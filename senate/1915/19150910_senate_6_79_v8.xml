                        <para>- As regards the earlier stages of this matter, the facts are' that this man first of all wrote to me alleging that he was being badly treated, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> at the Base Hospital had accused him of being a malingerer, and made other abusive statements to him. I immediately made inquiries in regard to the statements, and I found that the man claimed that he was paralyzed in both legs, and unable to walk or use his legs in any way. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> had been treating the man, and had come to the conclusion that he could use his legs, and expressed the opinion that he was malingering, so far as paralysis was concerned. He consulted another doctor whom he asked to inquire into the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Steel</inline> examined Perry, and expressed the opinion that he could use his legs. Subsequently the electric battery was applied to the man's legs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> claimed that the response to the battery indicated that the man was not paralyzed in the legs. It was then <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade</inline> told the man  that, in his opinion, he was malingering. </para>

In his letter to me the man expressed appreciation of the treatment he had received in the hospital. That statement is on record in the Department.  His  only complaint was as regards <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Meade,</inline> and the charges he made in respect to him are those which I have mentioned. Later, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> wrote to me and drew my attention to the fact that the man had escaped from the hospital. The man who was paralyzed in both legs, and unable to move them, had escaped from the hospital ! </para>

                        <para>- No motor car can get into the hospital without passing the guard, and without the authority of the doctor in charge, and nobody can go in or out of that gateway without the consent of the doctor in charge. Therefore, if anybody left without such consent, he could only leave over the fence, which is 7 feet high. In his letter to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> complained that the man had deserted from the hospital, and that the military authorities were about to arrest him. He represented to me in his letter, which is on record, that the man did not wish to remain in the hospital, and asked me to intervene and prevent his arrest. I, immediately, on the receipt of that letter, after going into the case again, gave instructions that the man was not to be arrested. Coming to the later stages of the case, I propose to take the statements, as epitomized in the press, made at a meeting in the Trades Hall, and elsewhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney's</inline> statement, summarized, contains the following charges: - </para>

In regard to the charge that I had promised <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> that Perry would not be arrested after desertion, and that an attempt has been made since then to arrest him, I wish to say that, on the 14th June, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Malonev</inline> wrote to me asking that " no arrest be made of this poor, injured man for leaving; the hospital without leave." On that representation, and after looking over the file, I gave instructions that Perry was not to be arrested; but as Perry had deserted, and was not arrested, he, therefore, by his own action, became automatically discharged. </para>

On that day, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> wrote to me pointing out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Perry</inline> " is getting desperate, with her injured husband and no allowance whatever," and " that it would be a charity if something definite is decided, for if this poor fellow is to get nothing I must start a public subscription." I may add that his letter concludes with this paragraph, "With all greetings <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> yourplucky act, and good luck." I returned to Melbourne on Saturday afternoon, and immediately after going into the Barracks on the Monday and getting that letter, I gave instructions that a Medical Board was to at once assemble to investigate the case - that is the condition of the man - with the view to help the poor man, and to report as soon as possible what further action should be taken. That was on Monday, the 6th September, as the records will show. On the 7th, the Board assembled, and consisted of - </para>

It will be understood that this was not a matter for the central office, but a matter of district administration. By his own action in deserting, and his non-arrest at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney,</inline> Perry ceased to have any claim on the Department, as obviously the Department cannot be responsible for a man who has passed beyond its control by his own act. It will therefore be seen that on the three charges made the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> have not been sustained. Amongst the statements which have been made is one to the effect that an ambulance was sent to arrest Perry, and was accompanied by an armed guard. We frequently hear statements to the effect that military officers are always careful to cover up their tracks, and, in order that that statement might not be made in connexion with this matter, I sent for the man who drove the ambulance. I had him in my office this morning, and took down a statement from him, to which he attached his signature. I propose to read that statement - </para>

                        <para>- That statement came under my notice for the first time to-day, and I at once called for a report upon it. The statements appearing on the file, and showing that there was an application of the electric battery to Perry, make no reference to its having been applied to his tongue. I am having that statement inquired into. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask whether it is known to the Leader of the Senate, or to you, sir, that a number of wounded soldiers arrived in Melbourne from the front this morning, that a procession of them has passed through the streets, and that, to mark its sense of the importance of the occasion, the Melbourne community has been flying bunting from private buildings, business establishments, and Government offices, both State and Federal? If that, is known, will honorable senators be informed why, on this occasion, this building has been singled out as an exception ? When I arrived here, the flagpoles of Parliament House, which are frequently seen adorned with flags, were quite bare. </para>

If that course has not been followed this morning, it is an oversight, due possibly to the fact that the Senate sat so late, and the officers could not attend to the matter. I shall see that the oversight is remedied. </para>

                            <para>- I have repeatedly ruled that honorable senators, in framing questions, must not read long paragraphs from the newspapers. Our Standing Orders lay it down that a question must contain no statement of fact, no argument, and no comments, but must be asked solely for the purpose of eliciting information. It is obvious that if honorable senators are permitted to read paragraphs from newspapers, we shall be conceding to the newspapers a right to make statements, to offer comments, and to adduce arguments in this House which honorable senators themselves do not possess. I must, therefore, ask the honorable senator to confine himself to the asking of his question. </para>

                            <para>- The survey in question is being carried out because there is a small survey party on the spot. As the line will have to be surveyed sooner or later, the Government are of opinion that it will be cheaper to have the survey undertaken now than it will be to bring the party back and to have it carried out later on. The extension of the north-south line; however, will most certainly not be undertaken without the authority of Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">It is well known to honorable senators that specific charges have recently been made in a statutory declaration against certain officers engaged on the transcontinental line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. The merits or demerits of those charges I do not intend to discuss, because I consider that they are <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> inasmuch as an inquiry into them is now pending. But I wish to draw attention to the treatment that has been meted out to the author of those charges - Sergeant Gilchrist - who is now a soldier in training in one of the Melbourne Military Camps, but who was some time ago a clerk in the Construction Branch of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, a position which he had held from the inception of that undertaking. He had previously been employed in the Victorian Railway Service, but had been requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> the then EngineeriuChief of the Commonwealth Railways, to relinquish his position in order that he might join the Commonwealth service. Sergeant Gilchrist has made a statutory declaration, which was, in due course, placed before the Minister of Home Affairs, who referred it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> for report. At the time it was put before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> Gilchrist was in camp. Notwithstanding this, he was ordered by </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sims,</inline>
                    the Chief  Clerk  of the Department, to attend at the Central Railway Office, Melbourne. The letter ordering him to do this was written on the 2nd September, and he was commanded to attend at the office on the following morning at 10 o'clock. As he was in camp, and the letter was addressed to his home in Glenf errie, he did not receive it until the afternoon of that day, when it was taken out to him by a relative. He could not, therefore, obey the instruction contained in that missive, in addition to which, as he is a military officer, he would require to obtain permission to leave the camp. Accordingly, he wrote explaining the cause of his absence. A little later, he received a peremptory letter calling upon him to at once report himself at the office of the Engineer-in-Chief . That was rather a strange procedure, seeing that the man is a soldier, and could be charged with desertion if he left the camp without permission. However, upon subsequently receiving a telegram from  Colonel Hawker  he reported himself at the Victoria Barracks, where he saw
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman,</inline>
                    late of the Department of Home Affairs.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman</inline>
                    ordered him to at once proceed to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell's</inline>
                    office, telling him that he would not stand any nonsense, and if he was not there in twenty minutes, "You may look out." Sergeant Gilchrist thereupon proceeded to the office, where he saw
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline>
                    When he entered,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline>
                    called in the Chief
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr. Sims,</inline>
                    and also
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline>
                    the head of the Traffic Branch of the transcontinental line. In the midst of these three officials, he was subjected to a severe cross-examination .

                        <para>- He was subjected to what is known as ' ' the third degree." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> stated that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> was in possession of his statutory declaration, he felt that he would be doing wrong if he said anything until the inquiry was held into the charges which he had formulated. He, therefore, refused to answer any questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> then threatened him. He said, " Gilchrist, I am <inline font-style="italic">going tofight</inline> this thing to the bitter end, and you will be severely punished." That, I think, was a very wrong thing for the Engineer-in-Chief to do to a man who, until recently, had occupied a subordinate position in the Department. He should have remembered that this man had rights as well as himself, and that he had no title to threaten him. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> was obliged to furnish a report to the Minister, he had the statutory declaration of Gilchrist upon which to base his report. I have seen that declaration, and I say that every charge in it is so definite that it cannot be misunderstood. Why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> should require further information before he was in a position to make his report I cannot understand. He was surrounded by his officers, who had all the means of securing the necessary data, and I fail to see any necessity for sending for Sergeant Gilchrist at all. The Minister for Home Affairs has also acted in this matter in a manner scarcely becoming his position. In the </para>

                        <para>- Then I will say that a statement was made in another place to the effect that Sergeant Gilchrist should have been dismissed the service Ions ago. It is rather strange that it was only after this officer had made a statutory declaration, in which he had formulated certain charges, that it was suddenly discovered that his service had been unsatisfactory. It is very significant that he came to Melbourne on leave, and that when his leave had expired he was asked to return to Kalgoorlie and resume his official duties. Instead, however, he elected to join our Expeditionary Forces. I mention these facts to show that an undignified and unfair attempt has been made to discredit this man. If Sergeant Gilchrist had not taken the straightforward course of putting his charges in black and white, I could understand further information being sought in respect of them. But every one of those charges has been made in such plain language that it cannot be misunderstood. It is scarcely fair of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> to subject this officer to such treatment. It seems to me that his action was in the nature of intimidation, with a view to securing a backdown, or the withdrawal of the charges which he had made. It was most unfair to treat a man as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> was treated in this case. </para>

It. is high time that a protest was made against this sort of thing. If the charges are untrue, the Department should disprove them. If Gilchrist has done wrong it will then be time enough, when he is proved to be in the wrong, to consider what should be done with him. No officer has any right to summon a man in the King's uniform into his office as Sergeant Gilchrist was summoned, especially as the charges are to be submitted to an independent inquiry. I have always considered <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman</inline> to be a courteous official, and cannot understand why he should have peremptorily ordered Sergeant Gilchrist to attend at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell's</inline> office, and have threatened him that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> would stand no nonsense, unless he were there in thirty minutes. </para>

                    <para>At 4.15 p.m. on 6th September, 1015, Adjutant Anderson, of B Company, 1st Battalion, Military Camp, Royal Park, showed me an urgent telegram, instructing me to report to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman,</inline> Victoria Barracks, that afternoon. I immediately came into town and rang up  Colonel Hawker,  who signed the wire. I was informed that  Colonel Hawker  had gone to Queenscliff, and I was referred to Lieutenant Hutchins, who told me to report at Victoria Barracks to-day at 2.45 p.m. I did so, and was referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman.</inline> He rang up <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> in my presence, and said he would send me to him at once. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman</inline> then said to mc that he would stand no beating about the bush, and I had to go straight away and report to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> He added, "It is now 3.10, and I will ring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boll</inline> up at 3.30 p.m., to inquire if you have arrived. If not, look out." In compliance with instructions, I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> at 3.30 p.m., and he called in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> also his Chief <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr. Sims,</inline> to take down shorthand notes of the interview, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> repeatedly asked me several questions concerning my sworn declaration, and I replied by saying that I absolutely refused to discuss one word of it until the inquiry took place. He explained that he had been requested by the Minister to make a full report on the matter, and could not do so unless I supplied him with certain particulars. I again emphasized the fact that I declined to say " Yes " or " No " to any question put to me. He then told me that I was very foolish, as lie intended to fight the matter to the bitter end. He at this stage threatened that it would not pass without my being severely punished. I simply retorted that time would tell. When bc could see that I was determined not to divulge anything, ho turned to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> and said, " Well, this is just what I expected." He then said to me, "That will do, Gilchrist": and I left the room. I might add that ho tried hard indeed to impress upon mc that I was still a Commonwealth railway officer, and therefore under his jurisdiction, and by not complying with his instructions, by refusing to answer questions he asked me, I was committing insubordination. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the position as it presented itself to me. Honorable senators will notice that for very obvious reasons I have refrained from discussing the charges contained in the statutory declaration. These charges, I suppose, will in due time be inquired into, and it will then be time enough to make any comment upon them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and so did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald.</inline> As far as Gilchrist is concerned, he has been candid and open in everything he has done in connexion with this matter. When he wrote to me first I told him that they were serious charges, and that I would require something more than a mere letter. He therefore volunteered, on his own account, to detail the charges and put them in. the form of a statutory declaration, which he did. I received the declaration, which I placed in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald</inline> read it through. .Since then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald</inline> has received a copy of the declaration, and, I understand, has given it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> There was no necessity whatever for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> to send for Gilchrist, because he had the whole of the facts of the case before him, and he need not have subjected Gilchrist to any cross-examination, because, as I have already said, the charges are clear and definite, and they could have been contradicted, if the facts were not as stated, without <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist's</inline> attendance at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell's</inline> office. This kind of treatment requires a protest from the Senate, because if subordinate officers are to be treated in this manner when they take any action to remedy what they believe to be a wrong, it will be very hard indeed for daylight to get into some departmental transactions. We ought to commend an officer who has the courage and the pluck to come forward and expose what he thinks is mismanagement in connexion with a public Department. But if we allow any coercion or intimidation to take place, we shall commit a very grave mistake indeed. We, on this side, know what it is to be victims in connexion with trade unionism. We know how many trade unionists have suffered for exposing things, or taking independent action. Therefore, it would ill become a Government which is called a Labour Government, and a Senate which is dominated by Labour members, to permit this state of affairs to pass without entering a protest. I take this opportunity to bring the matter before the Senate, and to let the public know the true position, for it is only by a public exposure of such things that we can hope to prevent them from occurring in the future. If we burke them, or allow them to pass without a protest, we encourage this kind of victimization. It is our duty in public affairs to have the most candid and open investigation, and to prevent anything savouring of persecution in the Public Service. If we neglect that duty we shall permit the heads of Departments to do whatever they like with those who are under them, a thing which we, as trade unionists and labour men, have protested against, and fought against, too. Consequently it would be wrong on our part to allow an occurrence of this kind to go without the protest I am making here this morning. </para>

                        <para>- There is another way to prove whether the statements are true or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> is still in this country - he is at one of the military camps - and if the Engineer-in-Chief or the Minister of Home Affairs desired to test the accuracy or otherwise of his original statements, the method of procedure was not to take him into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell's</inline> office as he says he was taken. The public want to know, and we here want to know, whether or not the statements <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> made are true. I am not saying they are true, but I submit that when a public officer feels that it is a duty incumbent upon him to make certain statements, the proper way to carry the thing to its logical end is to hold an inquiry publicly, and not privately. </para>

He is entitled to a free, open, and public inquiry, such as he has asked for, and his request should be granted.  His  superior officers ought not to have taken him into a private room, and there, as it were, applied to him the third degree. I hope that while there is a Labour Government in power, if the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> is true, such a thing will not occur again. </para>

                        <para>- I have no information on that point. When the letter came back stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> could not attend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bingie</inline> to see if he could make arrangements with the Defence Department for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> That had been done in other cases.  Colonel Hawker  was communicated with, and evidently sent the usual cold-blooded business wire, and no more, asking that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> should see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> I am given to understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> then called on Captain Newman ; and it is said that Captain Newman told him that he had better go at once to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> or there would be trouble. If Captain Newman adopted that tone, it is remarkable, because we all know him to be one of the most polite and gentlemanly officers of the Department. He says he did not discuss the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> nor was he present when Gilchrist was interrogated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> In the circumstances, there was no great harm in asking permission of the Military Department for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> to be sent along, nob by way of tyranny, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> might obtain information about matters of importance to the Railway Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell, Mr. Poynton,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sims</inline> met him in the office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sims</inline> asked no questions, being simply called in to take a shorthand note of any interview that took place ; but from the start <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> took up the attitude that he was not prepared to discuss the question at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> then left the room. The whole affair did not take longer than ten minutes; and, whatever may have been at the back of the officers' minds, there was nothing approaching the rack or the third degree, nor could such a thing very well take place in ten minutes in a Commonwealth office in town. I have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> direct about that matter, because if anything of the sort took place, I should be no party to it; but they tell me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> simply asked the ordinary questions that he would have asked of any other employee. Charges had been made, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> that he was determined to get right to the bottom of the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister wants information in order to decide whether to recommend the Government that an inquiry shall b© held. All I am doing is to put the case of the officers. - who cannot speak here for themselves - as clearly and concisely as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> say they asked the ordinary business questions strictly relating to the charges levelled against the Department, and used no threats; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> declined to say anything. Subsequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> said, "I am determined to get to the bottom of this case," and left the room. The Minister of Some Affairs knew nothing of this. All he did was to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> to report on the charges. He was not consulted in regard to the interview. Personally, I have always found the officers of the. Department trustworthy, reliable, and polite, and it will come as a surprise to me to learn that any of them have been guilty of such conduct as is alleged in this case. If we obtain clear proof that the third degree was applied, the Government will not tolerate it for a moment; but there is not sufficient proof before us now that any of the officers in the Railway Department have been guilty of applying it. We ask for further proof, and if that is forthcoming, we shall leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of the case. In the meantime, I ask honorable senators to keep an open mind in regard to any officer against whom charges in connexion with this matter have been made. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that he is going away, but the honorable senator will see that he is under military control at the present time. In my view, the authorities of the Department of Home Affairs acted injudiciously, and without tact when they tried to exercise supervision over a man who was under the control of the Department of Defence. By leave of  Lt. -Colonel Hawker,  Gilchrist obeyed the call of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> and went to the office of the Home Affairs Department, as an employee of that Department, to listen to what was to be said to him. I think that Messrs. Bell, Poynton, and Sims acted injudiciously in asking their accuser to come before them and give them information in connexion with the statements he had made. They knew of his sworn declaration, and that should have been enough. I have seen the declaration, which covers nearly eight pages of typewritten foolscap, and I have read it. </para>

                        <para>- Whether the charges made are right or wrong is not for me to say. I have, so far, only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist's</inline> statement in support of them. The statements have been published in the press, and have been read by the Minister of Home Affairs and by the Engineer-in-Chief. If they can be proved to be true, the effect will be to seriously discredit the day-labour system, which it is alleged has added largely to the cost of the railway, and they will probably involve the dismissal of many men connected with this great project of railway construction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> coming from Kalgoorlie on leave to Melbourne, called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> as a matter of courtesy. If that be so, one would think that, in the interests of the Department and of the railway, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> would have been only too pleased to listen to any man coming from a distant part of the Commonwealth who was prepared to give the benefit of his experience, and say what he had seen, unless it was known that the man was a bore, an ignoramus, or was actuated by malice against the Home Affairs Department. I have it from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> himself that, when he came over, he had a long interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> He said that, after telling him all these things, and mentioning the grave charges to which he has sworn - and in connexion with which he could be prosecuted for perjury if it could be shown that he has sworn falsely - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> said to him, " Young man, you have been too observant while vou have been there." I do not. know whether that statement is correct or not, but I give it to the Senate as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> told it to me. I hope that the Government will see that an inquiry is made into these charges by some impartial person. I have in mind a man possessing first class engineering knowledge and a judicial mind, who would be well fitted to conduct such an inquiry. He should be given the power to call in engineering experts to discuss concave and convex rails and other technical matters. I hope that the Government will see that no one is permitted to intimidate a junior official who apparently, without any axe to grind, has spoken of what he believes to be wrong. I hope also that the inquiries may be the means of remedying any mistakes that have been made, and of putting a stop to extravagant expenditure if there has been such expenditure. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not much to say on this motion, except that we have, so far, heard only one side of the case, which does not present the chief officers of the Home Affairs Department in a very favorable light. I am not prepared without inquiry to regard them in an unfavorable light, and I trust that honorable senators generally will suspend their judgment until the last word in connexion with this matter has been said. The reason I say this is that I have in mind the case of a man who occupied a leading position in the engineering world, and who was hounded to death as the result of false and fabricated charges which were made against him. In consequence of those charges the man to whom I refer ultimately committed suicide. So long as I am a member of this Parliament I shall never accept as true charges of this kind made against any man until all the matters in dispute have been thoroughly threshed out. I know, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie also knows, that the man to whom I have referred was one of the best and most capable officers in the service of the Western State, and that he was not given a fair deal. </para>

                        <para>- In the case to which I referred a man was hounded to his death by the action of spies. I saw politicians in Western Australia rise in their places in the State Parliament and utter fabricated charges against this man whose boots they were not fit to clean. That kind of thing shall not be done in this Parliament with my consent. I, therefore, exhort honorable senators, who should, perhaps, be engaged in other work, to suspend their judgment in this matter until the' last moment, and to remember that the worth of these documents cannot be tested until the other side has been put. I am not going into the charges which have been made at all, but I say that an impartial observer, listening in the gallery of this chamber to what has been said this morning, would be led to the conclusion that able officers of the Department of Home Affairs are open to the charges which have been made in a sworn declaration. I am not prepared to subscribe to any such view upon an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement, and I shall never do so. I have said that I have had a little experience in matters of the kind, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has had a similar experience, and I have learned how necessary it is to suspend one's judgment until the last word on such matters has been said. I am not prepared to destroy the reputation of any man at one stroke.. I say that, in the interests of the Senate and in the interests of the party to which I belong, we need to be very careful about what we do in this matter. Men at the head of affairs have not reached their positions without any record, but because of services they have rendered, and I do not propose upon any <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement to write such men down as incapables </para>

                    <para>. - The speeches which have been made this morning prove the necessity for an inquiry into the way in which matters connected with the construction of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway have been conducted. I agree with many of the remarks which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> It is an undoubted fact that the higher the position a man holds, the greater his responsibilities, and very often the better he conducts his business, the greater the number of his critics. We should, therefore, be very careful about giving credence to criticisms of such men. I went very carefully through the sworn declaration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> and I think that the Government have done wisely in agreeing to have an inquiry into the charges which have been made. That is all that we want. We want to have the matter sifted to the bottom.' The officers at the head of the Home Affairs Department should have nothing to fear from the closest inquiry into their administration. I think that, in the circumstances, they made a mistake in calling upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> for a further statement when they had his sworn declaration. I have been pleased to find that Ministers have no sympathy with their action in calling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> before them. They do not indorse that action, and will not permit anything of the kind to occur in future with their knowledge. That is very satisfactory to me. I have no intention of condemning the officers of the Home Affairs Department. No doubt they have made some mistakes. The officer who superintends a large undertaking like the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway will naturally make some mistakes. But I do not think for a moment that it was the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> - knowing as I do his record in Queensland - to force Gilchrist to supply information which would tell against him personally. </para>

But let me put a suppositious case which I conceive to be a somewhat analogous one. Let us assume that John Smith, an employee in the Postal Department, lays a series of charges before the Postmaster-General against certain officers who are engaged on a particular work which is being carried out by the Department. Is it conceivable that the Postmaster-General, no matter how grave those charges might be, would at once advise the Cabinet to grant an inquiry into them ? </para>

                        <para>- Evidently ' the honorable senator misunderstood my question. In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell's</inline> record in Queensland, I cannot imagine that he would be guilty of anything in the nature of browbeating. As a member of the Parliament of that State, I had some years .of association with him. and I can honestly say that to the humblest man engaged upon construction work he was always approachable. I can scarcely conceive of anything going on in connexion with the construction of the transcontinental line, which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey,</inline> is calculated to damn the day labour system in Australia, seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> himself is the father of that system, and the gentleman who was responsible for its adoption in Queensland. He it was who initiated the system there, and who carried it out under Administrations which were not always wholeheartedly in sympathy with it. Despite these adverse conditions, it cannot be denied that he made a huge success of it, and that he is entitled to be recognised as the pioneer of the system in the Commonwealth. </para>

If John Smith, an employee of the Postal Department, made certain charges, would not the Postmaster-General be afforded an opportunity of gauging the work of that employee, and of ascertaining whether there was any substance in his accusations ? The first thing he would naturally do would be to inquire, " What sort of a man is John Smith?" </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened attentively to this debate, and the only point which puzzles me is why Sergeant Gilchrist should have been sent for by the Engineer-in-Chief. Here was a public officer who had made a series of sworn charges, which had been handed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who in turn had forwarded them to the Minister, who in due course had transmitted them to the Engineer-in-Chief with a request for a report upon them. That is the position as I understand it. Then the officers of the Department apparently sent for the author of these charges. Why? The charges had been definitely formulated, and for the life of me I cannot understand why the Engineer-in-Chief should require to interview the man who had made them. </para>

Now, an investigation was promised. The Minister controlling the Home Affairs Department, who is responsible for the construction of the trans- Australian railway, communicated with the Engineer-in-Chief , <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> and asked for a report in respect of the charges. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> - evidently ignorant that any promise has been made, because the Minister would not tell him that an independent inquiry had been promised - as departmental head - did what the Minister requested him to do. </para>

I have no feeling in this matter at all, but I am saying this in reply to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who took up the cudgels on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> and the Department, and contended that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> could simply have told them that he would not go. I was under the impression, until a few minutes ago, that that was the position, because I interjected, during the course of an honorable senator's speech, "Why did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> go?" understanding at that time that, as he had enlisted and had been granted leave of absence, he had left the Home Affairs Department to all intents and purposes, and could have turned round and said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> " You have my evidence in the sworn declaration; I am no longer in your employ." Now I am informed, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> might have thought that he was, to some extent, still under the control or authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman.</inline></para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that, after Gilchrist had made a sworn declaration, a very great mistake was made if any person who could have been assumed by Gilchrist to have military authority or control should have said to him in effect, " Look here, you must go before this Department, and mind, we'll have no funny business about it." If that statement was made by any one in the King's uniform - and it is said that it was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman,</inline> for whom I have the very highest regard - a very great mistake was made, because it might have intimidated Gilchrist, who, perhaps, would say to himself, "I am under military authority;  Colonel Hawker  has, to a certain extent, ordered me to appear, and now this other military officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman,</inline> has also told me that I must go." Probably in such circumstances Gilchrist thought it incumbent on him to go, and that he would have been punished if he had not obeyed. In my opinion, that is the position of the case. I think it is possible that rather greater importance than is necessary has been attached by some honorable members to the circumstances. If, however, an injustice has been done to any one, it may be that the time of the Senate has not been wasted discussing this motion. </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to me that substantial reasons for the motion for adjournment have been adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie with reference to this matter, which alleges maladministration in connexion with the transcontinental railway. The officers responsible for that undertaking asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> to go before them. I do not know that very great harm was done to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> by that request, because possibly the officers mentioned might have had very little knowledge of the niceties to be observed in connexion with a judicial inquiry. It is not given to all men to be lawyers. </para>

                        <para>- At the suspension of the sitting, I think I was stating that too much importance ought not to be attached to the action of the officers in having <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> before them, because men, otherwise very intelligent and experienced, sometimes do not know much of the niceties of judicial procedure and the proprieties which should be observed. Seeing that they knew that charges had been levelled against them, it would have been better, perhaps, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> and his subordinates to address themselves to the securing of evidence in rebuttal of the charges, rather than to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> to present himself before them. But I do not attribute any importance to the matter, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> evidently stood on his rights and refused to say anything. I hope that the charges made will be properly investigated by a competent official or tribunal. I was going to ask the Assistant Minister if it was the present intention of the Government to institute an inquiry before a proper tribunal ; but now a question of that sort addressed to the honorable gentleman would be meaningless, because, lo and behold ! there has come along a sacrilegious Pompey in the shape of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. He has lifted the veil which obscures the holy of holies of the Caucus, and told us that Ministers have to hold an inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to the charges themselves, I know that javelins of this sort are always being hurled at officials in high positions; and unless the charges are substantiated - substantiated to a very considerable extent - before a competent tribunal, I attach no great importance to them. But as the Administration has been so circumstantially assailed, as I understand it has been in the declaration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> in regard to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has very properly said a summary appeared in a newspaper, and as the expenditure on the transcontinental railway and the methods of its construction are of paramount importance to the people of the Commonwealth, I hope that an inquiry will be held, not because of the inherent gravamen of the charges themselves, but because of the fact that it is necessary, in all probability, to clear high, and most likely very competent, officials of the charges contained in the sworn declaration. I hope that it will be a fair and open inquiry, and I would prefer it to be conducted by an official of the status at least of the gentleman who inquired into the statements regarding the Liverpool Camp, for a very large sum of public money, apart from the competency of the officials themselves, is involved in the construction of the railway. I have said, from time to time, that, in all probability, the work will cost a great deal more money than the Administration have stated to be necessary. Therefore, in all good faith, and without impugning the competency of the officials in any way, without prejudging the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> I hope that a satisfactory inquiry will be made into the whole matter, and conducted by a competent tribunal absolutely above reproach. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard to the great discovery which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> seems to think he has made, I can assure him that it is the usual mare's nest, and, consequently, of little importance. I shall be quite candid, and tell him the circumstances, so that his mind may be at ease, as it seems to be troubled to some extent. When I interjected that there was to be an inquiry, and that the Minister had agreed to an inquiry, I stated a fact. There was nothing very much in the announcement. It is not a question of appealing to the Minister to do something, when I tell the honorable senator that the Minister supported the idea of holding an inquiry- </para>

                        <para>- That ought to show that I have no enmity or ill-feeling towards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that I did not judge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> so far as these charges by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> are concerned. I have, expressed no opinion on the charges contained in the statutory declaration; but I think that when an independent inquiry had been arranged for, all movements in the matter should have been suspended until the inquiry was held. That, I think, would have been fair to the man who made the charges, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> who, I consider, placed himself in a false position by the action he took. I am not suggesting that he deliberately did this thing. Perhaps he blundered into doing what seems to me a foolish thing. In my opinion he did not improve his position. No matter what view <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> may take, and no matter how some honorable senators may regard the question from his stand-point, there are other persons to be considered. I hold that the interests of the humblest men working on this railway are equally at stake, and that they are just as much entitled to justice and consideration as is the Engineer-in-Chief himself. </para>

Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> nor the Minister had a right to stand up and make personal charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> as undoubtedly has been done. He has been referred to by the Minister of Home Affairs in another place, in his first presentment of this matter, in a way which was grossly unfair. Not a word' in the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald</inline> made in the first instance was true. He should have waited until he understood the case, if he did not understand it before he made the statement he did in the House of Representatives. Some honorable senators have tried to excuse the act of taking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> to the railway offices. But what would a Judge say, when a case came on, if the accuser had been forced to go to where the accused was, questioned, and subjected to pressure to make statements in regard to charges? Would not the Judge very properly say that the accused had interfered with the course of justice? I think so. It was, under the circumstances, grossly improper. </para>

It has to be remembered that, in the first instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> refused to go to the railway offices, as the letter read by the Minister to-day proves, and that he, in a sense, did go there afterwards under compulsion. He refused to go in the first instance, but when, as a member of the Military Forces, he was summoned to go to the Barracks by the wire from  Colonel Hawker,  and Captain Newman told him to report himself at the railway offices within half an hour, he was under military orders, and went practically under compulsion. He could not have refused to go without disobeying his superior officers. </para>

                        <para>- We have heard enough to prove that he did not want to go there. When he went there he objected to be cross-examined upon statements that he had put into writing, and in taking up that attitude he did the right thing. Whoever was responsible for compelling him to go to the railway offices after he had demurred to goIng there, did the wrong thing. I hope that we shall not again have to raise a protest of this kind in this Chamber, but so long as I am in the Senate I intend to defend any man who is put in the position in&gt; which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist</inline> finds himself. He has been vilified and misrepresented by references to himself and his charges in the press, and the attack has been followed up by an inquisitorial kind of inquiry, at which the official charged with mismanagement wanted to subject him to cross-examination. In doing so <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> placed himself in a very false position. I say this without any heat or enmity towards him. I have never met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> and it cannot reasonably be said that I have any animosity against him. I have been compelled to bring this matter up by the remarks that have appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> from the Minister of Home Affairs with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> and by the subsequent action of the Engineer-in-Chief. I have declined throughout this debate to discuss the charges made in the statutory declaration. If I did so I could put a very different complexion on the case I have presented to-day, but I have refrained for very obvious reasons from going into those charges in any way. All I have done has been to bring before the Senate what has happened since. It was most unreasonable to ask the accuser to submit himself to cross-examination at the hands of the man he had accused, especially in a room where he had no support and no witness on his side, as against three men, all more or less implicated in the charges he had made, who could give afterwards what version they chose, whilst he would have no witness to support his version. This was most unfair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilchrist,</inline> and I shall never be a party to covering up practices of that kind, whether they are indulged in under a Labour or a Capitalistic Government. In fact, I shall be all the more determined to put down that sort of thing if it is practised by a Government that professes to be against it, while, at the same time, indulging in it. I do not think the Ministry as a whole are responsible for what has happened in this case, for I believe that the responsibility rests on one individual only. By leave, I desire to withdraw the motion. </para>

                        <para>- The effect will be to omit clause 4 altogether. Honorable senators will remember that this was a Bill dealing mainly with conditions in the Public Service created by the war, but the Government took advantage of the opportunity to bring forward a proposal to give statutory effect , to certain allowances they have been paying in addition to the minimum wage provided for under the Public Service Act. Honorable senators took the view that clause 4 raised the question of the minimum wage of public servants, and that they were entitled to press for an increase. To give effect to their desire they carried an amendment to omit the words " One hundred and twenty-six pounds per annum," thus leaving a blank in the clause, the object being to have the minimum wage fixed, not at £126, as desired by the Government, but at £138. The House of Representatives has disagreed with the amendment of the Senate, and has proposed the omission of the whole clause. The minimum wage provided for under the Public Service Act is £110 per annum. The Government, by Executive act, have _ been giving effect to an increase in the minimum wage to £126 per annum by paying allowances, in addition to the statutory minimum wage. The omission of clause 4 of the Public Service Bill will not affect that, and therefore the existing position of the public servants will not be endangered. </para>

                        <para>- On this particular question the labours of both Houses will result in nothing, and the Bill will deal only with conditions of the Public Service affected by the war. Honorable senators know that for some time the necessity for amending the Public Service Act in many directions has been frequently discussed. The Government intend to take advantage of an early opportunity, as soon as they can get the time, to go into the question of the amendment of the Act generally. When that is proposed, the question of the minimum wage in the Public Service and other questions of equal importance to the Service may be reviewed by Parliament. </para>

I hope that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has promised, the Government will, as soon as they can get an opportunity, consider fully the necessity for amending the Public Service Act. I hope that, as a result of the consideration which has been given to this Bill, -the position of the public servants in the matter of pay will not be worse than it was before the measure was introduced, and that the omission of clause 4 will not prevent them receiving some allowance, in addition to the existing statutory minimum wage of £110 per year. I trust that, even in these times of financial stress, the Government will find it possible to do something to alleviate the condition of the poorer paid servants of the State. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bill was before the Senate a week or so ago the object which the Government had in view was to amend the Public Service Act, so that they might have statutory authority for the payment of a minimum wage of £126. In this Chamber an amendment was made with the object of increasing the minimum to £13S, in order that it might be in keeping with awards made as to wages for work done by public servants. I regret that, notwithstanding the overwhelming majority recorded in favour of that proposal in this Chamber, honorable members in another place have seen fit to disagree with us. We were told that as the amendment proposed here would create a blank in clause 4, there would be no further chance for revision, which, of course, was absurd, and that consequently the Government would be free to make the minimum wage what they liked, and so far from increasing it our amendment would decrease it. That statement was made by the representatives of the Government in this </para>

I should like to have some definite guarantee from the Minister now in charge of the Bill that, although it is now impossible for us to give effect to our desire to increase the minimum wage to £138, the Public Service at least will not suffer by the omission of clause 4. We should, I think, have some assurance that the minimum wage of £126, which the Government have provided for by Executive act, will not in any way be affected by the omission of the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I did think that the Government would have had sufficient common sense to drop a Bill of this description, which, owing to the amendments which have been made in it, has become a mere farce. Perhaps it is a farce with a sinister intention. We are now called upon to consider an amendment to a measure the operation of which is to be confined to the referenda, and which is allegedly designed to secure an increased vote on the part of those electors who have been in the habit of neglecting to record their votes - electors who live in the remote portions of the country. The amendment which is now before us seeks to exempt these persons from being obliged to exercise the franchise. In other words, the compulsory principle of the Bill will be operative only in all the large centres of population where votes are usually recorded to the extent of 90 or nearly 100 per cent., and where the Ministry hope to secure the major portion of their support to the referenda proposals. The largest percentage of the unrecorded votes at elections is unquestionably to be found in our country districts. If the principle of compulsion is to operate beneficially, obviously those are the very districts to which it should be applied. </para>

I say, without hesitation, that it is quite inconsistent with the whole scope of the Bill. In our large centres of population the electors always record their votes. Down almost every other street they can find a polling booth. If the principle of compulsion is intended to gather in a large crop of unrecorded votes, it is necessary to apply it to the country districts. </para>

                        <para>- But the principle of the Bill is not one of prohibition, but of compulsion. The design of the measure is to glean every possible vote in the large centres of population, where an overwhelming majority of the electors are favorable to the referenda proposals, and to let slide that large area in which reside the electors who are opposed to those proposals. That is the whole scope and purpose of the amendment. The idea of compulsion has been completely abandoned, and the principle is to be made applicable only to those centres of population where the Government hope to secure sufficient votes to enable them to carry the referenda proposals. The amendment will serve only to make more marked the line between urban and rural voters. The real question at issue is whether the urban electors shall have the right to fix the prices of commodities which are produced by rural electors. Consequently, this amendment is a most iniquitous one. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care for that. But can it be seriously contended that the Liberal party in another place have sufficient power to force anything on the Government? That party is in a minority of ten or eleven in the other branch of the Legislature, and has no power to alter a single syllable of any legislative proposals which may emanate from the Labour Caucus. I have no desire to retract one word of my utterances in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>. - I will not detain the Senate for more than a minute, but I want to say I understood that when we proposed to adjourn on a former occasion, it was, owing to the critical period through which we are passing, the intention to so frame the motion that the Senate would adjourn until a certain date, or an earlier date, if circumstances warranted that course. We do not know what might transpire between now and the 27th October. A grave national emergency might arise, necessitating the meeting of Parliament at an earlier date than that fixed in the motion. If this motion were carried, I understand it would really be necessary to prorogue Parliament formally before we could arrange for its opening at an earlier date. I really think, in view of the extraordinary circumstances and the critical times we are passing through, the Minister might well consider the advisability of not fixing a definite date, but of framing the motion in such a way as to allow Parliament to meet earlier if necessary. </para>

                <para class="block">I need only mention that the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the States, have made an arrangement under which they will be the principal charterers in connexion with the transport of wheat and other commodities from Australia. In order to carry the business to a successful conclusion, it is necessary for the Government to have in their control a certain sum of money. This measure gives authority to the Treasurer to run what is practically an overdraft at the Commonwealth Bank to the extent of £100,000. Briefly stated, it authorizes the Treasurer to borrow the money to arrange for the supply of freight for Australian produce. The ' money received by the Commonwealth is to be paid into the Commonwealth Bank to the credit of an account to be called " Commonwealth Treasurer Freight Arrangements Account." Interest  on  the amount has to be paid at the rate  of 5 per cent, daily on the amount which the account is in debit. The indebtedness of the Commonwealth as regards the account must not be more than £100,000 at any time. Provision is made for the closing of the account when the necessity for it no longer exists, and for the payment of the amount in credit or debit, as the case may be, to or from the Consolidated Revenue. In the other House an amendment was made which reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to me that the Treasurer is bound, under the terms of this clause, not to incur a liability of more than £100,000 to the Commonwealth Bank at any given time. A mistake may be made if the clause is adhered to in its entirety. The work in which the Ministers are engaged is one of no small magnitude. The export of wheat and flour from the country in 1911 - a record year - was 63,000,000 bushels; and accepting the present season as a most promising one-- in fact, there is every promise of an increase 'of about 25 per cent. - it means that, all going well, we shall have at least 80,000,000 bushels to export this year. That quantity, on an average of, say, 2,000 tons for each bottom, will mean the chartering of at least 1,100 ships. When the Government embark upon a huge undertaking of that character, they are running very close to the wind, I think, in binding themselves down to an overdraft of £100,000 at any time. It may happen that charters may be arranged on very convenient terms, although at present the rates are very high. The present rates, I understand, average about 60s. a ton; whereas the former rates were nothing compared with that amount. I remember well being told by a gentleman who had an interest in and was master of a wheat ship, that at a freight of 18s. per ton his company was enabled to pay a dividend of 10 per cent, on the investment. With an increase of 300 per cent, in the freight charges, it is of importance that the Commonwealth Government should be placed in a position to charter quite a large number of ships, and for that purpose they will need . a much wider margin than £100,000. In face of the magnitude of the undertaking, that sum leaves a margin of very slender proportions. Although I know that the Government have gone into this matter thoroughly, still I remind them that they have to face the responsibility of finding £6,000,000 to cover the charges for the transport of the wheat. Therefore, a proposal strictly limiting them to a margin of £100,000 at any time will not give them a perfectly free hand which will enable them to make the best bargain. It is possible that during the transport of the wheat freights may come tumbling down. The Dardanelles may be opened, and very many of the interned ships there may be released, and special circumstances may arise which would enable the Government to charter ships on much more advantageous terms than are obtainable at present. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly ; but if the Dardanelles are forced they will be a solid accession to our ocean-carrying power. In the circumstances, and in view of the magnitude of the undertaking, the Government are sailing perilously close to the wind in limiting themselves to an overdraft of £100,000. At the same time, they are undertaking a work which will be highly valued by our people, and that will mean to those engaged in the industry the saving of large  sums  of money. I am sure that we in this Parliament who are acquainted with the hardships of those engaged in the industry, duly and highly appreciate the action of the Government on their behalf. 1 only hope that they have ample ground for believing that the clause, in its present form, will enable them to meet future contingencies. Presumably, I think they should have a much more ample margin than £100,000. </para>

                    <para>. -From the time the first ships get away, they will begin to earn freight, and all receipts, when they come to hand, will be paid immediately into the Commonwealth Bank. The freights for the first cargoes will come in long before the last go away. This clause simply gives us a margin to work on in the form of an ordinary business overdraft, and we believe, in view of the careful calculations that have been made, that the amount asked for will be quite sufficient. We hope that our overdraft in the Commonwealth Bank in connexion with this transaction will never reach £100,000; but, as Parliament is to meet again in October, and probably early in the New Year, we shall have no hesitation, if any difficulty arises, in asking for further power. At present we feel confident that we shall not want £100,000. </para>

On the 18th August a circular was sent by the Prime Minister to all the State Premiers on this subject.

No replies have been received from the other State Governments, but reminders have been sent to them. </para>
                    <para>SenatorFERRICKS (Queensland) [4.58]. - A number of men in the training camp at Enoggera have come from country towns, and desire to communicate by telephone with friends or relations in those towns. This necessitates their going into Brisbane, and a number of them have asked me to request the Defence Department to instal a telephone trunk system at the camp. They have the ordinary telephonic communication there now, but cannot get connected with trunk lines without going into Brisbane. Their request could, I think, be granted at a very small cost, and that would obviate the necessity for them to go so often into the city. Although Brisbane is a very attractive place, many of the men are not keen on going there too often. I trust the Minister will inquire into and bring about the improvement I have suggested. I do not propose that a wholly separate telephone line should be constructed, but that necessary additions to existing facilities should be made to enable the men at the camp to connect up with any trunk system that they desire. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to refer to the recent appointment -of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon to the charge of the Base Hospital at St. Kilda, and to one other matter of importance. I do not wish it to be thought that, in criticising the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon, I do so in any spirit of vindictiveness. For the gentleman himself I have every regard. When submitting questions on the subject before, I stated that I was credibly informed that this man had not been engaged in general practice for the last twenty years. The Minister of Defence stated in reply to me that it was within the right of the Dis- "trict Commandant to appoint an officer to the position to which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon has been appointed. On the question of his practice of his profession the Minister has stated that the work which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon will have to perform at the Base Hospital will be purely administrative. If that be so, the wonder is that a doctor should have been appointed to the position at all. If the office is a purely administrative one, and it was not necessary to appoint a man having medical experience and knowledge, was it not possible for the Department to have secured the services of a man possessing higher qualifications as a business 'man and an organizer than those possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon ? I think that the appointment was made somewhat hastily, and, perhaps, it is not yet too late for the Minister of Defence to review it. In his reply, the honorable senator has almost questioned the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon has not been engaged in the actual practice of his profession for a very considerable time, and I have only again to say that I have been informed on good authority that he has not generally practised his profession for twenty years. It is known to honorable senators, and to the public at large, that lie has been more of a politician than a doctor, and his qualifications for an administrative position at the Base Hospital are somewhat doubtful. </para>

                            <para>- This may be &amp; kind of organization for which a politician would not be well fitted. I should like the Minister of Defence, in replying, to state the reasons why <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon was chosen to fill this position as against many other persons at least as well qualified to fill it. The other matter to which I wish to refer is the fact that medical men who are not members of the British Medical Association are not being appointed to positions in connexion with the Defence Department? In replying to the question on this subject which I put to him, the Minister made use of the words "reputable man." It is, of course, right that only reputable men should be appointed to these positions, but I should like to know who is to be the judge of reputable men in this connexion. I wish to know whether it is a fact that the making of these appointments of medical men to our Military Forces is delegated to the executive of the Australian branch of the British Medical Association ? </para>

                            <para>- I do not make the assertion, but repeat a statement which has been made to me, and into which I hope the Minister will make inquiries. I have here the card of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. S.</inline> Zichy-Woinarski, of Collins-street, who has given me permission to mention his name. He offered his services to the Defence Department in November, 1914. Since then he has made four other applications for a position, and during all that time has received only one acknowledgment of his offer, which, I think, was dated 31st August of this year. There may be others similarly placed in Australia. It is done, no doubt, without the knowledge and consent of the Minister of Defence, but the point I wish to make is that apparently an effort has been successfully made by the British Medical Association to keep within their own ranks appointments to any medical positions under the Defence Department, whether for services at the front or in the concentration camps of the Commonwealth. I am not making any charge against the Defence Department or the Minister of Defence when I say that I am credibly informed concerning the statements I have made. During the few weeks of well-earned holiday, which I hope the Minister of Defence will enjoy, I trust that he will find time to make inquiries into this matter, and will see that every medical man practising his profession in Australia will be given a fair deal when appointments under the Defence Department are being considered, whether he is a member of the Medical Association or is not. </para>

I am aware that the Department concerned is working at high pressure, and each' member of the community must take his share of the inconvenience that will be involved in the carrying out of the census, but I wish to impress upon the Leader of the Government in this Chamber that, even though the date for the return of the cards may have been extended from the 15th to the 30th of the month, it may be necessary to further extend the time if those who are called upon to send in cards in the country districts are not better served than are the people of places like Sydney and Melbourne. Some allowance must be made to persons who honestly endeavour to supply the required information. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely giving the results of my own observation in Sydney and Melbourne during the past few days. To expect the return of these census cards within the prescribed period or even by the end of the current month, would, in the circumstances, be quite unreasonable. Many persons may already have made a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> attempt to secure cards with a view to supplying the required information. In doing so they may have subjected themselves to very considerable personal inconvenience. For example, they may reside some distance from a postal centre, and I am not sure that, in the event of their neglecting to supply the requisite information, they could not put up a very good defence if they were prosecuted. I hope that the Ministry will speed up the arrangements in such a way that when it is announced that cards are available, they will be obtainable in a sufficient quantity to meet all the demands likely to be made for them until the date finally fixed for their return. </para>

                        <para>. - I can indorse the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that persons who have applied for cards have been unable to obtain them. This may lead to serious complications. If a man who has vainly endeavoured to secure cards, fails to furnish returns, I think that he will be able to put up a very good defence if he is ever prosecuted for neglect. We must remember that many persons may have subjected themselves to great inconvenience in making their applications for cards. Are they to be called upon to submit to that inconvenience repeatedly? I venture to think that if a man has applied for cards, and has failed to obtain them, any Court would regard that circumstance as a mitigating one. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> are designed to secure a trunk line connexion between the .country districts adjoining Brisbane and the Enoggera Military Camp. Of course that is not a matter for the Defence Department, but I will undertake to bring the honorable senator's statements under the notice of the Postmaster-General, with a view to seeing whether effect cannot be given to his wish. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has asked why <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty.</inline> Salmon has been appointed to an administrative position at the Base Hospital, St. Kilda-road. My reply is that he has been appointed in the same way as many other citizens have been appointed, comprising blacksmiths, farmers, carpenters, &amp;c, who happen to have joined the military establishment, and to have obtained a certain military rank in time of peace. Now that we are short of officers, the services of these gentlemen are being availed of. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon is a militia officer on the Army Medical Staff, and as the arrangements in connexion with our hospitals are supervised by that staff, he has been called upon to assume administrative duties at the Base Hospital, St. Kilda-road. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has inquired as to what is his business capacity. I am informed that he is the managing director of a big tobacco factory in this city, which fact certainly goes to show that he must possess some business ability. The mere circumstance that that factory is one of the . few establishments which have managed to survive the competition of the Tobacco Combine is surely some evidence of business capacity. The conditions under which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon was appointed to his present position by the Commandant of Victoria are exactly similar to the conditions under which some hundreds of militia officers have been appointed to other positions. Regarding the British Medical Association, I wish to say that, in all military appointments, that association - as is the case with other unions - is not recognised. The executive of the British Medical Association has no voice in the selection of the medical officers who are called upon to fill military appointments. </para>

                            <para>- No; nor has any State Executive any voice in the selection of officers to fill military positions. What happens is that those who are members of the Army Medical Corps are on the military lists, and are called upon for duty  in the same way that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon has been called upon. In the case of our Expeditionary Forces, those who volunteer for service abroad are selected by the Director-General of Medical Service. Formerly they were chosen by Surgeon-General Williams, afterwards by Lieutenant-Colonel Fetherston, and latterly by  Colonel Shepherd,  of Adelaide. In each case the officer selected was the senior officer on the medical list. In the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Zichy-Woinarski,</inline> that gentleman applied, amongst hundreds of others, but was not selected. I do not know who informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that hundreds of men are being turned down. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to think that is not correct. There are only about 1,500 medical practitioners available in Australia, and the call upon them has been very heavy, so that it has been difficult to fill positions. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> however, that, as far as I am concerned, I will not countenance any interference by the British Medical Association, or allow any one to be turned down because he does not happen to be a member of that particular body. Concerning the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I am in a position to say that the date for the return of the wealth census has been extended to the 30th September, and as regards the personal cards the date is fixed at 15th September. The personal card is easy to fill in, but the wealth card takes some time. I am  also  informed that the cards were sent to the country districts in every State first, and that the complaint about the difficulty of obtaining cards comes from the metropolitan districts. I obtained cards four or five days ago, though I did not get them from the Department distributing them, and so I know they were available in Melbourne, although not perhaps at all post-offices. </para>
