                    <para>.- Honorable senators are aware that a call of the Senate was made for 3 o&#39;clock to-day, but under the Standing Orders, as appears from the notice-paper, it has to be called on as the first business. I propose to move that the call be postponed until a quarter to three o&#39;clock, as some honorable senators may wish to attend the ceremony in connexion with the interment of the body of the late Genera&#93; Bridges. The ceremony is to take place at a little after three o&#39;clock, and in order to give honorable senators an opportunity to attend, we shall need to have the call made for a quarter to the hour. </para>

Apparently the Standing Orders do not contemplate the possibility of a morning sitting being held on a day when a call has been fixed for an afternoon sitting. If, however, there is any very strong objection, I do not propose to press the point. I am only trying to meet the convenience of. honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>- Before putting the question I may point out that there is a conflict between the Standing Orders, owing to the fact that the Senate has met to-day at an unusual hour. Ordinarily it meets at 3 o&#39;clock, and a call was made for that hour to-day. The Standing Orders provide that a call having been made for a particular day, it must be the first business called on, and having been called on, I am of opinion that it is within the right of the Senate to fix any other time it pleases, because the Standing Orders provide that it may be postponed to a future time. Further, although they provide for a call, there is no constitutional obligation to make a call. </para>

It must be the first business called on on that day, and, having been called on, I claim that it is within the right of the Senate to do as it pleases. I rule, therefore, that the Minister is within his rights in moving* for an alteration of the call to another time. Any little difficulty which may arise with regard to any honorable senators not being here at a quarter to 3 o&#39;clock can easily be got over, because the practice is to make a call of the Senate over and over again. If any honorable senator cannot come to the first call, we can have a further call at a quarter past 3 o&#39;clock, at half-past 3 o&#39;clock, or two hours later. I think that no difficulty will arise, and that the Minister is in order in submitting this motion. </para>

                        <para>- They require this business to be called first to-day, but it has always been the practice for a call to be immediately followed by taking a vote. In this case, however, the purpose in sending out the notice was not to enable honorable senators to answer to their names when the Senate was called, but to cast their votes on the proposed amendment of the Constitution. We might as well dispense with the call if we are going to proceed with the business before the hour fixed for honorable senators to answer to it. I am not questioning your decision, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that we have power under the Standing Orders to put the hour forward, <inline font-style="italic">but</inline> I think the Standing Orders ought to be modified so that such a possibility cannot occur again. </para>

                    <para>. - It would be much better to stand by the time fixed for the call; otherwise we may land ourselves in difficulties and have the whole procedure questioned, because a call of the Senate is rather a serious procedure. Putting it forward hardly comes within the scope of the standing order which says that a call may be postponed. We should not run an unnecessary risk for the sake of fifteen minutes. </para>

                    <para>. - I see the danger of anticipating a matter of this sort, but your ruling, sir, is perfectly correct that if the Senate decides a week or two before that there shall be a call of the Senate on Thursday, under normal conditions 3 o&#39;clock will be the time at which the call will have to be made. Honorable members receive their notice-paper, and may or may not be here before 3 o&#39;clock: If not, they are not able to answer the call, but in the peculiar circumstances that have arisen, and in conformity with the Standing Orders, the  President  puts that business first on the paper, which is quite right. The Senate has the right to deal with its business in any way it thinks fit, and to review its own decisions if that is felt necessary ; but it would be unwise to do what is proposed in this instance, because on some future occasion, if the Senate is differently constituted as to parties, this precedent may put into the hands of certain people a power that might not be used to the best advantage of the Senate or the country. In the circumstances, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that we had better stick to the time for which the call was originally made. On previous occasions when a call has been made we have postponed the time for taking the vote, which was perfectly right, because honorable senators were all here, and decided the matter to suit their own convenience. To anticipate the time, however, is a very different matter, and may involve considerable danger. It might be proposed, on some future occasion, to put forward the call, not by a quarter of an hour, but by two or three hours. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister gave as reasons for introducing this class of taxation the war and the very large public expenditure, but it must be remembered that the Labour party in this Parliament has for a long time had an income tax as one of the planks of its platform. The opposition shown by medium of the public press to this measure has been based mainly, not on the fact that it imposes an income tax, but on the incidence of the tax. It is claimed that no person in the community should escape his share of this taxation, and that every man who earns an income should pay something towards the enormous expenditure caused by the war. I firmly believe that people with small incomes have in the past paid a very much greater share of taxation than they should have been called upon to pay, and the Government would, perhaps, have been wise to make the exemption higher, but general satisfaction will be felt in the community by reason of the fact that people who have escaped taxation previously are now being called upon to bear a fairer share of the burden. It was said by the Minister that people with small incomes, such as wage earners with families, contribute very much more largely to the revenue through the Customs than do people who are very much better off. There is no disputing that fact, for the great bulk of the population pay practically the whole of the &#163;14,000,000 derived from Customs and Excise duties. A man with a wife and family and a small income, buying large quantities of the necessaries of life, pays much more in proportion of that class of taxation than does the individual in better circumstances with a wife and family of the same size. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because that class of person is more numerous than the other class in the community, though hitherto the other class has been swaying the legislation of this country to a greater extent than the one first mentioned. It is very desirable that the people should realize what the other class has been doing, and that they themselves have been contributing more than their share towards the expenses of administration. The time has arrived - perhaps a little earlier owing to the disastrous war - when this kind of taxation has become possible, and I believe that it has come to stay, because, after the people have had an experience of this measure, they will undoubtedly desire to continue it. </para>

                            <para>- I think that I have already mentioned - apparently the honorable senator was not listening - that the people who have paid the taxation in the past are not the people who will be called upon to pay in the future, if I am. able to judge the feelings of the electors of Australia. I feel confident that more benefits will accrue to the country under this form of taxation, and that unless our war expenditure is very largely increased, the burden of debt will not be passed on to posterity because of the provision made to finance the war. I know that there are a good number of people - : some belong to the party of which I am a member - who think that other methods of taxation should have been employed by the Government than the one under review. My personal opinion is that the Government did the best possible thing, and adopted the most effective means of raising the necessary revenue for the war, and of financing the debts necessarily incurred in connexion with it. Some people consider that a wealth tax should have been imposed prior to the income tax, but I view it in this way: The party to which I belong, for a number of years, had an income tax on their platform, and I consider it is the duty of the Government to give legislative effect to the party&#39;s planks before they commence dealing with other  classes of taxation that are not on the platform. The Government, therefore, have been absolutely loyal .to their programme and to their party. I have no desire to take up the time of the Senate any longer by discussing the measure now before us. When we rose last night the Bill was not to hand, and since then most honorable senators, I have no doubt, have been endeavouring to get as much sleep as they could. Had it been possible to have the Bill before us for some longer time, in all probability we could have discussed it profitably in greater detail, and have reviewed it to some slight extent. </para>

                        <para>. -  There is no doubt that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> &#39;has said, the income tax is one of the planks of the Labour platform. But there are other planks, or at least there is one other, dealing with the raising of money which, in my opinion, would have been much more effective in getting the required cash at the present moment, and which&#39; would have had a much better economic effect on the business of this country. I think, therefore, that that is the source to which we should have applied for money upon the present occasion. Everybody knows that I refer to land value taxation, I do not propose at this stage to make any lengthy reference to it, but I merely wish to point out the essential difference between land value taxation and income taxation. Land value taxation will liberate the resources of the country, make them available to the people of the country, stimulate business, circulate money, and quicken the blood of the nation. That is (exactly what we want at the present moment. Now I desire to point out - it may seem heresy, seeing that income taxation is a plank of the Labour platform - that income taxation is essentially of the same character as Customs taxation. That may seem extraordinary to some honorable senators who have not given careful consideration to the subject. It is a fact, nevertheless, that income taxation can be passed on to the multitude; and it will be passed on, just as Customs taxation is. That is one grave objection to this form of taxation. The people ultimately will have to pay, because the various companies, which our legislators so fondly think they will &#34; rook &#34; of their ill-gotten gains, will speedily find ways and means of passing this taxation on to the great masses of the people. Another objection is that it will have a blighting effect on industry. Let us look at the position seriously. We are glorying over the fact that &#163;13,000,000 has been poured into the Treasury to carry on the war. Very good. We want money for war, but we want money for other purposes; we want it for the development of this country. Is the development of the country to stand still while we are at war ? We hear the cry of the unemployed even now, and yet this instrument which I hold in my hand is going to turn thousands of men out of employment owing to its heavy incidence upon those who are carrying on the various industries of this country. Of course, I have no intention of opposing the Bill because it is a party measure, but, while that is the case, I think that I am well within my right in pointing out the objections to it. A party like the Labour party ought to be above this kind of thing. We ought, as I nave pointed out time and again, to decide to get the money that belongs to the people, namely the community-created values. We have a right to it. Why do we not take those values? Why do we allow them to get into the pockets of private individuals? Why is the land-owner to be the one benefited man in this country? I might hold 1,000,000 acres of land, and, except for the land tax, which is a comparatively innocuous impost, I might not be called upon to contribute a single farthing to the revenue of the country, because, if I made no income out of the land there would be no income tax to pay. And that is what is happening in a great number of cases. Men who have acquired large areas are holding them for speculative purposes, and are making no money out of them. They are holding a huge State or Commonwealth asset idle. We hear a great deal about the meat famine and the price of food generally, and we are howling at the American Beef Trust; but in Australia there is a Land Trust, which is far worse than the Meat Trust. However, we have power to deal with the Land Trust, and we have an excellent opportunity here. Not only have we opportunity, but we have the excuse. If honorable senators felt that in ordinary times they could not screw themselves up to attack the land monopolists, surely at a time like this - when the nation is at war and money is urgently wanted, and when  an opportunity is given for the employment of large numbers of people, and When, also, there is a prospect that a still larger number will be out of employment in the future, owing to the incidence of this proposed tax - even a Government like the present Ministry might have taken their courage in both hands and gone to the right sources for their revenue. The system proposed is unscientific, because it places a tax on industry and enterprise, and must of necessity be an injury to the country. I do not intend to continue my remarks at any greater length. I must vote for the Bill, because it is a party measure. Perhaps the day will come when some party in power in Australia will discard all these old unscientific methods of. raising money and resort to the new and true methods of securing the community-created values of the country for the &#39;people of the country. </para>

The honorable senator should be aware that, during the last two years, probably no investor has been more unfortunate in connexion with his investments that has the land-owner. It is quite true that we have the land monopolist in this country, and he is one of our worst pests. &#39; He has been the means of driving settlement into localities where it would never have had to go but for him. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should recognise that, in the effort to eradicate that pest, he may inflict a serious injury upon citizens of another type - pioneers who are entitled to every consideration at our hands. </para>

I still say that we need* to be very careful that in striking at the land monopolist we shall not at the same time injure citizens who have been very hard hit as the result of unusual natural conditions which we have for so long been experiencing. The returns from the Federal land tax give the best indication of the difficulties which have beset this class of the community during the last few years. It has been shown that the alternative before the Commonwealth Government has been to extend clemency to them, or to take over their properties altogether. </para>

                    <para>In my opinion, there is no fairer source of revenue than an income tax, because it is imposed only upon those who are able to bear it. If a man has no income he pays no taxation. If he has a moderate income, he pays a moderate income tax, and if he is fortunate enough to have a large income, the tax he is called upon to bear is increased in proportion. An income tax is an equitable tax, because it is imposed in proportion to the taxpayer&#39;s ability to pay it. One thing connected with the imposition of this income tax has caused me some concern. During this trying time, we have heard a number of people boldly proclaiming their patriotism and their readiness to sacrifice themselves to the limit in order to see this war through. We have heard expressions of inflexible determination to put forth the last effort to successfully prosecute the war. Yet when an effort is made by the. Commonwealth Parliament to obtain the sinews of war by the most equitable means that could be suggested, we find that these people who have proclaimed their patriotism set themselves up in practical rebellion to the Government for having made this proposal. If we consider what has been don&#169; in other parts of the British Empire, we must come to the conclusion that the people of Australia are exceedingly fortunate -in being citizens of this Commonwealth, since they are called upon by this taxation to meet such a small proportion of the huge bill which must be incurred in carrying on the war. The professing patriots to whom I have referred, and their press organs, are not now squaring precept with example. Judging by the experience of the past, the rich nien of this country have not shown the same spirit of loyalty and patriotism as has been shown by some who have little or no wealth, and have been prepared to sacrifice their lives. I am not going to say that the people in the humbler walks of life are doing more than their proper share in the ranks in connexion with the present war. I believe that our Expeditionary Forces are made up of a fair proportion of all sections of the community. No special credit is, in my opinion, due to any particular section of the community in connexion with the unexampled effort which the people of this country are putting forward in the actual conduct of the war at the present time. But we are neither blind nor deaf, and we cannot fail to recognise that the press organs of the wealthier sections of the community have shown a disposition to defeat this proposal for raising revenue tor the conduct of the war, which is not in keeping with their professions at the time the war started. We are now engaged in finding ways and means to carry on the war. Without money it cannot be carried on. We have high authority for saying that money is the great weapon bv which success in the field may be secured. The Minister in charge of this Bill gave a number of illuminating examples to show that the tax in the United Kingdom on incomes derivable from personal exertion is, in many cases, four times as high as the tax here proposed. </para>

                            <para>- The fact remains that, in the case of moderate incomes, the tax in the Old Country is considerably higher than the tax here proposed upon similar incomes. We only reach the point at which the rate of taxation becomes about the same in the case of incomes of &#163;8,000 a year. When we come to consider the taxation on incomes derived from property, we find the taxation in the Old Country represents a burden seven times as great as that which will be imposed under this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. As the honorable senator has referred to the fact that British taxpayers have to bear the cost of previous wars, I may say that I have hero some figures of a startling character, which show that the people of the Old Country have in the past stood up manfully to the task of bearing the cost of war during its currency. A study of the matter makes it quite clear that those who will be called upon to pay income tax here will bear a much lighter measure of taxation than people enjoying similar incomes in the United Kingdom. We have read in the Melbourne press that the Government are proposing to raise too much money. It has been suggested that it is something in the nature of an outrage to propose to raise a revenue of &#163;4,000,000 under this Bill, and that that amount is far more than is required to pay the interest on the war bill. Including interest on loans to be raised, the war bill for this year will amount to no less than &#163;45,000,000. That is a huge indebtedness for a small community like ours to incur in one year. Of that amount the Government propose by this measure to  raise  about one-eleventh. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has happily reminded me of what the people of Great Britain have done in the past in the way of raising money to meet the indebtedness incurred to carry on wars during the currency of those wars. I have here some interesting figures, which throw light on the way in which our forefathers in the United Kingdomadjusted the burden of war between the generation engaged in it and generations following. Quoting from the Imperial <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 1900, I find that the Peninsular War - the greatest in which the Empire was ever engaged - cost &#163;1,013,000,000. Of that huge total the British taxpayers of the day carried the burden of no less than &#163;391,000,000. The loans borrowed in connexion with the war at the time amounted to &#163;622,000,000. So that of the total war bill for carrying on the greatest war in British history, the taxpayers of the day shouldered a burden of no less than &#163;1 in &#163;3. </para>

                            <para>- I am quoting from a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Michael</inline> Hicks-Beach, when Chancellor of the Exchequer. These figures are calculated to give a mild shock to persons who regard the tax to be imposed under this Bill as a severe one. I find that an income tax at the flat rate of 2s. in the &#163;1 was paid for a period of thirteen years by the people of the United Kingdom to finance a portion of the indebtedness incurred to carry on the Peninsular War. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware of what the exemption was in those days, but the exemption under the British Income Tax to-day is &#163;160, which is slightly higher than is proposed under this Bill. In this country, of infinitely greater resources and in which the people may secure a very much better reward for their efforts, it is proposed to impose a tax of only 7&#163;d. in the &#163;1 higher than the rate of tax imposed in Great Britain during the progress of the Peninsular War, and further, the British taxpayers agreed to defray the expenditure upon that war to the extent of &#163;1 in every &#163;3 which it cost, whereas the Commonwealth Government are being severely criticised because they propose that the taxpayers of this country shall contribute to the extent of about &#163;1 for every &#163;11 of the cost of our participation in the present European struggle. This circumstance proves conclusively that a hundred years ago the people of England were willing to manfully shoulder the burden imposed upon them by the Peninsular War, and had no desire to pass it on to posterity. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. They paid the proportion stated, and the balance they passed on to posterity. The Crimean War, we all know, was a very much smaller affair. Its total cost waB &#163;67,000,000. At the time of its out break <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and his acknowledged policy was that the nation should bear the cost of a war, because he regarded that as the most salutary check which could be imposed upon the inclination to make war. Out of that &#163;67,000,000 the people of Great Britain paid in taxation &#163;35,000,000, and passed on to succeeding generations only &#163;32,000,000. In other words, for every pound which was paid by them in that connexion, only 18s. was passed on to posterity. Half the cost of that war was borne by the British taxpayers during the currency of the struggle. Under this Bill, it is proposed that the people of Australia shall contribute only about one-tenth of the cost incurred by us in this great European war, and yet our opponents object to it on the ground that the taxation involved is excessive. The figures relating to the Boer War show that on that occasion, too, the people of the Old Country faced the financial position in, a very manly way. The cost of that war was &#163;230,000,000; the amount raised by taxation, &#163;75,000,000; the proportion borne by taxation being about one- third. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. According to the official records available, the Russo-Japanese War cost the Japanese nation &#163;198,000,000. Out of that sum there was raised, by transfer of surpluses, by the sale of articles, by land taxation, and by other special efforts on the part of the Japanese people, no less an amount than &#163;83,000,000, or 42 per cent. It will be seen, therefore, that the objection which is urged to this Bill on the ground that the taxation which it seeks to authorize, is excessive, has not a very solid foundation. </para>

                            <para>- I have been at some pains to get them. It is manifest, therefore, that in this Bill we are proceeding upon very moderate lines. I welcome the measure as one which affords us a very fair means of raising the necessary funds to enable us to carry on the war. I deplore the necessity for its introduction, but we have need to steel ourselves to the task which lies ahead of us, and to impose the utmost strain upon our finances in order that the struggle in Europe may be pushed to a successful conclusion. We all hope for the triumph of our arms, but, in my judgment, we are not doing as much as we might to insure that triumph. In this connexion I refer particularly to the methods that are being employed for recruiting our Expeditionary Forces. I believe that we need to do much more than we are doing if we wish to avoid the suspicion that we are shirking our obvious duty. The means proposed in this Bill for the raising of the necessary revenue, suit my purpose fairly well, although I hope that next year a more reliable method will be adopted to enable us to defray the cost of the war to a still greater extent. We are not doing sufficient by raising &#163;4,000,000 annually. If we wish to hold the balance evenly as between the present and future generations, we require to shoulder a greater share of the financial obligations that will be involved in the prosecution of the struggle to a victorious issue. </para>

                        <para>. - So far, the Labour party has never expressed an opinion in favour of the imposition of an income tax for Federal revenue purposes. But, despite that circumstance, the Government have submitted this Bill with a- view to the taxation of incomes. In doing so I believe that they have correctly gauged, not only the views of a majority of this Chamber, but also of a majority of the electors. Direct taxation for the purpose of defraying the naval and military expenditure of the Commonwealth, to which the Labour party is pledged, was undoubtedly intended to convey the idea of &#39;direct land-values taxation. The principle underlying the imposition of an income tax is a very old one, so old that it is almost impossible to ascertain when it was first adopted in Great Britain. But in that country we know it has been most tenaciously adhered to for the purpose of raising revenue, with a view to keeping the Treasury full, and thus avoiding the necessity for compelling the land-owners there to make an adequate contribution to the services of government. That, however, may not be the idea which underlies the introduction of this Bill, although I believe that there is a consensus of opinion amongst the people of Australia that the levying of an income tax affords one way in which we can compel wealthy men to contribute their fair share towards the national revenue. To my mind, the present occasion is an extraordinary one,, and we may yet have to resort to methods of taxation even much more unscientific than is the one which we are now adopting. We have been told that we ought to impose a tax upon tea. Only the other day we were informed that something like 40,000,000 lbs. of tea are annually imported into the Commonwealth. It is an easy calculation to ascertain how much a duty of 3d. or 6d. a pound on that quantity would produce. But, fortunately, public opinion outside Parliament, and I believe here, too, is, so far, directly opposed to the taxation of that commodity. Therefore, there is nob the slightest possibility of that form of taxation being imposed, at any rate for a considerable time. It will be satisfactory to a very large number of persons to realize that the Commonwealth is rapidly bringing its national taxation into line with that of Great Britain. This measure is a further step in that direction. The national receipts of Great Britain for the financial year ending 31st March, 1915, totalled &#163;198,323,445. That total included the following sources of taxation : -Customs, &#163;35,568,580; Excise, &#163;39,657,957; estate duty, &#163;27,165,123; stamps, &#163;9,983,363; land tax, &#163;690,007; house duty, &#163;1,994,401 ; property and income and super tax, &#163;47,240,771; and land value duty, &#163;734,893, making, under those headings, a total of &#163;163,035,095. The non-taxation revenue amounted to &#163;35,288,350, making a grand total, as I said before, of &#163;198,323,445. The revenue from Customs in the  Commonwealth  has been gradually advancing from the establishment of Federation. Sometimes the yield has receded slightly and sometimes it has advanced, but it has steadily advanced from &#163;S,811,174 in 1904 until it stood at &#163;15,110,635 in 1914, showing that, notwithstanding the alleged great difference of fiscal opinion in the two countries, Australia is rapidly assimilating her method of raising national revenue to that of Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- The returned value of land in the Commonwealth is &#163;196,000,000. We have been assured by some honorable senators that the landowners have been exceedingly hard hit, and that they will find it most difficult indeed to pay the small amount of land tax now imposed. So far we have no record of the land values of Great Britain, and, to my mind, we have no reliable record of the land values of the Commonwealth; but, no doubt, we shall get them in the near&#39; future when the plans now in progress are completed. But, &#39; while we do not know what the values of the lands in Great Britain are, we know how much the British Government derive from house duty, property, income and super tax, and land value taxation. I admit that those four headings are somewhat vague, but in a general way they will apply directly to land values or to incomes; mainly, in my opinion, to the latter. An income tax will not open up a single fresh avenue of employment. It is not intended to do that. It is intended to tax a man who is responsible for the production of an income. It is intended to tax a man in proportion to the value of the money which he employs in reproductive works. </para>

                            <para>- That will undoubtedly be the effect. The intention of the Bill, in my opinion, is to compel the people who are best able to bear taxation to do so. My trouble about the tax is that it will not have that effect. It has not had that effect in Great Britain. It it a matter of common knowledge that the wealthy people in that country did not offer any more opposition to the imposition of income taxation than they did to the imposition of Excise or Customs taxation. Where they have always shown the strongest possible opposition has been to a proposal to tax them in proportion to the land values which they monopolize. I think it is about time that a definite principle of taxation was adopted, and I venture to say that Henry George laid down that principle in a way which has not yet been successfully controverted. It is admitted by most persons that, so far as Canberra is concerned, the Commonwealth is doing quite the correct thing in appropriating for national purposes the entire rental value of the 1,000 square miles of land which it possesses there. And, in a similar way, it is admitted by the provisions of the Federal land tax that the Commonwealth has a right to appropriate some of that value for national purposes. In most of the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">States, taxation in that direction is also imposed. In Queensland and New South Wales, the taxation of land values for local purposes, with the exception of one or two cities - probably Sydney is the only exception in those two States: - is established by law, and is working very well. There can be no doubt that this form of taxation will have the effect of very considerably increasing the number of officials who will be required to collect the tax. It is not a particularly expensive tax to collect, but, still, it entails a good deal of expenditure. It is supposed by some honorable senators that this is a war tax, which will only remain in operation during the currency of the war. To my mind, it will remain on the statute-book for many a long year after the conclusion of the war, because, while it will not be imposed upon those who, in my opinion, are best able and ought to be called upon to pay taxation, it will be imposed upon those who employ labour, invest their own capital, and do their utmost to advance the best interests of this country. I recognise that there is no possible chance at the present time of securing an increase in the progressive land value tax - that is the direction in which taxation ought to go - and in view of the almost unanimous opinion of Parliament on this question, I do not wish to offer further objection to the measure. But I shall watch its operation with some degree of interest, feeling quite confident that it will not open up a single fresh avenue of employment, and that it will be passed on, to a very great extent, to those who are least able to bear the impost. </para>

                        <para>. - A good deal of objection has been taken to this measure on two or three grounds. One objection is that it entrenches very severely on the State preserve with regard to taxation. I do not know but that there is very serious ground for that objection. But, in excuse for that, we may put up this proposition, that, whatever honorable senators may feel with regard to the result of the Bill, the necessity of it has been brought about by the calamitous war in which we are engaged. Then an objection is taken with regard to its stringency. It is said that it is practically duplicating taxation, and that those who have to bear it will also have to pay State income tax. -But it is practically the only avenue which is open to us at the present time. Combating some of the arguments advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> I would point out that an increase in. the land tax could neither yield the amount required nor meet the purpose in view to-day. That drives us back to the proposition of finance. Our financial dealings seem to me to be on a very shifty, if not unsound, foundation. We ought to have been in a position, had we grasped the opportunity, to finance the war entirely through our banking institutions. I do not blame those who, having the opportunity, seized it in order to deal with the finances of the Commonwealth for private purposes. In the circumstances, they were justified in so doing. Finance is the foundation of all legislation and of all government. As the old saying has it, government is finance and finance is&#62; government. Even when we have achieved the purpose aimed at by this Bill, we shall not yet have reached the ultimate goal of our expenditure, and if we are to continue on the same lines there will be open to us only a duplication or triplication of the same means as we are adopting to-day. It is about time we faced the serious problems of nationhood and put affairs on &#38; firmer basis, so that we may really grasp the whole question and determine the exact lines on which we are to move forward. 1 take very little exception to the Bill as a tentative measure, but as a national proposition it stands condemned as being merely a duplication for Federal purposes of what the States have hitherto done for State purposes, and therefore a lessening of their power. This system will mean impoverishing the States to enrich the Commonwealth, and is hurrying us towards other calamities that we have not paused to consider. We are forcing Unification at a terrific rate. </para>

                            <para>- Unification in itself would not better it. It must be bettered altogether irrespective of whether we have a unified system or six sovereign States. If we are simply to go along the old lines, we shall not be approaching the question with a full conception of the possibilities of the Commonwealth or of the nation of which we form a part. We shall fail to realize the opportunity that lies to our hand of laying down stronger foundations for the whole of our Commonwealth concerns. We should consider seriously the tremendous significance of what Australia did yesterday. It showed us that its wealth could, if appealed to properly, very largely negotiate its own loan needs, so that we are propelled towards the conclusion that, in times of stress, there remain to us opportunities of dealing with the financial question on lines entirely different from those we are following today. Our Commonwealth Bank, for instance, has done good service, but it has done the service simply of a child, when it should have done the service of a man. The consolidation of the note issue is, after all, only the beginning of its possibilities, and that Bank should be to-day a bank of issue and deposit as well as simply a bank of currency or exchange. It would then have before it an even wider field of usefulness. </para>

New occasions should teach new duties. We ought to be able to grasp the wider, broader, deeper, and more eternal principles to-day instead of simply dealing with the ephemeral as we are doing. The objections taken to this measure in some quarters are scarcely justified. The patriotism that has been displayed has been eulogized, but&#34; that patriotism is costly, and the Bill partly represents the price we have to pay for it. If that spirit of waving the flag and crying &#34; Glory Hallelujah !&#34; to everything we do has anything more in it than hot air, I should expect such a proposal as this to prove that the words of the people who indulge in those practices are not merely idle. If we expect the man who has only his life to offer for his country - and that is the biggest sacrifice of all - to respond to our call to defend the nation&#39;s interests, those of us who cannot make the same offer can at least take up our share of the burden of taxation without any grumbling. If the Australian, when asked to enlist, had refused on the ground that the sacrifice was too great for him to make, we should have thought him lacking in that spirit of nationhood which, fortunately for this country, has been amply manifested in his exploits at Gallipoli; hut whilst we are glorying in his manifestation of that spirit, have not we, too, who remain at home, the duty to take up our own burden in the same cheerful spirit, and to do it just as manfully, thoroughly, and unstintingly as he has done? I therefore deprecate the utterances to bo read in many newspapers that claim to be leaders of public thought, but that seem to have entirely lost sight of the perspective of the question. They fail to see where they should stand, and the arguments they have advanced must do a great deal to discourage those who have so willingly gone forward to defend their country. The greatest objection I take to the Bill is that we have, unfortunately, no time to give it the very serious consideration that it merits. Whenever we approach a question of this kind, especially under existing conditions, we seem to do so under new difficulties. The measure demands from the Senate, not only its most serious and careful consideration, but a great deal more time than we have at our disposal. It comes to us in almost the closing moments of this portion of the session, and yet it is fraught with the utmost importance to the nation as a whole. The tax will bear heavily in its incidence on some, whilst others may be relieved to find they are being so lightly dealt with. Being here to do the business of the country  we  ought to consider this measure in that clear light which its importance demands. At the same time, I hope that its passage will not be retarded because of its dilatory entrance to this Chamber, and that we shall give it the fullest consideration possible, with such results as will make it effective in meeting in a great degree the exigencies for which it is put forward. If it does that, Australia will have cause to look back on this era with a feeling of pride that she rose to the occasion, and showed herself to be no unworthy daughter of the proud nation from which she sprang. We scarcely realize to its full depth the meaning of the call that has been made to us, if we grumble about the price we have to pay to retain the great heritage we have received from the Old Land. If we rise to that fine spirit of patriotism which should animate us in this period of crisis, we can accept this Bill, although it may, perhaps, impose a burden on some persons, very cheerfully remembering all that the Motherland has given to us in times past, and the rights and liberties that it has taken up arms to defend. </para>

                        <para>. - As my statement that I was willing at all times to do everything to assist the Government in the successful prosecution of the war was no mere lip service, I have no hesitation, in a general way, in supporting the measure. I do not concede that an income tax is an unscientific method of raising revenue. It is immeasurably superior to the oft-suggested wealth tax, which is always discredited because in its incidence it is most inequitable, wrongly derived, and constitutes a burden on the people which has to be removed at the earliest possible date. </para>

                            <para>- No. It was suggested in Tasmania, but, fortunately, the legislators of that State had too much sense to impose it. Some of them, however, had the moral courage to say that the necessities of a State required the imposition of an income tax which touched incomes as low as &#163;80 a year, thus bringing home to the people the serious position in which the State found itself during the early years of Federation. I regret that we are not able to give more time to the consideration of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose the general principles have not been altered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> produced some very useful figures for the purpose of making comparisons of the way in which the income tax is levied in the Old Country and the income tax as it is applied in Australia. I do not impugn the accuracy of his figures in the slightest degree, but I think I am correct in saying that income taxation in the Old Country found its genesis in the necessities of war. It has always been regarded there as a war tax, and very often the imposition of an extra penny or two was sufficient to meet the needs of the Empire in the prosecution of those small wars in which the Mother Country has been engaged during the course of her development. I would, however, remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the British Empire is in a somewhat different position from that of the Government of the Commonwealth. The British Empire, largely in consequence of the wars it has waged, has for a long time had practically a monopoly of the carrying trade of the world. The British Empire has also been the world&#39;s banker. It has had passed through its banking marts the whole of the world&#39;s financial operations. </para>

                            <para>- I am not arguing against the measure at all. I am only regretting that we have not had more time to consider it. We have had the Insurance Bill before us for a long time, and we have  remasticated  it and re-digested it, and some honorable senators who are specialists in insurance matters have contributed to our knowledge on that subject. But this measure, which is of supreme importance, reached us only in the early hours of this morning, and it was suggested that we should carry it through practically forthwith. In the interests of this Chamber and of the nation we ought to give as careful consideration to this proposal as we did to the Insurance Bill. I admit, of course, that income taxation is no new development in regard to finance. </para>

The contention that taxation of too heavy a nature would prevent the development of the nation&#39;s resources, and indirectly, if not at once, cripple the development of that financial strength which is essential to the prosecution of a long war, is genuine, honest, and legitimate criticism. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s criticism is not justified by the facts. It is legitimate to point out that the nation may be like a horse engaged in a race, and require a lie Lit weight for a long distance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> himself stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> regarded the imposition of heavy direct taxation as one of the factors that deterred nations from entering upon war. But we are in this war, and if the taxation we impose at the outset is too heavy, it may have that deterrent effect which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has mentioned, and may, perhaps, paralyze or somewhat dull the efforts of the people to prosecute this struggle inflexibly to a successful conclusion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has spoken of Japan. Undoubtedly, Japan did, to a very large extent, by direct taxation, finance her expenditure during the war with Russia. </para>

                            <para>- The Japanese people anticipated that they would be able to get an indemnity from Russia, and it was a well-known fact that when they went into conference at the instigation of President Roosevelt, at Portsmouth, the Japanese representatives stood out for the  payment  of an indemnity. But, unknown to the rest of the world. Japan&#39;s financial resources had been practically exhausted; and, therefore, although the Russian diplomats were not disposed to concede the demand, the Japanese delegates quite unexpectedly accepted the peace terms. They did so because Japan was financially exhausted. The inroads upon the capital of the nation had been too heavy, and to-day Japan is suffering from a lack of capital, for she drew too extensively, in the way of taxation on wealth, upon the nation&#39;s resources, which otherwise would have been devoted to the development of industrial enterprises. </para>

                            <para>-  Her  alternative was to raise loans, the payment of which would be distributed over a much longer period of time than would be possible by heavy and drastic direct taxation. That is the only argument that has been advanced against this measure. It is legitimate criticism, which has found favour amongst Ministerial supporters, who hold the view that the imposition of this heavy taxation will imperil the development of Australian resources, which it is essential should proceed contemporaneously with the prosecution of the war. </para>

                            <para>- This is the first time we have incurred any war expenditure, and it is admitted that the only comparison we can make with this income tax is the war taxation of the United Kingdom, imposed to defray, not only the cost of the present war, but to assist in meeting accumulated expenditure consequent upon a long series of historic wars. I do not intend to labour the question, for I am supporting the measure, and I tell the capitalists of Australia, witheut the slightest hesitation, that they have to assist us in the successful prosecution of this war. I know that many of those capitalists who may have contributed to the war loan will pay heavy income taxation in the various States, for I venture to say that the exemption under the provisions of the War Loan Act will not enable them to escape their obligations in respect of State income taxation. </para>

                            <para>- And it is higher than in Tasmania. Very few people who will have to pay under the Federal income tax will escape the State income tax. That is my point. In practically every case the person who will be called upon to pay this Federal income tax will have to pay State income tax as well. This is heavy taxation for a beginning. I recognise that had the Commonwealth loan been subscribed to the extent of &#163;20,000,000 it would only meet our war expenditure for twenty weeks. Fairly heavy taxation will be necessary to meet the interest bill on the loans which we must borrow for the prosecution of the war. Human nature is human nature, and, as I have said before, a politician needs to be somewhat of a philosopher. It is always wise to accustom people to new taxation in homoeopathic doses. Whilst I am willing to give a general support to this measure, and am prepared to assume to the fullest extent my responsibility as a member of the Senate, in assisting to place it upon the statute-book, I believe it would have been wise for a start if Ministers had been content to impose about 50 per cent, of the taxation it is designed to impose under the complete scheme of income tax which will be provided for by this machinery measure and the Income Tax Bill fixing the rates. There is a difference of opinion amongst people in this community as to whether, in connexion with our first war expenditure of any magnitude, it is wise to impose taxation up to the most drastic imposts of other countries, or whether we should&#34; impose, say, only 40 or 50 per cent, of the taxation imposed elsewhere, and so permit the liberated capital to be employed, as it undoubtedly would be, in the development of the resources of the Commonwealth. If the wealth of the Commonwealth is to be increased year by year, as no doubt the war will be waged year by year, it is absolutely essential that there shall be concurrently the greatest possible development of our resources in order that, as the national wealth is dissipated in the conduct of the war, there may be a continuous and increasing fund of new wealth built up to enable us to successfully prosecute the great conflict in which we are engaged. I shall give this measure support in a general way, and I hope the Senate will occupy a fair amount of time in the investigation of its details. There is no hesitation in the expression of my desire to assist the Ministry in the successful prosecution of the war, or in my assumption of full responsibility,  as a member of the Senate, for the placing  of this Bill upon the statute-book. </para>

                        <para>.- My remarks on this measure will be brief. I desire first of all to express my pleasure at the manly utterances of my Tasmanian colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> and my appreciation of the generous support which, as I expected, he is prepared to give to this Bill. In approaching the consideration of a measure of this kind we have first of all to remember that we must incur very serious liabilities in taking our part in the war. What they will ultimately amount to none of us can say. Up to the close of the last financial year our indebtedness on account of the war amounted to between &#163;10,000,000 and &#163;12,000,000. This year it is estimated that our war expenditure will closely approach &#163;50,000,000, and if it continues to increase at the same ratio we must expect that by next year it will have reached enormous proportions. Aa honest men we have to face the position. The money necessary to carry on the war must be found, and the only honest way in which to get it is to borrow it. There is another way, and that is confiscation, which I do not propose just now. </para>

To be honest, we must meet at least the interest charged on the money we shall be compelled to borrow, and I am glad that the Government propose to secure enough for that purpose, and a little over. There may be room for a difference of opinion as to the best means of securing the money we require. At a time like this one hesitates to say all that he thinks. It is clear that at such a time we should try to avoid the imposition of undue burdens on the people. It may be said that the man has not yet been born who can devise a tax that &#34;would be perfect in its incidence. </para>

                            <para>- We are not discussing land value taxation now, but the honorable senator will allow me to disagree with him. Income taxation is almost universal in the British  Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> referred to the income taxes in the different States, and particularly in Tasmania. The exemption in that State is as low as &#163;80. It is presumed that &#163;100 is exempt in the case of a single person, but if his income exceeds &#163;100 he has to pay the tax on all of his income over &#163;80. </para>

                            <para>- They did; and, according to population, better than did the people of any of the other States. The representatives of Tasmania are very proud to know that the people of their State have done their share in subscribing to the war loan. I have looked up statistics to discover the position in regard to the taxation of incomes in the different States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has said that practically no person who will be called upon to pay the Federal income tax will escape the State income taxation. That is hardly correct, because I find that in New South Wales the amount of income exempt from taxation is &#163;300. </para>

                            <para>- In Tasmania a deduction for children is allowed, but it is somewhat less than that provided for in this Bill. In Tasmania, however, a distinction is drawn between married and single persons, and, by the way, I may say that I regard it as a defect in this measure that it contains no similar provision. Subject to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> correction, I find, according to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> that in New South Wales the income tax is 6d. in the &#163;1 on incomes ranging from &#163;300 to &#163;500, and the scale goes up &#34;to 7d., 8d., 9d., 10d., lid., and ls. in the &#163;1 on different incomes. In Victoria the exemption is &#163;200, and the tax 3d. in the &#163;1 on incomes from &#163;200 to &#163;500, 4d. in the &#163;1 on incomes of from &#163;500 to &#163;1,000, and 5d. and 6d. on incomes above &#163;1,000. In Queensland the exemption is &#163;200, and on incomes from &#163;200 to &#163;500 the tex is 6d. in the &#163;1; &#163;500 to &#163;1,000, 6d.; and 7d. and 8d. in the &#163;1 on incomes over &#163;1,500. In South Australia the exemption is &#163;200. and on incomes up to &#163;800 the tax is  4 1/2d.,  and on incomes over that amount 7d. in the &#163;1. In Western Australia the exemption is &#163;200, and on incomes over that amount the tax is 4d. in the &#163;1. Tasmania has a more elaborate scale of taxation than has any of the other States. The exemption is presumed to be up to &#163;100 in the case of a single person, and &#163;125 in the case of a married person. Whilst this distinction is made, if a married man receives an income of more than &#163;125 he has to pay the tax on all over &#163;80, the same as the single man. The tax rises from 4d. in the &#163;1 by many gradations until it is ls. 4d. in the &#163;1 on incomes of over &#163;2,000. Briefly stated, the position is that New South Wales exacts in the form of income tax from 6d. to ls. in the &#163;1, Victoria from 3d. to 6d. in the &#163;1, Queensland from 6d. to 8d. in the &#163;1, South Australia from 4Jd. to 7d. in the &#163;1, Western Australia 4d. in the &#163;1, and Tasmania from 4d. to ls. 4d. in the &#163;1. I have here some figures showing how the income tax works out per head in the various States. From these I gather that in New South Wales it represents 14s. Id., in Victoria 7s. 4|d., in Queensland 14s. 3gd., in South Australia 10s. ll&#163;d., in Western Australia 10s. 10&#163;d., and in Tasmania 16s. l&#163;d. It will be seen, therefore, that Tasmania is paying nearly 5s. per head more than is any other State by way of income tax. </para>

                            <para>- The income tax is practically universal in its application. It is operative in every State of the Commonwealth. In theory the tax is considered to be perfect, but in practice, although it approaches more nearly to perfection than does any other form of taxation with which I am familiar, a great many anomalies of necessity arise. Indeed, in connexion with any tax that we may impose anomalies will exist. The income tax, I maintain, approximates more nearly to justice in its incidence than does any other tax. What we seek to attain is equality of sacrifice. Since I was a boy I have never forgotten the first canon of taxation laid down by Adam Smith, namely, that a person ought to be taxed in accordance with his ability to pay. But throughout the British Dominions no attempt has been made to attain that ideal. We have never sought equality of sacrifice. This is all the more peculiar in view of the circumstance that the masses of the people in Australia contribute very much more than their fair proportion to the revenue of the country through Customs taxation. It is an old rule that where a tax presses unjustly upon a section of the people we should endeavour to afford relief to that section, with a view to securing something like equality. Seeing that the people of Australia are annually paying &#163;3 ls. 6d. per head in taxation through the Customs, and that they thus contribute practically as much as do the wealthier classes, we ought, when we are imposing a tax on income, to endeavour to relieve those who have hitherto been overburdened. </para>

A comparison has been instituted in Tasmania between the position of a man in receipt of &#163;100 a year, and that of an individual whose income is &#163;1,000 a year. Roughly, the former pays in taxation from all sources nearly twice as much as does the latter. These figures have been confirmed by the Commonwealth Statistician. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. My contention is that if a man who receives only &#163;100 a year contributes ls. in taxation, he makes a bigger sacrifice than does the man who receives &#163;.1,000 a year, even though the latter pays &#163;100 by way of taxation. The man with &#163;1,000 a year will never be in want of a breakfast, but the former - if he has to maintain a wife and family- may be deprived of the necessaries of life. Some six or 3even years ago I took part in a meeting which was held at Cressy, Tasmania. I went there with the secretary of the Australian Workers Union. Before Ave entered the hall two men approached us and inquired whether we could do anything for them. Upon being asked the nature of their trouble, one of them said, &#34; I have to rise at 4 a.m. daily to go to my work, and I do not get home until 8 o&#39;clock in the evening. I have to rent a house in Cressy in order to provide shelter for my wife and  children  and I receive a wage of 12s. per week.&#34; As a matter of fact, an employer in that district had openly boasted that he had never paid more than 12s. per week. My answer to the man who complained to me was, &#34; God help you, but you will have to help yourself a little bit first.&#34; It is when instances of this kind are obtruded upon one&#39;s attention that one feels inclined to insist upon these unfortunate men being granted some measure of relief. </para>

                            <para>- At that time the native-born population of Tasmania were leaving it in such numbers that the departures exceeded the birth-rate. Fortunately, things have changed since then. The people of Tasmania have thrown over their old political leaders, and have put a new party into power. All the revenue that is required to meet the present needs of the Commonwealth can be raised without inflicting material harm upon anybody. As evidencing how the tax under this Bill will operate, I may mention that a mau with a taxable income of &#163;300 a year - and we must not forget that every man will be allowed to deduct whatever he pays in State land and income tax, in addition to his life insurance premiums and his contributions to friendly societies, from his taxable income, so that, roughly speaking, if he enjoys an income of &#163;500 a year his taxable income will be only about &#163;300 a year - will be required to pay &#163;5 3s. Id. He will thus have &#163;294 16s. lid. left. The individual with a taxable income of &#163;500 a year will be called upon to pay &#163;10 3s. Id., so that he will have &#163;489 16s. lid. left. The man with a taxable income of &#163;1,000 a year will pay &#163;28 2s. 6d., and will have left &#163;971 17s. 6d; whilst a person with a taxable income of &#163;2,000 a year will contribute &#163;87 10s., and will have &#163;1,912 10s. left. An individual with a taxable income of &#163;4,000 will pay &#163;300, and will have &#163;3,700 left. A man with a taxable income of &#163;6,000 a year will contribute &#163;637 10a., and will have left &#163;5,362 10s.; whereas a man with a taxable income of &#163;10,000 a year will pay &#163;1,609 7s. 6d., and will have left &#163;8,390 12s. 6d. These are the persons who are complaining of the incidence of the tax. It is amusing to read the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in this connexion. Its statements would make a Scotchman laugh, and it is said that Scotchmen are devoid of humour. But the driest Scotchman could not fail to laugh at the funny things which appear in that newspaper. </para>

                            <para>- At the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the feverish appeals made in the press to this Parliament to stay its hand in putting on this taxation, especially at the higher rates included in the schedule. I mentioned that I had seen in the press a number of letters and articles, nearly all in the same tone, pointing out that if this Parliament persisted in imposing such taxation, ,it would rob the country of its. wealth, prevent capital from being used in the employment of labour, and stop poor persons from raising mortgages. Indeed, it would appear from the general tenor of the letters and articles that &#34; blue ruin &#34; was going to overtake Australia if the measure were enacted. I have no fear of that result following upon the imposition of the tax. I have noticed, too, that a few of those who are politically opposed to an income tax have indorsed the measure. One of the surprises I had almost immediately the enactment of an income tax was spoken of w.as the receipt of a series of letters from a so-called Liberal candidate in Tasmania, the son of a respectable old man whom I admired, but who in politics was a Tory. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwin</inline> Best, who in a letter laid down a scheme of taxation to meet the present position without knowing what the main principles of this Bill would be - in fact, before it was circulated. He proposed to raise more revenue than is provided for by the Bill, to tax up to the rate of 5s. in the &#163;1, and to impose that, rate on a lower taxable amount than is laid down on the measure. It was a surprise to me to get a letter of that character from a man who professed to be a Liberal, who is the son of a Liberal, and who has opposed our party in Tasmania. He thought that this was a fair policy. I had another surprise. In the northern part of the State there is a journal which we always call a Tory newspaper. It is a common saying among the followers of the Labour party that if a supporter of that party was found to coincide with the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> it was time for him to go home and examine himself, for there must he something wrong with him. I notice that in a leading article last week it practically supports this measure. It finds one objection - and on that point I agree with the writer - and it is that a distinction has not been made between a married man and a single man. There we have another confirmation of the justice of this measure. These commendations are coming in from all quarters, not merely from our own people, but also from opponents. If anything, it will tend to lead us to think that the exemption might possibly have been made a little higher than is the case. I should have been content if we had allowed an exemption of &#163;156, but let that be for a single man only. It must be obvious to every honorable senator that if we adopt as a basis the first canon of taxation I referred to previously - that laid down by Adam Smith - we ought to levy the tax in proportion to the ability of a person to pay. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Surely my honorable friend does not want to make the sacrifice unequal because it is for a special purpose? It must be obvious to every honorable senator that if a married man is able to pay, and it is just to impose on him certain taxation, it is more reasonable that a single man should pay more taxation. According to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> our Customs taxation amounts to &#163;3 ls. 6d. per head of the population. A  single  man pays &#163;3 ls. 6d.. but as a married man has to pay double that sum, he pays considerably more through the Customs than does a single man. There is a justification, I think, for allowing a larger exemption to a married man than to a single man. In the past throughout the Empire it has been so usual to heap the burdens of taxation on the poor that it comes somewhat as a surprise to find anywhere a political party who are game to levy the tax on the principle of equality of sacrifice. And so it is that our opponents are fighting to the last ditch in the endeavour to prevent the enactment of that which is just and fair. I am prepared to admit, as I said before, that anomalies will be found. A tax has never been imposed yet which has not been found after a little experience to contain some anomalies. Therefore. I recognise that possibly we shall have to make amendments in this measure in the near future, but they will not affect its main principles. I believe that although this tax is being put on temporarily for war purposes, it has come to stay. In view of the obligations imposed on the National Parliament to construct railways and develop the country generally, as it is trying to do, there will need to be found additional sources of income. I forecast that this tax, perhaps not necessarily in its present form, has come to stay. I have not had time to read the Bill as it is now, but one of its principles is to tax companies. In the past the profits which have accrued to various companies, and which we can follow up if we like, have not been disclosed, and I fear have not been subjected to taxation as they ought to have been. This measure proposes to tax companies. In its original form I observed one little anomaly which, I am inclined to think, has been adjusted. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that an amendment has been made there. The Bill contains a provision for taxing the house a man may live in to the extent of 5 per cent, on its capital value when owned by the occupier. At first sight it seems somewhat unfair, but I am forced by my sense of fairness to say that, so far as I can see, it is just in the circumstances to tax a man at the rate of 5 per cent, on the capital value of the house he lives in ; otherwise a great disparity would be created. There is no doubt that the general mass of the community have to pay rent. If a man who happens to own his own dwelling is to escape taxation, as is the case in Tasmania now, and the man who is paying rent for his dwelling is not able to deduct that amount from his ordinary income, it will create a distinction which to me seems very unfair, and so I must support the proposal in the Bill as it is. I hope, however, that we shall not have any need to increase the tax. We do not know what the necessities of the future may be. I stated just before the suspension of the sitting that the war expenditure had  increased  enormously in one year, and if it goes on increasing in the same ratio for one year or more it is certain that we shall have to raise further income to meet the necessities of the position. I do not desire to take up further time now. I had intended to refer to some of the companies in Australia, the profits they had made, and how they had got out of paying their just share of taxation, but I will reserve those remarks for a future occasion. For the time being I indorse and support the Bill, and believe that it will go through. I think that it will have the approbation of the community from one end of Australia to the other. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to say a few words because I do not approve of this kind of taxation being imposed by the Federal Parliament. I look upon this proposal as an . encroachment on State rights to a very large extent. Generally speaking, I do not approve of that kind of legislation, but having regard to the position we are in to-day and the obligation to carry on the war in which we unfortunately are engaged, it is not to be taken as a precedent that I am not found opposing the measure. I realize that in the exigencies of the situation the Government have to look somewhere for additional revenue, and believing in the principle that a man who is best able to pay should be taxed, I think that the imposition of an income tax is the proper way of levying additional taxation, and imposed on a graduated scale, I have not the slightest objection to it in the circumstances. I wish to draw attention to paragraph * of clause 18, which allows a deduction of - five per centum of the total amount paid in the year in which the income is derived in respect of calls on the shares of a company. </para>

                        <para>. - All things considered, we are in a very favorable position financially to-day as compared with the other parties to this great war - a fact which proves beyond doubt that we are reaping the benefit of the common-sense methods of finance adopted some time ago by the Labour party, especially when we remember the enormous sums that have been fired away in death-dealing agencies. We are facing ari expenditure for the current year of something like &#163;50,000,000, whereas formerly we regarded a total expenditure of &#163;5,000,000 as enormous. At the same time, the United Kingdom is spending &#163;1,000,000,000 where formerly it was called upon to spend only &#163;50,000,000. These figures are a striking indication of the enormous sums that are being spent at the present time. Seeing that we have been able to meet this tremendous expenditure with very little apparent hardship, we can safely say that we stand in a very favorable position Up to the present we have spent very  little money other than that which has been paid into the public coffers by means of the Australian note issue, and, according to the Treasurer, the war so far has been practically financed from that source, although, of course, he was speaking in a round and general way. If we have done so well out of the Australian Notes Act, it is a striking evidence of the wisdom and foresight of the Labour party in passing it. We cannot, however, expect the note issue to be an endless source of revenue, and must look for other sources in the future. We have been practically informed by the financiers of the Old Country that we must depend on our own resources to raise further money for war purposes, and this will cast upon our collective efforts a greater strain than we have ever yet faced, because most of our great expenditures have hitherto been met out of money borrowed in London. We started the war with a loan, but we have been informed that we can expect no more from the London market. Instead of Great Britain being able to play the part that she did in the Napoleonic wars, when Pitt, the Prime Minister of the day, was able to finance her Allies to such an extent as to make victory over her great enemy certain, on this occasion, although she is undoubtedly helping some of her Allies with money, she cannot be expected to do it to the same extent as she did then. We in this country are, therefore, thrown on our own resources, and must be prepared to finance ourselves by our own efforts. This can be done only by borrowing from our own people or by means of taxation, and, therefore, we have had to take the action which this Bill indicates. I am pleased that the loan we have floated has resulted so satisfactorily, but it is not possible to expect the whole of our share of the war cost to be financed out of loan. This income tax has, therefore, to be imposed, and is necessary if this generation is to do its share towards shouldering the financial burden. It is an opportune tax, well suited to our present necessities, for an income tax, when framed on progressive lines, places the greater burden on those with the larger incomes, which is as it should be, seeing that those incomes are for the most part enjoyed by people who possess property, and, consequently have most to defend. All that we are doing is to ask them to pay a larger national insurance premium because of the larger amount of property which has to be protected for them. This is such a fair, reasonable; and logical tax that there should be very little objection to it. I ask leave to continue my remarks. </para>
