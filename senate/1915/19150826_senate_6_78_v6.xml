                    <quote>
                        <para>The Continental Tyre Company has not been singled out for special treatment. The same principles have been applied as in the case of all other companies on the enemy list. The circumstances of the company are somewhat different from those of other companies, and especially the nature of its wares; but it has been dealt with on exactly the same principles as are being applied, for instance, to Siemens Brothers and the Australian Metal Company, the scope of whose transactions are much larger. </para>
                        <para>This Government decided to declare as having enemy character a class of companies, owned or controlled by enemy subjects, with which trading had not previously been legally forbidden; and in initiating this policy it was necessary to avoid injustice and injury to our own people. The rules of international law relating to enemy property on land must be considered, and applied evenly all round; and the difficulties of applying a general rule in such a way as not to cause serious industrial and commercial disturbance to the community are very great. </para>
                        <para>With regard to Siemens Brothers, for instance, if all pending transactions were to be terminated without regard to circumstances some enterprises of great importance to the community, undertaken by Commonwealth, State, and municipal authorities, will be abruptly terminated. </para>
                        <para>The same principles apply to certain large contracts and indents with the Australian Metal Company. </para>
                        <para>When it is stated that the total value of the transactions referred to reaches some &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000, it will be readily understood that the whole matter requires very careful consideration. It is receiving careful consideration, and the public bodies concerned are being communicated with. </para>

                        <para>The enrolling offices are situated in suitable buildings at the western end of the barracks, and, until recently, the system adopted was for recruits to pass from this office to a large drill hall, deposit their clothing, less trousers, boots, hats, and coats, on tables and pegs provided for that purpose, under the supervision of the military police; thence for medical inspection and vaccination to rooms (14 feet distant), formerly occupied by the A.A.M.C.

                                is under the control of the military authorities only so far as his responsibility for the control and administration of Army Medical Affairs is concerned. Anything he may have to do with the Red Cross Society is no concern of the Defence Department. If the Red Cross Society ask any military officer ordered to return to Australia to remain that they may avail themselves of his services in Egypt, I do not see that I can offer any objection.

                            <para>- Will the Minister of Defence say when he anticipates receiving the findings in connexion with the inquiries made in Egypt by the British Army Council, on which, according to statements made here, the military authorities have recalled <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ramsay</inline> Smith and Matron Bell, and have called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Barrett</inline> to resign. I assume that when the findings are received they will be made available to honorable senators. </para>

This measure will include that provision. </para>

                            <para>- There will be some, of course; but none of an extraordinary character. Provision will probably be made in this Bill for some rifle ranges, drill halls, and post offices, for which no provision was made in the other measure to which I ha.ve already alluded. But there are really no new items of a  striking character.  The measure is really based upon the same average expenditure as was provided for in the Supply (Works and Buildings) Bill, which was passed by the Senate earlier during the current session. The question has been raised of the advisability of the Commonwealth continuing to spend on its public works at the same rate as it spent during the earlier part of this calendar year and the latter part of the financial year. In connexion with this matter, I would like to say that during the earlier part of this calendar year the  Commonwealth  was faced, in nearly all the States, with a very serious unemployed difficulty, arising largely out of the almost total failure of the harvest throughout Australia. Although we are now practically assured of a good harvest, still the country has not felt the benefit of that improvement, and will not until the harvest is being gathered, and consequently in many of the States there is still a considerable amount of unemployment. This condition of things will prevail until the harvest is absolutely assured, and, until the labour which would otherwise be upon our labour market is otherwise employed, we think we should not Blacken off in our public works policy. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to grant that, with the good harvest and a keen demand for labour, it would be wise on the part of the Government to slacken off in expenditure on public works, but I do not think the time has arrived yet. We are unable to say that the primary producers are able to absorb labour which would otherwise be employed, and my reply to criticisms of our public works policy is that, while we recognise that in a time of war &#34;we should economise wherever possible, it would be false economy to stop necessary public works - because many of these works are not in the nature of relief works - many of which will show a return for the money expended upon them. I say, therefore, that it would be false economy to stop those works until we have an assurance that the labour employed upon them could be otherwise employed. I also give the assurance that the Government, if the harvest turns out as we all hope it will, and if there are indications that the labour can be absorbed in other directions, do not intend to go full speed ahead with their public works policy, but will slow down in order to give an opportunity for labour which is now absorbed by public works to be diverted to other and probably more productive channels. Otherwise, there is nothing in the Bill that calls for a great deal of comment It is a Bill to carry on the normal public works and services of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>, - I do not know how honorable senators individually feel with regard to this Bill, but I want to say at once that to me it is utterly impossible, in view of the fact that it has only just been placed in my hands, to say whether or not there is anything in it that calls for criticism. It does suggest to me that the Senate, so far as the financial proposals of the Government are concerned, is steadily going from bad to worse. It is idle to attempt to disguise the fact that it is making a farce of the proceedings to assume that we, as a deliberative body, should be expected to discuss the merits or demerits of the Bill which has just been placed in our hands, with the intimation that the Government intend to carry it through to its final issue. I know that the protest I am now offering is echoed in the minds of many honorable senators who may not be disposed to give effect to their protest against an abuse which I feel certain they recognise is becoming more  intense as  time goes on. The Minister has given us the assurance that the measure has in it nothing that is abnormal. I do not wish to dispute the Minister&#39;s statement, but the question as to what is objectionable or otherwise largely depends upon one&#39;s point of view. Of course, there .may be nothing objectionable in the Bill from the Minister&#39;s standpoint, but, nevertheless, there may be something objectionable in it to those who are not able to see eye to eye with him. Personally, I have not had an opportunity of considering the Bill. I do not know whether other honorable senators are more favorably situated. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to take that course with regard to a financial proposal. I can only express the hope that if this abuse continues the Senate will insist upon a fair opportunity of dealing with all financial proposals. Otherwise this Chamber must be content to sink into the position of a body, constituted merely to register formal approval to all financial proposals that may be sent from the other branch of the Legislature. With regard to the financial position, I find this Bill deals with certain appropriations for works, and it is a relief to know that there will be an opportunity of reviewing the whole financial outlook when the  Supply  Bill reaches this chamber sometime within the next fortnight. I do want to stress the fact - and it is a fact, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> admitted it - that there is a call upon the Government, not merely to preach economy, but to practise it. I cannot al together agree with the Minister&#39;s deduction regarding the labour market today. It may be sound policy for the Government to refrain from doing anything that would disrupt the labour market, especially at a time like this, but the Minister seemed to supply the best of all arguments for a very close scrutiny of every proposed expenditure for public works. He said that at a time like the present, when, owing to the failure of the last harvest, there is a considerable amount of unemployment,&#39; the Government should not add to it by a sudden cessation of its public works policy, but later on, with an improvement of the harvest prospects, the Government would consider the expediency of slowing down its rate of expenditure. That is a general principle which I am prepared to indorse, but I would like to draw attention to the fact that not only is unemployment less obvious to-day, but the statisticians inform us that the percentage of unemployment is fess than it was a little while ago. It is very gratifying to know that this is so, and seeing that the unemployment difficulty has become less acute, it seems to me that the time we have been looking for has already arrived. Instead of waiting to see if the harvest will still further diminish, the fact that unemployment is now diminishing constitutes, on his own argument, a reason for a very close scrutiny of public expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- If we are going to view the action of the Government with regard to employment, I would like to emphasize this fact : that to-day we have something like 129,000 men on the payroll in connexion with the Military Forces, and that, in addition, there are many thousands more steadily employed in administering to the needs of that Army. The Government are employing to-day a much larger number than ever were employed before. Indeed, they are employing more men to-day than ever the State Governments have employed. That is a considerable set-off against the obligation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems to think rests on the Government to continue the public works policy. If we employ more men in one Department, there is less pressure on the Government to still employ the same number of men in other directions. We have had very frequently put forward the fear that there may be a shortage of labour at harvest time. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend says so, but other persons, who are in as good a position to speak as he is, have some doubts on that subject. Already it has been intimated that the State Governments are somewhat concerned, and are taking steps to organize labour with which to lift the harvest. There may not be any great number of unemployed in the country. It does seem to me that the time has arrived when the Government should seriously consider whether it would not be wiser to adopt a policy, not of sudden disruption of expenditure, but of gradually easing down; to proceed rather by an inclined plane than by a sudden drop over a precipice. Unless they do, if the war should continue much longer, as seems quite likely, we shall be faced with a crisis the like of which Australia has never seen. It would be a much sounder policy to proceed by a gradual diminution of unnecessary public expenditure rather than to wait till circumstances force us to bring it to a sudden conclusion. That is all I wish to say with regard to that matter. I admit at once that I am not able to point to any portion of the Bill wherein retrenchment might be effected, for the simple reason that I have had no opportunity to look into the items. That cannot be alleged against me as a fault. I am a victim of circumstances, in common with every other honorable senator. I had, however, hopes from the statement made by the Minister of Defence on Friday afternoon that something would be done in order to assure to the Senate a reasonable opportunity, not merely of voting on these Bills, but of considering them, and considering them in a thoroughly business-like manner. It cannot be pretended that, in bringing on this Bill at a few minutes before 4 o&#39;clock, and asking us to sit until it is passed, any honorable senator, other than a Minister, has an opportunity to consider the details. </para>

                    <para>There is great distress in this district in the amount of unemployment. I am continually having applications made from the unemployed, and am at my wits&#39; end to know what to do or where to recommend them to go. </para>
                    <para class="block">The letter refers to Beaconsfield, which was a very progressive mining town until the last year or so, but which is now closed down. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> forecast that a difficulty is likely to be experienced in getting sufficient labour for the harvest is correct or not, but I do know that the statement in this letter is correct - that there is great distress through the lack of employment in at least one industrial centre in Tasmania. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> dare say that the same remark applies to many centres in other States. I believe that unemployment is not so acute now as it was a few months ago ; at any rate, at should not be, owing to the fact that we have sent so many of our best industrials to the front, and that others are undergoing training in camp. From every -centre in Australia we can get irrefutable evidence that there is a good deal of unemployment. I am quite in accord with the Minister that it would be very foolish on the part of the Government to close down on any necessary public works simply because we are afraid of the financial outlook. I anticipate that the genius of our people for self-government will evolve a solution of the difficulties. These only exist to be overcome. Those in power must find a way out. In my opinion, it would be suicidal for the Government to begin a retrenchment or starvation policy, to cut down expenditure on any of the big necessary or important public works, simply because the way is not-so rosy as it was, and there may be a little- difficulty facing us in the future. In connexion with the unemployment in the Beaconsfield district in Tasmania, may I point out to the Minister that if he chooses to have investigations made by his experts, he may be able to do something which is absolutely necessary, and which would be to the interests of his Department, and incidentally give relief to the labour market, and that is to establish a munitions factory. Perhaps in Australia there is no other centre which could be more cheaply brought into use for the manufacture of munitions than could Beaconsfield, because an enormous quantity of splendid machinery is lying idle there. If the advice of their experts should cause the Government to consider favorably the establishment of a munitions factory in Tasmania as one of the necessary Defence works incidentally it would go a long way towards relieving the unemployment in the Beaconsfield district. It is, of course, a State question, but nevertheless the people then&#169; are Australians. Although it might be their first duty to look to the State Parliament for relief in distress still they are Federal as well as State electors. This matter has been brought under my notice, and I suggest to the Minister of Defence that if the Department are contemplating the erection of munition works in Tasmania, or the turning of any other machinery establishment to that purpose- </para>

                            <para>- I shall leave my remarks on that matter until we get into Committee. There is another question on which the Minister may be able to give some information in reply to this debate. I have heard that it is intended to spend about &#163;40,000 in the erection of a hospital for the Defence Department in the city of Melbourne or its suburbs, if that be so, it seems to me that there has been an evasion of the Public Works Committee Act, which lays it down that any proposals for expenditure upon public works, involving an expenditure of not less than &#163;20,000, must be remitted to the Public Works Committee for report. There is a proviso that in the case of works for Defence, the expenditure may be authorized by an Order in Council. I am not aware that an Order in Council has been issued authorizing this proposed expenditure. Perhaps the Minister oi Defence* will say whether it is proposed to . erect a hospital for the Defence Department in Melbourne at a cost of &#163;40,000, and whether the expenditure is embraced in the item appearing on page 3 of the Bill under the heading of Naval Defence, &#34;Various States- &#163;100,000,&#34; or under the heading, Military Defence, &#34; Various States and Federal Territory- &#163;200.000.&#34; </para>

                        <para>.- The amount to be spent on the proposed hospital is part of the war expenditure, which is not confined to Melbourne Similar expenditure is, and has been, taking place in every State of the Commonwealth, not only in the provision of hospitals, but in regard to a number of other works. I should say that from10 per cent, to 15 per cent, of the war expenditure is expenditure on works, such: as huts and other buildings. I do not. believe that Parliament ever intended: that the Government should hang up proposals of this kind until they have been referred to the Public Works Committee or any other Committee. If the Government did so they would probably meet with very severe censure. </para>

                            <para>- Not if there is one proposal involving an expenditure <inline font-style="italic">oS</inline> &#163;50,000. When we know that thousands of sick and wounded soldiers are coming back to Australia it is the duty of the Government to have hospitals ready for them. They cannot unload that responsibility upon any Committee, and I am sure that Parliament would not ask them to do so. This is work which has to be taken in hand at once. In order that honorable senators may know the urgency of the matter, I may inform them that we were first of all told that no wounded soldiers would leave Egypt for Australian until September, because of the hot season. That intimation, in our . opinion, gave us plenty of time to make necessary arrangements. A month after getting that information we received a cable informing us that the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra</inline> was leaving Egypt with a certain number of wounded&#34; soldiers. A week later we were informed? that the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> was leaving, and then that another and yet another ship were* leaving with sick and wounded soldiers, and without any withdrawal of the previous information that no wound? tP soldiers would leave the Base until September. This meant that in a very short space of time the Government were called upon to -provide accommodation fosr hundreds of wounded soldiers, whom they thought, acting on the information stro&#62;plied them, they would not be receiving&#39; until October. If we had gone through the procedure of the Public Works Committee Act in connexion with proposals for expenditure to provide hospital accommodation the returned wounded soldiers would have been stranded. What is the position to-day in Melbourne? Every public hospital is full. If,  in many cases, we had not rushed up the necessary buildings without waiting for the authority even of a vote of Parliament, the men would have to be put into tents. What would the public have said then ? Let me remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> that the Public Works Committee Act covers only the ordinary expenditure of the Commonwealth, it would include, for instance, expenditure upon ordinary buildings for defence purposes. &#34;Unless proposals for such expenditure were otherwise exempt where they  would involve over &#163;20,000, they would be referred to the Public Works Committee. This has already been done in the case, for instance, of the buildings at Westernport. It was never intended that war expenditure, and especially upon hospital accommodation, should be referred to the Committee. If that were done, the members of the Committee would have to visit the sites and take evidence, and it would lead to endless delay. Obviously it is the duty of the Government to make this provision as soon as they become aware that it is necessary. The provision that is being made in this case is of a temporary character. With respect to the particular hospital referred to, I may inform honorable senators that the land on which the expenditure is to take place is worth the money we are paying for it, and we have, in addition, a large building which will be immediately available for hospital purposes. It is necessary to spend more money for additional temporary buildings around the permanent building that is on the land at the present time. If, at the close of the war, the property is no longer required, we shall be able to sell it for probably more than we gave for it. The result will be that we shall have had the use of the property rent free. </para>

                            <para>- It is one of the best bargains we have been able to make. I quite understand that the honorable senator was only asking for information, and I am sure that when he knows the facts he will be the last to say that the proposal for this expenditure should be investigated by the Public Works Committee. In connexion with war expenditure, the Government must take the responsibility for their action. If they blunder they must take the blame, and if they succeed, though they will probably not get much credit, they will be entitled to credit. With regard to the other question of the supply of munitions, that is really a matter for the State Governments to deal with. We have referred to the Governments in each State, inviting their co-operation in the manufacture of munitions for use in the present war. The State Government of New South Wales are taking certain definite action. So are the Western Australian Government. If the Government of Tasmania care to take action, we are willing to accept from them an undertaking to supply a certain number of shells. If they have the machinery in Tasmania suitable for the purpose, I should say that, following the lead of the Governments of New South Wales and Western Au&#39;stralia, they would do well to utilize it. I can only say, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> criticism, that I do not think that we can say that the present position as regards employment is quite satisfactory. Certainly, the figures show that there is a decrease of unemployment, though we are not, I think, yet out of the wood. If Parliament votes this money, and the increase of employment continues, there is no reason why the whole of the money should be spent. If we find that the ratio of unemployment continues to decrease, some of the less urgent works may be stopped, and the money saved. If unemployment disappears, as we all hope it will, expenditure on the less urgent works can be postponed. Parliament, in the circumstances, will be wise in voting the money asked for, in case it is required. , </para>

The amount&#39;s under the heading, &#34; Defence, Naval,&#34; set out for the different States, come to &#163;19,600, whilst the general items for the &#34; various States &#34; is &#163;100,000. Under the heading, &#34; Defence, Military,&#34; the items particularized for the separate States come to &#163;39,300, whilst there is a vote of &#163;200,000 for &#34; various States and Federal Territory.&#34; I think that the Committee is entitled to some explanation of these votes, that they may know what they are being asked to approve. </para>

                        <para>. - I can only say, in answer to the honorable senator, that we do not set apart a certain sum for public works, to be cut up amongst the various States in proportion to population. The amount is determined by the requirements of the Commonwealth in respect of public works in the various States. If, for instance, we take the item of &#163;100,000 for expenditure in the various States for naval defence, the honorable senator will understand that that is expenditure which cannot be allocated to a particular State. It is for the benefit of the whole of the Commonwealth. In connexion with naval works, it is, for instance, necessary to provide dredgers. These may be needed at Westernport, Victoria, and later at Cockburn Sound, Western Australia. Their cost could not be allocated entirely to either State, but must be put down to all the States as a sort of moveable liability. </para>

                        <para>. - The specialized State items under the head of &#34; Naval &#34; amount to &#163;19,600, and the undefined items for all the States to &#163;100,000. If it is possible to give details of the smaller amount, it is surely possible to show what is included in the larger. So under &#34;Military,&#34; the amount specified as allocated to each State is &#163;39,000, whilst the unallocated total is &#163;200,000, again five times as much. If the Naval or Military Department intends to do such work as the Minister suggests, the Committee ought to be taken into their confidence. I do not object to the amounts themselves, but we ought to know what they are for. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause would impose on fire insurance companies a duty which it would be difficult to discharge in regard to insurances for short periods. In many instances, also, insurances are transferred  from one company to another, and it would be difficult for a company to give a return of such business that would faithfully represent its business for the year, and enable the Commissioner to rightly judge its solvency. A similar argument applies to insurances for short periods against accident. The clause requires to be almost entirely redrafted, and in the meantime could conveniently be postponed. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause stipulates that the Commissioner may publish any accounts, &#38;c. That officer, I assume, will exercise very close supervision over insurance companies, because he will be responsible for their safe working throughout Australia. The best method for protecting the public interests is that of giving publicity to the accounts of these various institutions. This clause  vests  the Commissioner with the necessary power to do that. Of course, there may be some accounts which it would be a distinct disadvantage to publish, and the publication of which, instead of protecting the public interests, might have the very opposite effect. The Commissioner, therefore, is to be vested with discretionary powers. </para>

                        <para>- This clause deals with the Commissioner, whereas the next clause deals with the rights of the shareholders of insurance companies. There is a distinct difference between what the Commissioner &#34; may &#34; do, and what insurance companies &#34; shall &#34; do. I cannot recall, at the moment, exactly what returns will be published under this provision, but it is quite certain that publicity  will  be given to the balance-sheets and other statements affecting the financial position of insurance companies. At the same time it is necessary to vest the Commissioner with discretionary powers. Then, I would point out that if all these accounts were published at the expense of the Government, the cost involved would be enormous. On the other hand, we have no desire to injure insurance companies by compelling them to publish accounts which would be useless alike to the shareholders and the public. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause defines the duties of the Commissioner in relation to insurance companies in much the same way as the duties of the Auditor-General are denned in relation to the public accounts. To my mind there should be an annual review by the Commissioner of the different insurance societies, according to the accounts that he may have investigated. He will be the guardian of the public interests in connexion with this particular class of business. He will be vested with extremely large powers, and he will be expected to exercise them in such a way as to safeguard the interests of those individuals who are concerned with the transactions of insurance companies. The clause leaves undetermined the frequency with which these returns shall be published. If it be necessary that the Auditor-General shall undertake an annual review of the public accounts it is equally necessary that the Commissioner shall undertake a periodical review of the business transacted by insurance companies. In the absence of some such review, we shall be endowing him with powers which will be of no public utility. To my mind there should be a publication of accounts at certain specified periods of which the public should be informed. </para>

We must always recollect that behind the exercise of such powers is the controlling influence of public opinion, which really imposes an effective check upon them. The clause is perfectly clear.

Moreover, there would be the check in the form of public opinion. Those who understand the working of the publicity machine know quite well that if any injustice is done in any part of a big public Department, such as the Postal Department, External Affairs, or Customs Department, there is always prompt application to have the injustice removed. The Commissioner, I am satisfied, would not attempt to do anything unjust to any particular company. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline>
                    After a fairly long experience of the six State Acts, we ought to be able to place in this Bill provisions specifically setting out what the Commissioner shall publish and what should be left to his choice. Surely we ought to be able to determine exactly what matters should be published in the interests of the general community. I submit there is a danger here of giving the Commissioner absolute power to publish or withhold, as he thinks fit, documents sent in by the various companies. Surely, in a matter such as this, it should not be left to the Legislature to call for returns in connexion with various matters relating to the control of insurance in Australia. There are certain matters which should be clearly defined, and in connexion with which it should be obligatory on the part of the Commissioner to publish. Additional information, if required, could be asked for in the House. We have heard several complaints of government by regulation, and to me this seems to be an extension of the principle. I would suggest that the Minister in charge should postpone the clause, and see if it could not be made more definite in the direction I have indicated.

While, under the clause as it stands, the Commissioner may publish certain information, he is directed to do it in a spasmodic and unmethodical manner. If there happened to be a feeling of insecurity in the public mind, the publication of information concerning a particular company might ruin its whole business; but if the Commissioner simply stated in his annual report that an investigation had taken place with regard to a certain office, and that certain remedies had been adopted, the public mind would be eased, and danger to the company averted. We should provide that the Commissioner, in publishing this information, would be  simply  doing his duty, and thus he would avoid public criticism. I hope the Minister will give a wider scope to the Commissioner in the interests of the general public. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Insurance business being probably the most profitable in Australia, we can rest assured that the directors will take every care that their balance-sheets are kept well before the public, so we need not go out of our way to legislate for publicity. After a company has made its printed return to the Commissioner, as provided under clause 41, we find that under clause 44 the Commissioner has power to query any statement in that return, and he may publish those questions. The position, I think, can quite safely be left in that official&#39;s hands. Their interests are safeguarded, but I do not think it is desirable to say definitely that the Commissioner shall publish such-and-such returns, because the returns and balance-sheets from insurance companies might become very voluminous. </para>

Suppose that we were to tighten up the clause to such an extent as to lay upon that officer the duty of publishing abstracts of any returns deposited with him. Surely my honorable friend can realize how wonderfully the returns from insurance companies might grow in volume if they saw the opportunity of getting information concerning themselves printed and distributed broadcast at the public expense. I am decidedly against any legislation to compel the Commissioner, or indeed the Government, to make use of the columns of the press for that purpose, because, although it -secures a certain amount of publicity, it imposes a great hardship in various directions. Indeed, the newspapers are so crowded with other matter of a similar kind that the desired publicity is not obtained. Clause 44 appears to me to be all right, but if any honorable senator thinks that it is not, I do not mind a postponement of it until we get another opportunity of dealing with it. </para>

                    <para>. - I again direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that, while this division of the Bill gives the Commissioner complete control over insurance offices, and enables him to do all the things which the Minister has indicated, the Bill contains no provision for a report, or even an abstract of returns, to be tendered to any other person. He will be a sort of little king in his Department, and his will will be absolute, for there is no provision for any one to control or check him, or to call in question any determination. I suggested to the Minister what I thought was a <inline font-style="italic">via media.</inline> I pointed out that if it were provided that at specified times the Commissioner should render an abstract of the returns he received, which would be available to Parliament and the public, there would be the same sort of supervision over him as. exists over the Auditor-General. I know from experience how valuable is the report of the Auditor-General when we are engaged in discussing the Estimates. This Bill provides for the appointment of an officer who will be practically the Auditor-General for the Insurance Department. It is proposed to allow him. to accumulate information regarding the operations of insurance companies. He may publish a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of the information, or he may not, but it is not provided for in this measure that it shall be his duty to furnish an abstract for the information of Parliament. Apparently, we are to take no cognisance of the business which is to come under his supervision. I submit that some provision of that kind should be made. It seems to me that the Bill only empowers the Commissioner to select the information which he wishes to be published. It does not indicate in a general way the sort of information which he shall publish or embody in his report. I urge the Minister to provide in this or a subsequent clause that there shall be a review of the insurance business by the. Commissioner annually, or, if he thinks that that would be too often, once in three years. Surely we have a right to know from time to time what he has done in his office. I challenge the Minister to point out how, under the Bill as it stands, it will be possible for any honorable senator to ascertain what the Commissioner has done, except by going to the trouble of perusing the accounts in his office. If publicity is what the Minister wishes to secure, an abstract of the results of the Commissioner&#39;s supervision ought to be published periodically. </para>

It will remove one objection to this clause, for it provides that we shall get at least an annual report on similar lines to the annual report from the Land Tax Commissioner or the Public Service Commissioner, narrating the work of the Department and giving details of the business he controls. But even with that objection removed, I think the Minister would be well advised to postpone the consideration of the clause in order that he may be able to lay down specifically the classes of subjects on which the Commissioner shall report annually, and so save honorable senators the trouble of asking at odd times for the production of various returns. In my opinion, his duties in that regard ought to be clearly defined in a specific claus*. </para>

To my mind, clause 44 is alf right as it is. I do not see any occasion to alter its wording, because if the desire is to give more publicity to the returns furnished, it may be done by way of a new clause, or an addition to an existing clause. I, perhaps, ought to take the blame for the intermittent manner in which this measure has been deal&#163; with, but that has been due to the state of public business. I am still of opinion that there is no occasion to alter the provision that the Commissioner may publish abstract statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> has pointed out that extraordinary powers are being given to that officer, but I venture to point out that if he has to control such a huge concern as the insurance companies in Australia, he ought to be endowed with extensive powers. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the Commissioner will be a public officer, and that the Government will be responsible for his administration of the Department, is an ample guarantee that he may safely be entrusted with extraordinary powers. It must be borne in mind, too, that the people will always have a voice in indicating how the Department shall be. managed. It may appear to some persons to be a very roundabout way, but to my mind it is a direct and clear method for controlling a public officer in the exercise of statutory powers. I am not alarmed at the fact that large powers are being conferred on the Commissioner by this measure. The experience of the last twelve months has shown us what large powers have to be granted at times. It must always be remembered that the humblest citizen will have the right of appeal to a Court to protect his interests if they are trespassed upon in the administration of this measure. Being as we are, a people accustomed to be governed by law, I am not afraid of giving wide powers to the Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- It will not be costly to an insurance company if the Commissioner is found to have used his powers unwisely or against a clear interpretation of the law. Suppose, for instance, that a company is called on to appeal to a Supreme Court to protect its interests. What will happen ? If the Commissioner is found to be in the wrong the costs will be awarded against him, and the company will not have to pay any costs. My experience, however, is that law is costly. We legislated here on the subject of trading with the enemy. It was understood that the law was very definite and clear in its terms, but a Court has decided that a certain power was not given, and therefore an individual cannot be interfered with. In this case we lay down distinctly the functions of the Commissioner, the powers he may exercise, and the claims which he may make on the insurance companies. He will be the umpire between the companies and the public, and we have made provision that there shall be furnished to him information concerning the operations of the companies for the benefit of the shareholders and the general public. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Minister to agree to postpone this clause. In my opinion, it clothes the Commissioner with uncommon powers. According to what has been revealed, he will have power to make public information of specific cases. There is nothing specific in the clause referring to the Commissioner&#39;s report. He may examine so many offices, and explain that he finds them in a certain condition. But under this clause he may hold up any particular society before the public. As the Minister has himself admitted, this may be followed by a lawsuit, involving heavy costs. The previous clause has been postponed, and as this is related to it, I ask the Minister to postpone this clause also. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me that considerable abuse may arise under this clause. It would be competent for a number of shareholders or policy-holders in a company to pester it by continually demanding that the company should send them returns, abstracts, or statements by post, free of charge. I have no desire to limit the power of shareholders in these companies, but I think it is unreasonable that a shareholder or policyholder should have the right to demand that a company should at any time send in a copy of a statement or document by post, free of charge. If the demand could be made once in each case it would not be open to so much objection. A company might be called upon for considerable expenditure on postage under a provision of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- He might be proposing to sever his connexion with the company, and he could involve it in considerable expenditure by demanding that a number of returns should be posted to him free of charge. I think it would be well to omit the words &#34; free of charge.&#34; That might overcome the  difficulty.  I have no doubt that the companies would have no objection to supplying shareholders and policy-holders with copies of documents they desire. I should be glad to hear Senators Guy and Senior on this matter. As the clause stands, it seems to me that it might work injuriously to a company without any advantage to the shareholders. </para>

                        <para>- I think so, but I cannot be positive on that point for the moment. The advantage given to shareholders and policy-holders is very seldom availed of. I think it is right that if a shareholder desires to have a copy of the annual statement or other return of the company in which he is interested, he should be entitled to get it. Generally speaking, the different societies are only most anxious to have their statements and reports distributed. I was at a meeting of a society at Launceston on Monday last, and I will guarantee that the statement presented there will be promptly sent to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> in order that it may be commented upon. Societies are usually anxious for the distribution of their reports to advertise the advantages they offer. If a society can produce a good statement of accounts, it will be glad of the advertisement it will receive by its distribution to- every shareholder. </para>

                    (South Australia &#91;5.28&#93;. - This clause deals with confidential information which must be supplied by companies to the Commissioner under a penalty of &#163;100. The Commissioner is restricted from publishing it except for statistical purposes. I want to refer to the clause in connexion with the matter which we previously discussed on clause 41, with which it may be said to be co-related. We must draw the line very clearly between what is confidential information and what may be published. A little while ago we were told that we must trust the Commissioner, but now we are being asked to pass a clause which&#39; will leg-rope, tether, and hobble that officer. A company in sending information to the Commissioner may claim that it is confidential. Who is to determine the matter ? Some of the confidential information may be published for statistical purposes.

                        <para>- It may not apply to accounts, but it may apply to information concerning methods adopted by a company in doing its business. It may apply to certain claims which a company may have accepted, and under this clause, by merely marking its reports to the Commissioner &#34; confidential,&#34; it may prevent the publication of information concerning the very kind of business which may, in the opinion of the Commissioner, make it insecure. In my view, this clause counteracts the benefits which the Minister has claimed will follow from the adoption of the previous clause referred to. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know why there should be so much objection to that form of legislation, seeing that it is easier to disallow a regulation than to amend a Bill. If the Senate is not sitting the regulation will have force during the recess, and immediately the Senate reassembles it must be laid on the table. If exception is taken to it, the debate on the question must take precedence of other business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has shown by his detailed knowledge of the Bill that there will be cases where it will be necessary  for the Commissioner to obtain from the companies certain information that it is not wise to publish. The regulations will clearly set out what is to be confidential information, and what may be published. We are making it clear that publicity shall be given to all the matters dealt with in this division of the Bill, which are necessary to enable the ordinary citizen to form a correct judgment of the stability of any company. It is then provided that the companies shall furnish the Commissioner with confidential returns, with the further proviso that such confidential information may be used for statistical purposes, but  not  &#34; published or divulged in a form which would enable the information supplied by the company to be identified.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The Government determine it before the regulations are promulgated. A parallel case is to be found in the war census returns. Under them the public will shortly be called upon to furnish much confidential information about their private affairs. It would be a gross breach of confidence to publish any private details of that character, but the aggregate results will doubtless be used for statistical purposes, and may rightly be published without doing any one a personal injury. </para>

                        <para>- That could not be used for statistical purposes. For instance, mortgages on insurance policies will be covered by the information regarding mortgages. The confidential returns are to be prescribed by regulation, and are therefore altogether outside the general scope of the Bill. Is it to be left entirely to the regulations to define what is confidential and what is public information ? If used under sub-clause 2, the information will become public property, and therefore no longer confidential, even though it mav not be particularly identifiable. The clause is simply overloading the Bill. The confidential information can be of no value of the Commissioner, who, after all, will be a public servant, and must take the responsibility of making public any information he receives. These considerations apply with all the more urgent, seeing that the clause has a penalty of &#163;100 attached to it. </para>

                    <para>, - I do not agree that the clause is unnecessary. It might be necessary for the Commissioner as the guardian of the public interest to know how the funds of an insurance company were in vested, although it would not be necessary to make the information public. In some of the States the insurance companies may with their surplus funds engage practically in the business of banking or advancing money on large estates, and the Commissioner mav be promoted, by some public statement that a certain company is investing money detrimentally to the policy-holders, to seek to obtain confidential information from the company. He should be in a position to do this, although it would be essential for him to keep the information confidential when he obtained it. The clause can do no injury, and may do a great deal of good, because the problem of the investment of the surplus moneys of companies is one of the most difficult that they have to face. They all want to find safe investments from which their money can easily be withdrawn again if required. The regulations will prescribe what is confidential information, and what may be published, and we may safely leave it to the Commissioner to make inquiries as to how moneys are invested, and to regard those inquiries as confidential. </para>

                    <para>, - This clause is in the nature of a very large order for the Commissioner. I need scarcely point out that the book containing the addresses of the shareholders of an insurance company may not be printed. It may need to be copied, and the &#34; prescribed fee&#34; may be a very large one. Some of the limited liability companies doing business in Australia are proprietary companies in the sense that their proprietors live in foreign lands. It seems to me that if we provide that a copy of the addresses of the shareholders in all insurance companies shall be deposited with the Commissioner, and shall be open to inspection by any shareholder, we shall be doing all that is necessary. We are not justified in giving to every shareholder the power to ask for a detailed list of all the shareholders in any company with which he may be connected. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the position would only be complicated if we decided that the Commissioner should keep this book. We must recollect that in this Bil&#93; we are not legislating merely for the needs of to-day. I trust that the measure will represent the last word in insurance legislation for some time to come. If a man desired to obtain a list of the names and addresses of some hundreds of thousands of shareholders in an insurance company, it would scarcely be fair to compel the company to supply him with that list free of charge. The clause in its present form, I think, adequately meets the case. Under another provision in the Bill power is given to any shareholder to inspect the shareholders&#39; address book, and if he wishes to obtain a copy of that book it is only reasonable that he should pay the prescribed fee. It is just as necessary to protect the insurance companies as it is to protect the individuals. The former must not be liable to be harassed by a shareholder simply because he may disagree with their method of conducting business. In my own State, I recollect that when a large insurance company desired to extend its operations to Great Britain, one or two shareholders who objected to that move, as a result of their energetic and persistent opposition, involved the company in considerable expense. In my judgment, . the clause &#39;.in its present form should be adhered to. </para>

I believe that an understanding has been arrived at under which the consideration of that Bill in the other branch of the Legislature will be finished to-night. Its discussion here will afford honorable senators an opportunity of debating administrative matters. If, however, the session is to close on Thursday next - as we all hope it will - it will be necessary for us to meet on Tuesday, as one or two important measures yet remain to be dealt with.
