                    <para>GEELONG, Monday. - The doings of certain soldiers in the military hospital at Osborne House are the subject of much comment in the city. Insubordination  is  said to be common amongst the men, and it is stated that the superintendent and the staff have much difficulty in dealing with offenders. Residents of North Geelong, in whose territory the hospital is situated, complain of misconduct. On Sunday afternoon a contingent of girls visited the institution, and an officer subsequently found a dance in progress. An orderly had occasion to check one of the soldiers, and an exchange of words led to a fight. The question of leave is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> sore point with a section of the men. </para>
                    <para>Will the Minister make inquiries to see whether the allegations are true or otherwise, and take the necessary steps ? </para>

Will the Commonwealth Government consider the advisability of taking similar action so that soldiers who are fighting outside of Australia may have the opportunity to record their votes? </para>

                            <para>. - In resuming my remarks, I do not think it will be out of place if I express pleasure that those members of this Chamber who, with some members of the other branch of the Legislature, were passengers by the Melbourne express train which met with an accident on Saturday morning, escaped almost unscathed. In regard to those who sustained injuries, I trust that their injuries will not be of a lasting character. I heartily congratulate all of them upon their fortunate escape. It would have been regrettable, indeed, if our parliamentary friendship had been interrupted by the hand of death. I trust that they will remain with us as long as this Parliament lasts, and that they will remember with feelings of thankfulness their escape from the lamentable accident in which, unfortunately, one poor man lost his life. On Friday last I was dealing with certain phases of the inflammatory phenomena attendant on the evolution of nations, which we call war. I was saying that our Citizen Army is an amateur force, and that in view of our continental responsibilities it is incumbent upon us to devise a more satisfactory scheme of home defence. In order to avoid unnecessarily stressing this aspect of the matter, I wish to say that the Commonwealth should have a professional army, which should be equal to at least one-fourth of that maintained by the United States of America. The United States occupy a very similar position to that in which we find ourselves. Until quite recently America's territories were continental, but it now has insular possessions scattered throughout the Pacific - notably the Sandwich and the Philippine Islands. The United States, which are inhabited by a specially peace-loving population, think it necessary to maintain a standing army of approximately 300,000 men. I feel that Australia will be very unwise if she depends solely on the Citizen Forces that we have organized and. are organizing. I have good military authority for this statement. It is almost a platitude to say that the people of the Commonwealth have shouldered tremendous responsibilities, and that they must show themselves equal to those responsibilities. We have a territory which, in the aggregate, is at least as great as that of the Roman Empire, and we must exhibit Roman qualities if our dominion is to endure. I have no hesitation in saying that we shall have to organize our Citizen Forces on a basis which will give them very much more training than they at present receive, and that the Army will have to be stiffened by regular soldiers to the extent of at least 25,000 men. It is true that this will entail very great financial sacrifices on the part of the people, but if they are not prepared to make those sacrifices, they will be unworthy of their very great heritage. Now, I intend to explore pretty well every section of this argument, and to refer to the financial phase of the question, because this is most important in relation to the proposal to organize forces for overseas service. In justice to myself, I must elaborate this phase of the question, particularly in view of the fact that some honorable senators opposite pretend to be unaware of the arguments which I have used previously in favour of levying, by conscription, on the manhood of Australia for further soldiers for the defence of the Empire. Some members interjected the other day, " What about the dependents?" and in reply to that I want them to reflect upon the fact that it has been statistically ascertained that we have in Australia approximately half a million men of military age who have practically no family ties. At least, they are not in the married state, and are between the ages of eighteen and thirty -five years. Surely, then, there is a sufficient field for recruiting by conscription the force required to assist the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, at the beginning of the scheme, for it would be bad policy at that stage to bring the married men into the rank and file. It has been laid down by a great Continental historian that the true test of national greatness is the readiness of a nation's young men to fight, and, if necessary, die for great national ideals, and one of the reasons why I advocate conscription is that it will enable us to give very necessary assistance to the Empire. I stressed the fact in the columns of the Tasmanian Labour paper, some months ago, when Parliament was in recess, that we are borrowing the money from the sorely pressed Mother Country to pay our men 400 and 500 per cent. more than the British taxpayers are receiving in the trenches of Flanders, for the poor Tommies are, to a certain extent, the taxpayers of England. It is unbecoming, therefore, that this money should be borrowed to enable Australia to make war on the most expensive scale ever indulged in throughout British history. Now anybody who knows me well is aware that I am in favour of paying high wages, and I am only taking up this attitude because I believe it is incumbent on me to say that we should wage this war with the utmost vigour available, and on the most economical basis. </para>

I do not mean to say that the Imperial resources are not very great, but this matter deserves to be very closely discussed, and even now I understand a proposal to levy an income tax on all incomes exceeding 10s. per week is being mooted. </para>

On the mere money basis, <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> or even £5, a day would not be too much to pay men who are risking their lives every hour of the twenty-four; but this should not be done if it causes any invidious distinctions to be made between the troops who are engaged in the conflict. My plan for conscription is certainly not original; and I venture to say that if the war does not end within the next few months conscription will be brought into force in the Old Country, and, in the long run, it must be adopted in Australia. </para>

I have been set upon this track by an interjection from an honorable senator opposite, who expressed some surprise that I should advocate giving assistance to the Empire, and not paying on the scale that we are doing at present. I find that the Honorable William Hughes and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> members of another place, expressed similar sentiments when the creation of the Australian Citizen Defence Forces was being discussed by Parliament, for they advocated service as a citizen obligation without any payment whatever. When I read their words, I can fancy that I can hear myself speaking. I completely identify myself with their utterances. </para>

                            <para>- We are treated to a great deal of ancient history when references are made' to the establishment of the Australian Fleet and the Australian Citizen Army by honorable senators opposite. Ancient history is considered most apposite, and is quoted freely by our honorable friends opposite, when the attempt is made to establish some claim on behalf of the Labour party; but ancient history is to be relegated to the limbo of forgotten things when it tells against them. We have heard about the Australian Fleet and what the Labour party had to do in connexion with its establishment; but they always keep in the background the fact that the only persons who voted against the resolution submitted in another place which committed Australia to the establishment of a Fleet were members of the Labour party.

I say that if it is a sound proposition to ask Australians to fit themselves to defend Australia within Australia as an integral unit of the Empire for nothing, it is a sound proposition to ask that they should be prepared to fight alongside Imperialists who are voluntarily enlisted for Is. 2d. a day, at the same rate as those men receive.

                            Surely not. The Minister has power to call upon every male inhabitant of Australia, except those who are exempt from service. . . . It is inconceivable that when the whole nation has to respond to a call to arms every man should be paid. On the very face of it, such an idea is absurd. Therefore, since the principle of general conscription is introduced-

If we knew that the war .was going to last only a month or two, we should know what we were doing, and might bo in a position to indulge in a little extravagance. We might even be more generous to the members of our Forces than we are at present, but it is essential that Australia shall continue the necessary assistance to the Empire until the war is prosecuted to a successful conclusion. It is, in the circumstances, inherently and manifestly wrong for us to be paying men 6s. per day when we are borrowing the money with which to pay them from the Home Country, that is paying her own voluntarily-enlisted soldiers at the rate of ls. 2d. per day. </para>

                            <para>- I have; but I do not believe that that expression has any real military value. As the honorable senator should know, Lord Curzon has quite recently expressed himself in regard to the amazing courage shown by young German conscripts. I am quite sure that our conscripted men would show courage at least equal to that of the young Germans. I am, in this matter, looking ahead, and considering what is done in other countries. If we prosecuted the war to a successful conclusion; the conscripted men should then te given something by the Government. They should be- rewarded neither tardily nor parsimoniously. If the war lasted two years, the men who came back uninjured should receive a bonus. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned with interjections of that sort. I can give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> something to chew over at his leisure. I read in the newspapers and certain magazines many interesting articles on strategy and the European military situation, written by journalists who seem to have incorporated the genius of all the tacticians who have lived and died since the birth of Julius Caesar. I will admit that the writing is very often interesting, but I do not forget that one of the most prominent of them - although probably he would like it forgotten - wrote, in 1913, in a magazine of which he was editor, that Lord Roberts was a panic-monger. In the British press and the Imperial Parliament there was an outcry, having for its object the disrating of Lord Roberts, because he was being classed as a pernicious alarmist. The truth is that British statesmen, able in many other respects, and in fact the British people generally, lack what I call the storm or danger sense. Many people in Australia who study international relationships had no doubt that Germany was arming to destroy British supremacy, and yet British statesmen - for I must call them such, because of their great achievements in other fields - seemed to be absolutely oblivious of the fact that this great armed nation was seeking to accomplish the downfall of the Empire for whose safety they were responsible. When I know these facts, honorable senators need not think that I am going to be diverted from my. argument by interjections to the effect that I ought to be in the place of these men, and that I would show them how to do things. My duty is what I conceive it to be, and if the legislators and people of Australia collectively put me down as a foolish alarmist they do so to their mortal cost. There may be some kind of patched-up peace in the next few months - a thing which I would altogether deprecate - but if that happens the storm centre will only shift. There are men belonging to armies which may be our potential antagonists within the next decade who are hoping and praying that the European war may last five or six years, because of the new and potent international combinations which they will then be able to dictate. I say in all seriousness that there are men whom innocent Australian taxpayers believe to be well disposed towards them - professional soldiers of the armies of one of the great Powers - who have expressed themselves on Australian soil, covertly, of course, but in a manner which came to my ears, to the effect that they desired to see the European war last five or six years. Why? Because European civilization would suffer from exhaustion and enable certain international movements, which they believe to be desirable, to be consummated. I cannot allude in more specific terms to what is in my mind. Honorable senators with any perspicacity can divine my meaning. </para>

                            <para>- I go about my business in my own way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> drew attention to a most important fact, that certain contractors for military materials appear to have been, to say the least of it, lax in their supervision over the articles which they had undertaken to supply for the equipment of our soldiers. I am not saying that the statements have been proved. I spoke to a Frenchman a long while ago at considerable length about the position of his country after the Franco-Prussian war. He had been in that war, and told me that it was pitiable to see the French troops marching into Besancon almost barefooted, or with boots made of brown paper hanging from their feet. Such boots, I am sorry to say, were supplied to the French Government by British contractors. This Frenchman attributed a great deal of the loss of morale on the part of his countrymen - and the military operations disclosed the same thing - to the fact that they had suffered from the practices of fraudulent contractors on numberless occasions. I am not prone on the production of a little evidence to assume that any person is, or a number of persons are, guilty of offences, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> undoubtedly made out a case demanding investigation. It would, perhaps, be desirable for the Minister to take into consideration the embodiment in such a measure as has just been tabled of some provision enabling us to punish most severely contractors proved guilty of fraudulent practices. </para>

                            <para>- It would be an excellent idea. One fine argument in favour of conscription is its democratic nature. With it no invidious comparisons can be made by different sections of the community as to what they have done, and what somebody else ought to do. The stern lips of the law summon men to defend the country according to law; there is no room for cavil, or for odious comparisons. Every man is called upon according to the law to fulfil his citizen obligations. Before leaving the subject of the war, let me say, not incongruously, a little about peace. Already we see a great deal of kite-flying in the papers about this peace business. The position, as I take it. and I hope I am not an altogether unintelligent observer, is that, while the German people have not yet any consciousness of the probability of defeat, the leaders of German thought, and the directors of the German armies, have no doubt in their minds that Germany's objectives cannot be realized at the present time and in the present circumstances. They see presages of defeat. Individually I admire many Germans. I admire the German Empire for a great deal of material achievement, but our duty is to our own country, and I shall regret having assisted in the voting of any money towards the assistance of the Imperial Government if Imperial statesmen, when victory is within their grasp, patch up a peace which will entail, if not on us, at least on our immediate descendants, a repetition of this terrible war. There is no doubt that, sooner or later, the British Empire and its Allies are going to achieve victory. I have always maintained that the resources of the British Empire alone, if fully exhibited and carefully economized, are sufficient to enable us to triumph over Germany. </para>

                            <para>- We will win if we exhibit our full resources, but if we are afraid to pay the price, then the victory will not be decisive, and a peace patched up by an indecisive victory will be for the British Empire the equivalent of defeat. The task is a great one, and that is why I am so insistent upon our rendering assistance to the Empire on the most economical basis, but the end cannot be in doubt, and the leaders of German thought recognise that it is not in doubt. But what are they attempting to do ? If they are covertly suggesting peace, they are attempting to do what is known in the boxing ring as smothering. They know that international combinations do not favour Germany at present. They know that they cannot immediately realize their objectives, and they hope to. induce the British Empire, in a spirit of false humanitarianism, to conclude peace - a peace which will enable perhaps present international alliances to be dissolved, and allow- Germany to remedy the weak points of its scheme, and to . more surely make an attempt to destroy the British Empire on some future occasion. If ever there was a patriotic party required in the British House of Commons, it is now. We want legislators who will stiffen their country- to its duty. We must achieve victory at all costs - not partial victory, but completely decisive victory. I ask honorable senators to picture what sort of peace it would be if the Germans consented to retire from Belgium and from France, if there was no indemnity to be paid, and if the German fleet, as regards its capital ships, was to remain intact? Do honorable senators think that the German people would have the consciousness of defeat? No; they would have the consciousness of only partial victory. They would know that they had achieved a moral victory, which would be converted into a material victory at a later stage. I hold that British statesmen will fail in their duty, as they have failed in the work of preparation hitherto, if they enter into any peace negotiations with the enemy until France and Belgium have been evacuated as a condition precedent to any discussion of peace. We must evict them by force of arms, in order to maintain the prestige of our Empire. We must drive them out, and then, although the sacrifice may be great, the status of our Empire in the world, already great, will be even greater. If the German fleet is not destroyed, or captured, or surrendered; if Germany pays no indemnity ; if she only retires from France and Belgium as the result of some peace discussion, do honorable senators flatter themselves that the British Empire and its Allies will really  have won in the-war ? I will feel very sorry indeed, and will think that a great many brave men have laid down their lives in vain, and that the whole bloody and infernal business will have to be re-enacted. </para>

                            <para>- There is one little matter to which I must allude. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who very often delivers himself in a way which I respect, very foolishly, to my mind, dragged in some statistics which had been printed, showing the percentage of unionists who have enlisted in connexion with the forces that we are sending to the front, and the percentage of non-unionists. If ever a comparison was odious, it was that one, for there are many other questions to be considered. Now the percentage of unionists and non-unionists we are sending to the war is a very small one indeed. But what would the honorable senator say if in the peculiarly Labour stronghold of Broken Hill something occurred which I sought to drag into the discussion? Very early in the history of the war, certain men at Broken Hill - probably labourites - very much to their credit, volunteered to go to the front; but when they got into the railway carriages they had to endure contumely, hisses, and shouts from a crowd characterizing them as murderers. Why? Because they had volunteered to serve their country in the hour of its need. Are the Liberals so numerous at Broken Hill that there is a high degree of probability that it was they who. crowded on to the railway stations and hissed " Murderers " ? </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; and, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> argument in connexion with the percentages cuts very little ice. That sort of argument should not be introduced into an assembly of reasoning men. It applies, as an honorable senator interjects, to all the members of the Expeditionary Forces when a Labour senator uses it, but if a Liberal used such an argument he would be decried throughout the length and breadth of the land. </para>

                            <para>- Let the honorable senator quote me a Liberal newspaper which has made the assertion that unionists were not enlisting in sufficient numbers because of their lack of patriotism. That is the sort of thing which passes for argument. I know what human nature is. I have never questioned the loyalty of any Australian. I knew that when British civilization was in danger all people would rally. I knew that Irishmen, Scotchmen, Welshmen, Australians, black men, brown men, and brindled  men would all rally to the support of the flag, and it is the lack of knowledge of that fact which has landed the Germans where they are. These comparisons, introduced as to which section is most loyal, are most unsatisfactory and unnecessary, and will be put an end to by conscription. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is talking nonsense. I venture to say that any Australian country-bred lad, if given, a military rifle, will, after two days' tuition, hit the target more frequently than he will miss it. I have heard an Australian lad who was being pressed to join a rifle club plead that he had had no experience of shooting with military rifles, although he was accustomed to a sporting rifle. He also urged that he had not yet been sworn in. Thereupon the Captain, who was also a justice of the peace, replied, " I will give you a rifle and a supply of cartridges now, so that you may commence firing straight away. I will swear you in when we get to the township." The boy's objections having thus been overcome, he took the rifle, and scored four bull's-eyes in succession. That is the sort of material which makes the Australian soldier so resourceful. The contention that we may not have sufficient rifles and military accoutrements with which to equip our Forces in large numbers is a wrong contention. </para>

But. as Lord Kitchener and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George are credited with having expressed the opinion that the struggle will be a long one, I think that we shall be acting unwisely if we do not change the basis of our assistance to the Mother Country. Before long the wisdom of my remarks will, I feel sure, become abundantly apparent. I hope that the war will be prosecuted with undiminished vigour until victory of a most decisive character is achieved. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. Either accurately or inaccurately, Lord Kitchener is reported to have said that the war will last for three years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George is also credited with having expressed the view that the struggle will be a long one. If it should prove to be long, my remarks will have very much keener point than they appear to possess at present. I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the Constitution. As is well known, many members of the Liberal party took a prominent part in the struggle which resulted in the consummation of Australian nationality. We assisted in getting the people to assent to the Commonwealth Constitution. That Constitution is, to my mind, a very fine instrument of government. Yet many of those who are in opposition to us to-day were so dissatisfied with it, that if the electors had hearkened to their advice, Federation would probably not yet have been accomplished. </para>

                            <para>- Nobody has more respect for the ability and learning of the Justices of the High Court than I have, but I regret that they have found it necessary to give a decision adverse to the Commonwealth in connexion with the action of the New South Wales Government in seizing the wheat of that State and preventing its export to other States. I am particularly anxious that the Administration shall carry that case to the highest tribunal in the Empire. If ever a, case ought to be taken to the Privy Council, certainly this one ought to be. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say anything: of the sort. The honorable senator imagines that I prejudge anything when evidence is submitted to me. I do not. When I dealt with the action of the South Australian Government in prohibiting the export of wheat to Tasmania, I said that I held the opinion that such action was unconstitutional, but that I held that opinion subject to the judgment of the High Court. I do not say that the law as laid down by the High Court is bad. But there is a possibility that the judgment of that tribunal is not correct, and may be reversed on appeal to the Privy Council. </para>

                            <para>- The party to which I belong is quite capable of taking care of itself. When the people become infuriated with it, it can quietly await their return to a saner state of mind. Victory and defeat are not new experiences so far as the Liberal party is concerned. The history of the Commonwealth has disclosed the fact that the National Parliament can exercise only a few very important functions. The great extent of our territory is undoubtedly a factor in the consideration of this matter. Although I am an ardent Nationalist, I believe that the functions of the Commonwealth should not be greatly extended. I am of opinion that this Parliament has quite sufficient to do in properly exercising its chief functions - those which the electors principally had in mind when they voted for the Constitution Bill. When they were asked to accept that measure, there was no doubt in their minds that by so doing they were providing the machinery for a complete system of Australian defence, and also for absolute freedom of trade between the States. I venture to say that no well-disposed Nationalist believed at that time that any State Government had power to arbitrarily hold up Australian trade. Believing, as I do, that in their acceptance of Federation, the people were animated by a desire to provide a complete scheme of national defence, and to bring about absolute freedom of trade between the States, I will support any amendment of the Constitution which may be necessary to give effect to their intentions. There is no nonsense about me - I am a Nationalist. But there are not many functions which the National Parliament can satisfactorily exercise. Those functions are few, but they are very great and important. </para>

                            <para>- There was a little talk about securing a uniform Matrimonial Act and a uniform Bankruptcy Act, but these measures did not vitally influence the acceptance or rejection of the Constitution. They were merely subsidiary and complementary. The two principal matters which the electors had in mind were the establishment of a scheme of national defence and InterState Free Trade. It appears that the defence power has not been seriously impaired by any judgment of the High Court. But I venture to say that the action of the New South Wales Government and its attitude towards the Constitution - notwithstanding that it has been held to be perfectly legal - is a most un-Australian one. When the war started, were not capitalists denounced for holding too much food? If a man who possessed a few pounds more than his brother citizens purchased a few extra bags of flour, was not his action roundly condemned ? What, then, can be thought of a State which, having the biggest supply of wheat, has said in effect, " We will keep the lot." I know that the present Commonwealth Administration has been criticised for having intervened in this matter, but I say unhesitatingly that it did its duty in getting the constitutional question which was involved relegated to the proper tribunal for decision. </para>

Consequently, if Australia is attacked, inasmuch as our interests are the greatest, the whole of our troops will be retained within our own borders. Of course the men who drafted the Constitution were not demi-gods, but they were able men, and their names will be remembered gratefully by the people of Australia, for they brought about Australian nationality through the medium of an instrument which gained the encomiums of many Imperial statesmen. </para>

Just a few words now on the Tariff, and I will bring my somewhat lengthy speech to a close. All honorable senators know I am a Protectionist. I believe that the Tariff can be made a fairly effective instrument for national development in certain circumstances, but I am sorry - and my sorrow would be the more intense if I did not know human nature - that there are many Protectionists abroad who believe in Protection for themselves only. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose most senators have experienced what I have, for I have been inundated with letters and circulars during the last month or two asking me to vote for this or that duty, and I notice that every man who is producing something, or thinks he can produce something, wants a very high, almost a prohibitive, duty. That is all right up to a certain point, but I am a Protectionist who believes that if a policy is to have any real value, it ought to work all round. Unfortunately, Protection does not hold out very much inducement to the true primary producer. We know what Germany has done with her Tariff laws, and what America has done, and knowledge of the achievements of those countries confirms me in mv opinion. But what do we find is the attitude of the people in Australia ? The majority of Protectionists take up a singular attitude - they want to get the very highest price for what they produce, and obtain what they want in the cheapest market. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and at a low price arbitrarily fixed. What do honorable senators think of these Protectionists? They are not Protectionists at all. They are merely selfish men who are out to secure a personal advantage. Now I want to illustrate to honorable senators a matter in connexion with the mining industry, of which I have some knowledge. If silver-lead goes up £5 or £6 per ton, or £8 or £10 a ton, the silver-lead miner is overjoyed; and if silver were to go up to 4s. per oz., I suppose all silver producers throughout the land would be almost frantic with pleasure. When tin went up to over £200 per ton, and when tin-miners were, of course, overjoyed, a great many people were denouncing the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for selling sugar at a price which was really below what it was ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago. If you had suggested to a lead-miner that he was getting too much for his lead, and was inconveniencing the plumber in the city, he would have regarded .you as a madman, for he felt he should receive the highest price that he could get for his product, and properly so too. But at the same time these people were complaining that the "cockies" were making too much money. I have heard miners, who were getting fairly high prices for their ores, complaining of the price of bread. Evidently they wanted the farmer to produce his wheat at the lowest possible price, while they themselves obtained the highest price in the markets of the world and in Australia. The whole position is illogical. What has happened in connexion with the Tariff up to the present?? When a 5- per cent, increase was placed upon woollen goods, the mainland woollen, mills advanced the price in proportion very much more than the duty necessitated. What do honorable senators say about that? Did the Necessary Commodities Board consider this phase of the problem? Is not cloth a necessary commodity for the men on the land ? </para>

                            <para>- I know that very well, for I am not blind to the obvious, surely. The Minister commandeered the whole output, and probably he is paying on the prices fixed before he did so, for the prices were advanced directly the Tariff was introduced. This question of the Tariff, I am sorry to say, resolves itself into a consideration of country interests as against manufacturing interests, which are largely city interests. Does anybody suggest that boots are not a necessary commodity, and does not the farmer want them ? Did the Necessary Commodities Board suggest that boots should be reduced 2s. 6d. a pair for the benefit of the farmer? No. The necessary commodities of Australia, in the opinion of that Board, are what the farmers produce, and, notwithstanding all the disadvantages the farmer labours, under in connexion with the Protectionist policy, the Board does not concede to the farmer the right to obtain the full market price for his productions. The tendency always is to fix the price of the farmers' commodities in a downward direction. If that is Protection, then I repudiate any association with such Protectionists. Has the Necessary Commodities Board fixed the price of a single manufactured article ? </para>

                            <para>- I will not go into that question, for you will find a minority in regard to an expression of opinion on all questions; but I would be very satisfied indeed as to the feeling of the farmers if they were collectively asked to express an opinion by a referendum upon the justice and equity of the Act passed by the New South Wales Parliament limiting the prices of their product. That would be a more satisfactory indication to me than the giving of one or two banquets to members of the Labour party. In analyzing the position, one arrives at the conclusion that something must be done, and I unhesitatingly say that if we are going to have a Protectionist policy - a truly Protectionist policy - which will result in the imposition of heavy, almost prohibitive, duties on every manufactured article, then in justice to the farmers, I am prepared to give them a bonus on every necessary article essential to the welfare of the community which they produce, because we cannot recompense them in any other way. </para>

                            <para>- Because I believe in Protection all round. I am not a fanatic, however, and if peace could be guaranteed for a couple of hundred years I would be a Free Trader, because trade is not evil. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> in his speech, referred to men who had transgressed certain measures which have been passed; but, after all, most of these offences were only technical, and were so described by the Judge. Yet they are mentioned here to pillory the Liberal party. Whether this is so or not, I am not in a position to say; but let me tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that during the Napoleonic wars, when trading with the enemy was absolutely prohibited, and when the Continent was placed under a sort of interdict commercially by Great Britain, trade was not found to be an evil. The French Government issued permits surreptitiously to certain French merchants to trade with England, although England then was supposed to be in outer darkness as far as continental Europe was concerned, and the English Government also issued permits - thousands of them - to British subjects to trade surreptitiously with the enemy. Some people say that trade is an evil, and that we should be absolutely self-contained. Because of our insular position it is well that we should manufacture all that we can. But we have to look at the matter broadly. If we increase the price of every manufactured article to the wool producer and the wheat producer, the men whose produce really brings us the wealth we derive from foreign countries, it is right that we should give some consideration to their case. </para>

                            <para>- Is this a normal year? Did we not suspend the wheat duties when, if they had been imposed, they would probably have been of some assistance' to the farmers? Speaking generally, legislators are interesting people. We propose a duty for the benefit of the farmer, which in a plenteous year is of no use to him, but in a lean year, when the duty might be the means of putting a little profit into his pocket, we at once take the duty off in the interests of all the people. </para>

                            <para>- -If the Australian wheat crop was not sufficient, I have no doubt that the men engaged in the trade would have made the necessary arrangement for large importations from foreign countries; but Governments have stepped in to deal with the matter, and have been under the imputation of having robbed the farming community. I shall exercise my own discretion in regard to Tariff matters. I believe that all thought of making our Tariff so high that we shall be able to produce everything we desire, and that there will be practically no Customs revenue, is a kind of delusion. I have never yet known a Protectionist country that was at the same time a strong commercial country abreast of modern civilization that did not obtain a very large revenue through its Customs House despite its Protectionist Tariff. This proves that, although Protection may be a useful expedient, lucrative and profitable trade is, after all, the objective of the commercial world. I do not think that our experience in the matter will be found to be any different from that of America or Germany. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware there are American shovels and mining implements sold very much cheaper than those imported from Great Britain. For many years, in connexion with the tin-mining industry, practically the whole of our tools were imported, not from America, but from Great Britain, though America is admittedly a Protectionist country, and Great Britain is in theory a Free Trade country. It does not always follow that the exports of factories in a Protective country are sold at a higher rate than are the exports of similar factories in a Free Trade country. But as a general thing, if we exclude the principle of dumping, we must admit that the tendency of Protection is to prevent to a certain extent the manufacture of articles at a price at which they can be sold overseas. In Australia, with our high labour market, which I do not say is wrong, because it is one of the lines -of our social development, I do not think that a Protectionist policy will result in our being able to manufacture many articles which we can sell at a considerable profit overseas. It will, however, enable us, perhaps, to overtake our internal requirements. In that respect it will be regarded by many people as a considerable boon, but in the long run we know that we have to pay its fair price for everything that is worth having. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I might mention the establishment of the Small Arms Factory as an illustration of my argument. It may cost us more to manufacture a rifle than we have hitherto, been called upon to pay for imported rifles; but; it is absolutely essential that we should manufacture rifles in Australia at the present time, and in this way Protection operates in a manner conducive to the national interest. I associate myself in connexion with Tariff matters only with those Protectionists who believe in the application of the principle all round wherever this is practicable, and I abhor the Protectionist who desires merely the highest price for the article which he manufactures, and at the same time desires to force the farmer to sell the article of primary production upon which he depends at a price lower than he would otherwise get for it. </para>

I have redeemed my promise to be pretty discursive "and to treat fully the salient features in the Ministerial statement, and I resume my seat with a repetition of the assurance that any measures introduced by the Administration necessary for the successful prosecution of the war and the obtaining of a decisive victory by the Empire and its Allies will receive my humble support. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator laid it down that the policy of the Liberal party, in the Senate at any rate, was to be a political truce. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> speech is the kind of truce we are offered. I admit that the honorable senator said that we must be prepared for healthy criticism of any measures we bring along. But we do not want any hypocrisy about it. It is far better that our honorable friends opposite should come out into the open and say that they are going to fight us honorably than that they should lead the public to believe that they are genuine and sincere in their offer of a political truce. </para>

Let me inform honorable senators that it was the Labour party who made genuine overtures for a political truce in the first place, and the members of the Liberal party held them up to ridicule because of those overtures. I can refer honorable senators to what occurred just previous to the last elections. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who is one of the leaders of the Labour party, generously and in a spirit of the highest patriotism, offered the Liberal party a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> truce.

                                <para>- That is so, and our political opponents seized upon that cry and used every argument in their power to profit by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> generous offer. Since then we have had contested elections for the Grampians and for Bendigo, two Labour constituencies. We had no offer from the other side of a party truce in connexion with those elections. They contested those elections most bitterly. We take no exception to that, but we do take exception to the hypocrisy mouthed here by the party opposite when they say that they are genuinely desirous of a political truce. In view of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has said, let me remind honorable senators of what has taken place since this Parliament assembled after the elections. We have witnessed in another branch of this Legislature such a low standard of political etiquette that our friends opposite should be ashamed that, as a party, they are responsible for it. We saw that the dignity of Parliament was made a reproach. The Leader of the Opposition in another place made one of the greatest scenes in the history of the Federal Parliament. Is that the way to observe a party truce? </para>

                                <para>- The Opposition have vanished. What must members of the Liberal party in England think of the conduct of the leaders of the Liberal party here? On 19th December last, just as the first part of the session was being closed, the scene to which I have referred occurred in another place. Shortly afterwards, the following cable appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald- '</inline></para>

                        <para>London, Friday. </para>
                        <para>Deep regret is expressed in Imperial circles at the scene which occurred in the Commonwealth House of Representatives on Thursday night, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Cook, leader of the Opposition, came into collision with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> McDonald, the  Speaker,  and was suspended. "It is to be hoped that parties will sink their personal differences," says a famous Imperialist. " We always expect leaders to exhibit sufficient tact to avoid collision with the Chair, no matter what provocation may be given." </para>
                        <para class="block">Surely that is a most stringent and biting criticism of the methods of the great Liberal party in this Parliament. Yet we hear now from their leader in this Chamber a great deal of humbug about a party truce. </para>
                        <para>I should probably not have taken part in this debate but for the remarkable statements which fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> lips. Some of them should be replied to. I would direct attention first to the very derogatory references made by the honorable senator to the fact that we were sending only 70,000 men to the front. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was very silent while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> was indulging in these reflections, and that no approving "Hear, hears! " came from the Liberal benches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> went on to say, "If it takes as long to defend our shores as to send those men, it will not be much good." I am quoting his own words. He is a public man, and should have considered the matter very carefully before giving vent to such statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could have told him - but </para>
                        <para class="block">I noticed that he was silent - and the Minister of Defence would have told him if applied to privately, the true facts regarding the equipment of the Expeditionary Forces. Any honorable senator can obtain privately from the Minister a statement of the real position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> had that avenue of information open to him, and yet, either wilfully or in ignorance of the true facts, he made a statement which, if it goes forth to the world, may lead people in other countries to believe that we have not done our duty towards the Empire. It was a positively dangerous statement to make. If the honorable senator had gone into the matter carefully, he would have found that it is of no use to send efficiently trained men to the front unless the last button has been put on their uniforms, and that modern warfare necessitates an equipment complete in every detail. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> knows that to equip these men entailed a great strain on our resources, yet we did it successfully. He knows that, for obvious reasons, we cannot discuss those matters frankly at the present time. He knows that we never had such a position to deal with before, and if he reads the American papers he must know that one of the principal troubles of the great nation of Russia has been the equipment of her troops. She has had the men, and they have been quite willing to fight, but it has been another matter to supply them with the accoutrements, arms, and ammunition required to enable them to take the field. The honorable senator is well aware of these facts, and yet he railed at this Government, and the preceding Government, because more men had not been sent. I' do not think very much attention will be paid to the honorable senator's opinion in this Chamber, however it may be regarded outside. Here is an extract which I desire to set against it. It comes from a great Liberal newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which, in a leading article on 19th December, 1914, commented in the following terms on the work which the Government had done in sending troops to the front- </para>

                            <para>It is no more than simple justice to the Labour Ministry to observe that it has displayed a rare quantity of wisdom and courage in its management of the finances. It had to face conditions of exceeding difficulty, and to solve problems wholly foreign to the experience of Australian statesmanship. With little or no help from its political opponents, and in the teeth of much partisan objection, the Government effectively discharged its onerous and unprecedented obligations, and in a manner that bids fair to indemnify the credit of the nation from remote or proximate depreciation. The Ministry also deserves applause for its vigorous and successful administration of our Defence system, which has already resulted in an Australian representation of armed forces at the seat of war, which is likely to serve the Empire passing \2fll, and the continuous preparation of  reinforcements  for the front. And these great tasks have been, and are being,, satisfactorily carried out without imposing on the people a sensible economic strain. </para>

                                <para>- It is not an untruth, and I take exception to the term. I have shown that the leaders of Imperial thought commented adversely on the partisan tactics of the Opposition in another place during the early part of the session. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> also said the same thing. The honorable senator knows it is true, and all his offensive interjections will not alter the fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> alsosaid we could have been better prepared. When he said that, he knew the facts. I cannot speak openly in this Chamber, for it is not advisable to deal in detail in public with these military matters. Our leader has refrained from doing so, and we must follow his example. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> sends broadcast over Australia the allegation that we are not doing enough. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannonindorse</inline> his colleague's statements? </para>

Whose fault is it that we are not better prepared <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The Liberal party are in a large measure responsible, and I hope, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> aid, to show it. He was very ready, when challenged by the Minister of Defence, to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> remarks from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> In 1903 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was the first man to move in favour of inserting in the Defence Act provision for the creation of a Citizen Defence Force. He has every reason to be proud of this, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> quoted from his speech to show that he made no proposal to pay the men. He omitted to mention that the training was to be only in times of peace. Nothing was said in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> motion of war times. What was proposed was that there should be a national militia force, which would have fourteen days' continuous training, and not more than thirty-two detached drills, aggregating 112 hours, per annum, in addition. It is quite true that at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did not advocate payment, because it was never anticipated, when the force was first established, that we should need so much training as Lord Kitchener and other expert advisers proved in their reports later on to be necessary. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> seemed to get some solace out of his quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> let me quote from the same <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook towards the proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> cannot say that in quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> I am quoting an irresponsible member of the Liberal party. I am quoting the Leader of the party who, on 5th August, 1903, immediately following <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> made a speech to the following effect: - </para>

Although, perhaps we have not been as prepared as we might have been - I have pointed out that the Liberal party must take most of the blame for that position - it is recognised that, in the circumstances, the self-governing Dominions have done marvellous work for the Empire in this time of stress, and any attempt to talk conscription, and attribute blame to everybody but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> at this juncture, is not only injudicious, but absolutely criminal. </para>

                                <para>- I am pointing out that, as regards an appeal for men - which is an entirely different thing - we have never been disappointed. We can get sufficient men to enlist, not only in Australia, but throughout the Empire, without the aid of conscription - by merely calling for volunteers. In the Commonwealth we are getting as many recruits as we can deal with, and in England a greater number are offering their services than the authorities can equip. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> talks of conscription. </para>

I believe that I rightly gauge public opinion when I say that any attempt to impose conscription upon Australia would be bitterly resented by our organized Democracy. I believe that our people would even resort to physical force, if necessary, in order to avoid it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has not shown that any need exists for taking such an extreme step. He has not proved that we can arm or equip more men than we are arming and equipping now. He has merely affirmed that we shall have to resort to conscription, and to pay our conscripts1s. 2d. per day. He declares that he fails to see much difference between compulsory training and conscription. Compulsory training is an arrangement made in time of peace, under which men have to undergo prescribed periods of training. </para>

                                <para>- That is a sufficient reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> assertion. Surely the honorable senator does not think that Australia has reached such a parlous condition that it cannot afford to give our soldiers a rate of pay sufficient for the maintenance of their wives and families. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has put forward the argument that only single men should be enlisted. But if married men volunteer for service abroad, why not allow them to go ? I am very glad that adequate provision has been made for their dependants. I know that quite recently I have been approached time and again by relatives of men serving in our Expeditionary Forces, who complain of the inadequacy of the present rate of pay, and of the trouble experienced in maintaining big families upon it, although they are patriotic enough to exist upon it during the period of the war. That rate, I claim, is the very minimum on which we can expect these people to maintain themselves. Any reduction would be an insult to the Democracy of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- There is no doubt about that. I wish to show that in the Commonwealth there are large incomes which have not yet been heavily taxed, and when it comes to a question of making sacrifices, I hold that there should be an equality of sacrifice. In view of the fact that the nation <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> engaged in a struggle for its very existence, those persons who derive big incomes should be called upon to make commensurate sacrifices. In his famous Limehouse speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, in speaking of the taxation of unearned incomes, said that in case of war the nation would be justified in taking, for the time being, all these incomes in Great Britain. What does that mean ? It means that all the incomes in England, Scotland, and Ireland which are derived from investments either in the form of rent, interest, or dividends, may be justifiably confiscated by the nation when it is fighting for its existence. I wonder whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> will be so ready to indorse that statement as he was to declare that we should pay our soldiers, who are about to fight the Empire's battle, only1s. 2d. per day ? Turning to an interesting little booklet, compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> I find that as far back as 1911 there were 3,536 individuals in Australia with a total income of £22,953,874. </para>

                            <para>. - One scarcely knows whether to bo thankful or otherwise to the Government for having given honorable senators an opportunity of discussing this matter, for if a good deal of criticism has been levelled at the Government for their administration of affairs, some little advice has been tendered to them also. I am doubtful, however, if the Government will benefit very much by the advice tendered, not because they might refuse to accept it, but because the advice has been of a somewhat unsatisfactory character. The Government have been severely  criticised  for many of their actions, particularly in the administration of the Defence Department, and, of course, living as we do in a warlike age, it is natural to expect that most people are thinking and talking more of warlike subjects than of any other. I presume, therefore, that it is natural that some time should be devoted to advising the Minister of Defence and his colleagues how this war should be conducted. I am not going to take up that line of argument, however, and I am not going to talk conscription, or advocate paying our Army, whether under- conscription or otherwise, at the " magnificent " rate of ls. 2d. per day. Personally, I would have no objection to conscription if that course were necessary, but I am confident that in Australia, and, indeed, throughout the whole British Empire, we are fully meeting the claims made upon us in connexion with this war by the voluntary system which has been adopted. It is right, proper, and wise that we should look to the possibility of conscription, but we are a very long way indeed from the necessity to adopt that course, and it is hardly fair at the present time that in the National Parliament of Australia any honorable senator should get up and voice for a moment even the suggestion of conscription in this country. It is a very poor compliment indeed to pay to the people of Australia, and a very poor compliment indeed to the men who are volunteering in large numbers, for we have the assurance of  the  Defence </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Department that our young men are volunteering just as quickly as the Department can equip them ; and, indeed, quicker than they can be provided for. I do not know by what means <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> would clothe or arm our men under the system he suggests. I remember, however, that in reading the history of my own country, at a- time when men went out to fight during the earlier ages, the question of clothing or armament received very little consideration. A kilt, a rag or two, was all their clothing; a' stick with a scythe blade tied to the end of it, a pitchfork or something of that kind was the weapon with which very often they went out to fight their neighbours' quarrels, or their own. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> I hope, does not suggest that we should send our young Australians to the front armed in that way. But, if not, how are they to be sent? Our ammunition factory, our clothing factory, our boot factories, our saddle and harness factory, and, in fact, every factory dealing with the munitions and supplies for war purposes, are working at top speed, and yet we have men in our camps for weeks and, in some cases, months before they receive the necessary equipment. I am confident that if the men could be equipped and armed quicker than is the case to-day we would be able to muster our men more rapidly than at present. I deprecate exceedingly any honorable senator coming here- and advocating conscription, for the reports of his utterances will travel very quickly indeed. Probably even before today is over, the fact that conscription has been suggested in Australia will have been wired all over the world, and the report will be given greater prominence from the fact that it has emanated from a member of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia. I only hope, therefore, that the utterances of those of us who repudiate the idea will follow as quickly as possible on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> suggestion, so that the world will know what is the opinion of the Senate on this subject. It is not my intention to find very much fault with the Defence Department, though there are some matters upon which I have ground for. complaint. But they are small compared with what the Department has been achieving. During the past few months there has been a tremendous strain upon the Department, and I realize that every man is doing a fair thing, from the Minister downwards, and I recognise also that the Minister and his officers want every encouragement that we can possibly give them, instead of condemnation for the small matters of complaint to which attention might be drawn. It will be much better if we do not bring these complaints into this chamber for ventilation through the public press. During this great crisis the Defence Department has proved itself capable of dealing with very big issues indeed, and though I have some small grievances I think the Department is entitled to the best thanks of this Parliament for what it has done. In addition to what has been done by our Army - and that seems to have been the subject of the honorable senator's condemnation - we ought not to forget our Navy. A few months ago every man and woman in Australia, I am sure, felt very much bigger as a result of the splendid work of our Navy. No doubt any criticism which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> levels at the Army on the subject of conscription can be applied also to the Navy. I do not know whether he purposes to give the men the option of joining the Army or the Navy, but I dare say that, if he did, he would find it necessary to advocate the building of a great many more battleships to accommodate the young Australians who would be available for service. I repeat that the scheme of conscription suggested by my honorable friend is entirely unnecessary, and is not creditable to him at this juncture. I want now to refer to the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> The honorable senator's remarks were favorable to the Government, but behind them there were suggestions of trouble to come. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> indicated that so long as the Government were prepared to go along on perfectly safe lines - and, by doing so, to break their pledges to the people of Australia, by delaying giving effect to the promises made at the last general election - he would support them. But the moment they commenced to put their pledges into effect we could look for trouble from that quarter. In spite of the fact that this fearful war is raging in Europe, and we are taking a very important part in the war, there is no reason why we should go to sleep upon our own domestic affairs. "We have the requirements of our own country to attend to. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. People are being born, married, and buried, and they have to be fed, clothed, -and provided for just as they were previous to the outbreak of war. The great Labour party were returned at the regent elections upon certain pledges and promises made to the people of Australia. When those promises and pledges were made the war was raging, and the people who returned the members of the Labour party to power were confident that the war would not interfere with the fulfilment of those promises and pledges. Our honorable friends opposite, now that we are in power, wish us to become opportunists, as they have themselves so frequently done, and to slide out of our promises to the people. I am satisfied that no such attempt will be made on the part of the present Government. I hope that, as we shall devote every attention that is necessary to the great question of prosecuting the war, we shall also devote all the attention that is necessary to our own domestic affairs. Whilst the big outside questions must necessarily occupy a great amount of our time, we should not neglect to give due regard to questions affecting the welfare of our people. In reply to honorable senators opposite, then, I say that the Labour party have no intention whatever to delay the fulfilment of the promises they made to the people of Australia during the recent elections. I wish to, deal now with the statement which has been placed before us by the Minister of Defence as leader of the Senate. Any unbiased person reading that statement, and certainly those portions of it which refer to the conduct of the war, and to the troops we have sent to Europe and are preparing for the front, must feel gratified to know what has been achieved. It is about eight months since the war broke out, -and, in the face of tremendous difficulties, we have since that time sent a great number of men to the front. I invite honorable senators, and the people generally, to calmly consider the forethought and the tremendous care which has been necessary in order that our Forces should be properly equipped  and transported with perfect safety from Australia to the seat of the war. It must be admitted that this was the biggest undertaking in the way of the transport of troops that has ever been attempted in the history of the world. Yet an honorable senator on the other side is found to ask what this Parliament and the Government have done. Why, it can scarcely be said that the age of miracles is at an end when we consider that this tremendous undertaking has been successfully carried out by men who had no previous experience of such work. </para>

Yet we are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> who is supposed to know everything under the sun, that we have done absolutely nothing. When we come to consider what really has been done, the honorable senator's statement must, by its very extravagance, lose any weight it would otherwise have. I feel proud of the success which has attended the efforts of the Government in this direction. I am confident that if further troops are necessary, they will be sent with the same safety and despatch. </para>

                                <para>- I sincerely hope that very few more, will be required. While on the question of war, I should like to say that I think that a degree of secrecy has been observed in Australia with regard to the operations of the war that is quite unnecessary. The censorship has, in my opinion, been altogether too severe. Those of us who receive newspapers and correspondence from the Old Country are surprised at the amount of detail in connexion with the war which is published in them, in comparison with the very meagre information supplied to us in Australia. I think that there is no need for so much secrecy. I believe that there would not be the same lack of confidence on the part of the public generally if they knew more of what is really going on. If the Minister of Defence, within the bounds of safety, of course, can do anything to« relax the too strict censorship which exists at the present time, he will relieve the anxiety of many people who have relatives and friends at the front, and, I believe, will induce many to come forward and enlist who are now holding back. I hope that the Minister will be able to do something in this direction. The matter next in importance is, I think, the question of finance. We had the strange statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that we in Australia are now paying our share of the expenses of the war. He has said that we are borrowing the money from the British taxpayer, and from the British soldier who is in the trenches in Flanders to-day. That is an extraordinary statement, but it is in keeping with many of the curious things which the honorable senator said. We have borrowed money from the Imperial Government for a certain purpose in just the same way as we have borrowed money before. We are paying interest on the money, and w© shall repay the principal in the ordinary way, as we have done in connexion with any other loan. We are under no obligation to any persons for the money lent to us, and they are under no obligation to us for interest and principal, which will be paid as they fall due. It is a pure business transaction, profitable and agreeable to all the parties concerned. I am proud, as an Australian, to know that the men we are sending from the Commonwealth represent the best-paid Army in the world. We are all proud of the fact that there is no Army in the world today that is paid as well as our Forces are being paid, or for which, in the event of disaster or accident, such liberal arrangements are made for the injured or the dependents of those who are killed. All this goes to show that our financial arrangements are perfectly sound, and that the men who are risking their lives in the defence of the Empire are not being overlooked by those who are responsible for them. To a great extent we have to thank the Commonwealth Bank for the satisfactory nature of the financial position. This is an institution which we have heard denounced from time to time. Certain people have attempted to cripple and injure it, and to restrict its usefulness in one way or another. I have a lively recollection of a Bill which was sent up to the Senate last session, the intention of which was to injure the Commonwealth Bank. It was one- of the measures which the Senate promptly rejected. The Labour party have reason to be proud of the fact that by the rejection of that measure they helped to extend the influence of the Commonwealth Bank, which has done so much to assist the Government in financing the expenditure due to the war. It is not my intention to deal at greater length with the financial position, because there are other matters which appeal to some of us more directly at the present time, important as the question of finance undoubtedly is. I wish to refer to the railway proposals of the Government, and in this connexion I may not be quite so eulogistic as I have been in referring to their achievements for the defence of the Empire. In the statement read by the Minister of Defence a reference is made to a proposed strategic railway from Brisbane to Port Augusta. I have no fault to find with any railway proposals intended to develop the great northern part of the continent of Australia. It will be a very bad proposal, indeed, for the opening up of that country by railway communication which will not secure my indorsement. But no railway proposal will have my support until the great north and south railway is undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. There was a definite promise made to the people of Australia in connexion with that railway. I wish it to be understood that I am not here pleading for anything for South Australia. I remember that when I was dealing with the question some time ago an honorable senator characterized my statement as " a wail from South Australia." I am not one to wail, but I am prepared to say what I consider necessary in my own way. I am not condemning the proposed strategic railway at this stage, as we have no information concerning it, and it is not now before us for discussion; but I do say that the north and south railway has been before the people of Australia for many years, and I regret exceedingly that no reference to it is made in the Ministerial statement read by the Minister of Defence. </para>

                                <para>- I should not like to say that that is the intention, but I must say that many people have been looking for some definite statement from the Government with respect to the north and south railway. I believe that it is a fact that the Commonwealth Government must give the Government of South Australia twelve months' notice from the end of the year of their intention to take over the portion of the railway between Quorn and Oodnadatta. So far as I know, no such notice has yet been given, and, as I understand the matter, twelve months must elapse from next November or December before anything can be done by the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the north and south railway. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister will see how much more easy and simple it would be to take his own material over his own railway than to take it over a section owned by South Australia. I wish to refer to what an honorable senator said here regarding my remarks on this railway. On a previous occasion I made certain references to the territory through' which the railway should pass, and, amongst other things, I said that it would pass within a reasonable distance of the Barklay Tableland. An honorable senator told me that the Barklay Tableland was not in the Northern Territory, but in Queensland. I had not an opportunity to reply to him, but I have here the latest ' maps of the Territory, which show conclusively that the- Barklay Tableland runs for 400 miles into the middle of it. We want to borrow nothing from Queensland to bolster up this great Federal possession. I am pleading for Federal territory, and not for any particular State. I referred also at the time to the possibility of artesian water being found in the Barklay Tableland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> told me that there was no such thing as artesian water anywhere near the Barklay Tableland. I have here another map, on which a very large area of that country is marked as "probably artesian." What is the use of an honorable senator telling us that certain things do riot exist in the Northern Territory, when, to judge by his own remarks, he has never even seen a map or plan of the country ? Before I referred to the subject on the last occasion, I took the precautions to examine all the maps specially prepared by the Government, and find out what I was talking about. Whilst the through railway does not actually touch the tableland, a route has been surveyed which goes nearer the Queensland border, and right through the centre of the tableland; so that we need not go to Queensland for anything in connexion with that part of the country. This Federal possession will, in a few years, return an enormous revenue to the Federal Government. Another map which I have here shows the settlement that has already taken place in this country, which is supposed by some people to be worthless. The whole of the coloured portion has already been taken up. It is not a barren waste, or a noman's land, but a country where a tremendous area has already been taken up, and where settlement would exist to-day if there were railway facilities for the people to get goods to their places, or their stock away to the seaboard. I think the area taken up already is about 300,000 square miles. The rainfall map shows that on the Barklay Tableland the average fall is between 15 and 25 inches. There are many portions in Australia where the fall is considerably le3S. </para>

                                <para>- If Oodnadatta had no railway there would be no settlement there at all. All this goes to show that before an honorable senator condemns another senator's remarks, or suggests that he wants to impose on another State, he should acquaint himself with the facts. If he did, he would not fall into such a grievous blunder as my honorable friend fell into in connexion with the north-south railway. I am satisfied that good progress has been made, in spite of. great difficulties, with the east-west railway, and I hope that long before the two and a half years mentioned by the Minister have passed, the line will be open for traffic. There are great water difficulties to be overcome. In fact. I believe the difficulties in the way of construction are greater in that case than they will be in regard to the north-south railway; but I am quite satisfied with the progress that the Commonwealth is making in the construction of the line. Unemployment is very much felt, and we hope that every effort will be put forth by the Commonwealth Government at the earliest moment to go on with the public works which have already been outlined, to absorb as many unemployed as possible. I believe the season is promising well, and if our workers can see their way to get over the coming winter, which will be a severe one, I believe that afterwards a much greater amount of employment will be available in rural occupations. I would, therefore, urge the Minister and the Government to do everything possible now in the way of providing employment. There is no reason why the whole of the amount set apart for public works, and not spent, should not be spent during the present year. </para>

I have every confidence that the Government will do their best. They have done their best so far, and if they can continue on the lines they have followed, they will earn the approval of everybody in Australia. I have no fault to find with the work they have done during the adjournment, and I have no doubt the past is simply an indication of what will be done in the future. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to oppose the motion ; but I hope the Minister will endeavour so to order the business that, when we assemble here to do work, some reasonable programme will be prepared for our consideration. I make all allowance for the emergencies which may necessitate the introduction by the Government of special legislation; but after the somewhat lengthy recess we might have hoped, on re-assembling to do business, that something more serious would be demanded of us than to meet for two or three hours and adjourn. The Minister might either have business ready for us or refrain from calling us together. It seems to me that, no matter what may happen this week, the Senate will not transact more business than could have been properly done in two days. It would be just as well for the Government to recognise that fact, and not to call honorable senators here for three days when there is. only business sufficient to occupy them for two days. I express the hope that for the rest of this session, if there is to be a shortage of work, honorable, senators will be told that there is no business for them to do, and, therefore, they need not attend. For any honorable senators to travel here a long distance to do a couple of hours work, and then to adjourn, is, to my mind, reducing what should be serious work to something in the nature of a farce. I trust that in the future when we are called here we shall find something to do. </para>
