      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE.</inline>- It will be remembered that a question arose as to a statement made by myself that the first statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> had not been referred to the censor. The day after I made that statement the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> said that it was incorrect. &#39; I made the statement, as I said at the time, on the authority of the  deputy  chief censor, who informed me that the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had not been submitted to the censor. On making inquiries1 regarding the contradiction by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> I found that I was quite right, and that the statement made by the deputy chief censor was quite correct. I may say that in its issue of the 4th June, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> published the following explanation: - </para>

      <para class="block">
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>for having said that he had not been accurately informed in the matter. What actually happened was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> sent a copy of his statement to the Sydney press, and I understand that he also sent a copy to the Melbourne press. The statement which appeared in the Sydney press was referred to the censor, and a certain paragraph was struck out by him. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> acting as the&#39; correspondent for the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> telegraphed, I understand, that statement to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> but the statement that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> published was the one which it received direct from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and that statement was not submitted to the censor. That, I believe, is the explanation of the whole matter. </para>

            <para>- I do not propose to start on a search for a place which will be free from defect - the defect referred to being mud. Wherever you have rain you will have mud. The conditions after the heavy rain at the Broadmeadows Camp were certainly not good, and to alter them whilst the camp was in occupation was practically impossible, because the traffic would have to be carried on. The health of the men also had not been so good as we would have wished after that heavy rain. Therefore, it was decided to shift the camp to Seymour, where the soil was said to be better, and that action was. taken. I then appointed a committee of engineer officers to go into the question of what steps could be taken to make the Broadmeadows Camp habitable,, and they have submitted a report in which they recommend an expenditure of &#163;6,000 for the purpose of putting in roads and draining and grading the ground. As it would cost about &#163;4,500 to remove the buildings of various kinds which have been erected there to Seymour, and the engineers say that by the expenditure of the &#163;6,000 the Broadmeadows Camp can be made perfectly habitable, I have approved of the expenditure being incurred, and when that has been done, the troops will be brought back from. Seymour to Broadmeadows. But I want it to be understood that it is not because of the appearance of the paragraph to which the honorable member has referred that I have taken that action. </para>

              <para>- We have a tenure for the time the camp is required for the purposes of the war. It is a tenure similar to that which we have in respect to most camps. There is practically only one State where we have a training area which is used as a camp, and that is New South Wales. In other States we have had to acquire or lease land from private persons. In the case of the Broadmeadows Camp, the land was placed it our disposal free of rent for the use of the Department as long as it requires the camp for the purposes of the war. The money which is being spent there will not be lost. All the buildings are of a temporary character, and they have been so erected in order that they may be taken to pieces and re-erected, wherever we hold our annual camp. It is the intention of the Department in the future, instead of using tents for the annual training of the troops, to use &#39;the .huts erected at Broadmeadows. It is believed that that will result in a considerable saving, .because the wastage with tents is very large. The only expenditure which will not be recoverable will be the money spent on roads. </para>

It is considered preferable to refer the inventions to such a Board rather than have models of each brought forward to be exhibited at Parliament House. If the Board deems any of the inventions worthy of consideration, models maythen be exhibited. So far forty (40) different proposals have been considered by the Engineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways. </para>

It is right that I should draw attention to the fact that this ia the last Supply Bill for the present financial year, because honorable senators are entitled to certain privileges in discussing it. It provides for, approximately, one twentyfourth of the annual appropriation. It covers a fortnight&#39;s Supply, and there is nothing new or original in it. It covers merely the ordinary salaries, plus the usual contingencies for the Departments. The total amount asked for under it is &#163;2,013,020. </para>

          <para>. - I do not propose to discuss this Bill, because to do so would be quite superfluous. I do, however, propose to take advantage of the opportunity presented to direct attention to one or two matters which I think it advisable to bring under the notice of the Government, and more particularly of the Minister of Defence. First of all, I wish to say a word or two concerning the expenditure of a considerable sum of money at the Broad- meadows Camp.. When, a little time ago, the Minister of Defence announced the intention to spend something like &#163;6,000 at Broadmeadows, I asked what appeared to me to be a very pertinent question. I wished to know whether we had any title to the land used as a military camp at Broadmeadows on which it was proposed to expend money upon improvements of a permanent character which might be rendered useless if we had to hand the land back again to the owners. I understand that no title to the land has been acquired by the Government, and I suggest that the Minister of Defence should immediately look into this aspect of the matter. I do not wish to delay for a moment the work that is going on at the camp, but as money must be spent, amongst other things, upon roads, in view of the deluge which occurred there a little while ago, we may find, when we come to hand the land back to the owner, that we may have to pull up the roads, and possibly to pay some compensation for damage done to the land. </para>

            <para>- It does not necessarily follow, but I venture to say that most people having a road constructed through their paddocks for the purpose of a military encampment would, when the land was being handed back to them, see in the road a substantial justification for a claim for compensation. I am putting this as an ordinary business matter. I believe that the Department has for some time been considering the question of securing a permanent site for a military camp within a reasonable distance of Melbourne. I am speaking from memory, but I am under the impression that they had some scheme for the acquisition of the land at Broadmeadows for the purpose. I refer to the matter with a view of suggesting to the Minister that if he is going to spend money there on improvements which may later on be rendered useless, the whole question of the tenure on which we hold the land should be considered. There is no permanent military camp for Victoria such as we have in New South Wales, and sooner or later we must face the problem of getting one. It is a simple business proposition that, as we are now spending money on the land at Broadmeadows, our title to the land should pass under review. </para>

            <para>- For the moment I cannot say whether it is or not, but I know that it is not regarded by the military authorities as a satisfactory one. There was a desire in the Department a few months ago to acquire a permanent camp for Victoria such as the Liverpool Camp is for New South Wales. If Broadmeadows is not suitable for the purpose, my suggestion may be viewed in another light, but if it can be improved to meet requirements, I suggest that as a business precaution a title to the land should be secured before we spend a lot of money, the expenditure of which may be rendered useless a &#39; little later on. There is another matter to which I should like to direct attention. Quite a number of volunteers offering their services in Sydney - and I believe the same thing has occurred here - are told that their &#39; chest measurement is not quite sufficient, but that if they go to a physical culture school for two or three weeks experts in physical culture will be able to bring them up to the required measurement. Many are doing so, and doing it successfully. I suggest to the Minister of Defence that if it is clear to the enlisting officers that with two or three weeks&#39; training at a physical culture school a volunteer for service can come up to the required chest measurement, those men ought not to be sent away from the recruiting office, but should be taken into camp straight away, and be given their physical training there. At present many of these men are paying <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> or &#163;10 to physical culture experts, and they might be given the physical training they require at the camp, and at the same time become familiar with necessary military training. The adoption of this suggestion would prevent a good deal of disappointment and heartburning on the part of men anxious to serve the Empire, and it would save many of them money which they can ill afford to spend. It would expedite the business of enrolment, and give us the very element we want - the willing man. </para>

            <para>- These gentlemen who come back tanned with the suns of Queensland to take part in our national deliberations may be pardoned a little frivolity, but I do not care what it interferes with at the present juncture. I am putting forward the suggestion, I believe, with the approval of the Senate, in connexion with one of the little annoyances to intending recruits which I think might be easily remedied. Recently it was decided to establish a Dental Corps in connexion with the Expeditionary Forces. I should like to know from the Minister of Defence whether it is a fact that appointments to that corps have been made without applications being invited or without any consultation with the authorities representing the dental profession. I am informed that it is a fact, and, if so, it is a very serious departure from a very healthy and well-established practice in this country. The matter was not so desperately urgent that these appointments should not have been made public by an intimation, through the press or otherwise, requesting intending applicants to communicate with the Department. I believe that my information is reliable, and I should like to know whether the Minister is in a position to contradict it or to offer any explanation of what has been done. These are the three matters I wished to bring under the attention of the Senate. The Bill itself does not require a moment&#39;s consideration at our hands. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.40&#93;.- I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to say a few words regarding the present position, particularly regarding Defence matters. There has been some strong feeling exhibited concerning the employment of aliens . in connexion with not only the Defence Department, but other Departments throughout the Commonwealth. I am credibly informed that there are several gentlemen of alien  birth - really of enemy nationhood - now employed in the Defence Department at clerical work, and work in connexion with the accounts. At a time like the present it behoves the Government to set a good example to the public generally in the matter of employing alien enemies. Of course, we know that there are many here who  have  been in Australia for a great number of years with whom we have been able to get on quietly and comfortably - the same thing has taken place in Great Britain - but we realize now that the time has arrived when we must look at this  ques- tion  from an altogether different standpoint. We know that in Great Britain the position has gradually come to be regarded as more and more serious. People in whom it was thought absolute trust and confidence could be placed, owing to their long residence in Great Britain, and long association with British subjects, have been found to be in communication with the enemy, and disposing of important secrets that may have come &#34;within their knowledge ; and what has happened in Great Britain may happen here. We may have in our midst persons who will do the same thing. Possibly the men to whom I refer particularly may not do it, but just now we cannot afford to tamper with matters of that sort. It is better to make a mistake on the right side than <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the wrong side. Therefore, it would be wiser for the Minister to turn his attention to this object, and ascertain who are the men employed in the Defence Department in the way that I have indicated, than to run the risk of having persons there whose work, to say the least of it, may be unsatisfactory from a defence point of view. It may be urged that Australia is far removed from the seat of war, and is not likely to be attacked ; but as Australians are endeavouring to do their share in connexion with the defence of the Empire, an acquaintance with any matters connected with that defence may be of value and importance to the enemy. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD. - I believe that any number of men who have been rejected can be found. There is- the question of chest measurement. I know of men who have submitted themselves for examination whose chest measurement has been given as 2 inches less than their actual chest measurement. That is done by a peculiar method of measurement, which gives the minimum as actually less than the man&#39;s true minimum. I know of one man with a chest measurement of 41 inches whose services have been accepted and who has gone into camp. He was returned with a chest measurement of 39 inches. In another case a man with <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> chest measurement of 35 inches was told that his measurement did not come up to the requirement of 33 inches, and that he should go to a physical instructor and pet instruction for a week or so, then offer himself again. </para>

            <para>- I think that I can. The man of whom I have spoken has been undergoing this physical instruction and it has been stated to me that his chest measurement is something like 35 inches. There is another difficulty which exists, and it is a discouragement to men. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> asked a question with regard to men being kept waiting in a nude state for hours awaiting medical examination. I can understand that necessarily there is a certain amount of delay. I have been told by a man who was instructed to attend at about a quarter-past 9 o&#39;clock in the morning that the doctor will only examine men between the hoars of 11 and 12. The man stripped to the waist, and was required to stand for nearly  two hours before the examination <inline font-style="italic">ras</inline> held. If honorable senators will  make  the trouble to read some of the let.ers in the press to-day, they will see a  letter  in which a mother complains that  er  son was required to stand stripped for a considerable length of time before &#39;ie could be examined, with the result that he hr.3 an attack of broncho-pneumonia from time to time, and has really been broken up by the treatment he received. That is only one of many instances that are alleged to have occurred. I do not say that all the complaints are well founded, but once an allegation is made it is well to institute an inquiry. </para>

            <para>- Quite recently. When such complaints are made it is well to see if there is any ground for them. The Minister, of course, cannot be held responsible for such occurrences. . He gives his instructions and believes that they are being carried out effectively, but when complaints are made to the contrary, it is only fair that he should have the opportunity of ascertaining how much credence he can attach to the reports, and, at any rate, the opportunity of refuting them. We should do all in our power to encourage men to enlist, and not allow them to think that it is a matter of favour for the authorities to accept them and send them away to the front. Let it be understood throughout the Commonwealth that it is a case  of  mutual obligation and mutual benefit. It may be urged that we are not prepared to take all the men who are willing to go, because of a shortage of equipment. Truest is. that we may be unable to send the men into camp and get them away within a couple of months or so; but instead of turning them down absolutely, why not place their names on a list and call upon them as soon as there is an opportunity to get them into camp ? I think that this sort of thing has been going on for some time. Many a man has been . turned down, but if it were fully realized that it was most important that every able-bodied man should be accepted, another course of procedure would be adopted. </para>

            <para>- To-day we saw in the newspapers an appeal for recruits, giving the chest measurement, the height, and rates of pay. That indicates a desire to get men to enlist, but to-day the Empire is in such a grave position that we need the help of every able-bodied man we can get. One of the great troubles we have had to contend with is that we have been fed up with the belief that our people were doing well, that there had been no reverses. Unfavorable news has been carefully suppressed, and that has caused people not only here, but in the Old Country, to fail to realize fully the grave position in which the nation stands. If the nation does not wake up, and work a bit harder and more energetically, it may find that, instead of coming out of the struggle with the Allies as supreme victor, the war will result in practically a draw. We may not be able to drive the enemy out of Belgium, Northern France, and Poland, unless we get every man who is available to go to the front, and assist in vindicating the position taken up by the Allied Armies. </para>

            <para>- In Great Britain, public men are waking up, and there has been an amalgamation of all parties. The Government, the Opposition, and the&#62; Labour party have combined to form aNational Government to deal with on&#169; thing only, and that is the supreme safety of the nation. No question can be compared in importance with the safety of the nation. The freedom we enjoy today is very great. But let us assume the possibility of a hostile power being able to rob us of our freedom. What, then, would be the good of any laws we might pass? Suppose that Germany was in possession of this country. Where would be our freedom and liberty ? We would come under the iron heel of a despotism which would grind us down to the earth. </para>

            <para>- Then I ask the honorable senator to read in the press of Tuesday the statement of Lord Bryce in regard to the German system. He points out that, &#34; to the German the State is a tremendous abstraction, far above the persons composing it; with the singular attribute of being exempt from all moral conscience and moral sanction.&#34; Do we not see every day the effect of the operation of that principle? We read of great atrocities committed by Germans in Belgium, and the north of France. We know that it is only too true that atrocities are perpetrated by officers and soldiers. But I believe that, individually, they would never dream of doing such cruel and disgraceful acts. It is pleaded that the State finds it necessary to do these things in order to vindicate its own position. We in Australia, I am glad to believe, regard the State not as a supreme  body  that can do things which we as individuals would consider dishonest or wrong; we look to .the Government of the day to administer fair and equal justice to all classes. It is absurd for us to talk about minor differences of opinion. The. safety of the State is the supreme matter which we have to regard, and every effort of honorable senators, wherever they may sit, should be directed to maintain the supremacy of our great Empire. It can only be maintained, unfortunately, by the. sacrifice of thousands of the lives of our own people - lives which are valuable and can ill be spared, but which have to be sacrificed just as the lives of our predecessors were sacrificed in order to obtain the degree of political and religious freedom which we ourselves enjoy. I do not desire to say more on this question at present, except to appeal to honorable senators to do what they believe in their hearts to be best, and as far as possible to allow smaller matters to remain in abeyance whilst we are dealing with great issues. There is not a man in this Parliament, there is not a person in Australia, I hope, but realizes the great gravity of the struggle which is going on. There were certain matters in connexion with the camps which I proposed to refer to, but I will not delay the Senate now, because I believe, from what the Minister has said, that he .is taking measures to make the camps as sanitary and as efficient as possible. That is another matter which comes in pretty prominently with regard to the encouragement of enlistment. Let men understand that they are not going to a place impregnated with the germs of disease, but to a place which, by hygienic methods, has been made as healthful as &#39;possible. </para>

          <para>. - It is very interesting indeed to note the comparison between the speech of the Leader of the Opposition and that of the  Deputy  Leader. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> addressing himself to. the firstreading of the Bill, contented himself with a reference to the question of the chest measurement of those who arc anxious to serve the Empire on the battlefields of Europe. No honorable senator could help being struck by the practical nature of his suggestion, that if certain men were gaining a livelihood by charging some of our volunteers a fee to expand their chests, that work could very we1&#39; be done by the Department itself, seeing that it has. a staff for that purpose. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I see no reason why men who are told by the recruiting officers that if they were a little broader in the chest they would be accepted, should not be at once enlisted and placed in the respective camps, and undergo there a physical training which would bring them up to the required standard. That is about the only criticism which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> offered. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> worked himself almost into a fury, and made a charge against the Government that they were not realizing their duty to the Empire in the present crisis. Qualify his statement as he may, and apologize to the Minister of Defence as he did, &#39;he undoubtedly attacked the Minister, the Department&#34;, and the Government in saying that they were not realizing the crisis, that they were not enrolling all the men they could enrol, and that they were not sending sufficient men to the front. When the Minister asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to give the name of a solitary fit man who: had been rejected by an officer in the Commonwealth, he did not take up the challenge. </para>

            <para>- He compared the efforts of the Commonwealth with those of Canada. He said that figures would prove that Canada was doing more to help the Empire than was Australia. I venture to say that events have demonstrated that Australia has assisted the Empire more than has any other Dominion. Perhaps we have not sent as many men to the front as has Canada, but in proportion to our population we have sent more, and our troops have acquitted themselves exceedingly well. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is perfectly at liberty to produce figures in that connexion. The fact is that we suddenly found ourselves involved in a world-wide war. We were just as unprepared for the contingency as was the Mother Country herself. She realizes to-day that she was caught napping. The British Government were not prepared for the struggle either in connexion&#39; with her Naval or Military arm. I venture to say that if the policy suggested by my honorable friends opposite had been adopted by the Commonwealth, we would have been even less prepared, on the outbreak of war, than we were. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to say that we should sink party politics at the present juncture. He referred to the resignation of the Asquith Government in order that a National Cabinet, embracing all sections of political thought in Great Britain, might be constituted. Nevertheless, he was very partisan in his utterances this afternoon. I cannot help saying once more that whilst he accused the Government of failure to do sufficient in the way of enlisting men, he carefully abstained from suggesting a remedy. If the policy of his party had been adopted- </para>

            <para>- I cannot help it if my honorable friend becomes wild. It is quite evident that he cannot stand fair and honest criticism. There is no division amongst honorable senators to-day as to what we ought to do and as to the best way of doing it. We realize; that we are involved in a world crisis. We know that the present war is not. a territorial struggle. We recognise that, it is a fight for freedom against thedespotic Government of Germany. Wemust not be lulled into a sense of false security merely because German warships are not bombarding Melbourne orFremantle, or because our soldiers are not actively engaged in Australia in repelling an invading force. To-day they are fighting on the battlefields of Europeand of the Gallipoli Peninsula, where., they are endeavouring to maintain theprestige of the Empire and the liberty of the world. It&#39; is idle for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to come here and say that we arenot doing all that we should, unless he. can tell us what we ought to do. If hecan do that I will give him all the assistance I can- </para>

We all know that quite a number of wild statements have been made in regard to the Broadmeadows Camp.

            <para>- The answers given to the questions which I submitted to the Minister prove conclusively that there was no foundation for these statements. This circumstance ought to suggest to honorable members of this Parliament that they should exercise great care before making such wild assertions. When we come to analyze the number of deaths recorded at the various camps in the six capitals of the States, we see that the conditions obtaining in those camps have not been anything like what they have been represented to be. I wish now to refer to the payment to armourers&#39; assistants, in connexion with which there is evidently some misunderstanding between the Minister and myself. When speaking on the Ministerial statement, some time ago, 1 referred to the matter, and my remarks are recorded upon page 2375 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I also quoted the examination tests that those men had to submit to, and then I went on to read the letter from the secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in Perth, pointing out that at one time these armourers&#39; assistants were placed on the same basis as the postal electricians. But when the postal electricians approached an independent tribunal, namely, the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, they got an increase in their wages. When the Minister of Defence was replying, he said that having regard to the statements I had made he would look up the award of that Court, with a view of seeing whether or not he could review or revise the decision he had come to in connexion with the payment of armourers&#39; assistants. A little later on the honorable gentleman informed me that he had read the award, and had found that the armourers&#39; assistants were being paid more than the wages fixed for those men in the award. In connexion with that statement, I have a letter from the Department of Defence, dated 4th June, which reads as follows : - </para>

I was more than surprised to read your account of the statement of the Minister, as it is entirely at vari ance with the truth.

The following is a list of men engaged as assistant armourers at Perth, and their annual rate without allowances :- Turner, &#163;162; Maynard, &#163;156; Smith, &#163;156; Glen, &#163;144. </para>

        <para class="block">The other awards provide for wages up to as high as &#163;324.

I observe that the Assistant Minister shakes his head, and indicates that he does not agree with me, but if he will put a postal electrician alongside an armourers&#39; assistant, and require him to temper a bayonet, to work a slot machine, and mill, turn, fit, and drill, he will find that the postal electrician, although he may be a very good man, will not do the work of the armourers&#39; assistant. </para>

            <para>- I quite agree with that, but I again&#39; point out that a postal electrician cannot be expected to do the work of an armourer&#39;s assistant, and, say,, temper a bayonet that is out of temper. If the postal electricians can pass an examination test, and do the work that assistant armourers are called upon to do, I will give way. Any one who has a knowledge of the two industries knows that there is a great deal more skill required for armourers&#39; assistants than for postal electricians. I want to be clearly understood. I do not say that the postal electricians are paid too much. As a matter of fact, I do not think that they are getting enough. I would like to see them getting more than &#163;168 per annum. If the Minister will go again into the question, I feel sure he will agree that the men I refer to are not receiving a reward commensurate with the skilled nature of their work. I will not labour the matter further. I referred to it to-day in order to clear away any misunderstanding that may have arisen between the Minister and myself as to which men I was referring to, and I hope that the Minister, before this Bill is disposed of, will intimate whether or not he will give the subject further consideration. </para>

Even admitting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> contention is correct, and that Canada has sent forward a largernumber of troops in proportion to population than Australia has, he must bear inmind that Australia had a Navy, which Canada did not possess, and that in anycomparisons  that are made, this fact should be borne in mind. There are other considerations also which lead me to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> had not sufficiently looked into this question beforelie made his remarks. We must remember that Canada, being only about 3.000- miles from the scene of conflict, would find it an easier matter to transport troops over the shorter distance than would Australia, which is over 10,000&#39; miles away. </para>

            <para>- I do not desire to speak on that matter, because I donot know that it would be advisable to go minutely into it. We must acknowledge, however, that owing to the greater distance which our contingents had to travel from Australia, it was easier for Canada to send troops, especially at the beginning of the war. </para>

            <para>- Moreover, Canada from her situation has many advantages that Australia does not possess. Canada is adjacent to a large population where there is every  opportunity  to get equipment, and, as honorable senators know, this is a difficulty in Australia. I am not going to give away State secrets, even if 1 had knowledge of them, but we all know quite well that the one great difficulty in our organization was to provide our troops with arms; that the_ Small Arms Factory was not turning out&#34; arms quickly enough. I agree that there is room for difference of opinion as to whether the Small Arms Factory has been doing all that it might have been expected to do. but I think that something more could have been done in the ten months that have intervened since the outbreak of hostilities up to the present time. Still a great deal has been done in the direction of equipping our troops. I think we have done quite as well as Canada, and if our efforts were counted in pounds sterling, it, would probably be found that Australia has been spending &#163;2 for every &#163;1 spent in Canada. </para>

            <para>- That is so; but when unfair comparisons have been made, it is <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> duty to disprove and repudiate them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> dealt with another matter which at present is receiving considerable attention in various quarters. The daily press in Australia is taking up the cry for a National Government, in order that the war may be carried to a more successful issue than might otherwise be the case. The advantage of such a National Government is somewhat nebulous. It has not yet been so clearly proved as to induce us to accept the proposal. I am suspicious of the Greeks, even when they bring gifts. Fusion Governments are not looked upon with favour by Australian voters. We have had recent examples of this; and, speaking generally, the people of this country are against such Governments. When the war began, a Federal election was in progress, and during that election, offers were made by the Labour party to their political opponents. There were only .two parties concerned in the electoral contest, which was not complicated by the existence of a third party. There should, therefore, have been no difficult&#39;, in arriving at an understanding. The olive branch was held out by the Labour party. We said to our political opponents &#34; This is a favorable time for us to sink our party differences.&#34; </para>

            <para>- If it was quite  right  for our political opponents to thrust that offer aside, it is a little late in the day for them now to say that they are willing to take a share in the government of the country which the electors said they should not have. I believe that the time is not ripe for any such political combination as has been suggested. I am suspicious of the proposal, which I regard as a red herring, intended to put us off the track of the political reforms which it is well known the Labour Government will carry during their  term  of office. If we were to accept the offer of our political opponents, and ignore the promises we made to the country, it is the Labour party and not our political opponents who would be blamed for refusing to give effect to the pledges made from the election platforms. We said at that time that certain reforms were necessary. The war has but accentuated the necessity of those reforms. We said that the Constitution of Australia requires to be radically altered. Until it is altered, it would be worse than a mistake - it would be treachery on the part of the Labour party - to agree to anything in the nature of a truce because the war is in progress. The elections were fought under war conditions, and the people gave us a mandate to insist upon those constitutional reforms. Again, may I ask, which section of the proposed combination is going to swallow its opinion on the question of preference to unionists? Unless our political opponents are prepared to withdraw their opposition to those reforms, and are prepared to accept the mandate of the electors, and give it effect in the alteration of the Constitution, it is useless for them to dangle before our eyes anything in the nature of a combination Government. I have expressed myself in this way because I can see that an attempt is being made to foist into office certain politicians whom the people only a few months ago refused to have. I have no reason to believe that the people have in the meantime altered their opinion. Until our political opponents say that they are willing to allow the mandate of the people at the last election to be carried into effect, all talk of the establishment of n National Government here is useless. </para>

          <para>. - I do not desire to delay the passage of the Bill, but I wish to make an explanation in connexion with a matter which has been referred to in the Senate concerning the results of trials by military tribunals. I made a statement some time ago complaining about the difference in the punishment meted out by a military court of inquiry to a non-commissioned officer and to a commissioned officer. The Minister of Defence considered that I was not justified in making that statement. I said that the Commandant, in his report, stated that he was loath to have to dismiss the case against the officer. The Minister of Defence, in the endeavour to prove that I had made a misstatement, submitted a report from the Commandant, but, unfortunately, it was a report dealing with another case. I rise now to prove that I was perfectly justified in the statement I made. The report of the case to which I referred, and the evidence, have been sent to me. As the evidence is marked confidential, I shall not refer to it; but the Commandant, in his report, states - </para>

In the case of the captain, R.A&#39;.G.A., a perusal of the evidence will clearly prove that a conviction could not have been brought about by a cm., and though loath to do so, I had no alternative but to dismiss this charge. </para>

        <para class="block">That quotation from the Commandant&#39;s report will show that I was perfectly justified in making my statement, though the Minister of Defence tried to induce honorable senators to believe that I had no justification for it. I do not wish to bring the matter up again. I am satisfied to leave it as it stands; but I think that the punishment meted out to the non-commissioned officer in fining him about &#163;20 or &#163;30 a year by the reduction of his pay was altogether unjustified. Many things have been said this afternoon in connexion with the administration of the Defence Department, but at this critical moment I feel that I would not be justified in bringing forward some of the charges of maladministration which I have to make against the Department. This is a time when differences should be sunk, and we should be working together for the common good. I do not think that here in Australia we are taking this war as seriously as we should. I have considered from the start that we have looked upon the matter too lightly. </para>

            <para>- If we read between the lines of the information we get from the seat of war, we should awaken to the fact that it is necessary for us to do something more than we have done. I do not say that Australia has not done a good deal, and I shall not compare what we have done with what has been done by any other country, but I do say that we might have done a great deal more than we have done. Instead of boasting, as some people are doing in their attempts to prove their loyalty, I believe the Government should have instituted some means of arousing a greater feeling of enthusiasm amongst the people of Australia </para>

            <para>- In my view, the Empire and Australia are in grave danger, and we should do more than we have done. We should send our troops to the seat of war with the best equipment we can possibly give them, which is a condition of good health. Nothing is too good for the men who are going to the front to shed their blood for the country. The flower of our youth are giving their services voluntarily, whilst those staying behind are not doing as much as they should do. I could find at least half-a-dozen men in one street in Sydney who might themselves contribute as much money as has been subscribed to all the local funds. These people are not doing as much as they should do. We should be able to commandeer a certain amount of the wealth of Australia for the purpose of better equipping our troops for the struggle. </para>

            <para>- In my opinion, something should be done to urge the rich men of Australia to contribute a great deal more than they are contributing at the present time. I do not see why the expense of the war should fall so. largely as it does upon the general community. It should be distributed to a greater extent amongst those who are better able to bear it. The very flower of the country is going to the front. The Minister of Defence told us to-day of the number of deaths that have occurred in our military camps. There is nothing satisfactory about that. We are permitting some of our volunteers to die in camp of certain diseases, which indicates a lack of medical inspection. Men suffering from such diseases should not be allowed to go into camp. Last week when I inspected one camp I noticed that the number of young fellows suffering from severe colds was very large. These young men, who come from soft, warm beds, have to camp on the grass, and though they sleep in their clothes there is not sufficient warm clothing to go round. When we have boys of seventeen years of age, fired with enthusiasm that they have acquired in the course of their training in the ranks of the senior cadets, obtaining the permission of their parents to volunteer and go to the front, we should do a great deal more for their comfort; and it can easily be done. I do not think that sufficient has been done in the matter of securing a greater output of rifles. I hope that the Government are alive to the fact that we need to produce more. There is in Sydney a factory fully equipped with machinery that would make all but one or two parts of a rifle, which could be secured by the Government at a very small outlay. </para>

Some of the machines in that workshop are more modern and useful and up-to-date than those at Lithgow, and I believe that there are sufficient mechanical engineers in Sydney to equip it.

            <para>- The honorable senator is referring to a matter which might very well be allowed to have the shelter of oblivion at the present juncture. I am willing to suffer the past to be past, but if at this time of national crisis honorable senators do insist on discussing once more the question of where the merit of instituting the Australian Fleet should be apportioned, they must expect me to  interject  and also refer to certain facts, which show that the Labour party, in respect to its parliamentary representation, was  by  no means unanimous upon the question of the propriety of establishing the Australian Fleet. As a matter of fact, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> introduced the motion for the establishment of an Australian Navy, the minority - and it was a very considerable minority - consisted entirely of Labour members of the House of Representatives. I discuss the whole war question from a non-party standpoint; party enmity is at an end so far as I am concerned in the prosecution* of the war to a successful conclusion.; and, although the Avar is certainly the mostimportant item that a legislator in any part of the British Dominions to-day can discuss, I leave it for some later time, and address myself to the consideration of a matter which, if not the most important, at least is the nearest question to us nt present. I refer to the Australian Constitution and the Wheat Acquisition case, as it is called. As honorable  senators will recollect, I have displayed a certain mild persistence in having this matter pushed to its ultimate judicial conclusion. I have asked what the intentions of the Administration were in regard to appeals; I have asked what their intentions were in regard to other phases of the question disclosed by the action of the Government of South Australia; and so on. I am not forgetful of what I have said on previous occasions. I have pledged my word to support the present Government, or any other Administration, which will attempt to secure such a reform of the Australian Constitution as will enable the ideals and intentions of the Australian people when Federation was consummated to be realized. In other words, the most important question at that time being defence and intercolonial Free Trade, and in the belief that intercolonial Free Trade was intended to be established by the Federal Constitution, I am fully determined to do my humble best in trying to have the Constitution so amended as to preclude the present position, which the High Court has announced to be perfectly right under the Constitution as we find it, from being continued for any length of time. If the decision of the High Court in regard to the Wheat Acquisition case is to stand, I am prepared to support such an amendment of the Federal Constitution as will preclude any State from adopting the  selfish  monopolistic attitude of New South Wales and also South Australia in the recent crisis occasioned by the shortage in the Australian harvest. I have something to complain of against the Administration in this regard. Surely it is not so puffed up with a sense of security in regard to referendum proposals that it disdains the assistance of even the humblest of individuals ! I venture to say that in the State which I have the honour to assist in representing, if I took the platform in support of any proposed amendment of the Australian Constitution I could do a little in the way of securing the adoption of that proposal by the Tasmanian people. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator does not understand the spirit of Liberalism, nor the spirit that animates the ranks of Liberals. For instance, before I resume my seat, I intend to criticise severely the action of one of my leaders in regard to his war policy. Often jocularly honorable senators say that they wonder why I am not associated with the Labour party, but when they know me better they will understand that a deeper gulf runs between me and the Labour party than that which exists between any other man and that section of the Australian people -now enrolled in Labour ranks. </para>

            <para>- I did nothing of&#34; the sort. My complaint against the Administration in regard to the Wheat Acquisition case is that they did not carry the matter to the Privy Council, but announced their intention of accepting the High Court&#39;s decision as final. The people will listen most respectfully tothose who desire to amend the Federal Constitution if they have shown any respect for the machinery embodied in it. The Constitution, although adopted <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Australian people, is in reality a gift from the Imperial Legislature. They, inthe exercise of their Imperial right, bestowed the Constitution on us, and thatConstitution provides that an appeal can. be made to  His  Majesty the King in-. Council from a decision of even the HighCourt of Australia in regard to any matter. It is true that leave has to beobtained, and I say that the Administration should have obtained thenecessary leave and appealed, in orderto have the question put beyond all possibility of doubt. If ever an appeal tothe Privy Council was justified it was in this case, because the very spirit, andthe most important function, of the Australian Constitution are involved in a. proper judicial determination of thepoints to which I have referred. &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> - The most effectiveappeal is the adoption of the referenda proposals. </para>

            <para>- The honorablesenator, with all his knowledge of human nature, fails to properly appreciate the point. If the matter has not been determined by the highest tribunal in the Empire, how can the honorable senator meet the argument that any proposed alteration to the Constitution may be unnecessary, seeing that a final determination may not ha,ve been arrived at, notwithstanding the fact that the Constitution provides the necessary machinery <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the Administration were sincere in their desire to .amend the Constitution they would not disdain the means provided for securing an absolutely unimpeachable decision. Is there any guarantee that the Privy Council would not reverse the decision of the High Court? The High Court itself reversed the decision of the Inter-State Commission, and with all due respect to the High Court - and I do not think that there is any man of humble attainments more prone to respect great ability in other men than myself - I venture to say that there is a possibility of the decision of the High Court being reversed by the Privy Council. </para>

            <para>- It would settle the matter, and we would know the desirability of securing an amendment of the Constitution if we are truly national Liberals and national Labourites. In another place, which has been referred to as the Super-Parliament, there has been a great deal of talk about certain proposals which have been through this Legislature a couple of times,and partially a third time, which have been submitted twice to the Australian people, and twice rejected. If the measures as they were introduced in 1910, and submitted to the electors in 1911, and as they were introduced in 1912, and submitted to the electors in 1913, were passed by a majority of the electors and a majority of the States to-morrow, the constitutional position created by the judicial decision in the Wheat case would not be touched in the slightest degree. I will defer, of course, to the opinion of legal gentlemen. I have not had a legal training, but I have gone as closely as my modest abilities will permit me into this question, and I consider that the adoption of the referenda proposals in their entirety would not affect the constitutional position which has been created by the decision of the High Court. </para>

            <para>- Should not this matter be taken into consideration? Is it not important? Does it not concern the very vital principle which helped to bring about the consummation of Australian nationality? The Administration have refused to approach the highest tribunal in the Empire to secure a final and unimpeachable decision. In that matter I have a complaint against the Ministry, but I do not recede in the least from my statement that in regard to any proposal to amend the Constitution to bring about the free circulation of commodities amongst the people the Administration proposing such alteration, if such is satisfactorily worded, will have my humble support. It is necessary, of course - in fact, it is almost unavoidable - for a member of a British Legislature to make some reference to the war. But, before I deal with the matter in a general way, I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence what seems to me a very practical suggestion in regard to the camp at Broadmeadows. The other day I met a very successful mining engineer - a man who has made a great deal of money out of mining, and who seemed to be absolutely sure of his facts. Although Broadmeadows is admittedly a very good camp from the practical stand-point, being pretty close to a railway, and having many advantages such as commend themselves to men versed in the military art, still the fact remains that it was not satisfactory in the wet wintry weather we had a month or two ago. The nature of the mud and the lack of drainage added very greatly to the discomforts of men who are going to the front later to supplement the noble efforts of our troops already on European fields. This mining engineer told me that in the Chiltern district there are tremendously large heaps of a very small gravel or rubble which has been well washed because of the mining operations. There is an unlimited quantity of the spoil, and it can be obtained for nothing from the mining companies. A railway, I understand, passes the spoil heap, and the stuff could be brought down to Melbourne on Sunday in railway trucks, and taken by a short line to the camp. The material could be spread to a depth of 1 foot, or, if necessary, 2 feet, over the area of the camp. It would do away with the mud; it would make a splendid ground for the men to walk on to conduct military operations, and in the summer it would not produce dust. There are several honorable senators present who have had to mine for their living who will admit that when such material from deep leads has been well washed, everything likely to bring about dust has been eliminated. </para>

            <para>- I venture to say that before long the question of acquiring in fee-simple a satisfactory training ground for troops in the vicinity of Melbourne will have to be faced. So much for the suggestion which I offer to the Minister for what it is worth. I will now refer to the war, the policy of the Empire in regard to the war, and the policy of the Commonwealth in respect to the whole business. I know that honorable senators kindly bore with me six or seven weeks ago while I addressed myself at considerable length to certain phases of this very important, nay, vital, matter. I must, of course, traverse some of the ground which I then went over, but I hope not to altogether repeat myself, and honorable senators will recognise that great events have happened in Europe since I made my speech. I think I said then that there was a very wide feeling of discontent in the United Kingdom with the Liberal Ministry because of very large sins of omission in regard to war policy. I think I said, to quote my remarks literally, that a terrible indictment was preparing against a Minister, and that some form of political punishment would overtake, if not all, at least some of the members of the Ministry. The Ministry has been reconstituted, and some of the previous Ministers, if not hurled exactly over the  Tarpeian  rock, have been bidden to escape up the Tiber and hide in the bulrushes till a more convenient political season. They have had to bow before a storm of resentment issuing from the breasts of their countrymen. </para>

            <para>- The one Minister who in the eyes of his countrymen was largely responsible for neglect and unpreparedness on the part of the Empire has ceased to be a member of the Administration. It will be remembered that I very strongly advocated conscription. It is the bounden duty of the white population of this Empire to submit to conscription at the present time. </para>

            <para>- I would not be justified in criticising the Imperial Administration or the war policy unless I was going to apply the moral to our own people, Legislature, and Administration irrespective of party. The moral effect of the introduction of conscription would be great. At the present moment, every European nation allied with us. even the Asiatic nation allied with us, is carrying the cross of conscription. It is carrying that cross up the National Calvary, up the European Calvary; it is making the supreme sacrifice. Many months ago we heard that the small principality of Montenegro had practically exhausted the whole of its manhood.  Servia  has conscription, Russia has conscription, and France has conscription. Italy, regarding whose advent into the field of war we were overjoyed a week or two ago, has conscription, and is prepared to exert the whole of its national might. To-day we hear the echoes of a battle which is assuredly greater than that which took place in Asia Minor some hundreds of years ago, when the greatest of Asiatic conquerors overwhelmed his Turkish adversary, and of which the historian writes, &#34; Two millions of men disputed the Empire of the world.&#34; More than- 2,000,000 of Germans and Aus.trians and Russians are now  disput-ing  the Empire of the world along the River San and in Galicia. Whilst our Allies are making the supreme sacrifice, what do we find one of our Imperial statesmen saying ? I do not suggest that  those  statesmen are not possessed of very great ability, but I do say that they lamentably failed in foresight regarding Germany&#39;s attitude towards our Empire, because only a couple of years ago Germany asked them to give a guarantee of Britain&#39;s complete neutrality in the event of a European conflict. Ought not they to have been able to read the signs of the times ? Ought they not to have recollected the telegram which was despatched by the Kaiser during the South African War? As a matter of fact, they were purblind, and a great responsibility must attach to them in this connexion. I do not care to subscribe to the assertion that they are great statesmen, when I know that only the other day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LloydGeorge</inline> expressed the hope that we would be able to carry this war to a successful conclusion without resort to conscription in order that we might afterwards be able to boast that we had done our part without having made the last and supreme sacrifice. </para>

            <para>- It would not be a proud boast, because it would indicate that we were prepared to witness every other nation of Europe making the last sacrifice, whilst we refrained from so doing. As a matter of fact, I believe that the British Empire, if all its resources were&#39; fully disciplined and thoroughly organized, could beat the German Alliance singlehanded. I honestly hold that conviction. I honestly believe, also, that the Allies would be able to clip the wings of Germany, even if the British Empire rendered no assistance whatever. I believe that France, Italy, and Russia would succeed - perhaps over a long course of years - in breaking the power of Germany and Austria. But is it better <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> us to refrain from conscription in order that we may boast at the end of  the  war that we had not to resort to that supreme sacrifice, or to assure our Allies that we, like them, intend to make this last sacrifice on the altar of liberty? 1 say unhesitatingly that it would be better to adopt conscription, and thus to evidence that there is meaning in our boast that we are prepared to sacrifice our last man and our last shilling m this fight for liberty. </para>

            <para>- And a very good parable, too, although my rendering of it may be a little rusty and mixed. Those who were bidden to the feast made light of it, and went their way, one to his farm and another to his merchandise. Doubtless these individuals would have liked to attend the feast, but they had other interests to engage their attention. The result was that the King, in his wrath, sent out a messenger with orders to bring in people &#39;from the highways and the byways. The concluding phrase of the parable has a good deal of point if applied to our efforts at the present critical juncture - &#34; For many are called, but few are chosen.&#34; I propose now to deal with a question which must arouse the indignation of every well-wisher of his country- </para>

            <para>- What has been the net result of our offerings during the past nine or ten months? Although our population is absolutely a British one, and although it equals one-tenth of the population of the United Kingdom - admitting that the Imperial authorities have recruited armies aggregating 2,000,000 men - we have not recruited one-half of our proportionate share. </para>

            <para>- Then why all this talk about advertising for recruits at picture shows? Why all this fuss about pictorial displays at newspaper offices and at drapery establishments ? Are these appeals worthy of a great people, making a great effort to preserve the liberty of the world ? I say that they are absolutely unworthy. Only the other day the Minister of Defence said that fresh units will be sent to the front as they offer. Subsequently it transpired that in Victoria there are not sufficient recruits offering to supply the required monthly reinforcements. Is that a fact, or is it not? </para>

            <para>- Is it not a fact that recruiting has fallen off 50 per cent, as compared with the returns for last January ? But I am not here to indulge in recrimination. My desire is to arouse the people of this country, and parliamentarians, irrespective of party, to what I regard as an obvious duty. Honorable senators opposite may hold their party conferences, they may resolve upon devices such as the referendum and recall, they may allow themselves as politicians to be stripped of every shred of responsibility, they may constitute themselves - and this is apparently their ideal of popular representation - delegates, and delegates only; but the people will hold them responsible for any miscarriage in the national plans. They will say to them, &#34; Are you not the persons who appealed to us on the hustings, who claimed to be possessed of ability and of some of the attributes of statesmanship*? Did we not, shortly after the outbreak of war, send you into our National Parliament? Are you not the individuals whom we placed so high? Yet you now turn round and tell us that we should have arrived at another decision, that you did not care to initiate alterations in regard to our war policy because you did not think those alterations would be palatable to us.&#34; Nations will always arraign their leaders and not themselves. For this reason, I call upon the politicians of Australia, irrespective of party, to institute a system which will hearten our heroic soldiers who are sanctifying the soil of the Gallipoli Peninsula with their blood, by assuring them that the whole of their comrades in Australia are behind them, that the nation has seized and grappled with this problem, and that, irrespective of what Great Britain and Canada may do, we have determined to do the right and noble thing. </para>

            <para>- To introduce conscription - to take the men whom I saw at Flemington the other day when I visited the racecourse there. One gentleman remarked to me that three out of every five of the men whom we saw there were of the ideal military age and physique. Yet we are lowering the physical standard and talking of bantam brigades. We are going to appeal for recruits by means of cinematograph films, to send recruiting officers abroad, and to call for men in various ways; but we are going to refrain from asking the people to make the supreme sacrifice because we think the step would be unpalatable to them. I do not deceive myself for one moment. I recognise that if an appeal were made to the people to-morrow they would vote against conscription. But do we imagine that that circumstance will relieve us from the responsibility of instituting a system which in our hearts many of us believe ought to be instituted ? We ought to take occasion by the hand, to recognise that we are not merely parliamentarians, but that we have been elected by the people since the outbreak of the wai, and that, consequently, a very grave responsibility rests upon us - a responsibility which the people, in a few months&#39; time, will not permit us to shirk, and which neither posterity nor history will pardon us for shirking. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and I did. so because the Minister, in introducing, the increased land tax, said it was designed to break up big estates, although it is admitted that it has been ineffectivefor that purpose. If the Government will introduce a taxation measure and&#39; tell us boldly that it is for the purpose of financing the war, they will soon se&#169; where my vote will be. </para>

            <para>- That is a matter of detail. Two of the leaders in another place of the party to which I have the. honour to belong, spoke forcibly, clearly, and most pithily a few days ago in con-  nexion  with the issues of this war. My leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> said he was in favour -of the system of registration, and, with reference to that statement, there are certain phases which I deprecate. When I was speaking some time ago in favour of conscription, my leader here, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> made one or two interjections which he, with his foresight and political knowledge, saw would be useful to me; and one of the Ministers opposite immediately endeavoured to trap him into an admission that he was in favour of the policy of conscription which I was advocating  Precisely the same thing happened in another place when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> was speaking with regard to the system of registration. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> was asked by the Minister of Customs if he was in favour of conscription. I venture to say that the motive behind .those interjections was not too noble, and that the idea was that, after all, the Empire might muddle through without conscription, and that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could, by interjection, be trapped into the admission that they were in favour of conscription, it would prove very good political capital in the not distant future. The suggestion appeared to be  that if the Empire got through, and if Australia got through without conscription, the Liberal leaders could be pilloried afterwards because they had, inferentially, told the people, in answer to interjections from the Ministers,  that they  were in favour of conscription. Now I put it to honorable senators that the time has gone by for political trickery. I must confess that I was somewhat disappointed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> reply. He advocated the institution of the system of registration. For what? Not for conscription, so we are led to believe, but for the purpose of tabulating our resources. Of what earthly use will it be to tabulate our resources if we do not get some definite, concrete result? I care very little what the people say, though I admit I like to stand in people&#39;s good graces,  and I am human enough not to .say lightly anything that might be disapproved by those who return me to Parliament. But I am always sure of myself and of my duty. When all is said .and done, I am satisfied that conscription is one of the things needful for the Empire in this crisis. I must confess, there fore, that I was  somewhat  disappointed with the reply given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> at this juncture in the nation&#39;s history. I am disappointed that he did not boldly say that he was in favour of the policy of conscription as a logical sequence to the policy of registration. I have read, as commentaries on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine&#39;s deliverances, very able leading articles in the two morning newspapers of this city. They applauded what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> had said, and they indorsed what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine had said ; but, notwithstanding my admiration for the sentiments contained in the articles, I regretted that, after all, they dealt only in vague generalities and platitudes. They agreed that we must do everything we can to secure victory for the Empire in this crisis. But why did they not particularize ? What are we going to do to-day ? One advocated that recruiting officers, and the other that politicians, should do the &#34; stump.&#34; Politicians are supposed to be valueless, and their utterances, as a rule, are not supposed to carry much weight, but in connexion with this matter it is fondly hoped that the politician will succeed in charming the recruit from his lair. Are these all the suggestions that are available? Why not give the lead and show the Empire what the people of Australia are determined to do in this crisis? Never mind what they are doing in Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere. They are doing very well in South Africa, where one of the greatest men in British history has appeared lately. Never mind also what they are doing in Trinidad. Let us do the best we can in Australia. I want to know from the Minister of Defence if he can depend upon so many men from Australia twelve months hence without conscription. I know, of course, there is the fear that those responsible for the advocacy of conscription may later on be relegated by the people to the cold shades of Opposition. But we have a great responsibility, and we must discharge it. I make the statement without any qualification that, in order to put victory beyond all possibility of doubt, it is essential for the Commonwealth of Australia and the whole of the British Empire, in regard to its white population, to adopt conscription, to enable the authorities mathematically to know the number of troops that are to be sent forward, say, five, six, or ten months hence. There is something very slipshod in the whole business of the voluntary system. Lloyd George, whose name has often been introduced here, is supposed to have made a revelation in one of his speeches in Liverpool a few days ago, when he told the people that more munitions were required. We have been led to believe that there has been a great awakening, and that the people are now addressing themselves energetically to remedying this state of affairs, which is admitted to be unsatisfactory. This brings to mind an anecdote I once read about an unfortunate Hebrew who was assaulted by a youth. When the latter was asked the reason for the assault, he said it was because he had ascertained the connexion of the Jewish race with the Crucifixion. When he was informed that that had happened over 1,800 years ago, his excuse was, &#34; Oh, I only heard about it yesterday.&#34; Did it take Lloyd George to tell the people of the Empire that the armies were short of munitions, and that the manufacturing establishments of Great Britain were not doing all that might have been expected ? How many months ago is it since we read in the papers that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> French had made the appeal for munitions, munitions, and ever more munitions? He paraphrased the utterance of a great French patriot who advocated in the face of all Europe, &#34; Audacity, again audacity, and always audacity!&#34; I recommend audacity to the politicians of Australia. The people of Australia would not censure them because of the magnitude of the national effort. If the war ends in five or- six months, any number of men who might then be in training need not then go to the front, but could be discharged, all the better for the training they had received. We owe it to those brave men who are fighting on Gallipoli Peninsula to consolidate and extend the conquest so heroically begun. We are reading in the papers that there are indications that they are looking over their shoulders and asking what the people of Australia are doing to support them in an undertaking which a few months ago would have been regarded as miraculous, namely, that Australian troops should proceed to the conquest of Byzantium. Are we not going to show those men that we intend to stick at nothing to insure that their action shall be crowned with the green laurel of final victory? It is incumbent on our leaders to speak without equivocation and without reserve- to hit out and do something that will nerve the Australian people to prepare for&#171; their great task, the importance of which has not been realized up to the present. If conscription is not indorsed by the Administration - and I promise them that if they indorse it, my humble support shall be given to them, and they shall be held justified in the eyes of the Australian people, so far as my poor efforts to justify them can go - if, in despite of everything I can say, of the trend of events, and of events which ought to appeal to what I may call the almost insuperable stupidity of some politicians in the Old Country, they still  adhere to the voluntary system, there is on !v one appeal that Ministers and the Parliament can make to the citizens of the Commonwealth, and that is, &#34;Come! We want you, and if you come not we will take you.&#34; That is the way to talk to them. There is not going to be any -cajoling or lip-service so far as I am concerned. There is to be no bowing and scraping, no tendering of a cigarette to a man to induce him to join the Forces, nor is there going lo be any alluring poster such as will appeal only to the impressionable and the ignorant. There should be a stern-lipped announcement to the people that herring-shoals of men and mountains of munitions are required. After all, it is the men who are going to count, and the men who are most resolute. We should not, however, attach too much importance to the mathematical argument. There are men abroad who say, &#34; There are 200,000,000 or 250,000,000 of the Allies, and 130,000,000 of Germans and  Austrians,  with 16,000,000 Turks. We have two to one, and are sure of the advantage.&#34; That is a most dangerous argument to use.. Napoleon said something of the same sort. At that time the population of the United Kingdom was about 15,000,000, and the population of France over 30 000,000. Napoleon said, &#34; With 30,000,000 of Frenchmen and 15,000.000 of Englishmen the issue cannot be doubtful. History repeats itself . Rome destroys Carthage.&#34; But the modern Rome did not destroy the modern Carthage. The mathematical argument was found to be fallacious. We have to bear in mind that there are diversities of  language  amongst the Allies, and even amongst the soldiers of our own Empire, whilst we have in the German Empire alone, in addition to the most dangerous and almost fanatical race solidarity, a people numbering 70,000,000 speaking the one language. They are a people the best educated in Europe - although their education has been perverted - particularly in the line of science applied to industry. At the same time they are most fanatically misled in their worship of force, and their endeavour to make their race triumph over the races of every other European country. They are a most tenacious and resolute people. They are materialistic fanatics. I say, therefore, that we should not place too much reliance upon the mere mathematical argument, but we should get our men out and put them through their discipline. We shall find rifles for them later on. I shall not deal with the Small Arms Factory at the present time, because if it were working up to three times its present capacity it would take many years *o  fully  arm the great Australian Army thatis already in embryo. We can get thu necessary rifles for our men. The seas are open, the ways of commerce are free, and we can get the rifles from America or somewhere else. Our country lads do not require much instruction with the rifle. They shoot with the gun and with the pea-rifle, and I guarantee that any Australian youth with three or .four days&#39; instruction, even at my hands, will be able to hit the target within any reasonable range at least every other shot. Let us drill the men and teach them all the military evolutions. We can find rifles for them when they are required. Let us get into the ranks the men who at present, owing to reasons that have been spoken of, are hanging back, and we shall then know with mathematical accuracy the number of men we shall be able to send to the front at any given time throughout the currency of the war. I again, in sorrow, and with no regard to political caution, confess that I am speaking for myself, and that I have no warrant to speak thus on behalf of the Liberal party. I am not a leader of the Liberal party. I am only one. of the units in its ranks. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that. I speak when occasion requires, with the &#39; full sense and recognition of &#91;138&#93; what I believe to be my duty in a time of national crisis. I am speaking out of the fulness of my heart, not because I seek praise or fear blame, but because I believe that what I have urged should be done is the right thing for us to do. If we give a lead to the Empire, it will supplement in the mind of the world the fame and valour of our soldiers, and we shall put the fear of God into the hearts of any would-be invaders of Australia in the future. Let us be iron men. These are iron times, times for iron opinions and iron sacrifices. Therefore I make an appeal, not only to the Government, not only to my own political leaders, but to the people of Australia, who will in the long run charge us with the responsibility of urging them to make the greatest efforts of which they are capable, to make the most earnest of all sacrifices, to doubt nothing at all, but dare everything, and go on inflexibly to that goal where victory is to be had, and secure a triumph for the benefit of the Commonwealth and for those who, in after years, will be our successors and the representatives of Australian citizenship in this National Chamber. </para>

I would point out to the honorable senator that these Supply Bills are the only Bills upon which a discussion is permitted on the first reading. The object is to enable honorable senators to discuss matters which are not relevant to the Bill itself, and which they might have no other opportunity to ventilate. . If the honorable senator wishes to discuss a mere detail of the Bill as to the amount which may be put down for contingencies, I suggest to him that such a matter could be much more effectively dealt with in Committee, when he may receive a reply from the Minister concerned, and will have an opportunity, if necessary, to continue the discussion. It seems to me an abuse of the standing order passed to permit of a discussion on the first reading of these Bills upon matters that are not relevant to the measures themselves to enter upon the dis, cussion of small items appearing in the schedule. </para>

I have seen a number of the advertisements in the Home newspapers, but I have never seen one yetwhich puts the real conditions of Australia fairly before the British public.

            <para>- In my opinion, there is no occasion whatever to advertise the resources of the Commonwealth at the present time. They are sufficiently well known to the British public. My objection is that the advertisements do not put the true position before people con,templating coming to Australia. I understand that most of this money is expended in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth with a view mainly to induce British people to come and settle in Australia. </para>

            <para>- That is so; but I wish the British people to be made to clearly understand, even if the VicePresident of the Executive Council does not, what confronts them when they come here. I find, that it is a most difficult matter for any one desiring to settle in this country to secure land. In the State of New South Wales many eligible citizens have been going round, not for one year, but for year after year, vainly trying, owing to the land system in force there, to secure homestead blocks. There are many in Australia who are still looking in vain for an opportunity of that kind. It is not fair that the people of Great Britain should be misled in this matter. We ought to tell them of a case which occurred in New South Wales only a few days ago, where for one block of land there were more than 640 applicants. Only one of these secured the block, and the rest had to go away disappointed. </para>

            <para>- That may be one reason, but the fact remains that 640 eligible persons- applied for the one block. It is also a fact that the State Governments do not make land available for settlement as they ought to do. The facts should be made known far and wide, and intending immigrants should be informed that it is most difficult and most costly to secure land for settlement almost anywhere in the Commonwealth. I have mentioned a case which came under my notice only a few days ago, but it is typical of what is constantly occurring in New South Wales. When we come to consider the position which confronts the artisan and labourer invited to come to Australia, what do we find ? Around the large cities, townships, and villages throughout the Commonwealth the land is held by people who are hanging on to it with a view to obtain a higher price than they gave for it. It is quite impossible for an ordinary worker to secure a piece of land sufficiently large to build a home upon anywhere around the city of Syd- ney, and possibly the same may be said of Melbourne, at less than &#163;2,000 per acre. </para>

Land cut up into blocks 100 feet deep, and sold at &#163;5 per foot of frontage, is worth about &#163;2,000 an acre, which is about the general price of land around Sydney to-day. Every time the High Commissioner advertises for immigrants, he should be instructed &#39;to proclaim that no workmen will be allowed to settle in or around any metropolis in Australia and purchase land at a less price than &#163;2,000 an acre. </para>

            <para>- We know that immigrants generally stop in the largo cities. The other day, when speaking at &#91;138&#93;- 2 the Millions Club, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rickards</inline> - one of the gentlemen who devotes his attention to purchasing and cutting up estates in Sydney, is a member- <inline font-weight="bold">-Dr Arthur</inline> urged that we should extend the right hand of fellowship to Italians. I offer no objection to any one coming to the Commonwealth, but I think that it would only be fair if <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> told the Italians the exact conditions which they would find on arriving here. What opening, is there for Italian immigrants in Sydney except to get into partnership with -those controlling the fruit trade? And that is not a very alluring prospect even for Italians. Paragraphs appear ir the press daily  dealing -with the unemployed difficulty in all the States, yet we are urged to vote money for the purpose of enabling the High Commissioner to advertise, inviting more workers to come to Australia. I consider that we should first make provision for the workers who are here, and see that they have employment. We should not spend money inbringing other people .here while we have unemployed in our midst. Let those who are in favour of spending our public funds on bringing people here while re have unemployed on the spot, take the responsibility of doing so. I am not prepared to vote for the expenditure of any further money in this direction. A  sum  of &#163;20,000 is provided for the internment of enemy subjects. Internment of enemy subjects is the correct course to follow, but it is extraordinary that we cannot find some suitable employment for those that are interned. I do not know how the Germans are treating the British interned in Germany, but I should say that the cost per head of the internment of British subjects in Germany does not approximate the cost per head of the internment of Germans here. I suggest that the Government should have inquiries made in order to see whether it is possible to employ these people at some useful work during the period of their internment. I am <inline font-style="italic">nob prepared to</inline> say in what direction this employment should be found for them, but I may tell the VicePresident of the Executive Council, who interjects, that while these enemy subjects are idle they have to be supported in idleness by the workmen of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I have not called for more than one return. We provide the Land Tax Commissioner with &#163;80,000 &#39; for the control of his office, and this year we anticipate a revenue of &#163;2,700,000 from the land tax. The cost of collecting is something under 3 per cent., which no doubt is very economical. &#39; It has been represented to me that it is the custom of the Department to employ temporary clerks for twelve months, and then discharge them with only nominal notice, such as two days. A case of a married man has been brought under my notice. He was employed for twelve months, and two days prior to the expiration of that period he was informed that his services would be dispensed with, though single men temporarily employed in the Department have been kept on for two or three years. I shall be glad if the Minister will make some inquiries into that matter. </para>

            <para>- I regret that we do not concentrate our attention a great deal more on the war. An effort has been made to show that conscription is necessary in. Australia, but compulsory training being part of the policy of the Government, in a few years we shall find that every .able-bodied man in the &#39; Commonwealth will be trained. Already, as a result of the training our young men have enjoyed, 10,000 or 11,000 of them have gone to the front, so that we have done very well in this respect. To secure and train and equip 100,000 men is not an easy matter. A few months ago neither men nor officers nor equipment - were available, and the Defence Department has done remarkably well to bring about the training and equipment of such a large number of men within a few months. I do not say that there have been no mistakes. We have never yet seen a war conducted without blunders. The Defence Department has done its best, and at this juncture there is not the slightest occasion for the Government to take the advice tendered to them this morning by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and the little crowd of anonymous correspondents who fill several columns of those newspapers. It is a pity that the very salutary provision in the Electoral Act, compelling the signing of articles, is not in force, because then it would be seen that the opinion expressed in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is only that of one man, and is worthy of no more respect than that of any other citizen. The same may be said in regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and all the other newspapers advocating the same line of policy. I am satisfied that the present Government are well able to conduct the affairs of &#39; the Commonwealth,  and that they will leave undone nothing Australia can do in order to take its full part in the conflict now raging on the .Continent of Europe. </para>

          <para>. - I appreciate the opportunity that a Supply Bill gives to make reference to subjects which in ordinary circumstances honorable senators are precluded from discussing. I am very glad to say that I appreciated &#39; most highly the speech - in fact, the oration - delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> I appreciated particularly the note of independence which was sounded by him, and were it not that I had a misgiving as to how he will fare in the future with his colleagues, I should be. inclined to applaud him very heartily. He declared out aud out his independence on some points, and his want of allegiance to his party leaders was most noticeable. 1 am afraid that, in referring as he did to the action of his leaders, he has left himself open to a very serious form of censure later. We can all recall very vividly how a prominent member, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, had the independence and the audacity to differ widely from his colleagues, especially on the merits of the referenda proposals, and how, at a later stage- I suppose through the exigencies of the situation - he had to retract every word he had uttered so independently. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> I fear, was forgetful of that incident, and he would seem to rush in where even angels, or Irvines,  fear to tread. If he had seriously watched the progress of the party, and observed the strict discipline which has been exercised over each member of it, and recalled how even the foremost among them has been brought to heel on occasions, he would have thought twice before expressing himself so independently. However, I am pleased that he did. I almost felt that he belonged to the party sitting on your right, sir, because, if there is one characteristic more than another which has distinguished our party, it is that freedom of action which every member of it enjoys outside the policy and the platform which we deem essential. I almost thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> was one of our party, until I remembered where he was standing, and until, of course, he betrayed other evidences of the unfortunate associates he is found in company with to-day. </para>

        <para>What I desire particularly to draw the attention of the Minister to is a rumour which has been circulated in Western Australia concerning what has been called .&#34; the Government stroke &#34; practised on the trans-Australian railway. There are, of course, two opinions held in regard to that matter, just as they are held in connexion with every other such matter. We are told by the opponents of the present system for constructing the railway that the men are not doing a fair day&#39;s work, that they are enjoying conditions which men similarly situated had never enjoyed before, and that, therefore, they should put forward an extra effort in order to merit the <inline font-style="italic">justice</inline> which is <inline font-style="italic">being meted out to</inline> them. In my&#39; tame, I have had a little practice in that class of work. I know some of the men who are employed on this huge undertaking, especially at the western end. From what I know of the men, and from what I have been able to judge of the way in which they carry out their work, I have come to the conclusion that those who circulated this libel or lie about the men were actuated by nothing but interested motives. We know well enough that the policy of constructing public works by day labour is on its trial today, as it has been for many long years, and those who have an interest in bringing about the unpopularity of the system have only to send along a person with instructions to write down the system at so much per day or per week, and naturally he will do so, because he wants a living, like every other man. When the public are asked to believe that the men engaged on the line are not  doing  a fair day&#39;s work, they have, of course, to judge by the results. All that we know, so fair, is that the men are laying a mile of rails per day, which, in ordinary conditions, is a very creditable record indeed. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance from the Assistant Minister, and I believe that similar creditable work is being done on the eastern end of the line. What I wish to emphasize is the systematic - almost the organized - and ceaseless attempt by interested persons to underrate and depreciate the policy of constructing public work by day labour without in- the first place satisfying themselves that they have chapter and verse for their statements. I am acquainted with the men who are working on the line in my State, having moved amongst them in many walks of life, and from the best sources of information I have consulted I am perfectly satisfied that they are putting up a fair day&#39;s work for a fair day&#39;s pay. I can afford to speak in this strain, because I regarded it as my plain duty, when seeking the suffrages of the electors, not to shirk my responsibility in this regard. In every locality I  visited,  even in places where, perhaps, the expression of the view or the sentiment might not be most popular, I never refrained from stating that the man who did not put up a fair day&#39;s work when he got a fair day&#39;s pay was no credit to the Labour party, but rather the enemy of it. I have gone further than that: I have said, not only on the gold-fields, but in centres where, perhaps, one is credited with holding very wild opinions, that the man who, when receiving a fair day&#39;s pay, did not put up a &#39;fair day&#39;s work, was identical in character with the sweating employer who would endeavour to get the biggest day&#39;s work for the lowest possible reward. The two characters are interchangeable. After having tested my popularity for what it was worth, I feel that I have all the more warrant for expressing the opinion now that the Federal Government are getting a fair measure of work from the men employed on the western end of the transcontinental railway for the wages and conditions which they enjoy. In regard to the Commonwealth &#39;Bank - an institution which was brought into being by the Labour party - I feel that Western Australia has been somewhat neglected. I am not thoroughly conversant with the amount of control which the Government exercise over the Governor in regard to the branches which should be established; but I notice that in Western Australia - a State which covers an area equal to a third of this continent, and contains a thriving, virile, and intelligent population - only one branch of the Commonwealth Bank has been established. I do not intend to decry Tasmania, but I understand that in that State at least two branches of the Commonwealth Bank have been established. I can only congratulate the Tasmanians on their good luck, and deplore our own very indifferent luck in having only one branch of that beneficent institution. I use the words &#34; beneficent institution,&#34; because it is a Bank which is going to stay. </para>

            <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was discussing the position of the Commonwealth Bank in Western Australia, and while I am not prone to complain of the treatment extended to that State - because its people are usually very indulgent -  -in  the present instance there appears to be substantial reason for inquiry into its position. We have established in Australia a Commonwealth Bank, an institution which is conferring far-reaching benefits upon every section of the community. Those who are engaged in commercial pursuits as&#34; well as those who are engaged in primary industries have already derived great advantages from it. But Western Australia possesses only one branch of this  institution.  whereas other States possess more: The one branch of the institution established in the State .which I represent is to be found in Perth. There are other populous centres in Western Australia which have no branch at all. I believethat these places have equal, if not superior, claims to those of populous centres in other States where branches of the Bank have been set up. In Tasmania, for example, there are at least two branches of this institution. </para>

            <para>- The Commonwealth Bank will do well wherever it may be established. All the dismal prophesies to the effect that this institution contained the germs of disaster have been utterly falsified by time. Launceston contains about 20,000 inhabitants. But Fremantlepossesses a very much larger population. Yet the former place has a branch of theCommonwealth Bank, whereas the latter has not. Then there is no branch of theBank in large centres like the Boulder and Kalgoorlie, which boast a population of 30,000 souls. I mention these facts with a view to securing a readjustment of the ill-balanced disposition of the Bank&#39;s branches up to date. I am quite aware that the relationship between the Commonwealth Bank and the Government is very nicely adjusted. But I believe that when this matter has been brought under the notice of the Government they will, in turn, direct the attention of the Governor of the Bank to it, with a view to insuring to Western Australia a more liberal patronage in the matter of extended accommodation on the part of that institution than it has hitherto enjoyed. </para>

        <para>I was very pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> refer to the decision of the High Court in respect of the Wheat Acquisition Act in New South </para>
        <para class="block">Wales. That decision involves a very serious problem to every State in Australia, not only because it affects a commodity upon which we all depend for our daily sustenance, but because it creates a constitutional position under which, in* due course, an extraordinary power may be placed in the hands of a State Government to the positive detriment of other States. When we entered into Federation, if there was one thing more than another which was clearly understood by the electors, it was that trade and intercourse between the States was to be absolutely free. It never entered the mind of the most suspicious elector that the time would come when through an interpretation of the High Court, a power would be placed in the hands of a State Government which would enable it to hold up a vital commodity of which the other States were in dire need. I recognise that, in acting as they did, the Government of New South Wales were influenced entirely by the interests of their own State. But it must be -remembered that the very essence of the understanding arrived at by the Federating States was that no intervening agency should come between the owner of a commodity in one part of the Commonwealth and its potential purchaser in another part. We have travelled that road for about twelve years. </para>

            <para>- To be accurate, we have trodden it for about fourteen years, and the position to-day seems to be that any State may hold up any commodity of which it may possess a monopoly, if it pleases to do so. Such action is distinctly  unfederal,  and involves an absolute upsetting of the deliberate intention of the electors when they voted for Federation. I feel that the adoption of the referenda proposals will alter this position. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> when he says that it will not. By adopting the referenda proposals the Federal authority will be clothed with at least equal power to that possessed by New South Wales or any other State which may be bent upon following in her footsteps. If the illogical position to which I have referred is to stand, we can easily imagine how any State in the future may act. We can readily conceive of the six States being divided in such a manner as to leave within the bounds of any one of them the .exclusive possession of some commodity which might be common to the necessities of all. In such circumstances it would be competent for the State which had a monopoly of a particular product to hold it until the other States were prepared to pay for it any price which might be asked of them. We have had a declaration on this point. The High Court has spoken. But happily, the last word on the subject has not yet been uttered. I am looking forward with eager expectation to seeing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Bakkap,  and any other advanced Liberal - if it be possible to imagine an advanced . Liberal in the politics of this country - fighting hard to clothe the Commonwealth with a power which will enable it to insist upon the free interchange of commodities throughout Australia </para>

            <para>- It will- have superior power. If it had only equal power, when a conflict arose, the Federal law would prevail. I have a very lively recollection of what the action of New South Wales in the case  of the wheat seizure meant to persons outside its boundaries. When the edict went forth that no wheat was to be shipped, a bargain had already been made by a person outside that State, under which he was to receive a portion of its surplus wheat. </para>

            <para>- At any rate it nas exported wheat to Tasmania. Whether its imports and exports under this heading would balance I do not know. But apart from these considerations, the position is, that while the decision of the High Court stands Free Trade between the States is impossible. The intention of the electors of the federating States has thus been clearly frustrated. I only hope that the carrying of the referenda proposals will clothe the Federal authority with sufficient power to insure that all Australians shall have an equal right to share in any commodity produced within the Commonwealth borders, instead of that right being limited to a privileged few within .a more restricted area. I am hoping that, by carrying the referendum questions, with the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon,</inline> the commodities of the future, that are so vital for the people of Australia, will become common property, and not the property of one particular political area, no matter where it is situated. </para>

        <para>I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> make reference to the necessity of bringing in that era of political good-will and peace amongst all mortals here below. It is a laudable sentiment to desire peace, but it all depends on the terms of peace, and who is seeking it. As a Labour party, we are not here as a peaceable organization. We were called into existence for the purpose of disturbing the existing state of affairs. That is the <inline font-style="italic">raison</inline><inline font-style="italic">d&#39;etre</inline> of our party. We have been told by some of those who take it upon themselves to direct public opinion - including the public journals of this country - that we ought to follow the example set by the Imperial Government. I admit that the Imperial Government have provided some good examples on occasions-, and recently they have formed a National Cabinet for the great purpose of bringing this war to a happy conclusion. But I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that, while he is asking for peace and good-will, and suggesting that we should set aside all political differences, his party did not do much to give effect to that precept in days gone by. Of course I can quite understand the reason for his advice now. But when his party were in power, before the last election, did they talk of burying the hatchet? Of course they did not. The war was then in progress; the Fusion Government were in power, and they went to the country on a policy which was radically different to ours., We, on the other hand, after asking for a politicaltruce, went to the country on a definite policy, and with clear-cut lines dividing us from the Fusion party. They fought us on every item, and in their programme were some of the most contentious proposals ever included in any reactionary policy. And now they say, &#34; Let us have a truce.&#34; The Fusion party would not hear of a truce before the elections on 5th September, and we beat them in such a way that there is not a trace of them left on the political horizon. Even later, the State elections have brought more success to the Labour party, with the result that there is now only one State left in the control of our opponents. Victoria now stands out like a gaunt black stump on a landscape that has been swept by a bush fire, and I am confident that, after the next political bush fire, even Victoria will return a Labour Government. Members of this party now call for a political truce. Of course they do, because they are in a dependent position, and a truce is always welcome to a person so situated. They are asking us to say &#34; Amen &#34; to everything that is being done in the Old Country; but the party opposite did not do much to preserve that beautiful doctrine of peace and good-will between the two parties. Even when they met their Waterloo on the 5th September they would not bury the hatchet, for, in the by-elections held since then, they have fought the Labour party. We held Bendigo and the Grampians as Labour seats, and the party now seeking to bury the hatchet put men in the field in both constituencies to fight the Labour party. In that way they departed from the example set by the Mother Country, for there seats held by the Ministerialists were not contested; but our opponents in Australia, when they saw the chance of gaining an accession of strength, did not hesitate to put men in the field in Bendigo and at the Grampians. The Labour party were elected upon a distinct set of issues, and the electors will now expect us to give final and full effect to our policy. I am not in favour of any political truce, but, on the contrary, I am in favour of carrying out the policy on which we were elected, and for a very good reason. The electors of Australia have sent us here to do something. They have not sent us here simply to warm our places in Parliament, and leave untouched those reforms for which people have waited so long. We are open and candid breakers of the political peace, for, as I said, we were brought into existence to disturb that peace. Honorable senators opposite know that, so long as they can preserve the existing order of things, even for an hour or a day, or for a month, they are .accomplishing something. Being a party sent here to preserve the <inline font-style="italic">status quo,</inline> it is to their interest to see that nothing is done; but as we have been returned to disturb the existing order of things, it is cur policy to put reforms into operation. </para>
        <para>I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is now in the chamber, for I wish to say that he contributed an interesting discourse in his references to conscription. I was pleased to hear him on this subject, and I may also tell him, if it is any encouragement to him, that I am one who, like himself, is not frightened of words. I do not regard words as bogies, and I *m not afraid to adopt measures, wherever or by whom originated, if I think them to be for the general good of the community. I believe that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;Bakhap</inline> said with regard to conscription &#39;has in it very much food for earnest thought for every member of the British Empire, wherever found, for to-day we are engaged in a war the equal of which has never before occurred. We are engaged in a war with enemy countries which need not have gone to war at all. Germany was securing a peaceful, bloodless victory the world over in the matter of trade, and need not have gone to war at all. She could have preserved her good name and retained the respect and good opinion of the civilized world if only she had stood where she was, and had not drawn the sword. But Germany began by breaking her word, and since then has prosecuted the struggle in a way which could never have been anticipated. She is not careful of her weapons. She grasps weapons from any direction. She has violated every moral code, and to-day retains no vestige of respect throughout the civilized world. Having participated in that struggle, we need now to recast our ideas&#39; radically as to how victory is to be secured. Conscription has no terrors for me. </para>

            <para>- I feel convinced that if a vote were taken of those men whose names are emblazoned in our prints every day, those men whose names appear on the roll of honour, they would vote for conscription, and I believe, also, that the soldiers who are behind the trenches would vote for it. . We must not forget that our liberty is at stake. It has been said that the battles of this country are being fought on the field of Flanders just as effectively as if they were fought on the plains of Bourke or in Western Australia. In the event of an attack upon this country, we would have conscription pure and simple, or its equivalent, so why should we hesitate to resort to that policy which we would have- to adopt if the battles were fought here in Australia instead of Europe? </para>

            <para>- I am with those who stand behind this Government in insisting upon the adoption of means for the purpose of bringing this war to a successful issue. I see nothing wrong about conscription, which, in the abstract, is eminently fair and just. Where is the country whose freedom, honour, and safety are not equally the concern of every man in it, as well as of those who, braver than their fellows, come forward to fight for it? Where is the country which ought not to be defended, and the defence of which is not equally the duty of every individual unit of its population able to bear arms as well as of those who freely offer their lives in its defence ? We know that if our lives and our country were in jeopardy to-morrow we should have to resort to conscription here. If the independence of this country, our hard-won liberty, our free, institutions, our standards of living, everything we hold near and dear, and the security of our Parliaments, are being fought for to-day on the battlefields of Europe, the policy to which we should have to resort if we were called upon to defend those interests here can logically be resorted to to carry on the struggle in Europe. I have been led to speak of this matter because of what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> on tha subject of conscription, and because of a suggestion in his remarks that honorable senators on this side are somewhat chary of pronouncing their opinions on the subject. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the necessity will not arise for a resort to conscription; but I frankly admit that, in my opinion, conscription is honest, .fair, and patriotic in the abstract. It is not the business of any individual, or any political party, to depend upon volunteers coming forward to defend the .country. That is the business of everybody in the country. We should not be influenced by the shibboleth that conscription is of Continental origin, and therefore something to be despised. We should be ready to adopt anything that, in its essence, is fair and just. We should not permit a devotion to the shibboleths of the past to prevent us from adopting the better course. If the Government decide that we should resort to conscription in order to bring the terrible struggle that is being waged in the northern hemisphere to a successful conclusion, they will have no more staunch supporter than myself, in order that we may see the flag we have stood for so long waving over a battlefield of liberty, our free institutions intact, and our independence secured. I hope that our men who are going to the front will be provided with everything necessary. I realize the difficulties attendant upon the sending of a large expeditionary force to another country, and how they must strain the resources of such a small population as we  have  here. At the same time, we may be compensated by the results of the efforts of Australians in the past, and particularly by their exploits in the Turkish Peninsula, where our soldiers have ful filled to the utmost the highest expectations that were indulged in regarding them. In Western Australia I heard some references to a lack of provision in the matter of equipment. Some persons were loud in complaint on that score. So far as I could form an opinion from what I heard from volunteers there, I was led to the conclusion that, in the matter of clothing particularly, there is something lacking in the equipment provided for volunteers in the western State to-day. Having mentioned the matter, I am sure that the Minister of Defence will see that every reasonable effort is made to encourage those men on the honorable path they have chosen until a final victory for the Allied Nations is reached in the struggle in which they are now engaged. </para>

          <para>. - A few statements have been made during the debate to which I should like to reply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in  His  criticism as to. the expenditure at the Broadmeadows Camp, pointed out that, in view of the large expenditure that must take place there, we ought to acquire a permanent camp. No doubt it would be desirable to have permanent reserves in all the States for camps of training, but it has to be remembered that that would be a very costly matter. These camps must be somewhere near railway lines, and if we are to acquire the large areas which are necessary for military training, they will represent a very big capital sum that will be practically lying idle, because it will be impossible for us to utilize the land for any other purpose. Under existing conditions we can go out into the country districts and obtain land eminently suitable for camps of training on very reasonable terms. The Defence Act gives us authority to take any land for the purpose, and what we do is to select a suitable site for a camp, and notify the owner of our intention to make use  of it for that purpose. At the conclusion of the camp, the damage caused by the holding of the camp on the land is assessed by a committee, and the owner is compensated accordingly. Necessary repairs to fences and that kind of thing can be, and are, done by the Department. By the adoption of this course the cost to the Department represents a sum which is very much less than would be the interest on the capital sum which would be lying idle if we bought huge areas of laud for training camp reserves. <inline font-style="italic">J.</inline> agree that, if we had the money to spare, it might be advisable, despite the cost, to secure such reserves, especially in some of the more populous States. The Government of which I was a member made a start in that direction by acquiring the Liverpool Manoeuvre Area, and that involved a big expenditure. There have been so many matters upon which it has been absolutely necessary to spend money recently that we have had none to -spend upon matters which could be left for a few years, and for which it has been possible to find an effective substitute. </para>

            <para>- Only to a limited extent. When the camp .is at an end, stock may be turned on to the land, and in such circumstances we have used the Liverpool Manoeuvre Area for grazing. The owner of the land on which the camp has been established at Broadmeadows very generously offered us the free use of it, and permitted us to do what we pleased there. He Has been very loyal to the terms of his offer. To acquire that land merely because we are using it at the present time for a camp of training would not be a very wise proceeding. It is close to a very large city, the population around it is increasing, the area is not sufficient for training purposes, and it would be necessary to acquire other vacant land adjoining the site of the present camp. The cost of that land would perhaps be over &#163;20 per acre, and to buy thousands of acres of land at such a price would be a costly proceeding. </para>

            <para>- We have the use of the land at Broadmeadows free of charge. Owing to the wastage of the tents, it was decided to put up temporary huts, which will be available for other camps wherever we like to use them. They will not become the property of the owner of .the land at Broadmeadows. They will represent an asset, and will save the Commonwealth a great deal of money in the wastage of tents in the &#39;future, while they will give the men &#39;greater comfort. It .may be said that we shall have to remove roads we put down at Broadmeadows, but I am informed that we shall be able to arrange with the local shire council to take up the roads if we let them .have the metal, so that that work will cost us nothing after the camp is closed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> dealt with the question of volunteers whose services are rejected because of deficient chest measurement. It is an axiom in military matters that it is necessary to have men who are physically fit: A campaign is the greatest test of physical endurance to which the human body can be put. Medical men have laid down what they believe to be the standards for an examination as to physical fitness.&#39; All sorts of amateur advice is given us, whether in regard to teeth, chest measurement, or height. In fact, every person rejected for some physical defect can find a champion ready to prove that that particular defect is no defect at all. If we were to give way to all these representations we should reach the position that we must accept every man who offers. One of the things which hampers an army most in its operations is the problem of dealing with the sick and wounded. That is a sufficiently serious problem when we have to deal with those who, being physically fit, become disabled by sickness or wounds; but how much would the seriousness of the problem be increased if we had an army composed of a large number of men who were physically unfit to start with? At the beginning of the recruiting it was decided, not by me, but by my predecessor, to allow recruiting, not only in the large cities, but in the country. I am mentioning this, not by way of criticism, but as a statement of fact. In order to give residents of the country districts an opportunity to enlist, it was decided to permit of recruiting at&#39; country centres, the mayors of towns and the presidents of shire councils acting practically as recruiting officers, and local medical officers conducting examinations which entitled those who passed to be accepted. </para>

            <para>- It does&#39; not, and for a very good reason. When the first .division went to Egypt, they had not been&#39;, there very many months before we found&#39; a ship coming back with over one hundred men on board who were physically unfit. Upon investigation, it was found that the majority of them had  been passed in the country towns of Australia as physically fit, but they had not complied with the standards laid down by .the regulations. There is a serious aspect of the question which must be considered. We have passed a War Pensions Act, by which the country has undertaken the burden of supporting men who are incapacitated after the war. Many of the men who have come back disclosed physical defects which entitle them to make a claim upon the community to be kept for the rest of their lives as permanently or partially incapacitated.. Medical officers who have examined them since they came back have found evidence that their incapacity is of years&#39; standing. In other words, men were passed into the ranks, and sent on active service, who were never fit for active service, and should never have been passed at all. These men can claim that the country should support, or partially support, them because of their incapacity, unless we can demonstrate by medical evidence that the incapacity existed before the men were accepted. That state of affairs led to a very drastic alteration, and it was decided to regard country examinations for fitness as only tentative, and that when the men reached headquarters they must undergo a second examination by our own permanent medical officers. There has been a tightening up in that respect, and better results are being obtained. </para>

            <para>- They are farewelled because of the impression left by the previous order that acceptance&#34; in the country was not tentative, but final; but I think that people are now beginning to understand that acceptance in the country is not final.

            <para>- The number is not laid down. A soldier must, have sufficient teeth to enable him to masticate his food, which is a practical and common-sense test, and far better than any technical test as to the number of teeth. A man with twenty teeth may have them so placed that he cannot masticate his food, while another with fifteen teeth may have them so placed that he can masticate his food. That is the common-sense test that is applied in regard to the matter of teeth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> spoke of the formation of a Dental Corps. This has been a very much debated question. There was a good deal of departmental opposition to having dentists in any way attached to the Expeditionary Forces; but, having a perfectly impartial mind upon the matter when I went into it, I was satisfied that the policy of having dentists appointed to the Forces at the various bases would be a sound one; and so the policy now being carried out is to have dentists appointed to the bases, not only in Australia, but also in Egypt and wherever the troops move to from Egypt. </para>

            <para>- False teeth are not regarded as a substitute for real teeth. A man in the firing line may lose his false teeth, and if he has not sufficient teeth of his own to masticate his food, he at once becomes inefficient. If, in addition to his false teeth, he has sufficient teeth of his own to enable him to properly masticate his food, he can be accepted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> in his criticism, said that &#34; doctors had received instructions to be more strict, which interfered with recruiting.&#34; I hope that I am not misconstruing the honorable senator, but his remark seemed to inter that instructions had been given to tighten up the medical inspection with the object of limiting recruiting. As a matter of fact, it has not interfered with recruiting. It has interfered with inefficient men being sent to the front, and I have yet to learn that this means interfering with recruiting. Repeatedly, on public platforms, through the press, and in Parliament, the Government have said that  every man who is fit and well and  willing to volunteer will be welcome in the  ranks, and that there is room for him there, and that we shall do our best to train him and equip him and send him to the front. That invitation has been reiterated every time we have touched upon this question. The honorable senator drew a comparison between what Australia has done in connexion with the war and what has been done by other Dominions, particularly Canada. Comparisons are odious; but I make the statement, and challenge successful contradiction of it, that there is no Dominion in the British Empire which has done as much as has Australia. I do not make this statement in any boastful spirit, but I am in a position to know that Australia has done something more than merely contribute her quota to the fighting-line. She has assisted more than one other Dominion. She has not had to ask any other Dominion for assistance in any respect whatever, and she has assisted more than one other Dominion. </para>

            <para>- But Australia was the country of their adoption. The figures quoted by me a few weeks ago show that 70 per cent, of the troops are Australian born. I doubt whether any other Dominion can show the same proportion of native-born. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that the policy of continually decrying what Australia has done, and exalting what the other Dominions h&#39;ave done, is a policy of crying &#34; stinking fish &#34; in regard to one&#39;s own country. I give my meed of praise to all the Dominions for what they have done - they have done nobly and well - but I deprecate any attempt to foul our own nest by invidious comparisons with other countries, especially when comparisons are not based on facts. However, as they have been made. I feel that it is mv duty to challenge them. . I say that a larger number of soldiers have gone from Australia in proportion to her population than from any other Dominion of the British Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has pointed out that, apart altogether from the proportion of soldiers despatched to the front, the service which the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> has rendered in regard to naval defence has also to be considered - a service which has been officially recognised by the British Government as being of a most valuable character. By the organization of the captured German vessels, by the organization of our transport service, and by the co-operation of the Customs Department and the Naval Department, acting with the State Governments in the matter of meat supply, we have been able to render signal service to the Mother Country by providing supplies of food to the British troops in the field. In the same way inversely, we have been able to render assistance to several of the States of Australia by utilizing vessels fitted up to take away our troops for the conveyance of wheat and fodder on their return voyages. The State Governments have expressed their recognition of the service thus rendered to them. Apart from the fighting troops, we have sent to the front a Field General Hospital. It is &#39; not for Australian wounded. We have placed ifc at the disposal of the War Office for the treatment of British wounded. I have not heard of any other Dominion having done the same thing. We have also sent to the Mother Country a large number of nurses, not for Australian wounded, but for British wounded; and the British Government have expressed their appreciation of that act by asking for as many more nurses as we can despatch. I am not saying that we have done&#39; enough, or all that we ought to have done, but I have mentioned these matters in rebuttal of the pessimistic criticism that we have heard. We are told of men, awaiting medical inspection, having been kept stripped for two hours in the cold. No system on earth is fool-proof, and I suppose that in the Defence Department we have as big a proportion of fools as any other Department has; but is it believable that a medical officer who knows the effect that keeping a man stripped in the cold for two hours would have on the man&#39;s health would do this? To me it is unbelievable. I cannot see the necessity for it. A man submitting himself for medical inspection can strip in less than ten minutes. What could be the object of remaining stripped for two hours ? I have not met Australians who would consent to remain stripped in an inspectionroom for two hours. Fancy, asking Australians to remain stripped for two hours in the cold for some medical officer to inspect them at his convenience I There would be a riot in the inspection-room if such a thing were expected. I have seen medical inspections in progress. There are usually fifty men awaiting inspection. A sergeant-major calls them into a room four at a time. These four strip in. turn and pass, into the room where the medical officers are conducting their inspection, and from that room they pass out and dress, while another four are being examined. It only takes a few minutes to inspect each man, and the tale we have heard seems to me unbelievable. But I know that anything can be said. One has only to read the letters appearing in the press to see that. If I were to believe half of what they say I should be in a lunatic asylum, but there are plenty of good people who really believe that all these things are true. A lady who takes a leading part in a certain organization waited on me. the other day, and the interview lasted for three-quarters of an hour. She gave me case after case of terrible hardship and absolute injustice, and after each case was mentioned, I would say. &#34; Will you give me the name of the man who suffered this injustice?&#34; She would reply, &#34; I cannot give the name because I, do not know who he was.&#34; Then J would say, &#34; Can you give me the name of your informant, so that I can get from him the name of the man who has suffered ?&#34; She would say, &#34; I do not think that he would like his name mentioned.&#34; And so I went through the whole list. There was only one case in which I could get any name that would enable me to make an inquiry. I said to this lady, &#34; How on earth do you ex-  pect  me to find out anything if you come here and make these startling statements but will not tell me the name of a man who has suffered, or the name of a man who has given you information? Where am I to start ? Am I to say to the members of the Military Board, &#39; There is a private somewhere in Australia in one of the camps who was subjected to suchandsuch treatment. I do not know in what  company he is, or whether he is in the Light Horse, the Artillery, or the Infantry. I do not even know his Commanding Officer. But I want you to make inquiries and find out whether it is true &#39; ?&#34; This is a sample of some of the criticisms that have appeared in the press It seems to me peculiar that the very people who take up this gossip and this tittle-tattle, and these yarns and tales, will in the next breath assure one that they are anxious to assist recruiting. We have had the spectacle of one man writing to a member of Parliament and telling him that a sentry had been found dead with his face in the mud, and that another had been found dead at his post. </para>

            <para>- We have investigated that case. There is not a shadow of truth in it. No sentry has been found dead anywhere at his post, and so far as we can find out, every man who has died in the camps has died in his bed. However, that story was mentioned not only in Parliament but also in the press throughout Australia. We expect our young men to read these things, and to believe that a horrible state of affairs exists at Broadmeadows and at other camps, and that recruits are so neglected and so ill-used that healthy men who have just passed a medical examination will fall dead at their posts. We not only invite them to face the bullets, but we also warn them that they will run the risk of suffocation by being smothered in mud. Then we wonder why recruiting is not the success which it ought to be. If those who spread these stories really wish to assist recruiting, they will get at the truth.  of them before they give them voice. I may say that I have sent the papers on to the Attorney-General, and if :he says that there is a good case, we will give the writer of the letter an opportunity of discovering where a sentry was found with his face in mud. </para>

            <para>- An obligation rests upon public men who receive statements to see, before giving them publicity, that there is some truth in them - at any rate, a semblance of truth. Take the campaign in regard to the Broadmeadows Camp. I am prepared to admit, as I did to-day, that after a heavy rain it was anything but a desirable place. There was a tremendous amount of mud, and very disagreeable mud it was. But those of us who have lived in the country know that mud is always prevalent after a heavy rain like that which fell at Broadmeadows. You can find plenty of mud without going outside the boundaries of municipalities where you have roads and footpaths. The grumbling about the mud did not come from the men. They grumbled when they were taken away from Broadmeadows. They grumbled far more at their removal than they grumbled at Broadmeadows itself. The grumbling came from persons, who, perhaps with the best intentions, but with very little experience and knowledge, went out there, and, having been used to comfortable homes, with nice beds, and all that kind of tiling, saw men sleeping on the ground with a waterproof sheet under them, and thought that the men were being very hardly treated. We want to encourage recruiting. We do not wish to make feather-bed soldiers. Our men will have to undergo hardships on the field of battle - far greater hardships than they undergo in camps of training. I am not one of those who believe that we should not give the men any comfort. We should give them every comfort we .can; but it should be the comfort of the camp, not the comfort of the drawing-room. The men are in camp&#39; being trained for the grimmest test of human endurance. They want comfort, but not coddling ; and they do not expect it either. I believe that in Australia there are still many thousands of fit men who will come forward at the call of the country. Two very interesting speeches have been delivered here to-day on the question as to whether the time has arrived when we should have conscription. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> was certainly a very forcible utterance; but I think that I am not making any undue reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> when I express the .belief that his was even a more forcible utterance, because of one argument which appealed to me very strongly. He pointed out that, having established conscription in the Defence Act for the protection of Australia, it would not &#39;be a wide extension of that principle to establish conscription for the defence of Australia on the battlefields in Flanders and at the Dardanelles. That seemed to me a very powerful argument ; but, whilst I admit the force of the arguments put forward, I do not admit that the time has arrived for such action, or that the circumstances would justify Australia in resorting to a system of conscription. As to whether the time has arrived in Great Britain I am not com:petent to say. I have every confidence that the men who are handling its public affairs now will take the step if they think that it has become necessary. My personal opinion, which is formed on, perhaps, somewhat slender ground, is that if conscription were the rule in Great Britain to-morrow, the Government would not be able to send another thousand soldiers into the fighting line. That, I repeat, is ray opinion, though it may be wrong I do not believe  that those who are in charge of affairs in the Mother Country would hesitate to bring forward a proposal for conscription if they believed that it would result in putting into the field an increased number of men. If we can judge correctly from what we have read in the press, what is required more than anything else is munitions of war. </para>

It is not a thing which can be called into existence in a few short days, or weeks, or months, or even years.. It is a thing which has to be planned and organized years ahead, and the position in which the British Government finds itself is the same as that in which we find ourselves, and that is that we are wise after the event. </para>

            <para>- That is the honorable senator&#39;s opinion. As one of those whose actions&#39; are called in question by this criticism, I wish to say that some of the things which have been done in the past, and which are proving of incalculable value to-day, were bitterly opposed by the very men who are now uttering the criticism. Only for the establishment of the Defence factories . we would not have been able to send soldiers away, but some of the very men who are now criticising me and my administration are amongst those who, when the proposals to establish the Defence factories were first brought forward on the Estimates, condemned them, and would have defeated them if they had had the power. </para>

            <para>- The factories were established by the mere fact that the Labour party had a majority in each House; otherwise they would not have been in operation to-day, and we should not have been able to equip men in the time we have. There has been a considerable amount of criticism in regard to the Small Arms Factory. One Of the first investigations I made after coming into office was in .regard to that factory. I found that up to that time no inquiry had been made as to whether &#39; it could work a double shift or not. I sent for the manager, and told him it was the desire of the Government that the factory should turn out every rifle of which it was capable. I asked him whether it was not possible to turn out more rifles by employing two shifts, and I have the departmental record of his answer in which he said it was impracticable. He stated that it would take a considerable time to work up to a stage when we could employ two shifts, and he gave other reasons, which I cannot mention on the floor of this Chamber. </para>

            <para>- Of course they are handicapped, and naturally so. &#34;We are all handicapped when we are discussing a question of this character. I recognise that the members of the Opposition, if they are loyal to the country, are handicapped in criticising me, and I am handicapped in replying to their criticism. That was not the only time on which I went into the question of a second shift. On several occasions I revived the matter, and later I went to the factory and investigated the question, not merely by taking the manager&#39;s opinion, but by ascertaining the views of the employees, from the manager down to the men, and I came away absolutely convinced that at that stage it was impracticable to put a second shift into operation. At the same time I again impressed on the manager that all his efforts were to be directed at the earliest possible stage to bringing in a second shift. He has been working along that line and, I believe, loyally acting up to my instruction, and now the time is approaching when, even if the question had not been raised, a second shift will be installed, and it is just at the time that this criticism is brought forward. Why? In order that when a double shift is working our critics may be able to say, &#34; We forced the Minister of Defence to have a double shift.&#34; </para>

They believe that it is feasible, and so do I. But I recognise, and have recognised all the time,&#34; that one of the principal objections which obtained up to a certain time was removed before the Committees commenced their investigation, and removed as the result of the action taken by myself. </para>

            <para>- We took further action. Recognising that the manager might not have been carrying out my instruction to work a double shift at the earliest possible moment, I determined to get independent expert testimony as to what was being done and what ought to be done. We approached the Government of Victoria, and asked that the manager of the Newport workshops, who is a very capable man, should be allowed to go up to the Small Arms Factory to investigate the question. With that gentleman we sent the best expert we had in the Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Harding,</inline> the Inspector of Ordnance Machinery, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis,</inline> the Director-General of Public Works in New South Wales, recommended to us by the State Government, and as  chairman  of the Committee  Colonel Dangar,  the Chief of Ordnance. They visited the factory, interrogated the manager, and sifted the matter thoroughly there. What did they say? They stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline> was absolutely justified in the statement he made to me, that at that time a double shift was impracticable. I have only received that report within the past two days.&#34; It contains certain information regarding the output of the Factory, its possible output, and the amount of material available, which I cannot make public; but with the excision of that information I am going to make the report available to Parliament, so that honorable senators may know exactly what this committee of experts have said in regard to the position. As to the time within which a double shift can be worked, the committee point out that several things yet require to be done. They recommend how these things should be done, what steps should be taken to do them, and they also give an estimate of the time within which the double shift can be worked, and of the period which will elapse before we shall get the full benefit accruing from that double shift. I have issued instructions to the manager of the Factory that he is to follow the lines which have been laid down by this committee. 1 venture to say that no person could have done more under the circumstances. The manager of the Factory is not only well qualified for his position, but that he is believed to be qualified by persons who have had previous experience of him is shown by the fact that he has been asked to take charge of big works which are engaged in  turning out arms for the Allies. That is the best testimony as to whether or not he is thoroughly competent. &#34;What was the alternative open to me? Here was a man in a responsible position who tendered me certain advice. Was I to turn round and say to him, &#39; &#39; You are the expert, I am the non-expert. But I am also the Minister, and notwithstanding that you say this thing is impracticable, you must do it?&#34; That would have meant that I would have had to give him his walking ticket. I had either to accept his advice or give him his walking ticket. I accepted his advice, because I thought that it was well considered. </para>

            <para>- That question is now under consideration. We have a committee inquiring into it. There are reasons why I cannot disclose the names of its members. Obviously, in a Department like that of Defence, at a time like the present, many of our best technical officers are away. Even those technical officers, whilst they may know .all about a shell itself, may have no knowledge of its manufacture. Consequently, we have called to our assistance a wellknown manufacturer in Australia, who is also a thoroughly practical man, together with the manager of one of our steel works, and one of the best technical officers in the Defence Department. These gentlemen are now investigating the question of the manufacture of shells in Australia. Recognising that we could only partly attend to this matter here, some months ago we sent a technical officer to England. He has been pursuing his investigations there, and he is supplying us with the results of those investigations. The question is not without difficulty. The manufacture of the shell itself is a comparatively simple matter; the difficulty is in regard to the production of the fuse. My information is that prior to the outbreak of the war there were a very few works in the Old Country which produced fuse for the modern field gun. That is where the difficulty arises; but I believe that that difficulty can be overcome. I am hoping that the committee will give us such a report as will enable us to take action very shortly. </para>

            <para>- That matter is being inquired into. We understand that no difficulty will be experienced in manufacturing them at the Small Arms Factory. The particulars in regard to that matter are now being obtained from the War Office. In addition, soon after the present Government assumed office, recognising that our Cordite Factory was only able to manufacture cordite for small arms, we ordered another plant, which will be capable of manufacturing big-gun ammunition. That plant has been under order  for some time, and will shortly arrive here. To-day we axe not only manufac- - luring sufficient cordite for our own requirements, but we are supplying it to another Dominion. We hope very soon to be able to produce sufficient cordite not only for Australia, but for two other Dominions, which, we understand, are willing to get their supplies from us. In these matters we have not been asleep, although ib is not ab all times advisable to proclaim what we are doing from the housetops. </para>

In the immediate future, there is very little prospect of any attack by hostile vessels on Australia. But only a few short months ago that was a possibility. Thus to-day, while it is possible for me to reveal weaknesses, it would have been madness for me to disclose them six months ago.

          <para class="block">Bulb of hearing Victorian opinions, and redding Victorian newspapers, we are api to think that Victoria constitutes Australia. But I would remind . honorable senators that although Victoria is a very important State, it is nob Australia. It is a fact that recruiting has nob fallen off in the other States to the same  extent  that ft has in Victoria. Why?  Be,  cause there has not been the storm of criticism and misrepresentation in the other  States  that there has .been in Victoria. Take the State of New South Wales, &#39; for example. Heavier rain has fallen there than has fallen in Victoria. As a result the men were washed out of their beds one night ab the Liverpool Camp. Yet there was no outcry - no demand to shift the camp. The men came OUt of their tents, gob their clothing dry, and went back without grumbling. </para>

            <para>- I have never denied&#39; that, after wet weather, Broadmeadows was -a highly unsuitable place for the camp, because of the presence of so much mud. Bub I do deny the deductions which, have been drawn from that circumstance, namely, that men were suffering great discomforts, that there was wholesale sickness &#39; amongst them, and that deaths and sudden deaths were occurring on every hand. These are the statements which worked damage bo the camp. The young Australian is nob afraid of getting his feet wet, but he does like bo think that he has a chance, of living, and the criticism and misrepresentation to which the Broadmeadows Camp  was  subjected created the impression that if he went there he would be facing sudden death. </para>

            <para>- That statement refers to the officer of whom the honorable senator has spoken. If the Commandant had desired to express the opinion that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, that was his opportunity to do so. The document from . which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> quoted to-day was a report on Sergeant Yidding&#39;s case, in which the Commandant was answering the question of why that man had been dealt with in. a certain manner, while a particular officer had been allowed to go free. The Commandant, in forwarding his reply, said that, in his opinion, the action taken in each case was justified, but there was not sufficient ground for a court martial ; that a court of inquiry had been held, and had exonerated him. I think he said he regretted- </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator will see what was in the mind of the Commandant. If the Commandant thought that there had been a miscarriage of justice, it was his duty to send on his case to the Military Board, and say so. He should have said, &#34;I am sending forward this board of inquiry&#39;s report, but, in my opinion, the case should be reconsidered.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I do not want to pass an opinion upon the matter. The Commandant did say what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> said he did ; but he did not say it when he sent on the report. I do not think his statement is open to the construction which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> placed upon it. It seems impossible to reconcile the two things. </para>

I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> will be very pleased to hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has had to say in commendation of the work already done.
