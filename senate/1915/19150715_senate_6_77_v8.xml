                            <para>- Some time ago, when offers of assistance were made in regard to the supply of munitions, the Commonwealth Government announced publicly that they welcomed all such offers, whether they came from the State Governments, Chambers of Manufactures, Chambers of Commerce, labour organizations, or any other source. The Associated Chamber of Manufactures took action on that suggestion and constituted committees in the States in conjunction with the State Governments, Chambers of Commerce, and labour organizations, all of which I understand are under the proposals adopted yesterday to be amalgamated into one body in each State. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Minister representing the Attorney-General aware that there is considerable delay in circulating, and some difficulty in obtaining, the Statutes of the Commonwealth ? Is he also aware that a considerable number of persons in the community, mora especially lawyers, are anxious to obtain the Statutes as early as possible, and willing to subscribe for them if a system of that kind is adopted? Will he have inquiries made with the view to having the measures furnished to intending subscribers on reasonable terms as early as possible after they have become law? In explanation, sir, I might say that some Statutes of great war urgency, such as the War Precautions Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act, which have been passed during this session, are unobtainable in some States, even by those who necessarily need to have almost immediate recourse to them. </para>

                        <para>.- " I thank the honorable members of the Senate for according me the opportunity of continuing my remarks. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Much of what I said last evening with regard to the proposed amendment of the trade and commerce provision of the Constitution will apply with equal force to each of the other proposed amendments. All that I then said with regard to the difficulties which presented themselves to ' my mind as arising out of a grant of concurrent legislative power to this Parliament and the State Parliaments will arise in a greater or less degree in respect to each of these proposed endowments of power. But with regard to the trade and commerce power, I think that those difficulties will necessarily be much more appreciable than they will with regard to any of the other proposed increases of power. I do not propose to go over what I said last night, further than to remark that if this Parliament enjoys with each of the States a concurrent legislative power in regard to those matters, there will crop up necessarily cases of conflicting laws. There will be the necessity imposed on citizens of inquiring what laws are governing their every-day transactions, whether a State law or a Federal law, or both. If there happens to be both a State and a Federal law governing certain transactions, a further duty is involved, and that is to ascertain whether the two laws are in conflict on any points. If they are not in conflict, both will apply; but if they are in conflict in any particular, only the Federal law will apply in that particular. </para>
                    <para>It may be inferred from what I have said that I believe that there should be some division of power and responsibility. If a Parliament has a legislative power, it is accompanied by a legislative responsibility. I believe that the proper system of Federal government is what was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution, and that is a proper division of power. So far, there has been a line of demarcation between the Federal and the State power. The Federal power, so far as trade and commerce and other matters are concerned, has embraced all matters of a general Australian character, of an Inter-State character, and all matters of a foreign or extra-Australian character. On the other hand, the State power has been bounded by the territory of the State itself. I agree that, in its consequences, that is a division of power which, in certain circumstances, is attended by anomalies; but I believe that, generally speaking, it is the best division of power we can adopt. It is not an artificial division, as has sometimes been said. It is a clear line of demarcation - within the State all belongs to the State Parliament, outside the State itself matters in relation to other States and the outside world " come within the province of' the Federal Parliament. We have very often failed to realize the full extent of our trade and commerce power. It covers every transaction, bargaining, selling, buying, agreeing to buy, and, in fact, every negotiation leading ultimately to such a transaction. The ordinary intercourse between buyer and seller in the most remote township of any State of the Commonwealth is a subject of trade or commerce, so far as the legislative power is concerned. It has often been thought that our powers, by reason of the fact that they deal only with matters that are Inter-State or foreign, have been very limited indeed. A few years ago, when the present Attorney-General occupied a similar position in a previous Ministry, he was asked by his colleague, the then Postmaster-General, a question arising out of a deputation that waited upon the latter, and was composed of representatives of Tasmania in both Houses of the Federal Parliament, and of both political parties. It had been urged upon the Postmaster-General by the members of the deputation that steps should be taken to improve the steam-ship communication between Tasmania and the mainland. At that deputation, I asked that the Postmaster-General would refer to his colleague the Attorney-General the question- of. the constitutional competence of the Federal Government to themselves provide, own, and operate, ' a line of Inter-State steamers. The Minister agreed to submit that question to his colleague, and did so. The  Attorney-General  gave his opinion, and Ministers then in the Senate, at my request, agreed to table that opinion in the Library, -where it remained for some time. The Attorney-General, rightly, as I think, advised that as the Constitution exists at present it is perfectly competent for the Commonwealth Government to establish, own, and control a means of Inter-State communication. </para>

That is a power which is vested in the Commonwealth Government to-day. </para>

                            <para>- The absence of any such complete power on the part of the Commonwealth Government was put forward as one of the reasons for some of the proposed amendments of the Constitution when they were submitted on previous occasions. The question, as I have explained, was submitted to the Attorney-General by the Postmaster-General of the day, and he gave an absolute unqualified opinion which was tabled in the Library in the terms I have stated. I have mentioned this to show that we have not always realized the extent of our present powers. Because, occasionally, in connexion with the line of demarcation that at present exists, anomalies have arisen, we have been too apt to rush to the conclusion that we are exceedingly powerless, while we have not surveyed the full extent of our legislative powers. </para>

                    <para>With regard to the second of the. proposed amendments respecting corporations, what I have contended as to the consequences of concurrent power will also apply. It was in respect to these amendments that, some sessions ago in another place, the Liberal party offered the Government of the day to agree to a certain amendment. That offer was not met. That is the matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> referred last night when he questioned me on the subject. There is one of the strongest of objections to the proposed amendment with regard to corporations. </para>

If our power extended simply to the creation and dissolution of corporations, I think it would meet all that is required. But now we are asking for a power, not merely in respect of the creation and dissolution of corporations, but for their regulation and control while in existence. I will come directly to the reasons why I think this is objectionable. It is obviously a great advantage for this. Parliament to have the power to make laws with regard to the creation and dissolution of companies, so that the laws may be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, and so that the provisions with regard to flotation, the issue of prospectuses and matters made public by those promoting companies, the registration and the holding of shares, shall, as far as practicable, be one and the same for the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Let me come to that later on. It is obviously an advantage that we should have what is called a uniform " company law" throughout the Commonwealth. But at present the company laws of the various States make provision as to how a company shall be originated, promoted, formed, registered, dissolved. These laws are in actual operation, but they do not deal with the actual control of the company's activities during its existence. But we are providing for something more than the creation and dissolution of companies. We are providing for their regulation and control, and we are seeking to give this Parliament power to deal with the activities of companies when this Parliament would not have the power to similarly deal with a private firm or individual engaged, perhaps, in the same enterprise, and probably a competitor of those companies. That is where discrimination will occur, and that was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in one of hi3 judgments. In a case that came before him  it was urged that, under the Constitution as it now stands, the Federal Parliament had supreme legislative power over, not merely the formation and dissolution of companies, but over their operations. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins combated that view by saying that, if that were the case, this Parliament could, by virtue of its powers in respect of companies, so regulate and control them that it could legislate that every director of a company, or of a certain class of company, should be a teetotaller; and that this Parliament could legislate in spheres of activity from which it is at present shut out, by reason of the fact that, if the contention held good, its control of companies would be absolute. That is the power which we are here and now asking for, although I do not say that we are asking that it shall be exercised in that way. </para>

                    <para>We would still have concurrent powers with the States. The States could still legislate, and the Federal Parliament could legislate, and so long as our legislation did not conflict, each would operate; but when they did conflict, the legislation of this Parliament, wherever conflicting, would, of course, override that of the States. Then again would arise those difficulties that I described last night in relation to the concurrent power with regard to trade and commerce. I think the amendment dealing with industrial matters is altogether too comprehensive. It goes too far. I realize, in relation to this, more than in relation to any other power, that the State Parliaments would necessarily be very slow to exercise their concurrent legislative power in this domain at all. </para>

                            <para>- They would, but it being only a concurrent power, I am inclined to think it would often be put forward as an excuse by State authorities that, while they had the power, they hesitated to use it, because it might so happen that the Federal Parliament would pass legislation the effect of which would be to override the State, laws. Then the people who were interested might turn to the Federal authority and would, perhaps, be told that their particular class of grievance existed in only one portion of the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth Parliament would not enter upon legislation which would have to apply to 6he whole of the Commonwealth. I am afraid, therefore, that the people seeking remedial legislation would too often be between pill ar and post. These are my views with regard to one of the difficulties of concurrent legislative power. </para>

                            <para>- I am not downhearted. I have given the matter the most sincere and careful consideration, and I think, honestly, that that is the position in regard to concurrent  legisla-'  t,ion. It is full of pitfalls and dangers of which we may lose sight. There is the difficulty that grievances which require legislation will very often go unremedied, by reason of the fact that either Parliament may be expecting the other to deal with it, or that either Parliament may leave it to the other. If the work be cast on to this Parliament, as some honorable members and honorable senators and members of the public seem to desire, we shall be clogged and congested with work and unable to give it that attention, consideration, and sympathetic treatment that its importance to the community warrants. </para>

                    <para>The same applies with regard to trusts. I can only repeat the arguments I have previously used as to the extension of our power over industrial matters. One could deal at length with any one of these questions, but I am taking each of them .briefly and broadly, speaking, as I said earlier, only in order that it might not be thought that silence on my part meant acquiescence in their passage through Parliament. </para>
                    <para>It will be noted that the railway disputes provision is in terms the same as it was in 1913. It was proposed then that this Parliament should have power to deal with conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes in relation to employment in the railway services of the States. The High Court has decided that we have not that power under the Constitution as it at present stands, because action on our part in that direction would be interference with a State instrumentality. We are endeavouring now to have inserted in the Constitution an express power to deal with that State instrumentality in relation to conciliation and arbitration. We were asked to pass that in 1913 in, I think, the same words. Singularly enough, when, in 1913, we were asked to amend the trade and commerce provision, those who drafted the amendments' inserted the limitation to which I referred last night - trade and commerce generally, but not including trade and commerce on railways the property of a State, except in so far as it was Inter-State or external trade. All we could infer from that was that, when dealing with the trade and commerce amendment, the Government hesitated at taking a trade and commerce power which would affect trade and commerce on the State railways, and that at some later date, or, at any rate, at some different date, in dealing with the conciliation and arbitration power, that consideration did not appeal to them or was overlooked. When addressing the electors in 1913, I said the Government had shown a reasonable and justifiable hesitation in dealing with trade and commerce on the State railways, but that, perhaps because they did not give attention to the conciliation and arbitration amendment at the same time or under similar circumstances, that consideration had, in regard to industrial disputes on State railways, apparently escaped their attention. The Government have now harmonized the two proposals, because we are asked to pass an amendment giving the Commonwealth Parliament full power over trade and commerce without limitation. Obviously that is the corollary to adopting an amendment such as is now before us in relation to conciliation and arbitration on the State railways. This goes to show that between 1913 and 1915 the need for an amendment of the provisions then submitted has again in this case suggested itself, and such need will continue to suggest itself periodically so long as we follow this method of amending the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>The concluding amendment relating to monopolies differs from the proposal of 1913, which provided simply for the nationalization of monopolies engaged in the supply of "services." The present proposal is to nationalize monopolies engaged in the supply of "goods or the supply of services." There was an obvious defect in the earlier proposal from the point of view of its promoters, and I drew attention to it on the platform. My interpretation was challenged, but I think it was admitted afterwards by those who challenged me that I was right. The fact that the Government have now supplied the words which I said then were necessary to effect its own wishes goes to show that the Government themselves think that the earlier proposal was from their own point of view defective. The present proposal is defective to another very serious degree. It provides that the section " shall not apply to any industry or business conducted or carried on by the Government of a State or any public authority constituted under a State." We recently had the experience of the New South Wales Government becoming the monopolist of wheat in its own State, and by reason of that refusing to sell to certain persons in other States. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing the merits or demerits of the case, but there is the position.. The action of the State was challenged by the Commonwealth in the High Court, and we believed that it could be upset as being contrary to the Constitution. We thought the Constitution provided that upon the establishment of uniform duties of Customs and Excise, trade and commerce and intercourse throughout the Commonwealth should be free. The High Court decided that the action of the State was valid, but it did not decide anything in relation to the provision in our Constitution as to freedom of Inter-State trade. The effect ' of its judgment was to declare that a State has the right - sometimes called the right of eminent domain - to acquire any property within ' its borders, and to become the sole owner of it. It had that right before Federation, and it has that right to-day. It will still have that right, even if these proposed amendments of our Constitution be adopted by the electors. If a State has acquired a monopoly of the wheat within its borders, the adoption of the proposed amendments will not have the effect of compelling it to sell. It cannot be forced to sell. The  provision  in our Constitution relating to this matter sets out that trade, commerce, and intercourse throughout the Commonwealth shall be free. But a State cannot be compelled to sell. If it could, that would not be Free Trade. </para>

                    <para>We recently had an experience of the seizure of wheat in New South Wales by the Government of that State. When <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> action was challenged, its position was sustained by the High Court. That tribunal held that such action was not an infraction of the provision in our Constitution relating to freedom of trade. I repeat that we cannot compel New South Wales to sell any commodity that it possesses if it does not wish to do so. If, instead of "the New South Wales Government, a private individual in that State held a monopoly of the wheat within its borders, there is no power in our Constitution to compel him to sell it to persons in Victoria. Free Trade means that there shall be freedom as between buyer and seller, and if New South Wales' were not a seller to outsiders there could be no question of trade involved at all. The Government of that State recently seized the wheat within its borders, and held it. </para>

                            <para>- The proposed amendment of the Constitution in regard to monopolies will not only not meet the situation, but will absolutely strengthen the position of New South Wales or of any other State which desires to be a monopolist in the future. If all these amendments are adopted the experience to which we were recently subjected by the New South Wales Government may be repeated as the result of the action of the Government of any State in connexion with any commodity. The provision in the Constitution Alteration (Nationalization of Monopolies) Bill, instead of curing the evil, will intensify it. </para>

I have noted all the legislation which this Parliament has enacted, and I have observed how it has been dealt with by the High Court. As a result, I say that it is scarcely within the competence of any honorable senator here and now to attempt to remedy these evils. We require a more serious application to the task than we can bestow upon it. </para>

                    <para>Clause 2 of this Constitution Alteration (Nationalization of Monopolies) Bill provides - </para>
                    <para>When each House of the Parliament in the same session has, by resolution, passed by an absolute majority of . its members, declared that the industry or business of producing, manufacturing, or supplying any specified foods, or of supplying any specified services, is the subject of a monopoly, the Parliament shall have power to make laws for carrying on the industry or business by, or under the control of, the Commonwealth, and acquiring for that purpose, on just terms, any property used in connexion with the industry or business. Now, a monopoly may not always be a profitable one. Monopolies will arise in the Commonwealth in connexion with pioneering developments which are not profitable. Take the case of shale oil as an example. To a certain extent some other persons and myself may fairly be included with pioneers of that industry in Tasmania. For various reasons the enterprise was not a success, but at a certain stage of our operations we might well have been regarded as monopolists. Personally I believed - and I still believe - that the deposits of shale ore in my own State are excellent, and of a payable nature. </para>

Let us assume for the moment that the persons to whom I have referred and myself were the only persons in Australia who were producing oil. We would have been monopolists, although we would not have been carrying on a profitable monopoly. Now it is quite possible that in the future the Commonwealth may be invited to take over pioneering enterprises which are unprofitable monopolies. </para>

In the case of those undertakings we have to remember that Australia is, according to what we know at present, a country of infinite resource; that it has as great a variety of mineral wealth as almost any country in the world. Many of those things will be the basic commodities of large industries in the future, and when they are in the most experimental stage men who have gone into them and lost their capital may still be the monopolists, and not having sufficiently tested them may be anxious to get out. Those are matters which the Commonwealth Parliament, even if it does not take them over, will be bothered with. </para>

                    <para>About this time last year the United Kingdom was in the throes of a violent party warfare. It was in connexion with the proposed endowment of the people of Ireland with self-government. The Imperial Parliament had passed a Government of Ireland Bill, and a considerable amount of heat and party passion was engendered. I need not recall the circumstances. The Bill went on to the statute-book, and will come into force on a date to be fixed. I have been looking through the measure. It is a curious thing that the powers it is proposed to give to the Parliament of Ireland are the powers which we are now seeking in many instances by these amendments to centralize in the Commonwealth Government. In other words, we are going back to what they are departing from. They are seeking by devolution to take away from the Parliament of the United Kingdom certain powers and give them to the Parliament of Ireland. Hereafter, possibly they may follow a similar procedure with regard to Scotland, Wales, and England, leaving the Parliament of the United Kingdom a Parliament like this one, to deal with all the general matters and matters of foreign concern. </para>

                    <para>I do not oppose these amendments on the principle that the Federal Parliament of to-day, or of any day, should not be trusted. I do not for a moment suggest that either to-day, or in the future, it should be mistrusted, or that it is likely to abuse any powers. I realize that the Federal Parliament cannot exercise any powers except those which the electors of members of both Houses require it to exercise, and in the way they desire. But I do believe that, with this indefinite extension of powers which is comprised in the amendments, 'the Federal Parliament, so far from abusing the powers, is much more likely to be, unfortunately, compelled to neglect many of the- responsibilities which will fall on it. I believe that, with the added powers, it will be congested with business beyond its competence. </para>

It falls short of what they believe they are achieving. That is my opinion. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I say. I do not suggest that the Federal Parliament of to-day or of the future will abuse these powers. I do not say that, as an institution, it is to be mistrusted or distrusted, but the trade and commerce power and the industrial power are two powers which may be exercised in the most varied way, and under the most complex conditions. Regarding those two big powers in respect to which this Parliament's authority will be absolute, and in that way indefinite, I do believe that the congestion of work will be so great that it will not be able effectively to attend to it. What has been our history? With the limited powers that we already have, what has been the duration of our sessions? It has been longer than those of any State Parliament, and if we are to have this indefinite - this absolute extension of power in some respects - I do not see that there will be any recesses for the Parliament, if we are to apply ourselves property to the problems that will come up for treatment in the sympathetic and adequate manner which they will demand. </para>

                            <para>- I thought that I went very far last night in stressing the point that ours i3 a true Federation, or a political partnership entered into by six States, each sovereign, separate, equal, and free. In the Canadian Senate my honorable friend would not find a position unless the Government put him there, because the people have nothing to do with its composition. The Provinces have nothing to do with the Senate. It is chosen by the Dominion Government of the day. This Chamber is the distinguishing feature between our political partnership and a Confederation like Canada. Nova Scotia has not the same representation in the Senate as Ontario has. New Brunswick has not the same representation as Quebec has. Each Province is represented unequally, both in the House of Commons and in the Senate. We, on the other hand, are a true Federation, and it is because we united for certain purposes - we are still six separate, distinct, sovereign, and equal States for other purposes - that each State is equally represented here. That is the difference' between a Confederation and a Federation. </para>

                            <para>- The two Parliaments are differently constituted. I pointed out last night that if we take over these powers we shall, as a matter of logic, have to follow the course which Canada has pursued. We will not have equality of representation. That will go as a consequence. The argument against equality of representation will be intensified. It exists in Canada; it has existed from the first. They repudiated solemnly and absolutely the Federal principle; they would not have equality of representation which they found across the border, in the Senate of the United States. They would not have Lower and Upper Canada having just the same representation as Nova Scotia or a western prairie Province. Theirs is a centralized government, and the more we centralize our government the stronger will be the, agitation aud the argument for the abolition of equality of representation. We shall be told then, " Look at Canada. We have the powers that Canada has. It is the people only, and not the States, that must dominate the Federation." They will contend that the people shall elect the members of the House of Representatives, and that the States, if represented at all, be only represented in proportion to their population. </para>

                            <para>- Population is not everything. We have here an" enormous territory, and varied interests, so that the position in Australia is very different from that of London. The responsibilities of a Parliament are not to be measured merely by the number of people who have to be legislated for. It is a mistake which many people unwittingly make, that the number of the population is the only thing that has to be considered. </para>

                            <para>- Everything is not to be measured solely by the population. There are big interests, and varied interests of numbers of individuals throughout Australia to be considered. We have also to realize that in Australia there are very big enterprises, such as the railways and telegraphs, under the control of Governments that in other countries are controlled by private concerns. All these matters demand adequate consideration by the parliamentary bodies interested in them. </para>

                    <para>I have given very serious and earnest consideration to the Constitution, whilst it was being framed and since that time. Only last week-end, when in my office at Launceston, I was going through the more recent reports of the High Court; and noting the effect of their decisions -upon different Commonwealth legislation and upon the Constitution, I could not but be struck with the number of judicial decisions that there have been in connexion with the exercise of its powers by this Parliament. It must always be that the High Court will be the interpreter of our Constitution. When these amendments are adopted - if they be adopted - the High Court will be the interpreter of them. It will not be for this Parliament, but for the High Court, to say what they mean. That is the reason why the greatest care and attention should be given to any proposed amendment of the Constitution. It has been repeatedly said during the course of this debate that those who framed the Constitution found, when they came to work  under  it, that this Parliament has not the powers which they believed it had. It has been our experience to find certain legislation of this Parliament set aside by the High Court as not being within the competence of this body. All these decisions should warn us that every proposal of the present kind should receive the greatest care and the closest possible attention. All the talent, industry, and ability of the community should be devoted to proposals for amendment of the Constitution just as they were to its original formulation. The people themselves should be interested in any proposed amendment from the beginning to the end. I spoke last night of the position in relation to the introduction of legislation such as this to bring about ah amendment of the Constitution. What I said applies to such proposals, no matter what Government may happen to be in power when they are made. It has to be remembered that all proposals for the amendment of the Constitution must go to the people from this Parliament; even though we established a Convention for the consideration of those matters, this Parliament would still have the final decision as to sending them to the people. They would not be sent unless  they were  agreed to by both Houses of this Parliament. What I hope, and believe will eventually be decided, is that before the Federal Parliament reaches the stage that we have now reached in connexion with these proposals, the most exhaustive care and attention will be given to every proposed amendment of the Constitution. The work is so important, and its consequences may be so far-reaching, that it should, as far as possible, be accurate. If we do not adopt the plan of a Convention to deal with such matters, we should at least have a special session of the Federal Parliament whenever any amendment of the Constitution was proposed - a session in which the members of the Parliament would apply themselves solely to that very important work. I should not personally discountenance the. idea of bringing to the assistance of this Parliament the advice and counsel of outside authorities. We have before in the history of this Parliament secured the assistance of the Judiciary in connexion with legislation which we have passed. On such an important matter as the amendment of the Constitution we should not disdain such assistance. I think, in fact, that we would do well to invite it, not to frame, mark you, recommendations as to amendments, but to assist this Parliament to put into form its wishes with regard to amendments. I do 'not suggest that the Judiciary should be invited to originate the substance of amendments, but to help us to effectively express what we have already decided in substance as necessary amendments of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> last night quoted a list of cases decided by the High Court. Immediately . the High Court gives a decision affecting our legislation the first step taken is to remedy the defect by amending legislation. In some instances the amending legislation has failed to achieve the object aimed at. When in regard to matters of less importance we have already had the assistance of the Judiciary in framing legislation I do not see why in regard to such an important matter as the amendment of the Constitution we should not, and could not, secure such a system. We ought not to ask the Judiciary to recommend amendments, but, having decided the substance of amendments which we consider necessary, we might well get the assistance .of the Judiciary with regard to the form in which they shall be expressed. The High Court will continue to have the decision of all questions arising out of the Constitution. No matter what amendments we may pass, it will still be the duty of the High Court to interpret their meaning, and. its views as to our amendments will ultimately decide their scope and effect, and the limit of the powers  acquired by this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>At times I have heard certain honorable senators, though certainly not very many, in referring' to the High Court, speak; in a tone of resentment of its authority in the interpretation of the Constitution. I have heard it urged that this Parliament itself should properly determine the limits of its jurisdiction. I remind honorable senators who entertain that opinion that throughout the history of our institutions the judicial and legal body has always played a very important, if not the most important, part. I do not say that because I belong to the legal body. The other day I came across a reference in a book well known in Victoria, and, indeed, throughout the British Empire, a book called <inline font-style="italic">The Government of England,</inline> by Professor W. E. Hearn, sometime Professor of Law at the University of Melbourne for some years.  His  name is well known outside Australia, and his authority, too, in these matters is recognised. "Dealing with this subject in his preface, he refers to the position occupied by the Judiciary in connexion with all constitutional struggles. It will be remembered by honorable senators that many landmarks in the history of English liberty have been disputes purely of law, and not of rhetoric, and I think the position which the High Court occupies under this Constitution, and will continue to occupy here, cannot be better expressed than in Professor Hearn's  introduction - </para>

                        <para>As Lord Macaulay has observed, in the great debates of our history there is not a word about  Timolcon  or  Aristogeiton,  about Brutus the Elder or Brutus the Younger. When the Lords and the Commons held their famous Conference respecting the vacancy of James the Second's throne, and the fate of England was trembling in the balance, Somers and Nottingham disputed as if they were arguing a demurrer. Eighty years earlier Bacon and  Hakewell,  in the House of Commons, argued in the same spirit the great grievance of the impositions. Nearly four centuries before, in the hour of their distrust and disquiet, every doubt was quelled", and every wavering resolution was confirmed, when the patriot Primate produced to John's exulting barons the forgotten charter of their rights under the seal of Henry  Beauclerc.  That charter had itself been won, not by any abstract argument, but by incessant appeals to the " good laws of the Confessor." - </para>

                    <para class="block">So you can read through history and find that the most dramatic episodes and the most potent assertions of British liberty have resolved around the determination of a dry-as-dust point of law such as whether or not the King can of himself impose taxes upon his subjects. We all know the history of the patriot, John Hampden, who refused to pay the f 1 ship money imposed upon him. It was not oy any argument, or rhetoric, or appeals to passion, but by the calm, cold, calculating deliberation and appeals to law, and the legal principles affecting the Constitution, that matters of that kind were determined. </para>

                            <para>- It will be for that constitutional tribunal to determine the meaning of these amendments should they pass into law. Now these amendments, as I said last night, would have been drafted by a responsible officer to the Minister; in all probability the same draftsman who drafted the legislation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> last night said has been successfully called into question in the High Court. If that be so, I think we cannot do better than, in applying ourselves to the amendments of the Constitution, to take it up as a national work, and not as a work of a party. If we cannot have a Convention, first of all, to ascertain and report to this Parliament, I think this Parliament should devote a session to this important work, freed from any other matters, and if it finds that it can see the means of doing so legitimately, it should even invite to its assistance outside authority of a competent character. I have nothing more to say in regard to these amendments, except to thank honorable senators for their courtesy and attention in listening to me. </para>

                            <para>- It is not so today. If we compare Australia with New Zealand, we find again that the position is not the same, because New Zealand is not a Federation. The people in the Dominion are under one Central Government. Therefore, eliminating the New Zealand and the Imperial Parliament, we have left only three self-governing Dominions of the Empire between which comparisons can be made, and they are the Dominion of Canada, the Union of South Africa, and the Commonwealth of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> in his long - and up to a certain point interesting - speech, frequently touched upon the respective powers allocated <inline font-style="italic">%o</inline> the Federation op Canada and the provincial Parliaments. But he entirely missed the main point - whether purposely or not I am not prepared to say. He forgot to mention that, while the power over trade and commerce is not vested in the Commonwealth of Australia, it is vested in the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. The position is clearly denned in <inline font-style="italic">Federations and Unions in the British Empire,</inline> by Hugh Egerton, Professor of Colonial History at Oxford, WHO points out that, whereas in the Australian Constitution, trade and commerce is vested in the Commonwealth Parliament, " among the States and with other countries," in the Dominion of Canada, legislative authority over trade aud commerce is entirely vested in the Federal Parliament. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> does not for a moment assert that the people of Australia have less genius for self-government than the people of Canada or South Africa? Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> or any of those who are so bitterly opposing this amendment of the Constitution, which will give the Commonwealth more complete power over trade and commerce, say for a moment that the people of Australia are not as well able, through their representatives, to govern themselves as the people of Canada, and that they have less genius for self-government? </para>

This is the central fact: In Canada and South Africa, all the powers relating to trade and commerce are vested in the Federal Parliament, but in Australia the power of the Federal Parliament is almost nil. That is shown over and over again by the decisions of the High Court, and notably by the most recent decision. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It may be assumed that the people of South Africa, when they adopted their Constitution, were satisfied that it was the best kind of Federation for them. The power of the Union Parliament of South Africa is deliberately expressed thus in section 59 : - " Parliament shall have full power to  make  laws for the peace, order, and good government of. the Union." That embraces everything. Section 51 of our Constitution provides that the  Commonwealth  Parliament shall have power "to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to " certain matters, and then follow all those limitations which, in the minds of the great majority of the people, have proved so disastrous. The South African Constitution creates powers for the Provincial Councils, which should correspond to our State Parliaments, but which there live, move, and have their being at the behest and will of the Union </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament. There is in South Africa no such division  of  powers as we have, and the powers of the Provincial Councils are very small, compared with those of our State Parliaments. By section  90  the Union Government practically has power to make Ordinances for the Provincial Councils, because when a proposed Ordinance has been passed by  a  Provincial Council, it must be presented to the Governor-General in Council for his assent. The Governor-General in Council has to declare within one month that he assents to the Ordinance, or withholds his assent, or reserves it for further consideration. The State Governments in South Africa are only glorified municipal councils,  and  the  whole  power to govern the people in the things that matter is vested in the Union Parliament. That is the -arrangement in the most recent Federation amongst the English-speaking people, which was formed in the light of the experience of the Canadian Federation for many years,  and of the  blunders which we had fallen into in our short experience. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> aptly interjects, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who was then Prime Minister, and had played  a  large part in framing our Constitution, implored them not to make the same mistake as we had  done,  by limiting the Federal powers and extending the State powers, particularly in regard to trade and commerce. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is afraid that if the Federal Parliament's power over trade  and  commerce is extended it will lend to  a  great deal of litigation, but we must trust the people to some extent. Nearly all the other provisions  in  section 51 of our Constitution are based on trade and commerce. In the other two Federations - the only  two  with which wc may reasonably compare our  own -  the trade and commerce power is not subject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by our Constitution.  In Canada, just as  in South Africa, although  not  to  the same  extent, the distribution of the powers between the Federal and Provincial Parliaments leaves the great powers with the Federation,  and  only such powers as are expressly set out in the written Constitution to the Provincial Parliaments. Section  2.  gives the Canadian Parliament full power over the " regulation of trade and commerce." That covers everything, and is unrestricted. We should leave the regulation of trade and commerce in this country to the Federal Parliament, without those useless and expensive restrictions which now exist. As to concurrent powers leading possibly to litigation in the future, nobody can say. They may do so, but we know what has actually happened. A great deal of litigation has been caused through the powers being so mixed up to-day, and the difficulty of deciding where the Federal power ends and the State power begins. We have evidently made mistakes in several Acts we have passed, and ' it is a singular fact that amongst those who had a hand in framing those Acts were several who also had a hand in framing the Constitution, and yet did not know the actual powers inherent in it. A great deal of litigation lias been caused through the delineation of the respective powers being so vague, and the trade and commerce relations of the people are anything but what they ought to be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and and others have missed the main point, by failing, intentionally or unintentionally, to state that we are asking simply that the people shall have submitted to them the question of whether they will give the Federal Parliament the same powers as are possessed by the Federations of South Africa and Canada. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is very much afraid of a congestion of business in the Federal Parliament if these extended powers are handed over to it. That is a situation which can be well met when it arises. We should not meet trouble half way, but we know that the people are crying out for these powers. Practically ha.lf the electors only a little over a year ago said they wanted to give them to the Federal Parliament. We are simply making the reasonable request that the people should again have the opportunity of saying whether they wish them to be given to the Federal Parliament or not. We do not read of any congestion caused by the extended powers in Canada or South Africa. Even if we get the powers asked for in these six Bills, we shall still fall far short of the functions vested in the South African and Canadian Parliaments. Even then, all those things not expressly stated in our Constitution will be left to the States, whereas in those other Federations everything not expressly left to the provincial bodies comes within the power of the Federal Government. Here the </para>
                    <para class="block">States will still have plenty to do, and the Federation will not have too much to do. The cry of congestion is therefore absolutely futile. It is almost a childish cry to raise at this stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> yesterday, in urging that these Bills should be dropped on the ground that they were party measures, appealed to the sympathies and feelings of honorable senators and of the outside public by stating that the shadow of a great trouble was over us all. Let me remind him that there is also the substance of a great trouble over Australia. We should nob think only of the shadow, and forget the substance. The substance is that the people are fighting not only the enemy outside, but the enemy within the gates. The ghouls - I can call them nothing else - in our trading world, who are always waiting to take advantage of any crisis such as we are passing through now to enrich' themselves at the expense of the people, are operating amongst us, as must be well known to all those who are opposing these measures. To say that we cannot successfully prosecute our share of this war, and at the same time do something to protect the people within the Commonwealth, is simply to declare that we are children with no powers of initiative. Nothing can prevent Australia doing all that is necessary to take its part in the proper conduct of the war as it is doing to-day. The recruiting figures for Victoria for the last few days - and in the other States the recruiting campaign has not yet begun - are sufficient answer to Senators Millen, Bakhap, and others, who declare that we cannot properly assist in prosecuting the war and at the same time go on with self-government. It is absurd to say that we should stop doing anything to protect our own people. I admit that the position to-day is far more serious  than it was when the war broke out. At that time the cry to stop party government was not heard from the other side. In looking through a number of papers, I discovered a significant little paragraph which amused me so much at the time it was published that I cut it out. It shows that the  president  of the Australian Women's National League, an organization which is a particular friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> made this appeal to the people of Australia at the time of the outbreak of the war : - </para>

                        <para>I do not wish to minimize in any degree the paramount importance of the war, and its grave issues at stake. We bear in mind, also, that the political leaders on both sides have sunk all differences of opinion, in order to unite in a magnificent demonstration of expression of loyalty to our Throne and the Empire. The war will go on, and may God grant Britain the victory. But on 5th September the issue to be decided in Australia is of tremendous import to Australians. In. the face of the new and necessary call now made upon our time, money, and energy, let us not forget the urgent duty we owe to Australia, let us not diminish in the smallest way our efforts on her behalf. There is barely one short month between now and the elections, when the great question must be decided - if for the next three years Australia's Government is to be under Caucus and Trades Hall domination, or to be ruled by a Liberal and free Government, with equal opportunities for men and women of all classes and creeds. </para>

                            <para>- They are fighting just as bitterly, though perhaps not quite so publicly, as they did before. After all, there is no great harm in that. We may fight amongst ourselves whilst standing shoulder to shoulder against the outside foe. It is because we feel that we can do this without impairing our ability to energetically share in the prosecution of the war that we intend to submit these Bills to the electors. Every newspaper that we pick up tells us that in every corner of Australia the prices of the necessaries of life have risen far beyond the point that was necessary to allow those engaged in handling them a reasonable profit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> inquired whether our soldiers at the front had any time to think about internal questions of government in Australia ? In reply I say to him, " Ask the mothers and fathers of big families, who are hard put to it to adequately feed and clothe their children on account of the exceedingly high prices which they are called upon to pay for every necessary commodity, whether the depredations of the trusts controlling those commodities ought not to be curbed." It is because I believe that more than half the people of Australia are anxiously awaiting the re-submission of these proposals to them, in order that they may vest this Parliament with powers which it does not possess to-day, but which it ought to possess, that I wish to afford them an opportunity of making their will known. At this point I may perhaps be allowed to digress somewhat to answer the exceedingly unfair statements made by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last week when it charged the Government with hypocrisy and insincerity because they cannot immediately submit these questions to the people. That journal stated, in effect, " The Government affirm that the proposals are urgent," and with seeming innocence inquired, " In these circumstances, why are they not to be put at once?" The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> endeavoured to make the people believe that the Government are insincere because the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have stated that the questions involved in these measures are questions of urgency. </para>

The writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article, who, I presume, occasionally sits in the press gallery of this Parliament, knows perfectly well that no proposed amendment of the Constitution can be submitted to the electors until a period of at least two months has elapsed from the time the Bill in which it is embodied becomes law. The maximum period that may elapse is six months. In addition to being aware of the constitutional limitation, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> writer must also have known that some time will necessarily be occupied in getting our electoral arrangements in order. It is a great pity that powerful journals like the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which do so much to mould public opinion, cannot play the game fairly. </para>

                            <para>- If writing to order means writing that sort of stuff, I do not think that any reputable journalist ought to stoop to it. Upon the day on which one article appeared in that publication, quite a number of persons were led away by its deliberate suppression of the true position. This was clearly shown by questions that were put to me by electors who will vote "Yes" on the referenda, but who would not have done so had they not been told the truth. These persons inquired, " If these Constitution Alteration Bills involve questions of urgency, why are they not to be submitted to the people until December? They could be put through the Senate in twenty-four hours, and might be submitted to the electors next week." In reply I pointed out that that was impossible under our Constitution. Thereupon they admitted that the Bills could not be placed before the electors earlier than December. I repeat that it is about time that our great public organs played the game. Merely because a certain political party is in power, they ought not to suppress essential facts with which the public should be made familiar. I can only suppose that those facts are suppressed for party purposes. However, I think the electors are being educated to recognise that we intend to submit these Bills as early as possible, in view of the constitutional limitation to which I have referred, and consistent with the perfecting of our electoral arrangements. I am satisfied that if they are not carried on the next occasion, we will, at any rate, go nearer to carrying them than we did on the last occasion, because I believe that the people are ripe for the proposed alterations. </para>

                            <para>- It has been stated by honorable senators opposite- that the time is inopportune for placing' these measures before the people. The same cry was. raised by our political opponents when they were first submitted to the electors. In the opinion of the same gentlemen they were equally inopportune on the second occasion when the people were asked to vote upon them. At that time we had peace throughout the Commonwealth. Now we are engaged in war, and, accordingly, we, are told that the proposals are again inopportune. As a. matter of fact, they will always be inopportune to- honorable senators opposite. On their first reference to the people they were accorded substantial support. On the second occasion they received even' greater support, and I have no doubt that- at the next time of asking they will be carried by a large majority. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> which, is,, perhaps,, one of. the best newspapers published in the Commonwealth, and one which ought to be quoted here occasionally, pointed out- the other day  that  during the past twelve months, the workers have had to pay for such, necessaries as bread, meat, and' butter an additional sum of £9.,000.000. That is a very substantial sum indeed. If the proposed amendments in our Constitution be carried, I believe&gt; it will be impossible for those who; control the necessaries of life  to  extort such enormous prices; for these commodities. That circumstance in itself would, be* a powerful1 inducement to the electors to- vote for these-: proposals". It- has been- said that their submission to the . people will cost: the Commonwealth a. large- sum of money. May I point out th,at,. if they had. been submitted at the' recent  elections  - as they should have been - the cost to the Commonwealth  would  have been practically nothing. The cost now,, whatever it may be, will be entirely due to the- action of the then Government. Therefore, we should not have the slightest hesitation in taking the referenda at the earliest- possible moment. It has been, stated her©  that  our proposals- are too far-reaching. On the other hand, it' has been- asserted that in some respects they do not go far enough. I wish to emphasize this very important point, that we are not trying to withdraw from the Australian community any powers, but simply- seeking- to transfer certain powers from the State Parliaments' to the National Parliament. The latter is a body elected by the adult electors in the Commonwealth. No other Parliament in the Commonwealth is elected in that way; No fear need be entertained that the additional powers; when conceded, will be abused. That is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> most unlikely thing' to- happen. The State Parliaments are not elected by the adult residents'. In some cases the Upper House is a nominee body, while1 in other cases it is elected on a property qualification, but in no State is the  Upper  House elected by the adult electors. It exists, as it was fondly hoped, the Senate would exist, for the conservation of the alleged rights of property. I suppose that many persons who advocated Federation were imbued with the idea that the Senate, instead of being, a stronghold of Labour, would be forever a stronghold of capitalism and monopoly. That wast no  doubt  their intention, and one of the reasons which, actuated them in so strongly urging, the union of the Colonies. They have met with, disappointment,, and we find that to-day the Senate is by a long way the. most democratic Chamber in the whole Commonwealth, Therefore the people need not entertain, the slightest-; fear about clothing this Parliament with: the- fullest possible powers. It may be quite true that even after the grant of those powers we will still seek further {powers. In the meantime we ask for six amendments of the 'Constitution to be enacted. It has been said that the time of the Ministers and of members of Parliament generally will be fully occupied, and that, owing to the pressure of war matters, they will be unable to take a hand in placing the amendments before the electors. In my opinion, the workers of the country, who are suffering so keenly through the high prices they have to pay for various commodities, will not need very much urging to induce them to go and vote at the next referenda. So far as I have been able to judge, I believe that they are very anxious to get an opportunity. I trust that the Government will submit the proposals to the country ; as soon as possible after they have received the sanction of Parliament. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [5.9].- I- do not intend to speak at great length, nor do I propose to discuss these measures, as . I have had an opportunity to do so on two or three occasions. 'My opposition to the proposals has been declared not only here, but also before the people of the country. I recognise that these are measures which honorable senators on the other side have persistently and consistently expressed themselves in favour of. I realize that ultimately they will have to go before the people, in accordance With the , provision in the Constitution. The only question which engages my mind now is whether a . referendum ought to be taken now. The leader on this side pointed out yesterday, in very strong language, how inopportune the present time is. One has only to open the newspapers and read the expressions of opinion outside of Parliament to realize how strong is . the feeling against a referendum on these questions being undertaken . at the present time.

                            <para>- . I had no more to do with that matter than had the honorable senator, but the non-submission of the proposals shows that 'they were regarded then as Slaving a party complexion, or, at any rate, as involving matters of very great contention amongst the people, as we all know they do. The proposals may be the best in the world, or they maybe the worst, but that is not 'the particular question which to my mind should engage out attention. I find no fault with honorable senators for having discussed the measures, but this does not appear to me to be a proper time for the 'purpose.; This debate is virtually a case of beating the air. All the arguments for and against the proposals will not change a single vote in the Senate. The proposals were fought years ago, and fought again more recently, and they will be fought until the end of this year. As regards the merits or demerits of the amendments, I do not believe that a single 'vote will be turned here. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection marks an extraordinary feature of the debate. Honorable senators on the Ministerial side seem to imagine that because we on this side advocate the policy of no-party legislation, because we exhibit a determination to deal with the war and the war only, therefore, we should not oppose whatever the Government see fit to introduce. Does not the absurdity of such a suggestion appeal to the mind of every man ? In the Home Parliament there is only the one cry, and it is that 'a crisis exists which will either make or mar the nation. We are asked to debate certain amendments of 'the Constitution Which our opponents say will clothe this Parliament with greater powers in regard to trusts and combines and industrial matters, while other honorable senators say that they do not see eye to eye with the members of the Government, and, therefore, intend to oppose the proposals, as they have ; done on previous occasions. If by any process it could fee shown that the amendments did not sharply divide the people of the country, I could understand honorable senators on this side expressing their willingness to pass them. Suppose that there was unanimity in each Mouse : of the Parliament as to the advantage and the desirability of theamendments </para>

(SenatorLt.Colonel <inline font-weight="bold">Sir ALBERT</inline> GOULD. -Thehonorable -senator knows perfectly well the position which was taken up there by tie Opposition; but, even if that House was absolutely unanimous on the subject of taking a referendum at the present time, and the proposal divided the parties in the Senate, it indicates clearly the contentious character of the amendments. The speech with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> introduced the proposals to the Senate showed abundantly how marked was the division in the minds of the people as to whether they should be accepted or not. Can he say that all the people who opposed the previous Bills have changed their opinion? Can he say that the bulk of them have changed their opinion ? He, of course, imagines that he will get a majority, but we hope that he will not. Whether he will or not remains in the lap of the gods. The present time, I repeat, is inopportune for taking a referendum. The Government, to a certain extent, have recognised that fact by putting on one side all legislation except these proposals and measures relating to the defence of the* country and the Empire in a great emergency. The Minister knows that the newspapers are practically unanimous on the subject, and so, too, are the bulk of the people. </para>

But for the present position of affairs I would not say to the Government for a moment that this is not a proper time to consult the electors. The time would be quite proper if the existence of the nation was not imperilled. How do honorable senators opposite expect to take the opinion of the people fairly and honestly on these questions ? Before a referendum can be taken, probably 100,000 electors will be away from the country fighting for the maintenance of the Empire. Do my honorable friends mean to tell me that those soldiers will have no right to record a vote, or to give careful consideration to proposals of this character ? </para>

                            <para>- Will honorable senators tell me that the soldiers will have an opportunity ? Surely they know quite well that the legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament is strictly confined to its own territory. They may send ballot-boxes to Flanders or Gallipoli, and pass regulations with regard to voting at the front, but they will be absolutely powerless to carry out one iota of what is put down in black and white. To send ballot-boxes out of the country for that purpose would be to make an absolute farce of the whole business. When the war is over, and peace is established, let my honorable friends by all means bring forward these proposals if they consider that they will be in the best interests of the country then, as I presume they do now. I am not going to charge any honorable senator with not believing in the proposals he advocates. But we all perceive that there has arisen outside of this Parliament, outside the people of this country, a party which assumes the power to dictate to its representatives in Parliament what their policy shall be. This matter was discussed and debated, not only at the last Labour Conference, but at the Conference held three years earlier. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, they decided to lay aside all matters involving contentious legislation. The politicians who spoke at that Conference clearly pointed out the position which should be taken up, and the Conference refrained from discussing political questions which have to be brought before the electors. Those questions were freely discussed at the Labour Conference held in Adelaide recently. The Liberal Conference in New South Wales had some conception of the fitness of things. They knew that this is not the proper time to discuss questions of this kind, and they very nobly decided to defer the consideration of political proposals to a more opportune time. I remind honorable senators that we have to face enormous expenditure in connexion with the war. The Government are talking of borrowing more money to assist them in carrying on the war. They have already obtained large sums from Great Britain for the purpose. In the face of this they are proposing by these measures to divide the people of the country into hostile political camps. This is a most inopportune time to propose the expenditure of nearly £100,000 in order to submit these proposals to the people. </para>

                            <para>- It has been very good business for the Commonwealth Government to obtain £10,000,000 without having to pay any interest for it, and to be able to lend it to others who have to pay interest upon it. I am speaking of the money which will be required to carry on the war. We have no assurance that the campaign will be successful, and I say that when we are pushed, as we are at the present time, honorable senators should realize that even £100,000 will be of great assistance to us in the supply of arms and ammunition for the defence of the Empire. That sum would enable us to supply about 16,000 rifles, and we know that they are very much needed at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- I have made a statement, and the honorable senator can test its accuracy for himself. I shall be prepared to take my part in opposing these proposals when they are submitted to the people; but I am contending now that it is unwise at this time to divide the people into hostile political camps. Whilst honorable senators opposite make insinuations against honorable senators on this side, they are well aware that if the one great question of the war is dealt with there will be only one party in this Parliament, or in any other Parliament in Australia, because our success in the war involves the maintenance of our integrity and liberty. </para>

We are not now  considering the Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline> GOULD.- I alluded to it only to show that by setting it aside the Government recognised that this is not the proper time to consider matters which give rise to political dissension. I offer no opinion on the question whether the Tariff is a good one or not, but I say that when the Government have considered it wise to withdraw such a matter from discussion because they recognise that it would give rise to political dissension, we are justified in asking them in the same way to set aside all matters that would bring about similar dissension. It was at first thought that the war would go on very comfortably without our participation to any great extent, but as time has passed we have realized more and more the strenuous nature of the struggle in which we are engaged. It is about time that the Government recognised it to the fullest extent, and set aside these Bills that Parliament might give its whole consideration to the best means of prosecuting the war. </para>

Their Parliaments are treated by the Dominion Parliament in much 'the same  way  as municipal councils are treated by -State Parliaments in this country. Certain limited powers .-are given ,to them, but they -are exercised  subject  to the approval of the Dominion Parliament, which is an a position to say that, it does not approve of legislation, passed by the Parliament of a Province. Though honorable members opposite say that the powers of the States and of the Commonwealth here will be concurrent, they know that if their views are given effect the powers of the Federal Parliament will overshadow those of the States. A State Parliament may pass legislation which it believes- to be in the interests of the State, but the Federal Parliament will have the right to determine, whether the State Parliament knew best how to deal with its own affairs. This- means taking a long step towards bringing about Confederation or Unification, instead of the Federal system, which we now have, and which was intended by the framers of our Constitution to remain for all time. The Government propose to utilize our powers for the amendment of the Constitution to alter the- Federation to a Confederation, or to- bring about a system of Unification. I say that in doing so they are effecting a fraud upon the people. If there had been any idea that our powers of amending the- Constitution Would be exercised in- that way we should not have had the Constitution we have at present, because the power to amend it would1 be very different from what it is. It is not fitting, or becoming- to attempt, to side-track those who supported the Federal Constitution in the way now proposed. </para>

                            <para>- I will say to the honorable senator that where powers have been given to- this Parliament, and there is not sufficient authority to carry them out, we may very reasonably ask that that authority should be completed so that the power may be exercised fully. But when. you. attempt to.- take in additional powers you destroy the autonomy of the States to a very great extent, and certainly this is not the proper time to go on with these proposals. Even if it were, men. whose opinion differs from that of honorable senators- opposite should, have the right to oppose- the amendments, and point, out to the people of the- country as strongly as- they can, how detrimental the amendments,  would  be to the best interests of the community. I want to say also that the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> the other day was bristling with contentious charges, which, naturally will be resented, and which will be. a. "bone of contention during the campaign. The honorable senator probably felt very strongly - I have no doubt that he did - with regard to the subject, but if he. did feel strongly, surely he will realize at once that this must be a very contentious matter, if it entitled, him to speak in that particular way of certain sections of the community. </para>

T have <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> Copy of it, and if the honorable senator can point to any portion of it that is objectionable, or which should not be placed before the people of Australia, let him do so. On this subject I do not wish to anticipate a debate on a motion which is on the notice-paper, but I want to say that the people of this country have a perfect right to petition this Parliament at any time, and in the strongest language possible, so long as that language is of a respectful character. And if ever there is an attempt to browbeat the people, or to prevent them from placing their views before Parliament, there will be a gross infringement of the liberties of the public. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have already referred to that aspect of the question. My reason for opposition to these proposals is that the time is utterly inopportune for their consideration. They are of great importance, and. may have a considerable influence on the future history of our country, but they should be considered only when the public mind is not disturbed by more pressing and vital questions. In quieter times I shall be perfectly prepared to admit the right of the majority of the members of both Houses to send matters of this kind to the people in accordance with the Constitution, although I shall not give my vote to send them there. In times like this we should not squander money, or spend more than is absolutely necessary. In view of the urgency of the war, and of many other considerations, we must be prudent in the expenditure of public money. We want to raise more money to carry on the war, and this is about the worst time the Government could possibly choose to put questions of this kind to the people. They should receive full, fair, calm, and, just consideration, and not be influenced by prejudice, waste, or hurry. So far as the merits of the Bills are concerned, I commend to the consideration of honorable senators the quiet and logical speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> It would be well for honorable senators to pay attention to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said in opposition to the measure before they decide to vote for them,, or, if they are- carried, to go to the country urging the people to support them. </para>

My object has simply been to give reasons which would justify people, even if otherwise they would be in favour of them, in saying, " You have put them before us at an inopportune time, and we are not prepared to vote to put them on the statute-book." </para>

                        <para>. - I intend, at this stage to deal only with . certain matters that have not been very particularly touched upon. I have been waiting for some announcement from, the Administration of their intention to- sub-'  stantially  repair the breach effected in the hull of the ship of State by the High Court decision in the Wheat Acquisition case. I ventured the opinion that not one of these proposals would affect the position in the slightest, and I find in the speech of so able a man as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> a complete indorsement of my statements. Last night, perhaps without authority, I used the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> in support of my contentions. Happily, I am able to say that to-day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> empowered me to use his name, and stated that his opinion went absolutely to- affirm the ideas which I, as a layman, hold. </para>

                            <para>- I am not one of those who have complained of the submission of these proposals to the electors during the present war. I have accepted the situation. I knew that the Labour party would re-submit them to the people. I believe that proposals to amend our Constitution differ from other questions which properly arise in connexion with general elections w.heu personal issues are more or less involved. Consequently I shall always be in favour of submitting proposals to amend our Constitution to a referendum at a time other than at a general election. I really think it would be more advisable to submit these proposals to the people for their decision after we have arrived once more at the halcyon times of peace. But I know that the Labour party intend to re-submit them, and, that being so, with reluctance, with diffidence, but with a full sense of the responsibility which. I am assuming, I intend to suggest an. amendment in one of these Bills. If the Ministry are sincerely desirous of amplifying the powers of this Parliament in regard to the only serious breach that has. ever been made, on the original intention of the Australian people, it will accept my amendment, and, as a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">quo</inline> I promise it my humble support in endeavouring to secure for it the suffrages of the electors of the Commonwealth. I can do no more. I regret very much the stultification, the negation of the original intention of the people of Australia to establish what is in essence free and unrestricted trade between the States. I know that the Liberal party in another place refrained from discussing these measures. But this is a Chamber in which the States are supposed to be particularly and peculiarly represented, and 1 am not going to shirk any functions which vest in me as a member of this chamber of review. I favour very much the ideas which have been expressed by senator Keating. I believe that any substantial modification of our Constitution, such as is involved in these proposals, could better be discussed and considered by a Convention specially constituted for the purpose, or that, preferably, we should hold a special session of Parliament in time of peace to deal with matters of this description. We would then be able to call in outside assistance - such assistance as might be rendered by the Justices of the High Court, who would prevent us from falling into those pits which are continually in evidence when we attempt to trespass too greatly beyond Federal limits. </para>

I wish to deal now with the claim advanced in the sixth Bill of the series to make this Parliament, by a resolution of both Houses, the judge as to whether the business of a man or a corporation shall be sequestrated or taken over. I desire to emphasize my opinion that a Parliament is not a judicial body. It is primarily a legislative body, and it is of the first importance to the welfare of a nation that judicial functions should be- separated from legislative functions: </para>

                            <para>- It does not remain - the supreme high court of appeal in connexion with the administration of Federal functions, and in no case am I in favour of making Parliament anything like a judicial or an executively judicial body. It is a legislative body, and I intend to quote a passage which I think is of very great importance, and is almost a classic in connexion with the point I am endeavouring to make. It will be seen that when Parliament, by resolution comes to the conclusion that a business is a monopoly, it assumes that the monopoly is prejudicial to the people of Australia. It attaints the monopoly,, so to speak. There is a very ancient proceeding unknown to the Parliament of Australia, happily, but one which has been used in the Parliament of the Home country time and. again, though not of recent years. I refer to the power known as the power of attainder. It was, unhappily, very often necessary that Parliament should pass a Bill' and attaint a man of treason, attaint  i  him of doing something inimical to the interests of the country. It took away from the ordinary Courts of justice, often for- sinister motives, the power of trying a man, and, very frequently, trying him for his life. A parliamentary Bill of Attainder was brought in; a man was attainted of high treason; the Bill was passed, and he was executed without any other judicial process. Some of the best jurisconsults of. the Empire have maintained- that it  wast  an unsatisfactory process, and happily it has fallen into desuetude. It, is in abeyance1. </para>

                    <para>Sena-tor BAKHAP. - It would be most unsatisfactory to every man. I am going to refer to a historic case in which the Bill of Attainder process was utilized, namely, the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Fenwick. It was practically a party trial. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Fenwick was a supporter of the Stuart <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> and he was accused, after the accession of William the Third, of plot- ting against the established order of things, and conveying communications to France, which at that time was hostile to Britain. He was seized, accused of treason, and attainted. The Bill passed both Chambers of the English Legislature, for such it was then, arid he -was executed. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> desire to read briefly the arguments which were employed by those who were against the Bill of Attainder process to show : that it was highly desirable that the judicial functions should be separated from the legislative functions. In his <inline font-style="italic">History of England,</inline> Macaulay says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It  whs  much less easy to answer the chiefs  of  the Opposition when they set forth the danger  of  breaking down the' partition which separates the functions  of  the legislator from those 'of the Judge. " This man," it was said, "may be a bad Englishman, and yet his cause may be the cause of all good Englishmen. Only last year we passed an Act to regulate the procedure  of  the ordinary Courts in cases  of  treason. We passed that Act because we thought that, in those Courts, the life  of  a subject obnoxious to the Government was not then sufficiently secured. Yet the life  of  a subject obnoxious to the Government was then far more secure than it will be if this House takes  on  itself to be the supremo criminal judicature in political cases." Warm eulogies were pronounced  on  the ancient national mode  of  trial by twelve good men and true; and. indeed, the advantages  of  that mode  of  trial in political cases are obvious. The prisoner is allowed to challenge any number  of  jurors with cause, and a considerable number without cause.  The  twelve, from the moment at which they are invested with their short magistracy till the moment at which they lay it down, arc kept separate "from the rest  of  the community. Every precaution is taken 'to prevent any agent of power from soliciting  or  corrupting them. Every one  of  them must hear every word of the evidence and every argument used on either side. The case is then summed up by a Judge who knows that, if he is guilty  of  partiality, he may be called to account by the great inquest  of  the nation. In the trial  of  Fenwick, at the bar of the House  of  Commons, all these securities were wanting. Some hundreds of gentlemen, every one  of  whom had much more than half made up their minds before the case was opened, performed the office both  of  Judge and jury. They were not restrained, as a Judge is restrained, by the sense  of  responsibility; for who was to punish a Parliament? They were not selected, as a jury is selected, in a manner which enables a culprit to exclude his personal and political enemies. The arbiters  of  the prisoner's fate came in and went out as they chose. They heard a fragment here and there  of  what was said against him, and a fragment here and thereof what was said in his favour. During the progress  of  the Bill they were exposed to every species of influence. One member might be threatened by the electors  of  his borough with the loss  of his  seat; another might obtain a 'frigate for his brother from Russell ; the vote of a third might be secured by the caresses and Burgundy of Wharton. In the debates arts were practised and passions excited which are unknown to well-constituted tribunals, but from which no great popular assembly divided into parties ever was or ever will be free. The rhetoric of one orator called forth loud cries of "Hear him!" Another was coughed and scraped down. A third spoke against time in order that his friends, who were supping, might come in to divide. If the life of the most worthless men could be sported with thus, was the life of the most virtuous man secure ? </para>

                        <para>.- As the Administration have considered the amendment I desired to submit in regard to the sixth of these Bills, and as I have been informed by the Minister of Defence that they are not prepared to accept that amendment, my further remarks on these proposals will be compressed into a very brief space indeed. I have quoted from Macaulay in regard to the trial of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Fenwick in support of my contention that it is highly desirable that judicial functions should always be kept separate from legislative functions. That I may' show how desirable it is that Parliament should not be the authority to decide whether any business is a monopoly so hurtful to the community as to warrant its being taken over by the Commonwealth, I remind honorable senators of what happens when a Parliament is sitting and deliberating. The Senate numbers thirty-six individuals. We know that there are multifarious calls upon the time of honorable senators, and that the most eloquent amongst us can scarcely command an audience of more than half the members of the Senate. Honorable senators are outside this Chamber consulting with their constituents, in the Library, or are engaged in correspondence. In the circumstances the Senate, , as a legislative Chamber, represents the very negation of a jury that has to try a matter upon evidence. The members of a jury in a Supreme or County Court emp ann el led  to try an action involving £50 dare not act as members of this Chamber act, yet the Government proposal is that the members of this Parliament should have relegated to them the decision whether a particular business is a monopoly that ought to be taken over by the Commonwealth. Where is the man or company carrying on the business to be heard in defence? At the bar of the Senate - when half the members of the jury will be absent? Will a Judge permit three or four of the members of a jury to withdraw themselves from the jury box, and come back to the Court at their own pleasure, even in connexion with the trial of a case involving no more than £100? Not he. Yet, under the Government proposal, a business involving, it may be, £250,000 may be declared to be a monopoly by a parliamentary jury, any member of which is competent to absent himself whenever he pleases from the chamber in which the matter is being considered. I say that is the very negation of a judicial procedure. It is not because I am afraid to give the Commonwealth Parliament authority to take over the control of monopolies which are adjudged to be detrimental to the welfare of the nation that I am opposing the Government proposal, but because the procedure to be adopted in deciding whether a business should be taken over by the Parliament is the absolute antithesis of what a correct judicial procedure should be. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> alluded to the habit which is very frequent of comparing things which are absolutely unlike, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Mullan's  interjection is absolutely irrelevant to the point I am discussing. I say that Parliament is going to take upon itself the duty of deciding whether a business is a monopoly, and it acts in a way which would not be permitted on the part of a jury by a Judge trying a case involving a sum of £100. It is for this reason I am opposing the Bill dealing with monopolies as presented by the Administration. I have made a fair offer to the Government. I have asked that, in the name of justice, the decision whether a business is a monopoly detrimental to the interests of the nation should be relegated to the High Court. That is absolutely refused. I ask that the measure be so amended as to absolutely prevent any State in Australia acting in an un-Federal manner. That, also, is refused. And yet those who refuse to listen to these suggestions will go out on to the public platforms later, and charge me, and men like me, with being "little Australians." </para>

But these are the people who pose as nationalists, who want to repair the breaches in the Federal ship. They refuse every overture, and they are going to stand on the platforms of Australia and pose as the real Federalists. They are not Federal: they are only Socialistic. They do not care what the States do, so long as it is done on Socialistic lines; and even if what is done be an absolute negation of the Federal idea, so dear to the people of Australia when Federation was consummated. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Ready.</inline> - The honorable senator was himself a " red-ragger  " once. </para>

                            <para>- I am now a Socialist who believes in the people having wealth. I believe that every man should be given a free opportunity to exercise his initiative. But I do not believe in a Socialism whose only objective is the cribbing, cabining and confining of the efforts of those who really possess ability and initiative. There is nothing of that kind of Socialism in my composition. I believe that the full  efflorescence  of human effort should be secured to each man possessed of ability, initiative and brains, all of which are factors in the production of wealth. I believe that every man possessing these qualifications should be placed in a position to realize the fullest reward of his efforts. I shall not occupy the attention of the Senate much longer. I have done what I have done honestly. I have said my say. I wish to act federally. I am prepared to do everything possible to make the Constitution what it ought to be in regard to one of the most important functions of the Legislature. My proposal is turned down. I am refused the application of the principle of justice in the decision of whether a man's business or a corporation's enterprise is or is not a detrimental monopoly. And lo and behold, when these measures are submitted to the people, it will be alleged that in opposing them I am an anti-nationalist and a "little Australian," and that those who support them are the true Federalists. Yet they are the very men who refuse to take such action as would in the future absolutely prevent any Government in Australia from acting as some of them have acted, in an anti-Federal way. I have said enough at this stage, and my further utterances in regard to these measures will be made outside of this chamber. </para>

                        <para>. - After this outburst of oratorical fervour, we may get down to the prosaic consideration of the proposals now before the Senate. It is not my intention to speak at any length upon them, for the ample reason that the subjects with which they deal have been exhausted in the past. So much has been said in support of these measures for the amendment of the- Constitution that there is little left which can be said appropriately on the present occasion. Still, there are a few points which have arisen since these proposals were first submitted to this Parliament to which I should like to direct attention. The proof that the arguments in support of these measures have already exercised a marked influence on the public mind is the best justification for submitting them to Parliament and to the people again. They were first presented to Parliament and to the people in 1911, and by 1913, when they were submitted to the people on the second occasion, a change in public opinion had occurred which amounted almost to a political phenomenon. Whilst in 1911 these proposals were rejected by the enormous majority of 250,000 votes, that majority in the course of two years was cut down by 200,000. That result sufficiently bespeaks the merits of the proposals, without further argument in their favour. I am sorry that they should be before us at the present time, for reasons which have their origin in the action of the party opposite. In 1914 the Senate had these measures under consideration for the third time, and we looked in vain to the Constitution for some solid ground on which to stand, regarding that instrument as one guaranteeing to this Chamber some power, dignity, and authority in the community. We looked in vain, because the Government of the day, which is represented now in the Senate by five stalwarts, took upon themselves to override the Senate and its power and authority under the terms of the Constitution to pass these measures, and by so doing take the first step for their reference to the people. If that Government had been alive to their duty to give effect to the provisions of the Constitution, it would have been unnecessary for the Senate to consider these proposals on the present occasion. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Secondly, we notice that, when an appeal was made in 1913, the party opposite had (heir efforts supplemented in a very remarkable way. They had unlimited funds at their disposal, but, notwithstanding that, the referenda proposals were defeated only by a narrow majority, comparatively speaking. It is a matter for surprise to those who advocated the acceptance of the measures that they made such progress, considering that they had no money at their disposal, while unlimited funds were at the .command of their opponents. We have had the testimony of the mouthpiece of one company - the Colonial Sugar Refining Company - to the effect that they subscribed either more or less than £50,000 to defeat the referenda. We do not know how much was subscribed, but we have the evidence of the chief spokesman to the effect that it was either more or less than £50,000, and it is worthy of note that immediately the proposals were defeated in 1911 the price of sugar rose from £21 per ton to £23 12s. per ton - or about 15 per cent. - although the sugar crop during that year was the best that we have ever had in the Commonwealth, and the imports were the smallest. The party opposite could have helped us on that occasion if they had only set about getting a reasonable expression of opinion without allowing the employment of so much cash in carrying on the struggle. Those of us who advocated the acceptance of the measures had no money. The balance-sheets of all the organizations in the Commonwealth are open to public inspection, and .they will stand the keenest scrutiny in this respect. Gas. the same be said of organizations which supported- my honorable friends  opposite?  Can their balance-sheets be inspected? <inline font-style="italic">"No,</inline> and for the simple reason that they supplied so much money to defeat the measures. It is not disclosed just how much money was expended by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> when put to the test, admitted that his company had given either more or less - -he would not say whether it was more or less - than £50,000. If our opponents had any desire to get a fair and reasonable expression of opinion they could have helped to get it, and it would probably have meant obviating any reference to the people on the present occasion. I believe myself that if the electors then had not been victimized in a sense, and had not been cajoled and deceived, the result would have been very different. As a sample of what the electors were told, I might state that  in Western Australia one reason why they were asked to vote against the referenda proposals was that Western Australia would be controlled exclusively by a Government on the other side of the continent - by a Government at Canberra - 'and, on the other hand, people in the eastern States were told that "She regulation - of the railways 'and the control of municipal corporations would  be  at the mercy of the voting power of Western Australia. In this way many votes were turned against the proposals. I understand that it is the desire to get a vote on these measures to-night, so I do not want to waste any time, but I would like to point out that there is ample warrant for the submission of these measures to the people again. </para>
                    <para>During the last twenty years there have been very harmful and sinister developments in the industrial and commercial activities of this country. Twenty years ago, when our Constitution was being discussed, and when public thought on the subject was being shaped, there were no such things in this country as some of the evils we see surrounding us to-day. If we throw our minds back to about 1895, when public thought was being agitated as to whether or not a Federation should be created, these industrial dangers which now 'threaten the welfare of the people did <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> then exist. We .had not, for instance, .a .Shipping Combine at that time. The companies then engaged in the -maritime carrying trade did observe some form of rivalry in  their  business. The 'Colonial Sugar Refining Company has now -almost an exclusive monopoly in the -supply to Australia of that very 'necessary product, sugar; but twenty years ago there was at least some form of competition in 'the supply of this article. To-day, however, we have one institution, one company, supplying almost the entire needs of the Commonwealth, and fixing the prices for 'this commodity as it pleases. There is a tendency -everywhere for small companies to come together to wipe out competition, with the result that the people who have only the Government to look to for relief, and who are being charged higher prices for every article they require, have no money. Compare the position to-day with the position as it was in 1895, and we will see that there is every warrant for submitting these proposals; for, by the action of a small section of the community, burdens are pressing very heavily on the vast majority of the people. It is about time we remodelled our ideas of -the Constitution, and asked ourselves if, by any means, it has helped in the way expected. It has been well said that every human action is more or less regulated by the dominant thought of the period, and if we recall the conditions in the early nineties, or from 1895 to- 1900, just prior to the consummation of Federation, we will recognise, as an outstanding fact, that industries then were being conducted on much the same lines as they were during the previous fifty years, or even since the foundation of settlement in Australia. There was no 'material difference right up to about 1900. It was only since then that a radical alteration has taken place both in the field of industry and the field of commerce, and seeing that such a radical change has come, we should take stock of the position and utilize our powers of government to give the -people that maximum of relief which, a Government alone is capable of giving. That is the real purpose of these proposals. We want to set about the remodelling of our Constitution, and clothing the Government with power to enable it to confer the greatest benefits upon the bulk of our people, who are being victimized to-day. </para>
                    <para>Wei  hame had a discourse- from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> as to the nature of these proposals. The honorable senator referred particularly to the Canadian example, and I want to say that we can refer to that with a great deal of advantage to our present purpose. U.p to 1867 the different Provinces in Canada were under an independent form of government, just as were the States forming the American Union in 1786, and when the question arose of wiping out the barriers that separated them, the North American Provinces, forming the North American Confederation, had the example alongside of the United States Constitution and its working. They had at least one hundred years' experience of the working of the American Constitution, but, instead of taking that as a model, as we, in Australia, foolishly did, they broke away, and framed the Canadian Constitution in a vastly different form ' for the benefit of the people of Canada. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> called it a Confederation, but if he refers to any text-book or authoritative work, he will find it is referred to as a Federation, and as nothing else. It is rather curious to note that when the Canadian people were about to erect for themselves a form of government, they did not take the model that was so close to their hands, but struck out on original lines, and instead of leaving the Provinces as they then existed, with a large share of autonomy and power, they stripped them of much more of that power which the States alongside them enjoyed. The result is reflected in the Canadian Constitution,, which gives to the Central Government every power that is now sought for the Commonwealth Government under these referenda proposals. It conferred upon the Dominion Government, exclusive powers over every single subject which is included in these measures now before the Senate, and if we ask ourselves how the Canadian Constitution is working, we find it clearly answered in the prosperity of the Dominion, and in the way it has forged ahead' during the last fifty years. </para>
                    <para>The Constitution of the Dominion has not led to a harvest of litigation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> would lead us to believe; but, on the contrary, in Canada to-day there seems to be no friction between the Federal Government on the one hand, and the federated Provinces on the other. The Canadian High Court is not glutted with work in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keat</inline> ing; would have us believe.. In the  United States), according, <inline font-style="italic">to-</inline> the .reports of the Law Courts, there are at least 400 cases before the Supreme Court and the InterState Commission, centering round the intricate and knotty problem of; where the1 power- of Congress ends and that: of the individual States begins.. These cases have been there for the last four years, and are likely to remain, there for the next ten. We have slavishly copied that particular portion of the United States Constitution-, which has been- the- main source of all this litigation, trouble, and confusion. It has been well said' that the commerce power in the United States Constitution has been productive of' a twilight zone, in which no person- knows exactly where he stands; the- States do not know their authority, nor does the Central Government know where its authority begins or ends. It has produced a very profitable time for the lawyers, and the result is shown in the enormous piling up of cases. The American Constitution sets forth, as our Constitution does, that the Central Government shall have power 'to regulate trade and commerce among the States and with foreign countries. There are additional words regarding trade with the Indians, which in our case were not. necessary, but the framers of our Constitution seem not to have originated anything- new, nor to have- been guided by the experience of the United States. They took, word for word, the particular clause which has been such a prolific source of trouble, annoyance, litigation,, dissatisfaction, and friction between the Central Government and the States. We should be warned by such a development of events, and yet the party who. oppose these proposals would have us continue in the same old groove prepared for us- 128 years ago, for it was then that the American instrument of government was designed. America had at that time about 3,000,000 people) and thirteen independent States, all jealous of each other. They had just emerged from a war, and were so jealous of their power and authority that they framed the Constitution in such a way as to give the Central Government a minimum, while reserving to themselves a maximum, 6f power. </para>
                    <para>In those days trade was confined within well-defined limits. There were no corporations or companies operating beyond the boundary lines of one State, and in other respects trade and commerce was of a comparatively primitive nature. It was not the huge complex thing it is to-day in Australia. We are interdependent on one another in this country. The consumers in the west are the customers of those who are making their requirements in the east. The consumers in the north are dependent for their commodities on the people producing them in the south. Commerce to-day is a perfect network, so complex that it is entirely unlike what it was 128 years ago. We have apparently not had originating power enough to get away from the ancient example which was set before us, but we must get away from it if we are to reap any benefit from the Federal form' of government. We know that we need not look to the States. So long as their separate Constitutions exist in the present form we know that the people's interests will not be promoted in the State Parliaments. The more the Central Government is tied up and its power circumscribed, the greater will be the inclination on the part of the people to strengthen it, and to look with increasing confidence towards it for relief. I tell those who are opposing this measure that if these proposals are defeated on this occasion it will only whet the appetite of the people for a future effort at no distant date when the Bills will be carried by an overwhelming majority. I am certain the proposals will be referred to the people when a reasonable opportunity presents itself. I am aware that if a choice could have been made, it would have been better not to refer them to the people on the present occasion, but there is no help for it. The people are now being as much victimized as at any period within the last five years, and those disposed to victimize them have not shown the least intention to treat them fairly. Therefore, although we are engaged in a war which is absorbing the thought of every man, we need to put our own house in order, and particularly to keep in check the enemy within our midst. We must prevent the men who are prospering at the expense of their fellow citizens from despoiling them further. I support the proposals, and hope a reasonable and favorable opportunity will be taken to refer them to the people, when, instead of meeting with a reverse, as they did in 1913, they will be carried by an ample majority. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather pleased with the debate that has taken place, for I think members of the Senate have done credit to themselves by debating these serious propositions in a serious way. My only regret is that the offer of the Government, made in both Houses, to accept the assistance of the Opposition in so moulding these measures as to give the Commonwealth all the necessary powers, was not accepted. I issued that invitation in my second-reading speech, following the example of the Attorney-General in another place, with the full intention of accepting any reasonable amendment that would give effect to what we desire in better language than we had put forward. If honorable senators had any doubt of the sincerity of my offer, they needed only bo cast their minds back to a little more than twelve months ago, when I suggested on the eve of the election that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> that worthy man whose place I so unworthily fill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should across the table devise the measures necessary to give the Commonwealth Parliament the requisite powers. I listened with a good deal of attention and interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> speech, and gathered that he had detected a few changes in the measures since they last appeared here. I wish to make it clear that, in a few words I used on that point in my second-reading speech, I indicated that changes had been made. I said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Therefore, although I did not go into the details of the changes, I directed attention to the fact that the Bills were nob identical with those passed before, and I was rather interested, not to say amused, by the care with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> pointed out that some of the changes followed on the lines suggested by him when dealing with the proposals from the platform in Tasmania in the previous campaign. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> can suggest amendments in that round-about fashion, why does he not use his power in this Chamber to put before us and the country such amendments as will give us the exact powers that he thinks should be given? That is a fair and reasonable request to make of any honorable senator. But we are told that extraordinary powers are being sought. For instance, nearly the whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Bakhap's  speech was directed against me, in answer to a speech that I never made. He made out that I advocated the fixing of prices as a way out of the present difficulty. I made no such statement. All I have asked for on the public platform is that the Commonwealth .Parliament should be given the power to deal with the trusts and combines which are now fixing prices. I believe the greatest virtue of these powers will be exactly the virtue of the Defence power - that is, if you have guns and men to defend your country, you are not likely to be attacked. </para>

                            <para>- It would be just as absurd for me to say what the Commonwealth will not attempt to do as to say what it will attempt to do. To me, the chief feature of these measures is that the combines, knowing that a Parliament elected by the whole of the people has power to deal with them, will scarcely enter into their organizations, or attempt to take from the people unfair or unreasonable profits. They can do it now, because no power exists to stop them. We have it on the evidence of the ablest men on the other side that increased powers are necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine said it was necessary to have power to deal with trusts and combines, that the Commonwealth Parliament had not those powers, and that the States were unable to deal with the trusts. These facts should appeal to honorable senators, and I believe they will. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Gould's</inline> only reason for opposing the measures - and he takes a most reasonable view, admitting that the people should be given an opportunity to vote on them - is that, on account of the war, this is not the time to submit them to the people, and that we should deal with war matters only.

Every reasonable man, however, is convinced that the Government, since they took office, have done everything that could possibly be done by Australia in regard to the war, and that everything that can be done will be done in the future. We are told that it will upset the people to be asked to make up their minds on a question of such great magnitude. Does it upset the people to go to the theatre of a night and to their ordinary avocations in the day ? I venture to say that if there is one thing that leading men, particularly on the other side of the Chamber, should do at this juncture to assist the Government, it is- to help to restore to the people of this country that firmness which is essential for the proper conduct of the war.

Take almost any of our food supplies; read the evidence given on oath before Royal Commissions, such, for instance, as the evidence that has been quoted in this debate to the effect that various companies have been .putting up their jams in smaller  tins, so as to get a little more profit out of the people. An ounce or so of jam is missing from each tin, and, in the absence of the powers which we now seek, this Parliament is unable to deal with people who resort to these tactics. Then we have been told that the time is inopportune for referring these questions to the electors. " Why," I ask, " should they not be submitted to the people in time of war?" What occasion is there for any undue anxiety as to the outcome of this war? The situation is undoubtedly grave; but will any man who reads what is happening on the battle fronts of Europe say that it is not infinitely better to-day than it  Was  nine months ago? Will any man tell me, after reading the utterances of Lord Kitchener. that Great Britain, with 2,0.0.0,000 of trained men, is not in an infinitely better position now than she was when the war commenced? Why, then, this attempt to create a panic amongst the people by affirming that we must not do this, and we must not do that?

                            <para>- So far as the Government are concerned, we can take a calmer and more sensible view of those happenings because, before they materialized we were fully seized of how serious .they would be. We knew before they came about that Germany was not a Power which would crumple up when we shut our fist. We recognised that it would require the organized efforts  of  Great Britain and her Allies to beat Germany to her knees. But I have no hesitation in- saying that the organization o£ the Mother Country is infinitely stronger to-day than it was nine months ago. </para>

                            <para>- Thank God, it is. The Commonwealth can proudly point to: what it has done in this- momentous struggle. Nobody is more aware of that than are the members of the party with which I am associated. We- can point to what we have already done as an indication of what we will do&gt; in the future; There has- not been any question- brought forward in the. public press, or in this Parliament, in which the, needs of the position have not been anticipated by the Government. People have* urged us. to" do this and that, but. when the full facts have been made known it has become only too apparent that the matter had already been taken in hand by the Ministry. In this connexion., I need only point to the manufacture of shells and munitions. Whilst the people were sleeping the Minister of Defence was taking all the necessary steps in those matters. I do not wish my remarks to develop into a party attack; but when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> takes some words which I uttered - words which, if they are not torn from their context, I have no reason to be ashamed of, but every reason to be proud of - and imputes, because of their use, that the Government were not aware of the grave crisis through which we were passing, my answer is that we were fully seized -of the situation, and because of that we have the resolution and the moral courage to meet even a temporary set-back without endeavouring to make the people tremble in fear and panic. I say that now is the time for healthy optimism on the part of people who have red blood running through their veins. Now is the time for Australia to show that it is going to conduct its business as usual. The moment we begin clamouring for war what will become of this country? If business should cease what will happen to it? If manufacturing operations come to an end what will happen to it? Ought we not rather to encourage the conduct as usual of every form of industry? I have not had a great experience in my present position, but no utterance of mine on the platform or elsewhere will aim at other than allowing the people to know the whole .truth - as much as the Government themselves know - and the truth is that, despite any panic-mongers in our midst, there is nothing to fear. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care how my honorable friend may attempt to get back to the cries of years ago. I say  that  the man who, at the present time, will twist utterances, or misrepresent what is occurring, and thus mislead the people, is committing a grievous wrong. I believe that we should put forth all the efforts of which we are capable, and that we should train every, man who is willing to offer himself for service. Here I wish to say to the credit of Melbourne that the young men of this State are offering themselves in thousands at the present moment, and that the Government are providing for them. As fast as they come forward they will be put into training. This great war is not going to be affected by a sentimental cry. It is idle to urge that we should not do anything until the war is over. I wish I could see the end of the struggle, even next year. But the truth is .that nobody -can fix the time of its duration. In respect of the Bills which we are now considering, we propose to  ask the electors to give this Parliament the power to deal with trusts, combines, .and monopolies, the power to prevent them taking an unfair profit, not only from the pockets of the people,  but  from the dependants .of the very men who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> remarked, have shed their blood -on the hills of Gallipoli. The widows .and orphans of our soldiers fighting there are having their small incomes depleted to an extent that is almost unthinkable by persons who merely desire an increased profit. During the course of this debate, reference has been made to the scarcity of butter in New .South Wales. If honorable senators will take the prices which have ruled for that article in Melbourne during .the past four months, and compare them with the prices in Sydney, they will find that, whereas, butter in  the latter city has realized no more than Is. '6d. per lb., in the former it lias been sold at 2s. 3d. aud 2s. 4d. per lb. </para>

They have been withholding their supplies from distributors with a view to forcing the hands of the Necessary Commodities Board, and compelling it to increase the price.

                    <para class="block">The words "with other countries and among the States" limit our legislative power. Therefore, we submit to honorable senators a Bill to strike those words out of the paragraph, so that we may have the power to make laws for the good government of the Commonwealth with respect to trade and commerce - not only trade and commerce with other countries, but also trade and commerce within each individual State. But the honorable senator says that that amendment will not prevent us from intercepting New South Wales if it wants to take next year's wheat crop, or Queensland if it wants to take next year's sugar crop, or Tasmania if it wants to' retain all its fine potatoes and apples. Let us see if it will not do so. Where the Constitution gives this Parliament full authority to deal with any subject, and a question arises as to whether the power of a Stat© or the power of the Commonwealth shall predominate, section 109 makes the Commonwealth law superior to the State law. But in section 51 there is something which, I feel sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> must have overlooked, else he would not have imagined that the proposed additional powers will be insufficient. I have shown that under paragraph i. of section 51, as proposed to be amended, we shall have the power to deal with trade within the States or within any one of them, or any trading under the jurisdiction of Australia.

                            <para>- The Parliament possesses that power now, and we are not seeking to alter it. At the present time we have not the power to deal with trade within a State. But when the words "with other countries and among the States " are taken out of paragraph i. of section 51, it is unquestionable that our trade and commerce power will be unlimited. We shall have the power then to deal with the subject of trade within any State, and if New South Wales should take possession of next year's wheat crop, the Commonwealth Government could acquire that property in virtue of paragraph xxxi. of the section, because the grant of such power to the Commonwealth is quite clear and emphatic. </para>

He is aware of the decision of the High Court that, although the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to deal with trade between States, it cannot interfere with trade within a State. But the omission of the words "with other countries and among the States" from paragraph i. of section 51 of the Constitution will leave the subject-matter of trade and commerce indisputably in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- If those men failed to frame the Constitution in such a way as to give effect to their intention, what is the obvious duty of the people of the Commonwealth to-day? It is to say to- the men who- are interpreting the Constitution, " We will put the legislative powers in such language that there will be no mistake as to their meaning in the ' future." The responsibility for these questions being put to- the people at the present time rests- upon the members of the late Government. Twelve months ago; they could, have put the proposals to the people, and the matter would, have been settled.. I venture to say that had a vote been taken, on the subject at the last election no one would have been anxious to place the proposals, before the people- at the present moment, even if they had. been defeated then j but the late Government by an Executive act, refused to take that, course. The Senate, having by almost a unanimous vote passed the measures twice, acquired the constitutional right- to ask the people, to give a verdict,, but a few persons constituting: the Government for the time being refused to give the. electors an opportunity to. vote. When we propose now to consult, the people, our opponents say that the time is inopportune, that the people cannot grapple with such questions, during, the progress of' a war. Such statements emanate from those who do not want the people to deal with the proposal's. Whether in peace or in- war, the amendments are necessary.  In  my opening remarks I. said that- the measures were necessary in times of peace.  They  are ten- times more, necessary in times* of war. It is still' essential- that the Government should be armed with power to- protect the people- in a crisis of that kind. I appeal1 tor honorable senators not to. raise a party cry in the country as to these measures. I ask my honorable friends opposite in what way the measures, if carried, will give the Labour party any advantage over the Liberal party? In" what way, by making the Constitution, broader in the interests of the whole of the people, will the Labour party be given any advantage over- tha anti-Labour party ? If our honorable friends opposite secure a majority at the polls in eighteen months' time they can prevent anything being done under these  proposals.  If", on' the&gt; other hand, we again secure a majority, surely the- people, who intrust us with the government of. the country may be asked to trust us with the powers necessary to govern it well. "We asked for these powers before, and they were refused. "We are going to ask fOr them again, and, though I do not know what the result will be, I personally have no fear of another refusal. When these proposals were submitted to .the people in 1911, and again in 1913, our political opponents said' that the high cost of living, which was complained of even at that time, was due, not to the operations of trusts and combines, but to the fact that the Labour party were in Parliament, and in control. Unfortunately for our friends opposite they got their turn of office. They remained in power for a little more 'than twelve months, and during the whole of that time the cost of living continued to soar higher and higher. I am not so unfair as to blame our political opponents for that, because the high prices were due to a power beyond them - the power of the trusts, combines, and monopolies, who were getting their grip on the food supplies of the people. We know the grip they have in other countries. We know that the Beef Trust of America fixes the price of the meat that appears on the breakfast tables of the people of London as well as of New York. </para>

                            <para>- It is strange to hear that the honorable senator should have been in office without obtaining that knowledge. I venture "to say that every man having responsibility for the government of the country must have been aware that it -was necessary for the Government to exercise their power to prevent men sending -coal out of the country which they knew -would be going -to an enemy ship, to prevent men sending wool out of -the country knowing that the result would be that our own men would be left without warm clothing or blankets, and to prevent men sending sugar and meat out of the country. If our honorable friends in Opposition are not aware that combines were prepared to do those things, it is time that they were made aware of it. </para>

Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> say that the Government were not -called upon to prevent coal leaving the country when the information they had led them to believe that it was intended to be supplied to the enemies' boats, or to prevent wool leaving the country, because, otherwise, our own people would be left destitute of warm clothing ? </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly what I am saying. I am pleased that the honorable senator agrees with me. If he did not understand what I -was saying, I apologize for not having made myself clear. The export of these commodities was stopped because it -was feared  that  they -would find their way into enemy hands. Who would 'profit if they found their way into enemy hands? Who was profiting by our wool, coal, and meat going out of the country"? I am not going to say that these men were sending these goods direct to the enemy, but we had to stop their export because they might find their way into enemy hands. I do not wish to argue the matter further. I am satisfied with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> admission that we had to stop the export .of these goods because we knew that they were finding their way into enemy hands. I say that the public of Australia should be made aware of the fact that the very things which our soldiers and their wives and families needed were finding their way into enemy hands, and the Government took steps to prevent them leaving the country. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard the interjection that we had the power to do what we did in that connexion. Fortunately we did have that power, and we say that, as a Government, we are responsible for our actions. But we have not the power to protect the people in the various States. We can buttress that assertion by a reference to the opinions expressed by men of the calibre of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> and other men high in the public life of this country, who are agreed that we have not, in this Parliament, the power to deal with trusts and combines. It is because we believe that a Parliament elected by the whole of the people should have these powers that we propose these amendments of the Constitution. I do not expect any great results to follow from a power to fix prices. I do not imagine that that should be regarded as the be-all and end-all of everything. But I earnestly believe that when we are possessed of the power to deal with trusts and combines - and I look forward hopefully to the time when this Parliament will be intrusted with that power - there will be no combines to deal with, because it will not be profitable for men to attempt to set up nefarious business amongst a free people who can combat them, not in this State or in that, but from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. </para>

Had it improved upon the phrasing of the Bill ? I should have been &gt;glad to accept it; but I -think the honorable senators with whom  the honorable senator is associated will admit that it is not an -improvement. He merely tries to provide that the Court, instead of the Parliament, shall have the power to say what is a monopoly. A very good precedent has been established recently bearing upon this point. A Bill was dealt with in another place- </para>

                            <para>- I think that they will stand the assay on this question with a great deal of satisfaction to myself. I imagine that I shall find some metal in the crucible. I have had occasion to discuss this question several times previously. I have availed myself of the opportunity of ventilating my opinions upon it when Supply Bills have- been under- consideration. I have referred to- the fact, that recruiting in this,, my native State, of Victoria,, has not: been- as satisfactory as all concerned- with the- success of the Empire's cause could hope. Whilst I am an unswerving believer in, the principle of. conscription, for national" defence, and' while I believe it is vital to us in the present crisis), in?, the Empire's; fortunes, I am not ungenerous to the extent that- 1 would fail to give expression to my satisfaction in, regard to the recruiting: which, has taken place; in Victoria-, during? the- past nine, or ten days. If there, has  been  any slackness* any remissness,, any lukewarm ness in regard to supplying recruits, for our Expeditionary Forces in this State,, in a very large, measure that imputation has been removed by the great rush to the colours which has, occurred, in- Melbourne and in the principal towns of Victoria during the past few days. That circumstance, however, does, not deter me- from, advocating- the principle of compulsory service, and the undertaking forthwith of the preparation that, is necessary for the establishment of such service, in order that we may systematically provide reinforcements for our Forces who are now fighting, on European battlefields - reinforcements  which  they- must have- if the Empire's cause- is to decisively triumph in the near future. I would not like to refer in disparaging, terms to the recruiting method's which-, have been' employed- during the past few days;, but undoubtedly they are not-  such  as are consonant with the Empire's- fortunes and with the systematic performance of Australia's part in the present great struggle. I. have not been alone-  in <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> animadversions, for-, singular to say, I. have learned during the past three or four weeks that many of the arguments employed by me. in advocating the principle of compulsory service have been repeatedly used by prominent, men in- the Old Country,, and by  politicians  in the Australian States. To illustrate- my meaning,, let me read something which </para>

                        <para>One cannot read the cables from day to day, with news of Russian reverses, of industrial troubles in England in connexion with the supply of munitions, without feeling that the Empire is fighting with her back to the wall. Yet, while the fate of the world hangs in the balance, we are content with coaxing and cajoling and trying to persuade our men to enlist by an appeal to their emotions, which at the best are ephemeral. I cannot help but think that the somewhat spasmodic response to the appeal of the Minister of Defence savours too much of a revival meeting, where the temporary emotion frequently sways the whole congregation, while the effects are lasting with a few. We must now strike the stern note of national duty. </para>

                        <para>I And that an enormous amount of money is being spent in issuing the most extraordinary series of advertisements ever authorized by a Government. In every newspaper and on every wall there appears variegated appeals, not only to men of military age, but to the wives, mothers, sisters, employers, friends, and acquaintances of men of military age. Some of these appeals are so extravagant that a visitor from Mars might be pardoned for believing them to be the handiwork of desperate men with whom rhetoric had got the better of reason. Many of them are apparently intended to create a feeling of shame in the minds of  unrecruited  young men. The masterly advertisement writer even went the length of addressing " Four questions to the Women of England," the third and fourth of which read as follows : - " Do you realize that the one word ' Go ! ' from you may send another man to fight for our King and country? " " When the war is over, and your husband or son is asked, ' What did you do in the great war ? ' is lie to hang his head because you would not let him go ? " </para>
                        <para class="block">To which was added : - " Women of England, do your duty ' Send your men to-day to join our glorious army ! God save the King ! " </para>
                        <para class="block">This indiscriminate appeal to married women, mothers, and others to tell their husbands and men folk to go for soldiers is not a very pleasant thing to contemplate. Is &amp; " volunteer " shamed into going by such appeals really equal to "three pressed men," and when the employer of a man-servant is moved by official advertisement to discharge a footman so that urgent need should make that footman a soldier, is the process entirely admirable? </para>

                    <para class="block">While I have the greatest respect for the patriotism of the men who are volunteering in such considerable numbers, I nevertheless do not favour the system, because of the absolute lack of method about it. Can anybody say that any discrimination is being exercised as to how many married men are being recruited, or as to how many men whose services might be much more valuable in Australia are being retained here. As a matter of fact, all that is being asked of volunteers is whether they are physically fit. If a man can pass the medical examination, no regard is paid to anything else. Some little time ago I stated that, to my great astonishment, I had found that more than one-half of the men recruited for Lord Kitchener's new armies were married men. I regard that as a  very  injudicious move. - a very lamentable feature of' an otherwise admirable response to the call for men by Lord Kitchener. I spoke quite independently, because it seemed to me that there was a very great want of system and a very great wastage of the national resources involved in allowing such recruiting to take place. I have since found that Lieut. -Colonel A'court  Repington,  the military correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> stated quite recently that many blunders had been made, and that one particularly large blunder had been committed owing to the unsystematic recruiting which had been indulged in. This writer says - </para>

                        <para>We need men in the fighting line and for home defence. There is nothing to substantiate the plea for the intermixture of volunteers and conscripts, which would result in the disorganization of the Army. We are said to have enlisted more than 50 per cent, of the married men. The unlimited enlistment of married men has been a blunder, and is opposed to modern military science. </para>

                    <para>I find in military publications statements to the effect that 70 per cent, of Lord Kitchener's new army are married men. </para>
                    <para class="block">I am very sorry indeed to learn that this is so. To my mind it more than justifies the strictures of the military correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and constitutes a warning to us to adopt a system of a different character in the enlistment of men throughout the Commonwealth. I need not refer to the fact that there are in Australia practically 500,000 single men of ideal military age. Surely I need not demonstrate the uneconomical system involved in the recruiting of married men when such a large number of single men are available for service. The readiness of the young men of any country to fight and, if need be, die, for the ideals of their people, is the true test of national greatness according to one of the greatest historians of the German Empire. I refer to Mommsen. I heartily indorse every word which has been uttered in this connexion. The young men of a country can only claim to be great if they are ready to die for the interests and ideals of the people to whom they belong. We all know that the present struggle is not merely a fight between armed forces - it is also a war of resources. If a young man is slain in a battle, he has no wife or children who require to be maintained. Very properly, we have instituted a considerable pension scheme in connexion with the war, and yet we are still enlisting married men. The Minister of Defence will remember that very early in the history of the struggle I persistently asked him what percentage of married men was being enlisted. After considerable delay he furnished a return, showing that about 12J per cent, of the troops enlisted in our first Expeditionary Force were married men. Subsequently he informed me that a large number of married men had enlisted as single men. </para>

There has been no attempt made to restrain married men from enlisting and to enlist single men in lieu of them. On a previous occasion I had something to say about the necessity which exists for economizing. When I spoke about conscription in the first instance, that is months ago, I spoke to a somewhat derisive Chamber, but now we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> telling us that we must economize. We have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Fisher</inline> most properly saying that we must economize. Did not Lord Kitchener tell us at the beginning of the war that in all probability it would be a protracted struggle? Did he not emphasize that opinion the  other day, and once more give it to the world ? In the face of those facts, is it not absolutely essential for us to so order our military house as to enable us to conduct with all our force this national struggle for any time, until we arrive at a position which will justify us in claiming a decisive victory on the part of the Empire to which we' belong and its Allies '( Economy should be the order of the day, and the recruiting of married men is  most  wasteful. I ask honorable senators if, in view of Lord Kitchener's declaration, any one of them has the hardihood to say that the struggle is likely to come to a successful conclusion, so far as we are concerned, inside one year ? I know that the Vice-President of the Executive Council said only a few minutes ago that no man could reasonably assume that the struggle was now going to be a short one, dating from the present time. I indorse what he said. It is very likely to be a long struggle, very much longer than any one anticipated at the beginning of the year. But we have Lord Kitchener's warning, and with that admonition ringing in our ears should we not make the greatest effort of which we are capable at this juncture * Australia, I maintain, has more to gain and more to lose in connexion with the struggle than any other people on  the  surface of the earth. We are the only people claiming possession of one of the world's continents. It is absolutely essential for us to retain possession of the whole of the territory of the Commonwealth to enable us to carry out those ideals of government which are dear to us, irrespective of our political differences. If our Empire is forced to make a peace which can be characterized as the result of a draw, our position, precarious in the extreme, will become doubly precarious, perhaps, if we, one of the most important Dominions of. the King-Emperor inhabited by a white race, do not put forth our whole strength, our systematized efforts.

Our population is equal to a tenth of the population of the United Kingdom, and, seeing that we have, by virtue of the Home Country's protection, the unchallenged possession of one of the most important Dominions in the world, it is incumbent on us to make the greatest effort of  which  we are capable. We have to keep in view the prospect that we may have to put forth the whole of our "male population capable of bearing arms. I believe it is estimated that the greatest effort of which a modern nation is capable is to put 10 per cent, of its population in the .field. The greatest effort of which Australia is capable would be to put half-a-million of men in the field. I believe that we will have to face the contingency of putting at least <inline font-style="italic">200,000</inline> men in the field. If the contingency is admitted, if the possibility of the necessity of the effort is not  challenged,  should we not make the most complete preparation now? There are some gentlemen - some in the Labour ranks and some in the Liberal ranks - who say, " We must have registration; we must have a proper tabulation of the nation's resources. We agree with all that;. but conscription is not necessary yet." If it is admitted that there is a possibility of conscription being necessary at any time within the next few months, at any time within the next year, the proper time to conscript is now, because the men whom we must send forward within the next twelve mouths, perhaps within the next two years, ought to be in training. The Minister of Defence should know the numbers available to him, and they should be sent to the front with that steady regularity which is the greatest and best earnest of victory. I ask permission, sir, to resume my remarks on a future occasion. </para>

That, again, is a misconception. The man was not a private, but an acting sergeant, and he was not appointed without examination.

The point was made that the Selection Committee had recommended another officer holding a commission, who ought to have been appointed. Lieutenant Dunnington  He is referred to in the Committee's recommendation as " Lieutenant Dunnington, retired list." As a matter of fact, he was not a lieutenant, and was not on the retired list. He had been a second lieutenant in the Commonwealth Military Forces, from which he resigned on the 31st December, 1913; he had not enlisted in the Expeditionary Forces, and, therefore, he was not eligible for the appointment recommended by the Selection Committee.

                        <para>. - Some information has been sent to me which discloses a condition of affairs so alarming that I must put the correspondence in the hands of the Minister. It relates to the inexplicable delays which are taking place in connexion with the sending of correspondence, not to soldiers in Egypt, but to soldiers who are in camp in the States. I have here some correspondence from a man who lives in a mining town in which I resided for many years. He has given three sons to the Expeditionary Forces, and one son has been for years in the Australian Navy. The father of those young men is not by any means illiterate, nor are the' sisters or the neighbours who are addressing letters to the boys who are serving in the Expeditionary Forces, or amongst the men who are being recruited for those Forces. These persons are sending letters regularly, week after week, and they are getting letters hack from the lads who are <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> camp, saying that they are not receiving the letters addressed to them from . their home. They are in a state of perturbation to know how things are going on . at home. One of them happens to be married ; . his wife is writing to him regularly,  hut he is not getting her letters. One of them is even talking of deserting because he is kept in complete ignorance of how things are at home. The father tells me that correspondence has been addressed to the lads quite regularly every week. That condition of affairs is quite inexplicable. </para>

It may be that there is a reason for all this, but to me it is utterly inexplicable.

I hope that he will address himself to the Minister in charge of the Post and Telegraph Department and endeavour to have this state of things remedied at the earliest possible moment. </para>
