                            <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> drew attention to an increase in' the salary, and severely criticised the Government for granting increases to highly-paid officers during the present period. It threw the whole responsibility on to the Government. When I read the article . I <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> somewhat surprised, and looked up the Estimates. As these were printed with the previous gear's and last year's amounts in parallel -columns, the criticism appeared to be justified, because an increase of Â£100 per annum was shown, apparently as being  given  during the life of the present Parliament. On inquiry, I found that the increase had really been made in the -year before last, but was not shown on the Estimates for that year. It appeared that when those Estimates were originally made up, the then  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> furnished the Government with the usual amounts, and suggested no increases. After the elections a new  President  and a new  Speaker  took office. The new  Speaker  increased the salary of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives, and also, I understand, suggested to our  President  that a similar move be made in this branch of the Legislature. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> declined to take that step, and the 'Estimates were printed showing the  Clerk  of the House of 3 Representatives' salary as Â£1,000, and that of the  Clerk  of the Senate as Â£900. Subsequently the  President  made application that the  Clerk  of the Senate should be placed on the same level as the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- I hardly think that that is correct. Although the increased amount came before the Senate very few of us knew much about it. Although I attend fairly regularly, I knew nothing about the increase having been passed, and on looking up the records I found that, when it came before the Senate, some honorable senators, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was at that time sitting in opposition, protested against it. Although this was towards the end of the year, the salaries dated back to the beginning of the year, and were paid accordingly. I should not mention this somewhat out-of-date matter except to clear away misapprehensions as to the right parties to bear the responsibility. It was not the Labour Government that was responsible. It was the Fusion Government that put the amount on the Estimates, and if there is any responsibility, they must take it. </para>

                            <para>- Obviously, they have not, but they should have. It should not be left in the hands of one member of the Committee. It is rather high-handed to say; that a Committee elected by this Chamber have nothing to do with the salaries of the Staff of the Chamber. What, in the name of common sense, is the use of electing the Committee? If the  President  has the whole matter in his hands, and can do whatever he chooses, and ignore the Committee, we might as well have no Committee at all. It is time the Committee had the responsibility of regulating these matters placed on it. If that were done, increases would not be effected in the way this particular increase has been. The matter should certainly be taken out of the hands of the  President.  When I was on the House Committee, little twopenny-halfpenny increases to lower-paid officers or charwomen came before us; but when it is proposed to make a very material increase of Â£100 to an already very handsome salary of Â£900 a year, the Senate House Committee is not consulted in any shape or form. That is put through, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said, on the responsibility of the  President  of the Senate, and he is prepared to accept that responsibility. It is all very well for the honorable senator to say so, but it must not be forgotten that it is the taxpayers of </para>

                            <para>- When a House Committee is elected by the Senate, it should be vested with responsibility in . matters of importance to the Senate, and not only in trifling matters such as a twopenny-halfpenny increase of wages. Although it is somewhat late in the day to criticise this item, we cannot shut our eyes to the necessity for such criticism if we do not wish to be in the same predicament at some future time. In my criticism I have no wish to find fault with the manner in which the  Clerk  of the Senate performs the duties of his office. During the whole of the time he has occupied his position he has, so far as I know, performed his work in a very satisfactory manner indeed. I am not criticising the holder of the office, but I have a duty imposed upon me as a member of the Senate. If I allowed a matter of this kind to slip by without protest, my omission might be challenged outside, and I have no wish to take up a position outside which I am not prepared to assume in this Chamber. Every man entering into politics has to accept certain responsibilities. When an honorable senator day after day, in this Chamber, rubs shoulders, so to speak, with an officer, it is unpleasant for him to offer any criticism in connexion with the office which he holds, but that duty may be separated altogether from the individual, and it should be done, however unpleasant. I have no hostility to the gentleman occupying the position of  Clerk  of the Senate. I have spoken because I think that for altogether too long a time a wrong practice has been followed in this matter, and it should be altered, so that if in future any proposal of this kind is made, the members of the Senate may be called upon to accept their proper responsibility, and will know the reasons to be given for any proposed increase of salary to which they may be asked to agree. 1 am not at the present juncture going to pass an opinion as to whether the salary paid is too high or too low for the work performed. All that I find', fault with is the manner in which this, increase was made. Having entered my protest on that ground, I rest satisfied... </para>

                        <para>. - The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie: requires a little clearing up. It is, of course, an excellent thing for the taxpayers that they should have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie ready to act as watchdog over their interests in this particular matter. But when the watchdog permits the houses to be raided and the taxpayers to be robbed  for eighteen months before he barks, I do not think he can be regarded as of much account. This matter has been the subject of a good deal of criticism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said that it was. first raised by the press. I interjected that the press raised the question ilk ignorance. Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that the press did not make many inquiries. May be they did not feel called upon to do so. But if such a question had been raised by a member of the Senate, his ignorance' would have been? inexcusable, because the matter was fully ventilated in this chamber not this year, but over eighteen months ago. If honorable senators will look at the Estimates, which are now under consideration in connexion with the Bill before the Committee, they will find that in the Estimates for the House of Representatives no increase of salary is set down* for 1913-14. The reason for that wasfully explained by myself when the former Estimates were before the Senate. I explained why the increase did not appear on the Estimates for 1913-14. That explanation will be found at pages 4599 to&gt; 4601 of <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> for 1913. So that the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has raised to-day was fully discussed and ventilated1 over eighteen months ago. The honorable senator comes along now with a belated criticism as if this was the first opportunity given to honorable senators to discuss the matter. </para>

                            <para>- They were passed by both Houses at that time. Not a word of criticism was ever raised in the Senate about the increase proposed for officers of another place. All the criticism on the former occasion, and at the present time, has been levelled against the increase to the officers of the Senate. I remind the Committee that it has been laid down as a principle by the Senate that this Chamber and its officers should not take second place to the other branch of the Legislature. I have nothing to add to the statement I made on this subject when it was considered in the Senate over eighteen months ago. I do not wish to waste the time of the Committee by repeating that statement to-day. The facts were obvious to every one who knew of the increases given in both Houses. I refused at the time to take any action to disturb the recommendation of my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> The honorable senator is present now, and I am sure will bear me out by indorsing all that I have said. </para>

                            <para>- No, and neither did I at that time. But when the recommendation was made, putting officers of another place over the officers of the Senate, I insisted that the rights of the Senate and its officers should be preserved by putting those officers in exactly the same position as the officers of the House of Representatives. I do not wish to attach any blame to the former Government, but accept full responsibility for what I did. I have told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that I had no option but to accept that responsibility, since it is imposed upon me by an Act of Parliament. So far as the officers of the Senate are concerned, the Public Service Act imposes upon me the same responsibility as is imposed upon the Public Service Commissioner in connexion with officers of the Public Departments. Now with regard to the House Committee having something to say in determining the salaries of officers of the Senate, let me again remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that, an Act of this Parliament imposes that responsibility on the  President  of the Senate. The honorable senator would make the House Committee superior to the Parliament. He would have the House Committee placed in a position to override the Senate, and assume duties which the Parliament has said must be assumed by the  President  of the Senate. Let me remind the honorable senator further that the Joint House Committee has nothing at all to do with the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- The Senate has no House Committee with separate functions. We elect a certain number of senators to act with a certain number of the House of Representatives on a Joint House Committee, and our representatives on that Committee have no separate identity. Will any honorable senator claim that members of another House should dictate to the Senate as to the payment of the servants of the Senate, or their hours and conditions of work, or that members of another place should submit to conditions being imposed on the officers of their House by the Senate? The claim would not stand for a single moment. I was accused of having smuggled these increases through the Senate, and that is why I feel warmly on. the matter. </para>

                            <para>- It can only be said to have been smuggled through because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> straggled away from their duties in the chamber, because when the Estimates for 1913-14 were before us, I explained every particular fully; and to-day I have given the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reference in order that honorable members may look up the matter for themselves. Seeing that all this took place eighteen months ago, it would seem that there was some motive quite apart from a discussion of the merits of the case, behind the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie in bringing the matter forward to-day. I simply endeavoured to uphold the dignity of the Senate by maintaining the status of its officers. Perhaps my hands were forced a little; but when honorable members of another place, without a single word of criticism or discussion, were willing to raise the salaries of their servants, and at the same time offered criticism in regard to any increase in the salaries of officers of the Senate, and honorable senators take up the cue, and are led by the nose by the other Chamber to criticise the officers of the .Senate, though at the same time they do not say a word in regard to the officers in another place, it is time that those in charge of the honour of the Senate should do their duty and defend its officers from attack. Honorable senators generally would be acting with dignity if they would have some observance for the honour of the Chamber, rather than lay themselves open to attack from another place. These increases were made as from 1st July, 1913, and they were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> on 7th February, 1914. A full discussion took place in this Chamber at the end of 1913, and honorable senators can see the report of the debate on pages 4599 to 4601 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1913. They are not increases that have been made during war time, and if they are to be subject to criticism on any ground, the increases granted to the officers of another place should have been equally open to criticism. </para>

                            <para>- I object to criticism from members of the House of Representatives upon increases given to officers of the Senate unless they equally discuss increases to their own officers. I do not say that the Senate should be free from criticism, or that the House of Representatives should be free from criticism ; but when members of another place granted increases to their officers without a word of criticism, and immediately began an attack upon the Senate, we were entitled to express our resentment. It was another place that first granted these increases. As Senator Turley has already pointed out, there is such a thing as seniority among the officers of Parliament. Should we allow the seniority of the officers of the Senate to be sacrificed because members of another House choose to be generous to their own officers? Honorable senators would not tolerate such a thing, and if we had done so, they would have had just as much ground for complaint against myself as they appear to have now because of the step that was taken. </para>

By accident, I struck the right word at the opportune time. The history of these increases is rather curious, and shows the anomalous position in which officers of Parliament are placed through being subject to two authorities. The  Speaker  of the House of Representatives fixes the salaries of the officers in that chamber, and the  President  fixes the salaries of the officers in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I know; but, in any case, the increases were improper. Officials getting Â£900 a year could not be said to be underpaid. There was no sweating in connexion with their salaries. There were numbers of other officials, poorly-paid men, in whose case there would have been some justification for granting an increase. I think it was very ill-advised for the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, in the first place, to increase the salary of his  Clerk,  and also ill-advised on the part of the  President  to increase the salary of the  Clerk  of the Senate. There may be some reason why the salaries of the officials of both Houses should be the same - why the  Clerk  in one House should not be allowed to get a point on the  Clerk  in the other. But really I do not see where it comes in. The country has to bear expenditure which I think it ought not to be called upon to suffer. In any case, it is too late now to interfere with the salaries. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true. This increase was improper in itself. I think that the principle which ought to run right through the Public Service is that the men in the lower grades, who are paid a mere living wage, ought, if increases are to be given, to get them. I would point out that, the lowest man in the Service cannot be dispensed with any more than the highest man therein. No doubt some honorable senators will tell me that for an ordinary position you can get dozens of men. True it is that you can get dozens of men for any position that is vacant to-day, and it does not matter whether it is the highest or lowest position. If you need one man to fill a high position, you can probably have your choice of half-a-dozen or a dozen; so that it does not give the capacity of the highest officials any added value. As I have said, the principle which ought to run through the Service is that the men who are on the margin of a living wage ought to be seen to first, and that those who are well up in the scale - that is, above the living standard - should have to wait until the others have been dealt with according to the principle I have laid down. </para>

                        <para>. - The Committee is always entitled to the fullest information with regard to every vote, and so that there shall be no misconception in the future in regard to the salaries paid in the Senate Department, I want to take honorable senators into my fullest confidence in regard to the new arrangement which has been made consequent upon the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward.</inline> He has retired on three months' leave of absence on full pay, at the end of which time he will be entitled to a pension under the terms of his State service. That is a constitutional obligation with which the Senate has nothing to do, and over which it has no power. Since his retirement, I have re-arranged the offices, and, to some extent, the duties. I have appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan</inline> to be  Clerk  Assistant at a salary of Â£700 as compared with the salary of Â£775 paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward,</inline> and giving him, subject to review by Parliament, the right to an increase of Â£25 per annum for three years until he reaches the salary which was drawn by his predecessor. The Secretary of the Select Committees, who is also Usher of the Black Rod and Accountant, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. U'Ren,</inline> who has been appointed to the office in the room of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan,</inline> at a salary of Â£500, with the right to an- increase to bring him up to the maximum salary. The  Clerk  of the Papers is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Broinowski,</inline> who now occupies, at a salary of Â£310, the position which was formerly occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. U'Ren</inline> and a new assistant clerk has been appointed at a salary of Â£210. The net result of the whole re-arrangement is that, notwithstanding the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward</inline> was drawing three months' full pay on leave of absence, there will be a saving of Â£141 this year, and next year, and the year after, the saving will be greater, so that for the period of three years there will be a saving of something like Â£150 a year. There is one other matter which I wish to point out, and that is that there has been some re-arrangement of the duties of the officers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan,</inline> who was  Clerk  of Select Committees and Usher of the Black Rod, has been, for a number of years, Secretary to, and practically manager of the work of, the Joint House Committee, which includes the refreshment rooms, and he has a very great deal of important work to do in connexion with the Senate. In arranging the duties T thought that the Assistant  Clerk  might very well retain the secretaryship of the Joint House Committee. </para>

                            <para>- No. Formerly there used to be a separate allowance for the position, but it was thought that it would be more conducive to economy 'and efficiency if every officer was put down for  a  definite salary, and one had not to look through the Estimates to see if he was drawing anything else or not. That is, I think,  a  very good principle.  I  consider that the re-arrangement will apportion the work better among the officers, and. make for efficiency. If there is any other item on which I can give information, I shall be only too pleased to do so.  -I  thought it was right for the Senate to know what new arrangements have been, made consequent upon the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - I could not follow the  President  very well when he was detailing to the Committee the changes which have been made, but I find several differences between the Estimates as scheduled to the Appropriation Bill and the Estimates of revenue and expenditure, which were circulated some time ago. I have always thought that, when an opportunity offered itself the position of Usher of the Black Rod. might very well be abolished. I see that that distinctive appellation has been completely cut out. I do not know whether that will be an advantage or not. Anyhow, it has disappeared from the face of the Estimates <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

It would be  very much cheaper, and, I believe, a great deal more effective than to pay  a  man Â£600 a year, practically to do nothing. I have been here for fourteen years, and  I  have never seen an honorable senator yet distinguishing himself in the way suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline> No man has had to be removed from the chamber during my experience, and  I  do  not think it is likely, except, perhaps, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> in one of his exalted moods, might require the attention of an officer of this character. But, :seriously, I think that the  Clerk  Assistant, in addition to his other duties, might be appointed Usher of the Black Rod, because the Ushership  is clearly a sinecure in so far as dealing with honorable senators ie concerned. I often see the Usher of the Black Rod sitting here. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I think that he might be doing something more useful, at any rate, than coming in and sitting there. I was of the opinion that those in charge of this matter might very well have effected a reformation and a little saving by making the  Clerk  Assistant Usher of the Black Rod as well; but, apparently, they have thought otherwise. When I compare the schedule to the Appropriation Bill with the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure, I find that in the former the  Clerk  of the Papers and Accountant is down for a salary of Â£500 a year. In the Estimates he is down for Â£420. That sum was an increase of Â£15 on the salary paid during the previous year. I would be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will tell us exactly what is the salary of the  Clerk  and Accountant. Then there is the  Clerk  of Records. I do not find his office set out in the Estimates at all. He gets Â£440. All these officers have received increases, and instead of a less sum being paid to them this year than last year, the reverse will be the case. Last year their salaries totalled Â£6,373, whereas this year they will amount to Â£6,424. I protest against the continuance of the office of Usher of the Black Rod. I think that it is entirely unnecessary, and that even if it were necessary it might advantageously be conjoined with the office of  Clerk  Assistant. </para>

                        was good enough to say that my criticism was somewhat belated. I would remind him that that is no fault of mine. This is the first occasion upon which I have had an opportunity to discuss the increases which appear on these Estimates. It is the first occasion upon which those increases have appeared on the Estimates.

                        took particular care not to mention that fact. Upon last year's Estimates no increases were shown. It was not till towards the close of the year - about November or December - that a vote in favour of granting them was carried in this Chamber, on an occasion when I was absent. Had I been present, I would have joined with those who objected to the increases. Several honorable senators took advantage of that opportunity to point out that a salary of Â£900 a year was quite ample for the work performed by the  Clerk  of this Chamber. They affirmed that officers doing equally responsible work outside do not receive as large a salary, notwithstanding that they are continuously employed throughout the year. It is an old maxim that it is better late than never, and as I have not had an earlier opportunity of objecting to these increases--

                            <para>- We do not want to bite. I am quite satisfied with, my bark. I do not apologize for my action. I am entering my protest upon the first opportunity available to me against an increase which I say is unwarranted. Those who like to go outside "and justify this sort of thing are quite at liberty to do so. I am not prepared to do it. A salary of Â£900 a year for the  Clerk  of this Senate is ample, and the granting of an additional Â£100 is a downright waste of public  money. I am not going to say one thing in this chamber, and pose outside in another guise altogether. In my opinion, it was the duty of the House Committee to deal with these matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> says that there is no House Committee- </para>

When I think that an increase in the salary of any officer is justifiable I shall be prepared to move it, or to support it if a motion is submitted by any other honorable senator. I will not wait until I am forced to take action because somebody else takes action. There is no justification for this throwing away of Â£100 of the taxpayers' money.. If Â£90O was not a sufficient salary for the <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Senator Givens</inline> should have- been, courageous  enough to have proposed an Increase, and not have  been  forced' to take action by reason of the action of somebody else.

                            <para>- I say that the increase in the salary of the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives did appear on the previous Estimates. The whole matter was fully discussed at' that- time, and- an explanation was given. Also all the increases appeared in the Supplementary Estimates passed some time ago, and then there was a full opportunity for discussion if honorable senators desired it. There was not a single word of discussion upon the matter in this Chamber. But when the increases were proposed for corresponding officers in the Senate, a storm of criticism broke out elsewhere. Some honorable members appeared to think that the seniority of officers of this chamber should be abrogated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie complained that I did not make the increases on my own account, but that I waited until my hand was forced. </para>

When they appeared in print, I plainly told the Government of the day that I did not think the Senate would allow its officers to be passed over, and that unless they received corresponding increases, the Estimates would be held up. I refused to take action until the Estimates  appeared.  Then, when the matter was brought forward in this Chamber, I gave honorable senators every information in connexion with it. Now, after the lapse of eighteen or twenty months, it is again brought forward as if it were something entirely new.

I have nothing to add to that statement. There ought to be some finality to our proceedings, and a matter once fully discussed and threshed out should not be brought up year after year, putting the officers of the Senate in an invidious position as compared with the officers of another place. Comparisons, it is said, are always odious, and comparisons of this kind lead to constant bickering and strife, which is not desirable in the interests of the service itself. </para>

The printed copy of the Estimates that I hold in my hand proves my contention beyond doubt. The increase of salary for the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives appeared in the Estimates for the year before, but the increase for the  Clerk  of the Senate did not appear there; consequently this is the first opportunity, so far as the Estimates are concerned, that I or any other member of the Senate have had to raise the question. </para>

                            <para>- That is an entirely different matter. If I had taken up the attitude that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> apparently took up when the matter was first mooted, and refused to recommend the increase, I should have stood by that attitude. It appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> was first approached to put an increase of Â£100 or some other amount on theEstimates, but refused to be a party to it, believing that the sum already voted was ample for the office. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> been anxious to back up the action of his predecessor, as he tries to make out, he would have stood by the attitude he originally took up, even though the  Speaker  of another place put an increase on the Estimates for the  Clerk  of his House ; but he backed down. He says he did so because of the dignity of the Senate, but I do not know that there is very much dignity in the whole position.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> - I am not concerned with the dignity of the Senate, but I am concerned to see that justice is done to our officers. </para>

                            <para>- Just so. I think it is high time we made a protest which will have some business in it. I do not wish to divide the Committee uselessly;, but we must' do something if we intend that the Estimates shall be presented to us in time to deal with them . It does not matter what item a request is made upon, so long as it enables us to put our case in such a way that the House of Representatives will understand that in future the Estimates must come before the Senate in reasonable time for their discussion. If every time we deal with the Estimates, we allow the same excuses to be made in order to have them passed, we shall continue to have nothing but apologies. I seriously ask the Committee to say now whether they are prepared to insist upon the Estimates being presented to them in time, or whether they are satisfied to allow themselves to be treated in the future as they have been in the past. </para>

The men who have painted those portraits have undergone training in National Galleries. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> understand anything at all about art ? I know something of the work these men have to go through before they are&gt; recognised in the artistic world. They had to spend years at the National Gallery before they could earn a shilling for themselves as artists. </para>

Labour has given too little consideration to the importance of the artistic point of "view. We should appeal to the best instincts of Australians, and try to elevate their minds and tastes. Criticisms have been levelled at the paintings in the Queen's Hall often by people who do not know the difference between a pastel, an oil colour, or a water colour. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say a few words now that this subject has been brought up for discussion. I interjected just now that it was in 190S that this movement to have portraits painted of distinguished Australians connected with the Federal movement and the early days of this Parliament was established. I may inform honorable senators that when Lord Dudley came to Australia, and took over Government House, I, as Minister of Home Affairs at the time, happened to be there  on  the first Saturday afternoon after his arrival. I could not but be struck at the absence from that building of anything in the nature of furniture, pictures, or interior properties owned by the Commonwealth. I realized that the time would come when we would have a Federal Government House at the Seat of Government, and a Parliament House erected there. At the time of which I speak the Commonwealth held nothing in the nature of pictures, with the exception of some of those which are hung in our Library to-day. The movement started with the idea which then occurred to me of obtaining pictures which would be the property of the Commonwealth for all time. I gave expression to my views through the medium of a certain organ which deals particularly with subjects of that character in Australia. I made the suggestion in November of that year that the Federal authorities should proceed to have commemorated historic personages associated with the Federal movement, and with the earliest days of the Federal Parliament. Every one of the pictures to which Senator Stewart has made reference will ultimately find its permanent place, either in the Commonwealth Government House at Canberra, in the Parliament House there, or in some other of the public buildings. It should be remembered that if we were not preparing, as we arc now, for the purpose, we should have to buy paintings of some kind for those buildings, and what more fitting works of art could we have than those which deal with distinctly Australian subjects ? </para>

The portrait gallery, which is gradually being built up, is not intended for the Queen's Hall in Parliament House, Melbourne, but for the future public establishments of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - When this movement was initiated it was hailed with delight bv the newspapers and the public generally. Everything connected with it went on well until the time arrived when a couple of gentlemen belonging to the Labour party attained eminent positions entitling them to have their portraits hung in the Queen's Hall. Almost immediately after that and ever since that time the news papers have endeavoured to kill the movement with ridicule. If no Labour men had attained positions entitling them to have their portraits included amongst those hung in the Queen's Hall I have no doubt that the press would have continued to regard the proposal as a  splendid  national idea. I do not profess to De a judge of art, but I like anything Australian, and, in my opinion, all those who have had their portraits hung in the Queen's Hall have attained positions in the Commonwealth entitling them to  remembrance.  They have, in my view, done far more for the moulding of the destinies of the Commonwealth than any imported officials could possibly do. If the portraits  hung  in the Queen's Hall were confined to imported holders of titles, I have little doubt that in certain quarters they would be viewed with veneration and admiration. </para>

I did not for a moment suggest that the movement should be altogether discontinued, but I do think that it should be suspended until better times come round. We shall have to pay for these pictures if we keep on painting them, with borrowed money, and I do not think that is a very nice thing to have to do. If I get any support I shall divide the Committee on my request, because, under present conditions, I regard the painting of these portraits as pure  extravagance. </para>

                        <para>. - The fact that this Congress was the most important of its kind that has been held in any part of Australia is recognised by the sum provided in these Estimates to cover the expenses of these gentlemen of high scientific attainments, who came to Australia to attend it. Had it not been for the titanic struggle in Europe, the leading newspapers of Australia would have devoted considerable space to the proceedings of the Congress. I followed with more than a passing interest a number of the papers read there and the discussions thereon, but since then events have so overshadowed the Congress that its proceedings are not as well retained in memory as they would be if a handy report of them were published. Such a report would be very helpful as well as historical ; but, instead of having a voluminous report containing the whole of the proceedings of that Congress, the Government should consider the advisability of issuing pamphlets dealing with the separate subjects discussed. </para>

                        <para>.- Though Â£5,000 is provided for travelling expenses for the High Court Justices, there is only Â£10,000 provided for the travelling expenses of members of Parliament, which sum, presumably, also covers the travelling expenses of officers of both Houses. A sum of Â£5,000 for seven Judges and their officials, seems to me to be altogether out of proportion to what should be  provided  on. the Estimates. I think that it is only right that the Committee should have some information on the subject. </para>

It must be remembered that, owing to the number of members who travel, a. special rate per member - Â£42 - I understand, is charged. The number of the Judges, of course, is very much less, and their travelling has to he paid for in the ordinary way. In regard to the other travelling expenses, that is the only expenditure for travelling which comes.' under the vote for Parliament, and it is. to cover the cost of the cabs which take the  luggage  of members of Parliament from the railway station to Parliament House. </para>

                        <para>. - With regard to the Estimates for the. Department of External Affairs, can the Minister in charge of them give the Committee any information as to who the next High Commissioner is  likely  to be ? I also wish to know whether it is proposed to continue the advertising of Australia in Great Britain and Ireland ? I notice that during the last financial year Â£10,000 was. expended on advertising Australia in those countries. I do not know whether it is necessary to continue the advertising or not. I am very doubtful about that. Then I find an item for the development of the Australian export trade to Europe. The complaint of a number of persons recently has been that our export trade has developed far too rapidly," and left the people of Australia bare as regards a number of the necessaries of life. I desire to know whether, in the opinion of the Minister, the payment of this sum of Â£2000 ought to be continued? I think that he might give the Committee some information, too, as to what the duties of the High Commissioner are, and what useful service he performs on behalf of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>. - I do not for a moment anticipate that the whole of the Â£10,000 will be spent in advertising the resources of Australia in any short period of time. But I would like to get from the Government a definite statement as to what is being done in Great Britain and Ireland at present from the advertising point of view. We read in the press the other day that the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Benalla,</inline> on which, unfortunately for the passengers an accident happened, which turned out not to be so bad as was expected, is bringing 700 <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> 800 new arrivals for different parts of Australia. I have always said that there is ample room, not merely for our present population, but for ten times that number, if the right policy is followed, and Australia is managed as it is being managed just now, with a Labour Government in power, on a business basis. </para>

                            <para>- That is true. At a time when Australia is doing all she possibly can to play her part in the war for the protection of her territory, and for the defence of the Empire - when Australians are leaving, many of them, good and permanent positions, they ought to be assured that, in the event of their return - and I sincerely hope and trust that the great majority of them will come back - no policy will be followed in regard to bringing immigrants here which will be to their detriment. There is very great distress in every direction. Men in different trades and occupations are out of work, and have been idle for a considerable period. In those circumstances the Government ought to halt before they expend any more money in advertising Australia, especially during the currency of the war. It is not fair to those Australians who are fighting for the Empire, and it is not right to bring people to Australia at the present juncture because of the distress that exists. </para>

I hold that money and effort expended at the present juncture in the Old Country would be money and effort wasted. For those reasons I would like to get, if I can, any information at the Minister's disposal as to what is being done in the Old Country now, especially through the office of the High Commissioner,in respect to advertising our resources. </para>

                            <para>- One very good and substantial reason why I cannot do that is that I do not know the name. With regard to the item for the development of Australian export trade to Europe, I keep on referring to the fact that this is a Bill to appropriate money already spent. At the time the money was being spent it was done with the view to opening up channels for trade on the Continent - for instance, in trying to develop a market for apples, butter, and various other products - and there was a number of trade commissioners. The position was fully explained when that policy was initiated. The names of the officers were stated, and also the remuneration they were to receive. Some of them were to act in an honorary capacity, and others were to get a certain amount. All that business has come to an end. The passing of this Bill will not affect it one iota, because the business is all interrupted by the war. The same remark applies in regard to immigration. At the present Â»moment the energies of the High Commissioner's staff are devoted to the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris,</inline> who, I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> is the medical officer he referred to, was sent to England to examine immigrants for Australia before they left that country. An arrangement was made to utilize doctors all over the United Kingdom, so that we should have a medical examination of an immigrant before he came here, and not, as under the old system, after he arrived here. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. As regards the future policy of the Government on immigration, development of export trade, and advertising our resources, I put it to honorable senators that it is not the practice for a Government, in dealing with a measure to wind up a financial year, to forecast what they are going to do in the next financial year. An opportunity is taken by the Treasurer when he introduces his Budget to intimate the policy of the Government in connexion with the financial proposals for the year. I have already intimated that the Treasurer does not  expect  to be able to bring forward his Budget before the proposed adjournment of both Houses, but he does expect to be able to make a financial statement next week, I believe, in which he will deal with the various items of policy, and forecast them, so far as he can, as a sort of preliminary to his Budget speech. Therefore I do not think that I should . be asked to-day to state what is the policy of the Government for the future concerning immigration, advertising, or the development of export trade. </para>

                            <para>- I am not. It is quite possible that it may have arrived to-day. .Personally, I am entirely iri accord with the policy of the Department of External Affairs in regard to mining and pastoral matters in the Territory, save that T think some of the pastoral areas have. been tied up for too long a period. I do not expect much development in agriculture there in the immediate future. Before agriculture can he successful in the Territory, markets must be created and means of communication and transport provided. In my judgment, the best method of attracting population to the Territory is b.y stimulating mining development. It has been the experience of every State of the Commonwealth that population invariably follows mining development. I feel sure that if a profitable mineral field were opened up in the Territory there would be a great rush of settlers there in just, the same way as there was a rush to Kimberley and other parts of the world. </para>

In the preface to the Administrator's report for 1913, the position of the Territory is not put in a very attractive light. Certainly it is not put in a manner that is likely to appeal to the people. Indeed, the whole of that preface rather throws a damper upon the prospect of attracting population there, and we all recognise that population is what is wanted. For instance, the Administrator says - </para>

                            <para>- Other people assure me that the climate of the Northern Territory is very similar to that of Northern Queensland, where a few years ago it was stated that a white man could not live. It appears to me that the South is calling the Administrator himself. He answers the call pretty frequently, too, for he appears to visit Melbourne every year, and to spend two or three months here. If the South is calling him so strongly and emphatically, it is a wonder to me that he does not respond to it by staying here permanently. </para>

We have had a good illustration of that in Queensland, where the Central Sugar Mills have been administered by an unsympathetic Government, and by a sugar bureau, which has no sympathy with the idea of Governmentowned mills. As a result, an endeavour was made to cause a failure of those mills by writing off huge sums, and by smothering up profits in reserve. In similar circumstances, the same sort of disabilities will be experienced in the Northern Territory. I hope that the Administrator will exhibit a greater concern for the people of the Territory. I am informed that he has Government House there filled with Chinese servants. That is not a very good example for him to set if he believes in the policy of a White Australia. Women have gone into various parts of Queensland to undertake pioneering work - to places where the climate is just as tropical as it is in the Territory. If the Administrator really holds the beliefs which are credited to him, and if he desires to make the Northern Territory a success, in future reports- he will not give such a damping description of the place. </para>

                            <para>- It is a pretty "hot" description in one sense. In my opinion, it is a description which is calculated to keep people away from the Territory rather than to attract them to it. I have no desire to detain the Committee, otherwise I could quote more extracts to the same purport. The Administrator seems to exhibit a preference for people from the southern States of Europe. He appears to deprecate the idea of Australians selecting land there. </para>

                            <para>- Sometimes three or four hundred. The Administrator, I hold, should endeavour to attract population to the Northern Territory, and the Department of External Affairs will be well advised if it endeavours to stimulate the mining industry there, as the forerunner to the general development of the country. The residents of the Territory generally, and these of Darwin in particular, have many grievances. At Darwin they chiefly complain of want of accommodation. There they have been preparing a petition for presentation to the Minister praying that some sort of a State Building Society should be initiated on lines similar to those of the Workers Dwellings Department in Queensland, under which hundreds of homes have been built with the aid of advances from the State, the principal and interest being paid back in rental payments extending over twenty-five years. Some such scheme could, and should, be initiated in Darwin by the External Affairs Department under Government auspices, because the accommodation there is very limited, and the population is increasing, although slowly. I look forward to an improvement in that regard now the Government have taken over the hotels, in which they will surely increase the accommodation, so that visitors will no longer have to sleep five and six in a single room. I trust that earnest and decisive consideration will be given 'to the necessity of providing dwellings by means of advances from Savings Banks, State Banks, State Building Societies, or a Workers Dwellings Act under the External Affairs Department. The residents of the Territory also desire the creation of an Advisory Board, elected by adult suffrage, to work in conjunction with and advise the Administrator on questions with which they may be more conversant than he is. Even if the Administrator were the most capable man in the world, and well informed on all phases of industry in the Territory, it would be expecting too much of him to ask him to do justice to every one of them. An Advisory Board on the lines indicated would give the people in the Territory some form of representation to which they are fully entitled, and at the same time would be an advantage to the Administrator, the Department and the Government. I advocate some sort of public representation for the residents of this remote but very important part of the Commonwealth, because they have none in the National Parliament. Like the people in the Federal Capital Territory, they are aliens so far as this body is concerned. An alteration will have to be made in that regard before very long, for it is most anomalous and unfair that two portions of the Commonwealth should have no say in the election of members of the National Parliament. The first thing to do is to give them a voice in the conduct of their own affairs. The Minister  of External Affairs has wisely abolished the old conservative town council or Board, and created a body to be elected on adult suffrage to deal with municipal or shire matters, but the fly in the ointment is the fact that Chinese are allowed to vote. No Asiatics have been naturalized since the Commonwealth took control of the naturalization question, but many Chinese in Darwin hold land, and the Minister told me in a conversation that their rights could not well be abrogated, seeing that they were property holders. I would advise the Minister and the Administrator to be very careful on that phase of the question. I had some experience in that regard in Bowen, Queensland, where Chinese, naturalized under the State laws, were ratepayers, and had their names on the municipal and shire council rolls. On comparing the ratepayers' roll with a list of Chinese farmers compiled for me, I found that many Chinese, who had been naturalized prior to 1902, and whose names were on the ratepayers' roll iu Bowen, had departed years before for China, but their names were retained on the rolls, and new chum Chinese, not land-owners, exercised the votes of the absent and naturalized Chinese at every council election. That- scandal went on for years, and I fear its repetition in the Northern Territory, if the External Affairs Department allows unnaturalized Chinese to exercise the same voting rights as Europeans at town council or other elections there. From reports and information received, I believe the- Chinese of the Northern Territory are not of the subservient, docile class that we know in the southern States, or even in Northern Queensland, where they are obedient and humble. In the Northern Territory they are described to me as being quite the opposite, and even defiant. I understand that the Chinese children, when playing at soldiers in the streets of Darwin, knock down their soldiers and say, " Another  blanky  white man killed," although "  blanky  " is not the word they use. The Chinese  are  becoming a menace there. When the volunteers were leaving Darwin, they were taunted by prominent Chinese with going to fight for a country that could pay them only 5s. a. day. One of the taunts thrown at them  was,  " You heroes guarding the cable station are paid 5s. a day. Is that all the 'great British Government can pay you?" The Chinese of Darwin are therefore not the apparently simple fellows  wet  meet in the south. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps if the honorable senator were in Chinatown, in Darwin, he might not care to resent the taunt. If it is anything like the China-towns that we used to know in Cairns, Charters Towers, and Townsville a few years ago, the Minister, if he were in one of those narrow lanes, would put up with the taunts or find himself in a very serious position. It is my belief that the Chinese of Darwin are so defiant that they would not stop at a small matter, and I sincerely trust the Department will' review the decision to allow them to vote. Every white man ought surely to assert himself in a case of this kind. If the Government place Chinese on the same level as Australian citizens, the pioneer who goes to the Northern Territory to brave the difficulties and disadvantages described by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> in his damping report, will find himself in a very invidious  position. </para>

I have been there, and travelled inland as far as the Katherine River, and am in personal communication with several residents. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth's</inline> report can justly be condemned as a damping report. He has done what every official should do - given a fair, just, and impartial report to Parliament. It is not his duty, or within his province, to paint in glowing terms &gt; state of affairs which does not actually exist. Many honorable senators who have visited Darwin must admit that the Administrator's description of it as a " hot small town " is accurate. The Administrator is not speaking disparagingly of the whole Territory, because no man is a stronger advocate than he is of its development on White Australian lines. I have lectured a number of times on the Territory, and whenever the picture of the Administrator has appeared on the screen, although not a hero worshipper, I have said he was the best man for the position, and metaphorically taken my hat off to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> employed a Chinese cook at Government House. As a matter of fact, although I am opposed to the introduction to Australia of the Asiatic Tace, like every other man who is in favour of a White Australia, when T went to Darwin I had no alternative but to go to a Chinese tailor to get a suit of clothes fit to wear in that climate, and </para>

                        painted an awful picture of what is occurring at Port Darwin at the present time. The Chinese to whom he referred are peaceful, law-abiding citizens, living in the main street of Port Darwin, and many of them are naturalized British subjects. I am not "prepared to say that they should be called upon to leave the place because they were introduced by a Liberal Government to assist in building the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Greek.

                            <para>- I was in pretty close touch with the inhabitants of Fort Darwin while I was there, and I do not believe that the Chinese population would rise in a body against the militant whites that I know to be living there at the present time. I wish to refer to another question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> He blames the Administrator for not doing more than' he has done in the way of building homes for Government employees and ordinary workmen at Port Darwin. One of the principal reasons why <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> is criticised by the press of Port Darwin, and by many of the townspeople, is that he has done the very thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has blamed him for not doing. An outcry was raised by the Port Darwin press, and its echo found voice in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> because it was stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> was taking the park lands and the public lands of the people of the Territory. That outcry arose in this way: When the Commonwealth took over this Territory, which is six and a quarter times as large as Victoria, the Government spent a considerable sum of money there. The people of Port Darwin naturally thought that they would obtain the unearned increment arising from Commonwealth expenditure. They said that, as the Commonwealth were sending an army of officials to Port Darwin, they would make the Government pay through the nose for the land which they had held for a number of years, and on which they had spent  little or nothing in the shape of improvements. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> recognising that the officials should be properly housed in that tropical climate, asked these patriotic citizens of Port Darwin what they would sell their land for, in order that he might build homes on it for the Government employees. They at once put the price of the land up by 50, 60, and 100 per cent., and left him no alternative but to take certain lands that were not required by the people of Port Darwin as a park, because there are many square miles of land available for such a purpose in the vicinity of the town. He built homes for the Government employees on these lands, and he was then charged with taking the park lands from the people. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> has made enemies because he has trodden on the corns of vested interests up there. He has fallen foul of Messrs. Allen and Company, and others who have been holding land there for a long time. He has trodden, also, on the corns of the man who is the Port Darwin correspondent of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and who sends down reports to that newspaper intended to inflame the minds of members of this Parliament and of people outside against the Administrator of the Northern Territory. I am not saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> is infallible. Like any other man who has undertaken a big task, he has made mistakes; but I do not know any one to whom honorable members of this Parliament could point as a better Administrator of the Territory. He is a big man, and a big Australian. He has a large faith in the capabilities of the country, and is prepared to take his coat off and work. He lias taken his wife and children up to Port Darwin that he might be able to show that white women can live in the tropics without deterioration, which some critics of the White Australia policy hold to be impossible. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> that, according to the Administrator, people who go up to the Northern Territory are lured back again by the call of the South. I believe that that is a fact. Men go up there expecting that the conditions under which they will have to live and labour will be much the same as those they have experienced in the southern States, and it is no wonder that they are lured by the call of the South. I can give a concrete example in the case of a man who was very anxious to go to the Territory, and who went up to Port Darwin with me three or four years ago. He is a man who stood for election to the Federal Parliament. After making repeated representations, and having the necessary qualifications, he was appointed to a certain position in the Territory. He had not been five minutes in the place before he said, " This is no good to me ; I want to get back again to the South." In making the statement referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks, Dr. Gilruth</inline> only spoke the truth. Unless intending settlers are of the pioneering type, possessed of stout hearts and strong right arms, it is of no use for them to go to the Northern Territory. I Should not like any man in the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> to report otherwise than he has clone on these matters. I wish to say a word on the subject of the development of the oil-fields of Papua. A certain amount of money has been spent upon investigation, and I have read with interest the report presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> upon the development of the oilfields on the Valala  River. Only this week the price of kerosene has risen by 6d. per tin in Melbourne, and, although the Government cannot have very much money at their disposal, in view of the very heavy drain upon their funds to prosecute the war, I hope they will try to do something to develop the Papuan oil-fields, and to place on the market in :i commercial way the petroleum that we know exists in the region of the  Valala  River. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> has proved that oil can he obtained there, and I should like to know whether, without an alteration of the Constitution, we would have the power to place it on the market in Australia, and sell it generally to the people at a cheaper rate than is being charged at the present time for kerosene oil. When people are crying out about the high price of kerosene, I hope the Government will do something to carry out the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> and., if petroleum is found to exist in large quantities in Papua, as we have reason to believe it does, they will take the necessary steps for the erection of refineries in order that, after the referenda proposals have been carried, we may be in a position to compete with the oil trusts and other people who are at present charging an exorbitant price for this illuminant, which is so necessary, particularly in the homes of the poorer people of the community. </para>

                        <para>.- With respect to the suggested1 delay in the presentation of the report on the Northern Territory, the explanation is that a change has been made with respect to the Administrator's reports .concerning the Northern Territory, so that in future they will refer to the financial year ending on 30th June, and not as hitherto to the calendar year. Consequently, the current Administrator's report, which, in the ordinary course would refer to the year ending 31st December last, will on this occasion deal with the eighteen months expiring on the 30th -June. As soon as it is received, copies will be laid on the table of the Senate. I am sure that honorable senators do not expect me to traverse the various matters to which they have directed attention. The Minister of External Affairs proposes to visit the Northern Territory and make himself acquainted at first hand with many of the questions that have arisen in connexion with its administration. I have no doubt that after his visit he will be better armed to cope with the many problems arising in that Territory. </para>

                        <para>. - I have here a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laurie,</inline> a prospector at Tanami, which reveals a condition of things in that portion of the Northern Territory requiring a remedy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laurie</inline> has been at Tanami for eight years, and has persistently stood to his ground there. The field suffered for a long time from the lack of a mail service, until the Federal Government saw the wisdom of connecting this place, where there are so many pioneers, with Hall's Creek, and there has been a .mail service to the place for the last three months. To get to Tanami at present the traveller has to depend on the wells on the route, and the work of keeping those wells in repair has been thrust upon the prospectors at Tanami from time to time. Sometimes they did the work, without payment, on their own account, and in their own time, but the Government gave a contract to one of the prospectors to keep the wells in repair. </para>

                        <para>When the Warden arrived here one of the prospectors asked him to pay the balance due on the contract. He said that he knew nothing about it, and had received no instructions, but would pay if they had any papers to show that the money was due.. I happened to have a copy of their agreement which the Director of Mines gave me, and produced it, and he paid the amount due. So that that matter is fixed up after the men waiting fifteen months for their money. </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that the Government should make better provision to meet the needs of people in such remote places as Tanami. It is not very encouraging for men so far removed from civilization as are the pioneers of Tanami to have to wait for fifteen months for payment for work performed for the Commonwealth. I have said that the wet season supervened and prevented the Warden reaching the place at the time first arranged, but the Warden or some other official of the Mines Department could have gone to Tanami by the mail route. He could have gone round to Western Australia, and on to Hall's Creek, and from there to Tanami; and if that course had been followed, this man would have been paid for his work long before he was paid. </para>

                    <para>Some criticisms have been passed upon the Administrator of the Northern Territory in this Chamber. So far as I know or have read of this gentleman, he appears to me to be the right type of man to fill an awkward and difficult position. He is no armchair official, but has gone about the Territory more actively than perhaps any other man occupying a corresponding official position would have done. He does not depend on others under him to supply him with the information that he needs. He makes personal inquiries. He seems to be the most industrious man that I have read of for many a long day in the position which he holds. The papers laid on the table in connexion with the Daly River settlement indicate it. The type of settler selected for the Northern Territory has been anything but the right kind. Men totally unfit for pioneering work in a climate such as that of the Northern Territory were sent to the Daly River, and they endeavoured to take advantage of the Government to an unreasonable extent. They were receiving assistance on such a lavish scale that the Government, apparently regardless of the Treasury aspect, must have been prepared to spend their last pound in order to support these men on their holdings. However, <inline font-weight="bold">-Dr. Gilruth</inline> found that one settler had had a case of grog delivered to him as one of the necessaries that a settler should receive from a paternal Government. This fact shows <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> manner in which the Administrator is carrying out his duties. He very quickly brought up with a round turn this man who had been endeavouring to get at the Government in such a glaring manner. The Government have tried all they possibly could to pull through the settlers on the Daly River, but, unfortunately, the settlement has not been successful. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laurie,</inline> who has had a lengthy experience of the Northern Territory, says that the Administrator is a man who can be trusted, and that he is holding the scales fairly ; he says that though the Administrator has not done everything that should have been done for the mining -industry, because of the scarcity of funds at his disposal, his administration, as it has filtered down through minor officials, shows that he is the best man who has yet been in control of the Territory. We should recognise the difficulty of the Administrator's position, lt is not an attractive country, but he is taking the utmost pains to acquaint himself with it. At the same time he is trying to deal fairly and fearlessly with all sections of the community. The fact that he has certainly incurred the ill-will of many property-holders at Port Darwin - the men who have gained most through the action of the Commonwealth in taking over the Territory, and who have been interested in booming the place - has, in my opinion, done a great deal to set his reputation at a very high level. I have seen reports in the press painting him in many colours, but when possessed of the information disclosed to us this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> we can understand these reports, and look behind them and see the object that the writers have in view. These people would not provide the dwellings required, and yet they find fault with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> for having done so. The Administrator has steadily endeavoured to preserve the interests of the Commonwealth, irrespective of what the local residents might think of his actions, and that he is fulfilling his duties well and faithfully we can gather, not only from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laurie's</inline> opinion, but from the regard in which he is held by others who have come in contact with him. I hope the Minister will take a note of the circumstances that I have spoken of where men employed in such a distant place as Tanami had to wait fifteen months for payment for work performed by them for the Commonwealth. I arn aware that the floods cut off all communication from Darwin, thus preventing the officials from carrying out the arrangements entered into, but had there been more money at the disposal of the Administration, and more officials employed, the work would have been paid for considerably earlier. </para>

                        <para>. - Some time ago there was quite a heated press controversy, that took a very personal form, with regard to the officials sent to the Panama Exposition; in fact, I do not think that I have seen newspaper correspondence equal to it for a long time. Charges were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon,</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and there was doubt in the minds of the people as to where the real fault lay, but I have heard that neither of these gentlemen was to blame, and that both of them were misled by a third party. I do not know how much truth there is in the statement. I thought that the mystery would have been cleared up by the Prime Minister or by some member of the Government. It is time the public should know something about the real facts behind that controversy. The current rumour is that an official, in order to secure a trip to San Francisco, suppressed certain information in the correspondence in his Department, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was not responsible for having misled the Minister. I am informed, on very good authority, that the person really responsible was an official in the Department of External Affairs. I know that this is a very grave statement to make, but I do not make it without having some reason for doing so. I cannot speak dogmatically upon the subject, but my authority for making this statement is in a position in which he can speak with some knowledge of the facts. Can the Minister of Defence give an explanation of the position, so that the people may know the real facts <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- And <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> took his departure quite as abruptly. I was quite disappointed at his action, because I thought he possessed more spirit than to accept the appointment as Commissioner in the circumstances as the country understood them. However, what I have learned subsequently has given quite a different complexion to the whole matter. Instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> having been at fault, I understand that he was chivalrous enough and manly enough to accept blame which should have attached to an official in the Department of External Affairs. And <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> perhaps thinking that he should have acquainted himself with what was in the correspondence, and having taken the responsibility for the report which misled the Minister, felt that he was, to some extent, responsible, and, therefore, could not go back - could not, in fact, make a clear statement of the case. If there is anything in what I have said, surely the Government have some knowledge about it. All that I have said is known in the Department where this business was initiated. I do not think it is very creditable to the Government if they know these facts, and refrain from making them public, because I see nothing wrong in giving publicity to them. If they were misled in the matter, and the fault does -not lie with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> I think that the public should know the truth, in fairness to both parties, because fo leave the controversy as it is would be to leave it at a very unsatisfactory stage. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the Minister of Defence that there is quite a large amount of information other than was contained in the statement. I can assure him that things have been discovered since the Commissioner left these shores. I go further, and say that certain inquiries have been made in the Department, and officials were asked for explanations. The explanations made by the Minister of External Affairs, if they were made on behalf of the Government, presented quite a different aspect of affairs from that which I have indicated, and which I believe is quite correct. However, I do not propose to press the Minister to disclose any Cabinet secrets or do anything of that kind. </para>

                        <para>. - I did think that the progress of this Bill through Committee would have been very much faster than has turned out to be the case. Had there been any prospect of it being completely dealt with before the adjournment for dinner, I would not have had very much to say on a matter which I consider is worthy of comment. Seeing that we have got so near to half-past 6 o'clock, I.do not think that I can be charged with any desire to block the progress of the measure if I sneak on the question of the Panama Exposition and our relations with the great Republic of the West, as it is called. No doubt the regrettable quarrel, if T can so describe it, that took place between the gentleman who represented Australia and the Minister of External Affairs was a thing to be deplored by every well wisher of the Commonwealth . But I am not going to presume to  say  who was right and who was wrong. Probably each was right, or one was quite as wrong as the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has made no deliverance on the matter since he returned to the Commonwealth. and the Minister has spoken out very forcibly from time to time regarding certain features of Australian representation at the Panama Exposition. But whether there was any grave fault committed by our representative there, whether he overstepped the bounds that had been set by the representatives of the various States in Australia, who had been in consultation with the Minister, or whether the Minister was in error in acting somewhat arbitrarily, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> evidently thought, I am not going to determine. In my opinion, the quarrel was regrettable. for it is a deplorable affair that' anything should have occurred to ruffle, or to apparently ruffle, in any way our relations with the great American Republic. </para>

                    <para class="block">On these Estimates there are happily two items, one following the other, which have a very intimate connexion with our relationship to the United States. I refer to the item for the Panama Exposition, and the item for advertising in that country. It is with the latter rather than with the former that I am concerned. I know that there is in this chamber one honorable senator at least - there are probably more - who believes that any expenditure on advertising Australia's resources in America is wasted money. I am not one of that class. I trust that I am capable to a certain extent of looking beyond the present, and glancing at the future. It is most essential to the future of the Commonwealth it is most essential to the future of our Empire - and the Commonwealth is by no means an unimportant unit -that we should cultivate the closest and most amicable relations with the great Republic. Further evidence is given, if it is required, of the desirability of that state of affairs when we reflect on the fact that even to-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> addressed to a Minister a certain question, and it is evidently his opinion that in the United States there is a fairly fruitful financial field to which Australia might have recourse if this unhappy war be prolonged to a greater extent than we expect. </para>

                    <para>.- When the sitting was suspended I was discussing the item for advertising the resources of Australia, particularly in regard to developing our relations with the great Republic of the United States. I had just commenced to refer to what amounted to an expression of opinion on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the United States will no doubt acquire a dominant financial position as the result of this great war, and that that country presents a possibly fruitful field in which the Commonwealth may seek a certain measure of that financial assistance which it will be necessary for us to obtain in order to successfully and continuously prosecute this great struggle. One might spend an hour or two in a discourse which would neither be vain nor profitless in connexion with our relations with the United States. But I do not intend to adopt that course. I shall content myself with a comparatively brief survey of the possibilities in that direction. I do hope that in the forthcoming Budget provision will be made for an increased expenditure for advertising our resources in the United States. We know that that country is an oceanic Power, just as is the Commonwealth. It owns Honolulu, the important possessions of the Philippines. and other islands in tropical waters which are quite contiguous to those recently acquired by us. The United States, I repeat, owns Honolulu, the Sandwich Islands, and the Philippine Islands, whereas we have recently acquired by conquest the Caroline and Marshall Islands. </para>

                        <para>- This is news to me, and I am very glad that I rose to speak upon this question, because 1 was perfectly certain that these islands had been handed over to the Commonwealth by the Japanese. At any rate, we have taken over the German Possessions in New Guinea, and have thus become possessed of a considerable tract of territory in tropical waters. Thus we are in very much the same position as is occupied by the United States in regard to our ex-continental territories. If we were an independent country, and had the power to negotiate treaties, one of the first things that we ought to do in the field of diplomacy would be to enter into an alliance with the United States, whose interests are absolutely identical with our own. I hope that the might of these two great units of Democracy will be  associated  for decades to come in insuring that peace shall prevail both above the Equator and below it, in territories which are vital to the interests of America, and specially vital to the interests of Australia, and important in no mean measure to the whole British Empire. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> quoted very interestingly from a work dealing with many matters which have occupied the attention of the French people in North  Africa, and efforts in many tracts ot America which are not regarded as being very suitable for settlement. We can secure many object .lessons by a competent survey of what the Americans have done in those- tracts of country. I am sorry there is not more information in the hands of the members of this Parliament generally in regard to what the Republic of the West is doing in perfecting its naval armaments so as to secure for itself a supremacy which will enable it to insure that peace shall prevail in the Pacific Possessions. Quite recently I read an utterance from the lips of Secretary <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the Navy  Daniels,  from which I learned, to my great astonishment, that the United States had recently launched at Newport News the greatest <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> that has ever ploughed the ocean. We talk about the <inline font-style="italic">Queen Elizabeth</inline> and vessels of her class, but the <inline font-style="italic">Philadelphia</inline> is a <inline font-style="italic">super-super-Dreadnought.</inline> The United States, I found, has been constructing submarines which can accompany a battle fleet on a voyage . right round the world - submarines three of which cost over Â§5,000,000. These things are being done by a people who speak our own language, and who are descended from our own British ancestors. They speak the language of Shakspeare, of Milton* of Byron, and of Swinburne- </para>

                        <para>- I do. I am discussing the item for advertising the resources of Australia, with a view to establishing closer relations with the people of the United States of America, who are doing so much in the interests of peace. I. have from time to time expressed the opinion that, owing to this war, British interests in a certain quarter of the world are in serious jeopardy. That being so, it naturally follows that Australian interests are particularly in jeopardy. I hope that one of the things which Australian statesmen will keep in mind is the desirableness of cultivating the most friendly diplomatic relations with the United States of America. It is to our vital interests to do so. I hope that we shall keep on extending to the Old Country our left hand, which is nearest the heart, and which is the hand of affection, but that, at the same time, we shall offer the United States of America the right hand of friendship, and that, by our joint efforts in the cause of peace, we shall enable our interests in the Pacific Ocean to be so maintained as to secure the welfare of the two great Democracies of the world for centuries to come. The people of the United States of America are a peaceful people. </para>

                        <para>- I do not forget the wave of Democracy and friendship that ran right through our people on that occasion. My object in making these remarks is to impress upon honorable senators that we ought to take no heed of any paltry little talk about the unwisdom of spending a few thousands of pounds in advertising Australian resources in America, and in cultivating amicable relations with the American people. I hope to see this item increased in the Estimates for the current financial year tenfold. Let honorable senators consider that what is being done by the United States of America is aimed at maintaining American interests in seas in which those interests are identical with our own. "What is the expenditure of a few thousand pounds in cultivating interests which both great Democracies hold in common ? We spend dozens of millions sterling in war, which is necessary to conserve the liberties of the Empire and of the world. Let us not hesitate, then, to spend a few thousand pounds when that expenditure will conduce to those great, ideals which are entertained by the Australian Democracy in common with the people of the great American Republic. I will conclude my remarks by paraphrasing something from Bulwer  Lytton's <inline font-style="italic">Comma Race,</inline> in which he speaks of - </para>

That was plainly shown when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt,</inline> the late  President  of the United States of America,, referred rather eulogistically  to this country as the giant young Commonwealth of the South. If any evidence is needed of the growing friendship between this country and that it is shown in the development of trade. The statistics of imports and exports for the last five quinquennial periods prove clearly that the United States pf America has shown an increasing interest in this country so far as trade is concerned. During the last recorded year period we purchased from them goods to the value of about Â£9,000,000 per annum, or about five times as much as during the quinquennial period of twenty years ago. We buy more goods from them than, from any other country, save Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, much more according to our <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh,</inline> proving that the United States of America is of some consequence to us as a country supplying our daily wants. On the other hand, it is quite clear that, while we export freely to the United States of America, we do not sell to them nearly as much as we might.. It would be to the advantage of the. Commonwealth to appoint in that country some responsible mouthpiece to represent ug in all matters pertaining to trade. Australia, under present conditions, requires more than anything else to be widely known and advertised, and if there is one thing more than another that would bring this about, it is the appointment of some person in a. high responsible position in America as our representative. There is an appalling ignorance concerning Australia, not  only  in the Old Country, but in America. The reports that come from the gentleman in charge of the forty Western Australian boys now touring the United States of America demonstrate clearly that in that country there is an astonishing ignorance about Australian conditions of life and national and social development. It is our plain duty to foster and encourage a closer friendship with that country than we have done in the past, especially in view of its high position in the list of countries with which we trade. In order to pave the way to that end, we must go to some expense, and I advise the Government to take into serious consideration the appointment of some one there, either at the Seat of Government, or at one of the chief commercial centres to push our interests. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot appoint a consular representative, but we have authority to appoint a Trade Commissioner, and this we should do. Some people may regard the idea as novel or impracticable, but the ties of blood and kinship are very strong, as was shown in the relations between Servia and Russia at the outbreak of the war. Many of our people have blood relations in the United States. These ties, while .counting for much now, must count for even more in the future. We are at present in a state of splendid isolation, to use the phrase of a British statesman, and this in itself is very much of a safeguard for us; but we cannot depend on that alone. Our future safety can be best assured by cultivating the friendship of that country which, next to the Mother Country, would lend us a helping hand, possessing, as we do, institutions so much akin to hers. We desire to establish and maintain standards entirely different from those which our isolated position alone would permit, and our one safe course, while relying on our own resources, is on all occasions to cultivate friendly relations with a country of our own kith and kill and our own blood, so that when the hour of trial comes, if it should come, we may be able to depend, on her strong protecting arm if the task of protecting ourselves is found to be beyond our strength! </para>

                        <para>- Possibly it is; but we are trying to establish the same standards in Australia as have been established in the United States, and, though on many points of social and economic development we may be in a position to teach them lessons, we must not forget that the establishment and maintenance of those standards in this young Commonwealth will necessarily involve friction with countries of growing importance in the neighbourhood. I say, therefore, advisedly that it is our imperative duty to foster the strongest  possible  connexion and friendship with a country that will be a friendly help to us in any future hour of trouble. I mentioned this afternoon the wisdom of Australia in the near future looking to some new source for loan money to keep our public works going and our industrial machine in motion. We shall very soon be thrown entirely on our own financial resources, as the almost perennial spring upon which we have been relying so long for loan money - the money market of the Old Country - has been practically closed to us. </para>

No doubt some of that money will be expended to make Australia better known in America, and part of the functions of any official appointed ought to be to' bring under the notice of the American community the importance, the resources, the population, the development of Australia, and the many problems that confront us similar to those which America had to face during its corresponding stage of growth. I do not say that that necessarily implies the raising of loan money in the United States to-day, but it is certainly our duty, representing a country fashioned very much on the model of the United States in regard to forms of government, internal development, and size, to see that more money is spent to make Australia better known in the United States than has been the case in the past. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that what the honorable senator was after was the emigration to Australia of people from the United States of America, to Australia of people f was curious to know what particular' resources of this country he wished to have advertised in America for that purpose. It is certain that any Americans coming here would have some object in leaving the United States of America. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> wishes us to advertise our mineral resources. There is no doubt that they are very great; but I am not so sure that the people of the United States of America are particularly anxious to come here to develop them, in view of the fact that they  are engaged in their own country in  the  same business, and are operating on a very much larger scale than they could hope to do here. Then, with regard to the lands of Australia, I again remind honorable senators that the people at present in Australia cannot secure those lands. For every piece of land that is thrown open to selection in any part of the Commonwealth there are many applicants. I have known hundreds, and even thousands, of applications to be made for even a few selections. In view of the difficulty which people who are Australian-born have to encounter in the effort to secure a piece of land on which to make a living, it is of very little use for us to invite Americans to come here. </para>

I know that we have boundless resources in Australia, but our misfortune is that they are now largely in the hands of private individuals. I have been telling this Parliament, and the present and other Governments, for years that the principal object of their efforts should be to liberate the lands of this continent. They have not done so yet. Are we to point out to the people of the United States of America that there are hundreds of thousands of farms which they can have if they come here? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, thousands of square miles of country belonging to somebody else. A very large proportion of the accessible lands of Australia are in the hands of private individuals, and until, in some way or other - and I am not now going to suggest in what way - this monopoly is broken up, it is of no earthly use for us to try to attract immigrants from any country. There are thousands of people unemployed in Australia to-day, and it is a crying shames to every Government in this country, and in a greater measure to the Federal Government than to any other, that this should be so, because it is in the hands of the Federal Government that the weapon rests which could be used to break up the land monopoly. That is the position as I see it, and I look upon it as an absolute waste of money to advertise our resources in America when we could not make them available to those who might come here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> desires that Americans should come here with dollars so that our land monopolists may " take them down." That is not the way to promote settlement. I am more against this vote for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth in the United States of America than  I ever was before, when I consider the position taken up by the honorable senator. He desires that our condition of land  monopoly  should be broken up by a set of American rich men, who are to come here to buy up the land at present held by monopolists in Australia. I want nothing of that kind. I want to see oar big areas broken up and settled by working agriculturists. I do not want men with money to come here from the United </para>

                <para class="block">States of America, but men with muscle and skill. Men of brain and brawn are the men who are wanted for a new country, and not rich men. If rich men come here, their object will be to exploit the country. We have enough exploiters here now. What we want are workers, who will settle on the soil, cultivate it, raise crops, and make some use of it. Will the American rich men whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is so anxious to bring here do that? Not they. The remedy, however, is in our own 'hands. I have said a hundred times that what Australia wants- most is population; but we can never get the population we require until we are prepared to provide those who come here with the means of making a living when they get here. If we bring people here we must find land and employment for them. There is only one way in which that can be done. The Federal Parliament can do it effectually, but so far it has not done it. I hope that it will be done in the near future, because I am sure that Australia will never progress as she ought to do- until it is done. It is a pure waste of money to spend several thousands of pounds just now in , advertising our resources in America. The people of America know as well as we do what is our position here. </para>

                    <para>. - I think we should have some better information as to the manner in which this advertising is carried out. We should know to whom the money is intrusted for expenditure. Is there a representative of Australia in America at the present time, and, if so, where is he located ? I should like to know whether, just now, any money is being expended to advertise the resources of Australia in the United States of America, in order to "induce Americans to come here. Earlier in the day, I drew attention to the vote for advertising out resources in Great Britain, and incidentally referred to the fact that a vessel is shortly to arrive here with 800 immigrants. I say, in all seriousness, that I hope no money will be expended by the Government of the present time to induce people to come to Australia from the United States of America. Every observant man must be aware that there are thousands of men of varying occupations out of employment in Australia to-day. I have appeals made to me, personally or by letter, every day, to see whether something cannot be done to assist people who are at the present time placed in a position in which they have never been before. In these circumstances, it is wrong to induce other people to come here. We are passing through an exceptionally difficult period. We have just experienced the effects of a disastrous drought, aud are now engaged in a titanic struggle which we shall have te see to the end, no matter what it costs. </para>

I am not concerned with that class, but I am concerned about doing justice to the people who are already in Australia. When they are provided for, I shall have no objection to judicious advertising by the present, or any other, Government. No one can contend that to Spend Â£5,000 in advertising the resources of Australia in Great Britain or America at the present time is good business. It might be good business for those engaged in that particular line, it might provide them with employment j but it is not good for Australia or for those out of employment in Australia. There is nothing more discouraging to any person walking about day after day, unable to secure employment, than to know that tilings are likely to become worse; yet we are asked to encourage a form of advertising which is calculated to bring about acute distress. I am anxious to know how this money is expended, to whom its expenditure is intrusted, and the class of people it is desired to bring here by these methods. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a <inline font-style="italic">post-mortem</inline> examination of a matter already discussed and concerning money already spent. The advertising was conducted in journals, and through the distribution of literature in America, and was undertaken in conjunction with the States, whose representatives were located in the United States of America. The object was to attract people, particularly those with a knowledge of irrigation, to settle on land in Australia. No money is being spent in this direction at the present time. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the honorable senator upon his ingenuity in putting posers. Offhand, I cannot give him all the information he asks for. The <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Military Journal</inline> is intended to stimulate officers of the Citizen Forces who take an intelligent interest in the science of war. It is published by the Commonwealth at the Government Printing Office, and is circulated among the military officers who subscribe to it; but it is available to any honorable senator who may request that it be sent to him. It has been issued since 1912, and has been found to be a very good method of giving military officers in country districts the opportunity to acquire a knowledge that enables them to pass their examinations. Prizes are offered from time to time for the best articles on certain set military subjects, and the best articles are published in the j oura al. There is keen competition for these prizes. Further, the best articles likely to be of use to our Military Forces are culled from similar publications in other countries. The journal is very highly thought of and appreciated by our military officers. I have no idea of the amount of revenue received from the advertisements, but the rates are the same as those charged for advertising in magazines of a similar character, and the revenue goes into the Commonwealth Treasury. </para>

And, as a result of his invitation to the Minister to have the matter investigated, the latter announced that he would cause inquiries to be made into the allegations pf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> When we assembled in April, after the adjournment over Christmas, at my request the Minister consented to lay on the table of the Library the result of the inquiries that had been made. The effect of these had been to completely exonerate the gentleman against whom the charges had been made. But since then no opportunity has been afforded to effectively discuss the matter, because until now there has been no measure before us of which that Supply Bill was an interim portion. I am sure that I have only to invite the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> to this matter for him to acknowledge that the charges he levelled against a very reputable citizen of Tasmania were not properly founded. These were the remarks made in the Senate in December of last year - </para>

                    <para>- I take advantage of this opportunity to bring a matter which I regard as of some importance before the Minister of Defence. Quite recently a number of horses were purchased in Tasmania for our Expeditionary Forces. Amongst the officials appointed to carry out the work was a. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Piesse, of Bridgewater. This gentleman has had some rural experience, but "has evidently not had much experience of judging horses. A very credible informant tells mc that his qualifications are not such as to lit him for a position of the kind. He was asked to purchase horses throughout Tasmania, but was given to understand that he should not pay more than flc per head for them. I believe that subsequently the limit to which lie was allowed to go was increased, in order that he might be able to purchase some decent animals. I understand that this gentleman purchased for the Commonwealth some of the most worn-out and aged crocks in the island of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- Is that so? Some of the animals this gentleman purchased were so old and worn out that for very shame's sake the military authorities would not send them to the front. I believe that there are now four or five horses in the Mowbray Remount DepOt at Launceston which are absolutely useless. One is over twenty years of age, and another is probably over twenty-five years of age. 1 think that when we appoint a man to purchase horses for the Commonwealth we should hold him responsible in some way for the horses he buys. I ask that the Minister shall make a full inquiry into this matter. If, as my informant suggests, there has been corruption, and if this man has been giving high prices for inferior horses with a view of getting something out of the business for himself, a strict inquiry into his conduct should be made. I hope that the Minister of Defence will assure me that such an inquiry will take place. </para>

As the result of that statement an inquiry was made, and, as I said, I asked the Minister of Defence if he would lay on the table of the Library, and so make available to the Senate, the result of the inquiry, and he did so as far back as April last. The report has been lying on the table of the Library since that date ; at any rate, it was there up till a week or so ago, if it is not still there. Seeing that these reflections have been made in the Senate on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse,</inline> who is a reputable citizen of Tasmania, I think it is due to him that, at any rate, his character which has been, if not directly, inferentially aspersed here should be cleared here. That, I think, is the least which any one of us would expect if he was in a similar position. I have here a copy of the report, which is addressed to the secretary of the  Minister of Defence, Melbourne, and. signed by the Commandant of the 6th Military District, Colonel W. J. Clark.

                <para>It is admitted that some of the animals were aged, but, with two exceptions, these were fit for service. Owing to the difficulty of securing remounts at prices so much below local quotations, and to the pressure of time, the Board were placed in a difficult position. </para>

                        <para>- I can say that -active, or not active, I doubt whether I would recognise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse</inline> if I were to meet him in the street. I know, however, his reputation and standing. I know that it is quite as good, if not better, than mine, and nearly equal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's,</inline> in Tasmania. When a man is criticised on the floor of the Senate publicly, and his motives in acting on behalf of the Commonwealth are impugned, it is desirable that there should be inquiry. An inquiry was authorized by the Minister of Defence. All that I have commented upon is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> said, the fact that there was an inquiry, the fact that this report has been available since April last, and the fact that nothing has been said" with regard to the statements made previously. As I said before, I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> recognising those circumstances, will admit here that there were no grounds for the allegations which were made by him either directly or impliedly when he called in question here the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse</inline> on the 11th December last. I wish to say no more. I have only furnished the Senate with what was said then. Various members of the Committee heard what was said on that occa-   sion. They may not have known what the report was, but I have taken this opportunity of reading it. I am sure, and I am not saying it with any improper feeling, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> will realize that, after having ventilated the matter, there is something due to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse,</inline> who, like he and I, is a Tasmanian, who enjoys some repute, and some respect in our common State. </para>

I propose to give some facts, and let them stand against what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said. I stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse</inline> had purchased horses, and that they were not so good as they should have been. I repeat that statement. I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse,</inline> and probably some other gentlemen, purchased horses; that the horses were not worth the money paid for them, and that they were in the Mowbray Remount Depot. I have that information on the # authority of a gentleman with the highest qualifications of any veterinary surgeon who has ever come to Tasmania - Captain Bruce, now esteemed so highly by the military authorities tha.t he is in charge of the big Remount Depot at Cairo. Surely he is a man whose statement can be taken even against that of the Commandant of Tasmania. Captain Bruce informed me that the horses at the Mowbray Remount Depot, and purchased by the Tasmania authorities, were a disgrace. </para>

                        <para>- No. Captain Bruce, who was at one time Government Veterinary Officer for Tasmania, said to me that there was something suspiciously and singularly wrong with the quality of the horses, that they were not up to par, that many of them were old crocks, that others were not suitable for the purposes for which they were purchased. He said, " The whole business, to me, looks at least as if there is, if not corruption, well, gross incapacity." I challenge <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> honorable friend opposite, who seems to have a brief for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse,</inline> to contradict that statement. I said nothing about that gentleman personally. I criticised his conduct in purchasing horses, and I stand to that criticism. He is a warm partisan and supporter of my honorable friend, and has gone out of his way more than once to break a lance in his defence, and attack the party to which I belong. </para>

                        <para>- I say that I did not criticise his reputation as a private citizen. I criticised his purchase of certain horses, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> wants proof, let him ask for the correspondence in reference to the Mowbray Remount Depot to be tabled, and he will find "that some of the <inline font-style="italic">horses</inline> were so bad that one of them fetched 20s. in the mart at Launceston, another 30s., and another about Â£3. Let the honorable senator and the Senate remember that these horses were purchased at a fairly high price, and with Commonwealth money. I say - and my authority for the statement is Captain Bruce - that there was a gross waste of public money, and that the men who went out buying horses - some of them at least - were not competent. I have been informed by Captain Bruce that some of these horses were purchased by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse.</inline> That is my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> If these are the facts, I do not see that I should recall them despite the report which has been issued by the Commandant of Tasmania. I hope that my statements will have the ( effect of causing the gentlemen who have been paying big prices for horses which are fit only for the bone-mills to discontinue that practice. I believe that the publicity which has been given to my allegations has already resulted in making the military authorities of Tasmania more careful. I know that the Minister cannot check these things. He is too busy to be expected to do so. But the exposure which has taken place will doubtless cause  the authorities to tighten up their methods.  </para>

Knowing the facts, I should have been lacking in my duty if I had not drawn attention to them. </para>

I know that most of the officers in the Defence Department are solicitous for the welfare of the employees in that Factory. To-day it has been brought under my notice that there are indications of industrial unrest there. A fairly large number of girls who are employed in doing certain work in connexion with soldiers' uniforms have been given notice of dismissal. As a result, there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction among the whole of the Factory employees. I do not say that those employees are on the  verge of a strike. I hope that they will not strike at a time like the present. But </para>

                    <para>. - I am very sorry that the honorable senator should have used the word " strike" in connexion with this matter, because to a certain extent it implies a threat. The facts, as they have been represented to me, are that a certain operation in connexion with soldiers' breeches was done some time ago by hand. Subsequently it was found that that operation could be performed equally well by machines, and that as a result a greater number of garments could be turned out by a smaller number of employees. The Examiner of Stores recommended that the operation should be done by machines, because the adoption of that course would have the effect of cheapening the garments, as well as of increasing the output. Moreover, the operation as performed by machines was superior to that which could be performed by hand. The conditions of contract were altered in regard to these particular garments so as to allow contractors to undertake the work with machines. The Manager of the Clothing Factory was questioned on the matter, and was given authority to machine this operation. As a consequence, some twenty-five girls will be displaced from that particular work. But the immediate result will be that we shall be able to increase the output by about 900 garments per week, and the Factory Manager will be enabled so to extend his operations as 'not only to find employment for these girls, but for <inline font-style="italic">.m</inline> additional number, in other directions. Of course, I am merely giving honorable senators the statement of the Manager, because I have not yet had an opportunity of hearing the position from the union's point of view. It will be understood, therefore, that I am not committing myself to the Manager's version at all. But that is the view which has been put to me. I understand that when my parliamentary duties will permit of it, the secretary of the union intends to interview me on the subject. In the meantime I suspend my own judgment in the matter. I do not think that the word "strike" should have been used, because I am sure that no union in Australia would dream of striking over a matter of this sort. The. time when strikes would occur over that kind of thing has gone by 100 years. I shall give the union as representing the employees every opportunity to state their side of the case, and endeavour to do justice to the employees as well as to the Commonwealth and the taxpayers, because it must be remembered that this Factory has to compete with private factories outside. </para>

                    <para>- The  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Queensland has on occasions decided particular cases affecting employees, and when the employee appealed to a Board of Inquiry the  Deputy  appointed himself a member of the Board, and actually took the position of  chairman.  A Board so constituted is a farce, and if the  Deputy  had any sense of decency he would not attempt to sit on the Board after deciding a case. The  Deputy  in Queensland is noted for his autocratic conduct. He is, I believe, the most autocratic in Australia, and the one who causes the most dissatisfaction amongst postal employees. A notification should be sent from headquarters to Deputies and others that if" they decide an officer's case they must not sit on any subsequent Board of Inquiry. Complaint also reaches me from Brisbane regarding the number of sorters employed there as compared with the number employed in other capitals. In Sydney the proportion is four assistants to twenty-two sorters, in Melbourne three to eighteen, in Adelaide two to five, and in Brisbane nine to one. Assistants are men. learning the work, and when their number is so great in comparison with the number of sorters a great deal of additional work is- thrown on the qualified men. I trust the Postmaster-General will see that the proportion in the capitals is made more equal. </para>

                    <para>. - A registered letter containing a Â£10-note was sent recently from Cue, Western Australia, to  Tannymorell,  near Warwick, Queensland. Its receipt was noted at Warwick, and its transmission to  Tannymorell  accounted for, but the postal official there left the service, compulsorily or otherwise, and the letter never reached the addressee. The sender was a nurse,, and the addressee was her widowed mother. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> and I asked that compensation should be paid, but the reply of the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in each State was that under the regulations the amount of compensation payable was limited to Â£2. It would not be good policy to pay all such claims in full because of the possibilities of fraud, but this case was exceptional. It was brought before me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan,</inline> a most reputable solicitor at Warwick, whom I have known from boyhood, and who was acting in an honorary capacity in the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> had similar assurances from Western Australia, and we knew that the representations would not have been made to us if the case had not been genuine. I have criticised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Templeton</inline> before, and would have no hesitation in criticising him again if the necessity arose, but I do not blame him in this case for following the regulations. The point which I placed before the Postmaster-General, and which I thought he might have entertained, was that he should have the power as an act of grace to pay compensation in full in special cases. The regulations should be elastic enough to allow this to be done in hard cases, and this case is particularly hard. The nurse has gone to the front, the money is lost, and in the unusual circumstances, seeing that both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> and I are prepared to vouch for the honesty of the parties, the Postmaster-General might well, as an act of grace, pay full compensation. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a matter connected with the Post and Telegraph Department which has come under my notice, and about which I should like to say a word. I have noticed that in Tasmania, for many years past, it has been the practice of the Department to employ casual labour. Men are put on for six months as letter carriers, and I think also as sorters. Then they are put off for six months, and then put on again. That practice has obtained in Launceston for the last four or five years. It is impossible to secure the best results from such a system. It is not adopted to meet any particular rush of work, and these casual employees are engaged to fill what are really permanent positions. It can be easily understood that it will take two men to do the work which might be done by one man who had been constantly employed at it. The citizens are very much inconvenienced by the practice. I know of one round where, upon the appointment of a new man, the letters are not  delivered  until after 11 o'clock, when they should be delivered before 9 o'clock. I wish now to refer to the practice of dispensing with the services of men employed for some time by the Department because they have not been able to pass a certain educational examination. I brought this matter before the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General some time ago. I referred to the dismissal of three men because they had not passed some educational test. The reply given to me was very ingenious. It was to the -effect that, with the exception of two, the men had nob been in the employ of the Department for more than nine months. Of the two to whom I referred, one had been in the service of the Department for six years, and the other for three years. They evidently believed that they were in the permanent employ of the Department. I can appreciate the difficulty which the Public Service Commissioner may have in determining who should be considered a permanent employee and who should not. But I submit that any examination to test the qualifications of a man who is employed digging post-holes, splicing .wire, and using an axe or an adze should be a practical rather than a theoretical one. I have here a copy of the examination paper given to one of these men in the practical duties of 'his position, and 1 find that, for sinking 5-feet holes for poles, the maximum marks obtainable were 150, and this man obtained 150 marks. The next matter upon which he was examined was climbing wooden poles with stirrups, or climbing irons, regulating wires, .and making joints in iron wires while on the pole, and for this he obtained 120 out of a possible 150 marks. For fixing brackets, spindles, and cross-arms to wooden poles, he obtained 135 out of a possible 150 marks. For knowledge of timbers used in the construction of telegraph lines he obtained 30 out of a possible 100 marks. For the use of adze and axe he obtained 100 out of a possible 100 marks. For jointing and soldering copper wire he obtained 42 out of a possible 50 marks. Fo'r tying wires to insulators he obtained 42 out of a possible 50 marks, and for knowledge of knots and use of tackle he obtained 45 out of a possible 50 marks. To pass in this practical test an examinee required to obtain 400 marks, and this man obtained 664 marks; but, because he did not pass some little educational test, or perhaps failed to spell some word correctly, he was put down after being employed in the service for six years. This man 'has a wife and children to support, and it seems to me rather cruel, at a time like the present, to dispense with the services of such a man, when it would be scarcely possible to get any other two men in the State to do the work he was accustomed to do. Other men have been put in the places which were previously filled by the men to whom I have referred. I have here a list of fifty odd men who passed the practical and educational examination, and there is not one of them who secured the same number of marks in the practical test as did the man to whose case I have specially referred. If we went outside the Department we should not be able to find a single private employer who would be guilty of such a stupid thing as to turn such a man down, in the circumstances. When I was at work I never had to undergo any educational test. If I could do the practical task set me, I satisfied my employer. These men could do, and have done, the work they were employed to do. I do not care to mention the names of officers of the Department, but I have it on the best authority that the officers of the Department in Tasmania, up to the head, are extremely sorry that these men have had to go out, because they cannot replace them for the practical work they had to do. I think it is time that the Post and Telegraph Department did something more in accordance with the fitness of things than to dispense with the services of men who Have proved themselves thoroughly efficient in the practical work they are called upon to do, merely because they may be somewhat lacking in education. I hope that in future something will be done to obviate a repetition of this kind of thing. If, when men are put on, they are given to understand that in twelve months' time they will be called upon to pass a practical and educational test, they will then know what they have undertaken to do. To keep a man in the Service for six years, leaving him to believe that he will be continued in his employment, and then, because he fails in what appears to nae to be, in the circumstances, a quite unnecessary educational test, to throw him out on the world, is very unfair indeed. I hope that some good result will follow from the few remarks I have made on this subject. </para>

There is, however, one matter suggesting inhuman treatment of one of the employees of the Post and Telegraph Department, which I regard as of so much importance that I think it proper to deal with it for a few minutes on the present occasion. The complaint is based upon the following letter, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Baily</inline><inline font-style="italic">Standard</inline> of Brisbane of the 26th May, 1915, under the heading " Sympathetic " - </para>

                        On Saturday, 22nd inst., word was received from the Defence Department of the death  of one of our soldiers at the battle of the Dardanelles. Three of our leading city firms, on being apprised of the sad news, immediately told three of their respective employees (relatives of deceased lad) to cease work out of sympathy; but our Post and Telegraph Department not only refused to allow a brother of the fallen soldier off duty at 1 p.m., but kept him at work two hours extra. Is this the way to show sympathy and respect to our departed soldiers, who arc fighting to help keep these heads in their high positions? ThisPost and Telegraph Department is surely worked on a queer system.

                    <para>Attention of Council was drawn to a regrettable incident which recently occurred in the Telegraph Branch. A certain" officer, it was stated, received word that his brother, who left with the Expeditionary Force for the Dardanelles, had died of wounds. Intimation waa received at 11 a.m., and at 1 p.m. the officer in question asked, in writing, for relief. Apart from personal feelings, he. was actuated by the highest motives, inasmuch as he desired to he with his parents in their hour of trial. He- was verbally informed later that he could not be spared. He would ordinarily have ceased duty at1 p.m., but, as the Saturday schedule had been suspended for elections, he was detained until 2.40 p.m., and then only released on representation being made by the Vice-President. </para>

I hope that the Minister of Defence will suggest to the Postmaster- General, in whose Department this occurred, the necessity of instituting an inquiry. I consider that the officer responsible for this outrageous conduct should be dismissed from the Service. Nothing short of dismissal would be adequate punishment for the inhuman creature who could subject an employee to such treatment in such trying circumstances. I shall not labour the matter further; but I hope the Minister will make inquiries, and possibly, after the inquiries are made and the truth or otherwise of the statement proved, we may have more to say on the matter. </para>

[10.5]. - I am again obliged to refer to the inequality and unfairness of the wort of the medical profession in Brisbane in connexion with military examinations and camp necessities. From further inquiries I have made from the Minister and other sources I have come to the conclusion that the Defence Department is not so culpable in this matter as a small coterie of medical men - what I may call the military medical section - in Brisbane. Newspapers have informed us at various times that there has been a scarcity of medical men. That fact has been deplored in connexion with the agitation for increased activity in recruiting, and I have had it brought under my notice repeatedly by newspapers sent to me from Brisbane.

This is a matter for patriotic -action on the part of our many medical men who, busy as they may be, are easily in a position to alford to give some of their time to assist a national cause. </para>
                    <para class="block">This has particular application to Brisbane, as shown by representations Â»that have been made to me and, I believe, to the  President  of the Senate. In Brisbane, medical men can be found to carry through the necessary examinations and so forth. I trust that the Minister will renew his instructions that this matter must be expedited. I am satisfied, from the representations that have been made, and the inquiries that have followed upon these representations, that there is inequality in the distribution of the medical work, and if the medical men in Brisbane who are not permanent military officers, but who may be designated as attached to the Military Forces, are overbearing and confine the work to a few special favorites, I believe that the Minister will take drastic action, such as he has been forced to take in connexion with other prominent directors of medical and other phases of recruiting, enlistment, and general Defence operations. Another matter upon which I desire to touch is one upon which, on account of the despatch with which the Temporary <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Senator Needham,</inline> was putting through the Estimates, I was not able to speak this evening. I refer to the Patagonian  immigrants who are on their way to the Northern Territory. I understand that the ultimate idea is to have these people settle on the land .as landholders. This evening I quoted from the report of the Administrator of the Northern Territory to show that he was of the opinion that men from other parts of the Commonwealth would not make the most desirable settlers in the Northern Territory, and that he did not think that even people from the north of Europe would be the best class of settlers. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> thinks that the inhabitants of Southern Europe would be the best class of people to stand the climate of the Northern Territory. I understand that the great majority of the Patagonians are of Spanish descent, and that the authorities believe that they will be particularly adapted constitutionally to stand the conditions in the Northern Territory. The Administrator has also pointed out in his report that it will be well to employ these immigrants at first on railway construction work, so 0that eventually they may become landholders, and I understand that this procedure will be followed in regard to the Patagonians; but from inquiries I made at the Department of External Affairs a few days ago, on behalf of a man who was anxious to get information regarding the prospects of work and the rates of wages in the Northern Territory, I received a letter from the Department, from which I quote the following paragraph - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>At present, the construction of the Pine Creek-Katherine railway is the chief work in progress in the Territory. The rates of wages paid vary from ordinary labourers, who receive ls. 9d. per hour, to foremen carpenters, fitters, te., who receive 2s. 4d. per hour for a week of forty-four hours. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>If the Department were to announce that they required men to go to the Northern Territory to take work temporarily, while looking about  them  and choosing blocks of land, and that these men would be paid 14s. a day on railway construction, within forty-eight hours 500 men, <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> workers, would be found in Queensland prepared to go. I speak of men who have not the capital to go to the Territory on their own account, but are anxious to select blocks of land, and eventually become permanent settlers, and I say this from the knowledge that I have gained from letters that I have received from all over the State of Queensland, written by men who have become tired of a roving life in the northern fields of the State, and are anxious to go to the Territory, but prefer to go where the prospects of obtaining temporary work are favorable. I think that these men would be infinitely preferable to Patagonians as settlers. However, we shall see how the experiment is carried. out_ I attribute it to the representations made in the report of the Administrator - time will show whether these people make better settlers than ordinary Australians. When speaking on the War Loan Bill yesterday, I endeavoured to have recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter which I had received from a prominent business man in Melbourne, dealing with the financial difficulties coming upon the nation as a consequence of the war; but, as the  Chairman  ruled that I could not quote this letter, with' permission, I shall do so now, because it appears to be rather pertinent to the present financial situation. I shall not give the name of the writer, but the letter proceeds - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The new war taxes are interesting us. I think that either an income tax or a wealth tax is good, with a preference for the latter. If  a  tax on income is decided on, it over taxes tb( worker and undertakes the drone. When I say " worker," you will understand that I refer to the capitalist who works. This man pays wages and produces wealth. </para>

                        <para>- Any letter which an honorable senator reads in the Chamber is liable to be ordered to be laid on the table of the Senate. Further, it is contrary to the Standing Orders for the honorable senator to read a letter referring to a debate in the Senate. I am not sure that the tenor of the letter, so far, does refer to the business of the Senate ; but it certainly refers to the subject-matter of a debate. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to occupy a few minutes to direct attention to a matter which is of vital importance to a large number of persons at present, and that is the action which is about to be taken by the Federal Government for the purpose of providing freight for the wheat surplus. According to a report in the press, the Government have arranged with two firms to provide bottoms for the transport of the wheat surplus, and those two firms are Elder, Smith, and Company and Gibbs, Bright, and Company. So far as my knowledge goes, those firms have no interest in Western Australia, and if it be true that the Government have appointed them alone for the purpose, I think that the decision can well stand be ing reviewed. In Western Australia there are any number of firms which could be chosen with advantage to the State. If it is a case of appointing two firms only, it will naturally confer on those firms an advantage over others. In taking action of this kind the Federal Government have need to engage firms whose operations cover the whole area of the Commonwealth, and not two firms whose operations are confined to only one particular part of it. I, therefore, hope that the Minister representing the Department concerned will take a note of my remarks, and alter the decision. I agree entirely with the Government taking action of this kind. I do not agree with the statements made in the Parliaments of the neighbouring States that the action which the Federal Government are taking could better be taken by other means or by other Governments. I believe that, in the present circumstances, they are the only Government who could take action with advantage to all concerned, because they will be actuated by a desire, not to centre their attention on one State, but to regard the matter from a comprehensive point of view and to keep in mind the needs of the entire producers of the Commonwealth. If the report in the press is correct, the State of Western Australia will be dependent upon the operations of two firms which have no interest in the State. That is not desirable; and if the decision is not revised, I shall take an opportunity later of pointing out the unfairness of it. </para>

I am having inquiries made, and it is my intention to see that no favoritism is shown or injustice done. As regards the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> he will recognise, I am sure, that it is too important a one for me to go into fully at this stage of the day's proceedings. Next week there is almost certain to arise an opportunity when the matter can be fully ventilated, and when the Government's plans will be more fully formulated. </para>
