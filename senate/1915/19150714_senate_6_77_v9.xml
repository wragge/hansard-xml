                        <para>. - I have not spoken earlier in the debate on these measures because I en'tertained the hope that even at the eleventh hour the Government would see the wisdom of not pressing them upon public consideration at this juncture. The one outstanding national need now is a united national effort to ward off a distinct national danger. The national safety can be secured only by national effort, and that, national effort cannot be obtained to its fullest extent if the nation is divided into two warring camps. </para>

If an error was made then, it ought not to 'be perpetuated now. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in introducing these Bills, made use of a phrase to which I take the strongest possible exception. He spoke of "Business as usual." No more pernicious or mischievous phrase has ever been used in the whole range of controversy connected with this war. " Business as usual," when we find the hills of the Dardanelles dripping with the blood of our own  soldiers f " Business as usual," when the casualty lists are throwing the shadow of a great sacrifice over an increasing number of .Australian homes! "Business as usual," when ,$he man whose name to-day carries more authority than that of any other individual in the Empire - I refer to Lord Kitchener - says that we are faced with a crisis so serious that the Empire needs the services of every man who is available ! Let me remind honorable senators of what he has said. I invite them not merely to listen to his words, but to weigh and consider what underlies them.

                            <para>- I have only to go down Bourke-street and turn towards the Town Hall in order to get the most conclusive evidence that "'Business as usual " is not being carried oh. " Business as usual," when to-day Belgium is still quivering in the talons of the conqueror, when we have so far been unable to do anything towards redeeming our pledge to restore to her her national life and her national liberties ! " Business as usual," when a large portion of the fertile territory of our gallant allies, the French, is still under the heel of the conqueror ! " Business as usual," when, disguise it though we will, we must recognise the fact that our other gallant allies, the Russians, have been pushed back, and in a few weeks have lost the results of the strenuous efforts of months ! Why, there are a hundred circumstances which point to the fact that the one thing we dare not do is to attempt to proceed with our ordinary business. I need not go further than the records of this Parliament to show that there is no justification for the continued use of this idle and mischievous phrase. What has been the record of this Parliament since we met? </para>

In the circumstances, I do not propose to restrain the honorable senator; but I think that, while urging the war as a reason why the Bills should not be proceeded with, a general discussion of the present political situation will be neither proper nor relevant. </para>

                            <para>- I would point out that the proposal before the Senate is' that we should agree to the third reading of this Bill " now." I am endeavouring to show that now is not the right time to- pass it, and I am a little pained to hear that you .should regard my reference to big national matters - matters of Empire importance - as coming within the description of the term "political." I was attempting to point out that the records of this Parliament show that the Government themselves recognise that we cannot proceed with our usual business. We have already passed a measure which conferred upon the Government greater powers than we would ever dream of conferring upon them in this democratic community if we were able to carry on our normal business. The Government have been accorded financial liberty to spend what they choose. Why ? Because we are not able to carry on business as usual. That circumstance was a recognition of the fact that there was absolutely nothing usual about the business with which we were called upon to deal. " Business as usual, " when we know that the Government have never for a single instant contemplated the prorogation of Parliament ! We have practically been asked to sleep here, with our armour on. There has been no prorogation of Parliament, but merely an adjournment, in order that we might be able to re-assemble here if circumstances should render the adoption of that course necessary. </para>

Is not that circumstance in itself an indication that, even in their minds, there is a recognition of the seriousness of the hour which we are approaching? Is it " business as usual " when we practically tell the country that things are as. they are, and that, therefore, we will postpone the consideration of the Tariff for a still longer period ? </para>

                            <para>- I am not. There is neither time for pessimism nor optimism now. There is only time to act. Is it "business as usual" when we are to be confronted in a few hours with a Bill providing for the registration of the men, the women, and the wealth of this country ? Is that an ordinary or a usual measure? All these things and a hundred others go to show that, whatever justification there may have been - and I hold there was none - for the use of that phrase when it first found its way into print, there is absolutely no justification to-day, when the one thing required is that each, to the extent of his capacity, should devote all his thoughts and all his efforts towards meeting the danger that threatens us. In my judgment, one thing which is essential to enable the Empire to successfully meet the challenge thrown out against it by a nation which has so organized its resources that all its activities move with the preciseness and effectiveness of a perfected machine, is equal organization and equal unity of effort. </para>

                            <para>- But I point out that these Bills represent the throwing of " the apple of discord " among the electors. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in introducing them, gave us some figures of the voting at the last referenda, and seemed to derive comfort from the fact that the support for these proposals was growing, whereas, as a matter of fact, the figures only serve to indicate in the plainest possible fashion that the people in Australia, are sharply divided upon them. Waiving any slight advantage that they may give to one side or the other, I think it is a fair assumption that the figures indicate that the people of this Commonwealth are hopelessly divided upon these questions. </para>

                            <para>- If these proposals are put before the electors, I shall oppose them. When my friends speak of not making these Bills party measures, do they assume that, while they are to be free to bring forward proposals to which they know a large section of the electors objects, that that large body of electors is. to remain quiescent, and not give effect to its views? If Ministers would leave on one side these matters of contention between the two parties, they would not find among honorable senators on their own side any who would be more anxious to support them in their efforts to carry on the war than would be found among those politically opposed to them; but, in pushing to the final appeal to the people measures upon which they know the people are sharply divided, and which represent the main line of distinction between both parties, it is absurd to suggest that those opposed to them should remain inactive, while those who support them should be free to give effect to their political wishes. It is claimed that these are not party measures. How is it, then, that they form so prominent a feature of the manifestos of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> from time to time? </para>

                            <para>- I can prove from the manifestos issued by my friends opposite  that they are party questions. There was a manifesto issued, in 1910, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and signed at that time by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watkins;</inline> there were other manifestos in connexion with the 1913 election, and in connexion with the 1914 election, and in each manifesto these measures were put forward as being among the foremost planks of the Labour party's platform, and the assurance was given that, not only was the Labour party pledged to them, but it was also pledged to give effect to them in the forthcoming Parliament. </para>

I believe that the party system in Australia has been responsible for the purity of Australian public life, but when we are called upon to leave matters of party alone and to deal with a much more serious national matter, it shows, not- merely a want of a sense of proportion, but also great dereliction of duty for Ministers to seek to divide the electors upon any question. </para>

It does not cease to be of a party character because a small majority of the people of the country may approve of it.

What I wish to bring home to my honorable friends is that this is a matter to which the Labour party stands solemnly pledged, and which they have put in the fore-front of their programme. Believing in it sincerely as I think they do, I wish them to recognise that there is a very large section of the people who, not being in accord with them, will be compelled to oppose them when these proposals are put forward again. Let me take the Labour manifesto of 1913. It contained this statement - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a clear, plain statement that the proposals were part of the policy of my honorable friends opposite. Then we come down to the Labour manifesto of 1914, which is not a year old yet. The programme of the Labour party has already been declared. To that programme, which sets forth, in clear and unambiguous terms the policy of Labour, including its attitude towards trusts and combines, amendment of the Constitution, &amp;c, Labour stands pledged for the next Parliament. </para>
                    <para class="block">That we know was Labour's attitude in regard to these proposals. What has been the attitude of those who are opposed to them ? We have not to refer to the records of what has transpired outside Parliament, but only to take the records of the Senate and the other House to find conclusive evidence that if ever there was a party matter introduced within these walls it was the proposed alterations in the Constitution. How can you judge a party matter by any better evidence than that the members of one party support and the members of another party oppose? Let me remind my honorable friends of what took place in those bodies which control their political destinies. We remember that there was a carpeting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> a little while ago because he ventured to express an opinion not quite in keeping with the official utterances of the Labour party. If this was not a party matter, surely he might have been allowed to go his own road . </para>

It was because he, too, declared that he was unable to support the referenda proposals. If it was not a party matter, why was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> compelled to leave the ranks of the Labour party ? We are merely attempting to deceive ourselves if we assume for a moment that it is not a party matter. It undoubtedly is of great national concern, but every matter which has been of great national concern has invariably been a subject of party controversy, and the only question for us to consider is whether the circumstances of to-day justify us in inviting the electors to give a decision now or not. </para>

                            <para>- If that interjection were true, it would afford further proof that these are party matters, and are treated as such. Parties do not muzzle members or drum them out in regard to unimportant' matters. There will, for instance-, be no drumming out over the Tariff, because we know that, on various items neither party will be solid. But if the Labour party is dealing with a question on which it has pledged its existence, it does make it a party matter, and is not prepared to tolerate any opposition in the ranks. </para>

                            <para>- The interjection, if correct, would only go to prove that this is a matter of the most pronounced party character. So far as Parliament is concerned, to my mind it would be, perhaps, quite a negligible disadvantage if we had to deal with these proposals here only. But when we are going to ask public men to take th© platform for and against them, invite the electors to range up again in line, disturb the public mind with these complex and momentous matters, do we show any recognition of the fact that the fate of this Empire is still undecided ? I abstained from speaking earlier on these measures in the hope that, even now, the Government would venture to take that truly national course which I think lies clearly before them. They have not done so, and, of course, the responsibility must be theirs. Ali that I can do is to express the hope that the evils which I fear will result from the presentation of these proposals to the electors may not be so serious as I anticipate they will be, that the desire of the people of the country, to devote their whole energies to the prosecution of the war, will enable them to brush on one side that bitter controversy which otherwise might arise, and that we may look therefore to the good sense of the electors to do what the Parliament has absolutely failed to do. </para>

                        <para>.- The Leader of the Liberal party in this chamber has again indicated a complete reversal of form on the part of the party he represents. I represent a State which for months after the outbreak of this great war was stumped by Liberals, advocating fearlessly and practically every. day the watch cry of "Business as usual." They said it was absolutely essential at this juncture in our history that the business affairs of the nation should be carried on. </para>

                            <para>- There is the reply. The very reason why the Government are resorting to the extreme length of registering the manhood and the wealth of Australia is so that they can systematically and scientifically organize the resources of this great nation, not only as regards sending men to the front, hut as regards carrying on the great businesses and the commercial industries of the country. The registration is undertaken for no other purposes than to guard against any waste of effort or overlapping. The object is to completely systematize our industries, in order that we may fight the Germans with their own weapons. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. My leader's use of the phrase was based on the thought that now, above all times, we must see that there is no stoppage in industry. What are the Government doing ? Why are they spending loan money? Why did they go to the rescue of the States and finance them ? It was in order that everything should be kept going entirely as it was before the war. The Leader of the Opposition makes it plain to us that he has got stage fright; that he is stricken between party fear and cold feet. To-day this honorable gentleman, who once advocated an entirely different course, had the colossal impudence to get up here and tell us that we are wrong, that they were wrong, and we should abandon everything. Do we want craven hearts in the Government? The country needs not only an enterprising, hut, if necessary, a Socialistic policy, in order that" its resources shall not suffer in the greatest crisis in the world's history. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> asks who are these people. I will tell him of one case. When I came over from Tasmania in the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> a week or two ago, I met a prominent business man of Launceston, who is head of his firm, and I said to him, " You are doing pretty well out of chaff, are you not?" and he said, " I am trying to do pretty well out of it, but I cannot." I then asked him the reason, because I knew that Tasmania had the stuff to sell, and he replied, " It is because of the firms who control the chaff on this side. They are too big for us." I will give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> or any other senator, the nam© of this firm privately. The gentleman to whom I referred told me that there was one firm in this State, a firm in Melbourne, who had this season made £80,000 out of chaff. That is "business as usual," of course! It is to deal with this class of business that we are asking for authority to organize our resources through the medium of the referenda proposals. </para>

There is not. But let me tell my honorable friend that there will be preference against the men who are fighting so bravely for Australia, and that it will b© his party which will give preference against them, when they return to this fair land, as we hope they will in the fulness of time. When they come back, not one-third of them will have a vote or any say in the Legislative Councils of many of the States of Australia. </para>

In the face of all this, the honorable gentleman flings his taunts across the floor that there will be no preference to unionists at the front. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator in his speech, with sinister cunning, attempted to insinuate that the course we are taking in putting through the third reading of this Bill is unprecedented. Is that the position ? Is the course which we are taking in Australia unprecedented ? It is not true, and to prove it I remind the Senate of what Canada is doing. In the Dominion a general election is to be held in which the personal issues of all parties in the Parliament will be involved. On the other hand, what we are doing is not a personal matter at all, but a great national matter which ought to be above party feeling. </para>

The argument of the Government is that, as it is subject to constant hostile criticism and attack, that with twenty-two western constituencies without representation either in the Senate or the House of Commons, and that, with enormous obligations on account of the war and its own action in sending an army to Europe, it is desirable to have an authoritative declaration from the country. It is also pointed out that Ministers must shortly appear at an Imperial Conference to consider terms of peace and problems of the gravest importance to the Empire, and that, while there is a conflict of authority between the Commons and the Senate, they cannot speak with such decision as is desirable. </para>

To this the Government answer that if the election is not held now, it must be held in 1916, and there is no guarantee that the war will even then be over, while it is important that in the meantime a Government should hold office with the full confidence of the country, and free to devote its whole energies to -the war and the problems inseparable from Canadian participation in the conflict. </para>

                    <para>It is one of the remarkable anomalies of civilization that,  notwithstanding  that machinery to-day is immensely superior to the machinery of the past, notwithstanding that the tools of production are producing far more wealth, and doing it far more cheaply, than ever, notwithstanding the fact that machinery for primary, secondary, and technical industries is more effective than ever, the price of commodities is steadily increasing. That is an anomaly. The price of bread, for instance, is not lower to-day in spite of . the fact that improved scientific methods of farming have been introduced and adopted. We are, therefore, forced to look for a reason for the strange anomaly that, although things are being produced much more cheaply, the public have to pay more for the articles they consume. There are two or three causes to which this can be attributed. Land monopoly is a primary cause, the accumulation of wealth and private taxation forms a second reason, and trusts and combines constitute a third, for the abnormal increase in prices in spite of greater cheapness of production. When we come to deal with the causes of the increased prices, and the problem of checking them, and insuring to the people some return for the improved and up-to-date methods that :1 re being daily introduced in our machinery of production, we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> regards the fixation of prices as impossible. In his speech on the second reading he also asserted that there were no trusts. </para>

The honorable senator interjects that it is done by the people who sell them. They fix them entirely for their own advantage, and to the disadvantage of the rest of the people of the Commonwealth. The honorable senator argues that it is legitimate and shows business enterprise and initiative for these men to fix prices and become as rich as ever they like. He places no limit, so far as I can see, upon their acquiring vast possessions. </para>

                            <para>- They will be decided by the whole people. The honorable senator argued that the farmers had been robbed in regard to their wheat by a Liberal Government in Victoria, and by a Labour Government in New South Wales. What are the facts? I noticed that in the farming district of Murrumbidgee, represented in the New South Wales Assembly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pat.</inline> McGarry,  a Labour member, immediately after the wheat deal was consummated by the New South Wales Government, the farmers in his district banqueted him. The reason, which the honorable senator persistently evaded in his speech, is that when the New South Wales Government took the crop over they saved the farmer from the wheat speculator in the case of at least one-third of the wheat, if not more, because the majority of the farmers in New South Wales had sold their wheat for a little over 3s. a bushel. They actually got 5s. The honorable senator would have a tough job to persuade those farmers that they had been robbed by the Government. You do not find shrewd farmers, as a rule, banqueting those who work the depredations that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Bakhan  has pictured. The farmers of New South Wales are in the main very well satisfied with what their Government did. I have met a great number of producers from that State, and know that they are beginning to realize that their enemy is not the Government which fixes prices, but the speculator. They would welcome the fixation of prices by the Government to protect them from the speculators. I met a farmer on the north-west coast of Tasmania who had 1,200 bushels of oats which he sold for 2s. lid. a bushel, as he could not get more. He went from buyer to buyer in the northern part of Tasmania, and by some mysterious coincidence was offered the same price in one office as another. This mysterious fixing of prices by a ring occurs every day in the week. </para>

                            <para>- That, as a rule, is part of the paraphernalia. This farmer objected, because two hours after he had sold his grain he met a man from the mainland who offered him 3s. 5d. He said to me, "I have lost 6d. a bushel by that deal, so that I have been taken down for £30 in all. I had to pay to the twelve men who worked on the thresher £12 10s. under the new scale of wages." That was the scale to which a few of the farmers of Tasmania, backed up by the Liberal party, objected. It was fixed when the threshing machine award was introduced in Tasmania. The farmer said, "£12 10s. is what I had to pay my men, but I had to pay £30 to the man who wrote out the cheque." " Which," he asked me, " is my enemy - the men who got the extra wages or the man who tapped me for £30?" </para>

                            <para>- The farmers, as a rule, are not trained in business ways, and we cannot expect them to know as much as a grain merchant knows. Those are the things that are waking up the farmers. They are being exploited by rings, even with fodder at its present price. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> openly and barefacedly in this Chamber defends and apologizes for the ring. We hear a number of protests about the duty on jute bags, a matter which will have to be considered by the Government. </para>

It was the fact that there are certain firms in Australia who bought jute bags twelve months ago at cheap rates, and have kept them, and are going to unload them on the farmers at about twice what they cost, thus making big fortunes. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> says that we should not interfere.

Fortunately for the referenda, the people, and the farmers in particular, are getting very alive to these matters. They are beginning to wake up. All this argument about men using their business acumen, and showing initiative and enterprise, and committing robbery with the aid of those qualities, is repellant to me. All <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> 's talk about economics cannot blind me to the fact that the farmers, and many others who support him, are becoming alive to the real position. These " boodliers  " and exploiters support the honorable senator and his party. </para>

The State Factory in Western Australia is turning out these machines for £65 each, whilst private enterprise is charging £95 and upwards for them. In the same way the State Implement Factory charges £25 for a plough, whereas private enterprise  sells  it for £40. </para>

                            <para>- There have not been any losses. Of course I know that my honorable friend does not like these facts. They are not palatable to him. I would further point out that, whereas, private enterprise charges 8 per cent, interest on the price of these machines when-. sold on terms, the State Implement Factory charges only 5 per cent. But the worst feature of all is that, if a farmer requires any duplicate part of a machine, purchased from private factories, he is charged double what it is worth. If a .machine were built up of duplicate parts it would cost double the price at which it can ordinarily be bought. The duplicate parts sold by the State Implement Factory can be purchased for 50 per cent, less than can those sold by private enterprise. </para>

                    <para>I have carefully gone into the figures which the Royal Commission that inquired into the matter of farming implements has embodied in its report. That report states that there are 9,000 harvesters sold yearly in Australia. It will be seen, therefore, that the difference between the price charged for these machines by private enterprise and that charged by the State Implement Factory represents no less a sum than £270,000. Similarly there are 17,000 seed drills sold annually, and as the difference between the price charged for them by private enterprise and that charged by the State Implement Factory is £14, it represents a further sum of £238,000. On these two implements alone the farmers are being taxed to the extent of £508,000 a year - over half a million per annum. Yet the farmer's friends defend this sort of thing. I have here a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> R. Bell, of Bell Brothers, Western Australia, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will probably know as prosperous farmers. The letter reads - </para>

It is a publication which ought to be in the hands of every elector. Its author did not compile it as a supporter of the Labour party, but as a student. As a- matter of fact, 1 believe that, in politics, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> is a Liberal. </para>

In this State, prior to 1914, there were two companies manufacturing super-phosphates - the Mount Lyell Company and the Wallaroo Company - and the price .of super-phosphate was £3 18s. 6d'.

On one day he dug a large quantity of potatoes, which were of "the same variety and quality, and were grown in the same' paddock. He had them bagged and sent to Melbourne, one consignment being sent to the Gippsland and Northern Co-operative Selling Company, and a similar consignment to another agent. </para>

This agent stated that the potatoes arrived in a sunburnt condition, and that he experienced difficulty in securing a buyer for them at all. But the grower says that they were sent in the same truck as the consignment for which he received £4 15s., and were stacked underneath that consignment. Further, he says, that the weather was cool at the time. </para>

                        <para>The disclosed value of the assets of the Colonial Sugar  Refining  Company is £5,566,500; <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> market value of the shares in the company is £7,600,000 (an increase of approximately £1,000,000 in four years). In other words, the shareholders value their property at £2,000,000 more than the assets are declared to be worth in the duly audited balance-sheets. Now, this means one of two things: there has been either £2,000,000 of undisclosed profits devoted to buying plantations, mills, &amp;c, which are not shown as assets, or the shareholders consider their monopoly of the sugar industry (or, in other words, the power they have acquired to fix the price of refined sugar and sugar cane in Australia) is worth £2,000,000. If this is not so, then if the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a legitimate investment, the shares that were standing at £46 15s. in 1914 were only worth £34 10s., according to the published balance-sheets of the company. The conclusion is obvious. If the truth were known, it is probable this company is making 30 per cent, on the capital as it existed some few years ago. </para>

                        <para>During the last three years these lucky investors have had apportioned amongst them £450,000 of profits over and above their regular dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum. This extra distribution took the form of shares paid up to £20 each, but worth in the market more than double that sum, so that those participating actually benefited by something like £900,000 from these bonus additions to their capital. Clearly the undivided profits are becoming embarrassing, especially as the directors admit that the earnings of the business outside Australia during the last fifteen years have practically paid for all the company's investments in Fiji. Consequently it has been decided to present shareholders with £150,000 in the form of paid-up shares, raising the total distributed in this fashion to £575,000, approximately worth £1,250,000 in the market. This operation brings the paid-up capital to the authorized limit of £3,000,000. In order to provide for the disposal of the prospective larger profits foreshadowed in the chairman's speech to the meeting on Thursday, it is proposed to alter the deed of settlement so as to permit further additions to the capital account. </para>

A proportion of the growers, as growers, do well. . . . But growers as a class do not, in our opinion, receive their fair share of the profits of the industry as a whole. Nor do they receive that adequate return on their capital outlay which it should be one object of a protective system to insure. " We hang on in the hope of better things," expresses the prevailing attitude. </para><para class="block">Yet we have had from the honorable senator a laudation of this company that is not only penalizing the public, but is also, as every senator from Queensland will testify, robbing and exploiting the growers. I could also quote the report of the Royal Commission, in which the fixation of prices is recommended, and the report of the Commission that sat in New Zealand, and showed how this company was robbing the people in that Dominion through the merchants, but the honorable senator would not take notice of them. He claims that the referenda measures are the robbers and the burglars. We claim that they are the policemen, and that unless we get these enhanced powers, the robbery for which my honorable friend apologizes, and which he condones, will continue. </para><para>Another matter with which I wish to -deal before I sit down is the question of shipping. I speak with sorrow on this point. What have the party represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> done in regard to the Shipping Ring? Encouraged it, bolstered it up, and supported it by giving it Government money as a subsidy in order to enable it to take up a stronger position than ever. To our regret, as Tasmanian representatives, when we calculated on a cessation of the monopoly existing on the service between Melbourne and Launceston, and the institution of our own steamers run by the Australian people, our political opponents manoeuvred and intrigued - and one gentleman, who was Vice-President of the Executive Council in the last Liberal Government, was mainly responsible for it - until the Postmaster-General of that Government gave to the Union Steam-ship Company Limited and Huddart, Parker and Company Limited, as joint tenderers, a contract for seven years, enabling them to exploit and rob the producers and farmers of Tasmania until 1920. </para><interjection>

In the early part of my speech I said that the problem is that, in spite of the reduced cost of production, the people do not get a cheaper article, and in many instances they certainly do not. I have here clear proof of how the jam manufacturers, not satisfied with the profits they are earning, are making deliberate attempts to extort still more from the pockets of the people.

I told the members that whatever they decided to do in regard to the reduction of weight, we would be no party to it; we would not interfere with our weights in the slightest manner, whatever conclusion they came to; we would run our business in our own way, whatever they did. The meeting got out of hand then. There was a lot of warm talk, and one of their representatives, named BoYce, from Sydney, told me to go to hell out of that. 12153.

                        protested, the others waxed very warm about his remarks, and threw him out of the combine. But, fortunately, he was able to give afterwards sworn evidence, which placed the position clearly before the people of Australia. Not only have the jam manufacturers decreased the size of their small tins, but they have also decreased the size of the larger tins. The  chairman  asked - 12183. What are those quoted at wholesale per dozen tins? - I think the Necessary Commodities Commission raised the price of plum to 7s. lid. per dozen for 2-lb. gross tins: for fl-lb. tins they charge three times the price of 2 lbs. gross, less 3d.: that would be 21s.

If we got different-sized tins for different jams wo could get tins to take the 88  OZS.  only, but that is impracticable in a large business; and what we want is legislation, or regulations so drawn up that the minimum weight in the tins shall he either full pounds or such proportions as half and quarters.. It is fairer to the public and fairer to the other manufacturers, and people who put up the 82i-oz. tin, which is supposed

They do not say what weight of jam is in a tin, but sell the tin at a price, and the women think that they are buying the ordinary sized tin, not looking at the little difference in size, 'and congratulating themselves upon having got a cheap line of jam for the household.

The Combine are putting up a " dump " tin under the grocers' own label, and they have nothing but that in their shop. The Mutual Store has the 27-oz. tin, which is put up under their label, and the 21-oz. tin is put up under the grocers' label also. All the tins I produce, except the " dump," are bought in Victoria, in the suburbs of Melbourne; and are tins of different makers. </para>

If that is not robbery, I shall have to get a new definition of the term. Continuing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> said - 1 have been a member of the Sydney Jam Association for five or six years. There is an association of manufacturers in New South Wales, and an association of the manufacturers in Victoria. Twice a year the manufacturers from New South Wales, Victoria, Hobart, and South Australia meet in Melbourne to discuss matters in connexion with Western Australian and Queensland trade. The biggest sellers in those two States are H. Jones and Company Limited, of Hobart. My experience of this association is that we have no chance whatever; it is controlled by the Combine. They -met us as honorable men, and we fixed up arrangements ; but they always had some men they could not control, who were always breaking those arrangements. All through the year we were complaining, but we could get no satisfaction. When this Melbourne company was formed, we decided to have nothing to do with the association whatever. We wanted a free hand, so that if the Combine got up to their funny business we would not have to go to the trouble of withdrawing from the association; we would meet the competition. </para><para class="block">To-day the combine are trying to penalize Taylor Brothers, because that man was honest enough to tell the truth. He said that the combine not only fix the price for Queensland, but pay a retaining fee of £100 to a man in that State, whose duty it is to see that jam is not sold below the specified price. Speaking on that subject, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> gave this information - I 12150. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline><inline font-style="italic">Rouget</inline> - These all refer  only  to Queensland? - Yes.

It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Burnard's  business to see that they did not break the arrangement, and if they persisted he was to report to the manufacturers, who would not supply them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Jones, in his Hobart factory, put up 28 OZS.  until last year, and the Sydney factory put up 28  OZS.,  but now they put up only 27  OZS.  The public has not noticed the weight, and in Victoria they have been putting up 27  ozs.  for some time. The Hobart and Sydney factories have been following, and they want us to follow in the same way.  </para><para class="block">That is to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Burnard  went to Queensland, and made an arrangement with the merchants that jam was to be sold at a certain rate, and if sold at below that rate, he was not to supply them. That position of affairs in a free country, especially when it applies to about one-half of our business undertakings, is one which the people cannot be expected to tolerate much longer. </para><para>I could deal fully with the questions of timber and bricks if I had the time.

We say that the cure in many instances would be Government enterprise, and that it would be more' effective than a fixation of prices. The honorable senator says that not one of the Government enterprises has been a success, and challenges us to show any enterprises which have been justified, and he particularly mentioned the Defence Department. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> knows perfectly well that the French authorities make seven or eight different grades, of tobacco. They do the same as the companies here; they put up a cheap tobacco like the 6d. Lubra,  and if the poorer people want cheap tobacco like that, they can obtain it. But they also put up better qualities, and they put them up cheaper than we do in Australia. Does the honorable senator know that the average price of tobacco in France is 4s. ltd. per lb., as compared with 6s. 8£d. in Australia? That is to say, in Australia we pay 2s. 7d. per lb. more than the people in France do for their tobacco. But that is not all. The Tobacco Combine here is making millions out of the people. That is successful business. </para>

                            <para>- That does not alter the fact I have stated. Italy, prior to the war, was making £9,000,000 out of tobacco, and Austria £12,000,000. I am reminded that Japan has also nationalized this business. It was one of the best things that Japan ever did, for it enabled 'that country to prosecute the war with Russia more successfully than would have been the case otherwise. During (.'he war with Russia Japan was able to draw on her finances to insure, to a very great extent, the successful conclusion of that conflict. She floated ordinary loans, and finally, after she got up to her limit she raised a loan of £60,000,000 on the security of her nationalized tobacco industry. That will show how profitable the industry is to a country like Japan; and yet, if we talk about nationalizing the tobacco industry by means of these additional powers, which we hope the people will give to the National Parliament, we are told that it cannot be done, and -that French tobacco, which is quoted as an an illustration, is the worst in the world. The quality of tEe tobacco will be just as good as the people of Australia determine through their representatives that it shall be, and if they want a better grade, or a cheaper tobacco, all the demands will be legitimately and fully supplied. With the magnificent object lesson provided by Japan during the war with Russia, we can unhesitatingly say it would be good for Australia if, in prosecuting this war, we had our own tobacco industry from which we could draw profits to fight the Germans, instead of allowing those profits to go into the pockets of private companies. </para>

                        also said that State Socialism was enervating. Of course, according to the honorable  senator, it is not enervating if private enterprises fix and raise prices against the people. No;, it makes them feel better, and it' gives them a manly pride in themselves when they walk down the street ! We all must delight, I suppose, at the thought that the sugar company is taxing us, that the tobacco industry is doing the same, and that the many other monopolies existing in our midst are all getting their little bit.

                        it would fill us with anxiety and dread, it would strain our intellects, and it would upset our mental equilibrium, if we were to make many of these articles in our own factories. Pursuing' that line of reasoning further, we are told that it would be dangerous and damaging to the Constitution, and altogether deplorable, so far as the Democracy of Australia is concerned, to nationalize these industries. What an argument !

As a student, I have found the greatest pleasure in reading the history of that Department, and when we get sufficient Labour Governments in Australia we shall establish State Export Departments in every State, together with the necessary corollary, Commonwealth steamers to London, and we shall not stop there. We shall then establish a market for the distribution of the Commonwealth produce in London. When we have those Socialistic services in operation, we shall do more for the producer in five or ten years than the great Liberal party - of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is one of the remnants in this Chamber - have done during the last fifty years. </para>

But honorable senators who have been there know all about these. I would like, also, to speak of the Newport Workshops in Victoria, and of the magnificent work there turned out. I went over the Cordite Factory - more State Socialism - the other  day, saw for myself what it has been able to do in this great war; and I realized what a difference it would have made if we had not had the Factory at work. We must remember, also, that the establishment of that Factory was due to the forethought of Labour legislators. </para><para>I want to refer finally to one institution, established by the Labour party, which above all others will be of incalculable benefit to this country: I refer to the Commonwealth Bank - more Socialism, of course. If that Bank had not been in operation to-day, we would not have been in our present satisfactory financial position. I may remind the honorable senators also that that Bank started with no capital, but had £20,000 advanced by the Treasurer of Australia as till money. On the first six months' operations there- was a loss of £45.000, and that fact was at once seized upon by honorable senators opposite to misrepresent the position. The loss was occasioned by inaugural expenses ; but we find to-day that that loss has been wiped out, that the Bank is entirely self-supporting, and that it has not cost the people of the Commonwealth anything. This Bank will enable us, in the great financial undertaking close at hand, to socialize our finances and arrange to carry on the business of the country in an expeditious and economical manner. It will  also take charge of the great loan which the Prime Minister has indicated will be issued shortly; and, if necessary, it will be able to come to the support of the private banks, backed up by the legislation of this Parliament. </para><para>I want to say, in conclusion, that these referenda proposals are necessary now; that we, as a Labour party, have definitely come into this Parliament pledged to submit them to the people. We said that we could not' control the conditions of Australia without these national powers, and we would deserve to be hounded out of office, and be relegated to that oblivion which politicians dread - the cold shades of Opposition - if we did not give effect to our pledges. We made that promise when the war broke out, and if the party failed to keep it, many of us would want to reconsider our attitude towards the party. We should think seriously whether we would remain in it if it broke its promise to the people, who heard us on public platforms say it was our duty to take the 'referenda, organize our conditions, and socialize our resources. If we did not go on with these proposals, those who listened to that statement, including even many of our opponents, would ask us, " Why do you not take the referenda?" We do not know' what is ahead of us in Australia. We are living in strange times, and stirring episodes are ahead. This great conflict may lead us into many strange avenues; but we know that if we can uphold our position as a nation and combat the German hordes until we can organize the resources of the Empire to drive them back - if we can only mark time until that organization is complete - we must succeed, and the powers for which we are now asking will help us to achieve that purpose. If we fail to organize our resources, I cannot see how we can combat our enemies. It may be that conditions will be worse in six months. I sincerely hope they will not. 'I am rather an optimist, and believe they will be better. I believe in the resources of the Empire, and that the conditions will be just as propitious for taking the vote then as now. Anyhow, the Government are not answerable for the future; they are answerable for the present, and they must conform to the will of the people. </para><para>

                        talked of the lessons of history. My reading of history has made it plain to me that whenever a nation has become decadent the decadence has been preceded by the aggregation of wealth in the hands of a few. The honorable senator talked of the French Revolution, and the fixation of prices in that country at the time. Every historian tells us that the great nations went down directly its wealth came under the control of a few men. According to the historians, Carthage, .Greece, Rome, and even Babylon fell when a few people held the whole country within their grip.

                        <para>.- A petition was presented to the Senate this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of certain electors of this State, praying that the Constitution Alteration Bills be not submitted to the people for discussion or decision during the currency oi the war. Without having had the time or the. opportunity to peruse carefully the signatures attached to the petition, I venture to assert that the majority of the petitioners have in peace as well as war been opposed to the submission of these proposals to the people, and that when the Bills were before the electors on former occasions 95 per cent, of those whose names are attached to the petition unhesitatingly cast their votes against them. Whether in peace or war, these people are opposed to the principles embodied in the Bills. The Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, in his speech this afternoon, took as his text against the Government and the Labour party, as a strong party man - and he can never be anything else - in order that he might, in his own particular and peculiar way, strengthen his party and weaken ours, the three words, " Business as usual," from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> speech. But he signally failed, because he resorted, I do not think intentionally, to a method that cannot at any time be commended. If one takes three words from any sentence - from one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's,</inline> for instance - he can build up a hypothetical case, and lash himself into a fury, making himself imagine, if he keeps at it long enough, that he has a good case against his opponents. The Leader of the Opposition said this was not a time for either pessimism or optimism. That sort of statement is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. A man must be either a- pessimist or an optimist in this crisis. We have no time at this critical period of our, and the Empire's, history for pessimists in Australia, or in this National Assembly. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said in effect: We are intrusted with grave and serious national responsibilities,  and we shall preach optimism. This is the time to preach it. We shall tell the people of Australia that our national business is being carried on as usual. The shutters will not be put up at our huge Customs Department, from which, year by year, large revenues are derived. The Minister of Customs will be there morning, noon, and night, if necessary, to attend to his duties. The Postal Department will be intrusted to a responsible Minister, so that our postal, telephone, and telegraph services may be utilized as freely and extensively in war time as in peace. The business of the Defence Department, upon which, above all others, the eyes of Australia, and even of the Empire, are focussed, will be carried on as usual. It will be carried on as it always has been carried on when the Labour party have been in power - that is, in a business-like way. Never in the history of Australia have such business-like methods been employed in the administration of our affairs as have been employed since the Labour Government took office during the currency of the war. Would the party opposite stop all .our national undertakings during the war? Would they stop the construction of the trans-Australian railway, on which so many men are employed ? Would they stop the work at Flinders Naval Base ? Would they stop the works at the Federal Capital ? The Government say, "Notwithstanding the war which is engaging our most serious attention, the business in all our Departments is being carried on as usual." Because the Government have for a long time taken that optimistic view, the Leader of the Opposition to-day smites the Vice-President of the Executive Council hip and thigh for having the manliness and courage to proclaim to the people that the Labour party are not pessimists:that we shall see the war through no matter what the cost may be, and that during its currency all the Departments of the Commonwealth will be carried on as usual. The honorable senator's speech was made absolutely for party purposes. No one knows better than he that, in the various States, the big commercial institutions urged the people to take a hopeful and cheery view of the situation. As a result, numbers of business men displayed in their windows, to influence those citizens who might be disposed to take a pessimistic view, placards which read "Business carried on as usual." This was done in order that private employers might be stimulated to take a hopeful view of the situation, instead of being disposed to "sack" their men and look gloomy. It was felt that it was far better to look on the sunny side of the question in the hope that, in the process of time - and we trust the time will be short - the struggle in which we are engaged would come to a successful termination for the Empire and its Allies. I listened the other evening to a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> He is always, more or less, entertaining. Like the boy in the lolly shop, who stays there for a very long time, the honorable senator, when he takes a subject in hand, hangs a long time on his theme, but since I have been in public life I never heard a more illogical speech, a more parochial speech, a more reactionary speech, or one less Australian than that delivered by the honorable senator. The State of Tasmania, which the honorable senator represents, has for long years been anything but progressive. It has been one of the most backward of the States, and I do not wonder at it, because, for many years, such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> had possession of the reins of Government there. Only recently was there a ray of sunshine in that State, and that came with the advent of the Labour Government. We have heard honorable members of his party say in this Parliament, and from numerous platforms, that our Federal Constitution is not what the people thought it was when they adopted it, and that it requires amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> says that there will be no amendment of it so far as he is concerned. He affirms that we have enough to deal with. He says that we have three huge Departments under our control, namely, Customs, Defence, and Post Office. These represent the beginning and the end of our Federal Constitution from his standpoint. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> says that, to a reasonable extent, he is a Protectionist. He urges that Protection is a good thing for the cities and large centres of population. But he affirms that it is a bad thing for places in which the population is not large, and where settlement is sparse. In other words, he is a town Protectionist and a country Free Trader, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Facing-both-ways</inline> so far as fiscalism is concerned. But surely the Parliament which is empowered to extend Protection to our manufacturers should also be empowered to extend it to our workmen and consumers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> says that it ought not to have any such powers. Then he announced his opposition to these Bills on the ground that under them it is intended to fix the prices of farmers' commodities. Nobody knows better than he does that it is not intended to do anything of the kind. Where competition exists there is no intention to interfere with prices, and competition does exist in regard to all the primary products of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that we are at liberty to discuss the whole of these Constitution Alteration Bills upon this measure. It is not intended to fix the price of the primary products because competition prevails in respect of them. But where competition is eliminated, and prices are fixed by monopolistic institutions to the detriment of the people, these Bills will empower the Government to deal with such institutions. Why, asks <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> did the New South Wales Government fix the price of a certain commodity? Because these are war times, and because they felt it was their duty to safeguard the interests of the citizens of that State. Whilst I believed, when I voted for Federation, that we would have Inter-State Free Trade, and whilst I was of opinion that the action of the New South Wales Government was an unconstitutional one, I recognise that the High Court has declared otherwise. The New South Wales Government affirmed that it had the power to commandeer the wheat supplies of that State, and, having seized them, it fixed the price of that commodity at a higher figure than the farmer had been accustomed to re'ceive for his wheat. </para>

                            <para>- The High Court has declared the New South Wales Government had the power to seize the wheat supplies of that State. Now, Senators Turley and Bakhap inquire, " Will the passing of these Bills alter that condition of things?" I go so far' as to say that I dor not think any alteration of our Constitution will deprive the States of sovereign powers-; but I do say that the passing of these Bills will confer upon the Commonwealth Parliament a power concurrent with that possessed by New South Wales, and with concurrent power we will have supreme power. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator might be able to go on building up hypothetical cases till the crack o.f doom ; but I intend to deal only with concrete cases. When we entered into Federation, everybody thought that the States were entering into a partnership one with the other. Does anybody mean to tell me that the peopl'e were then of opinion that Queensland, which produces nearly the whole of the sugar supply of Australia, could at any time say to the citizens of the other States, ' ' Although we entered into Federation with you, we are not going to give you any sugar"? Did anybody anticipate that New South Wales would be able to say to the people of the other States, " We are not going to give you any wheat. Although you may be starving, you may whistle for your sugar and your wheat " ? What sort of a partnership would that be? </para>

If it is to be laid down that no railways should be built unless they are paying propositions, the honorable senator will, when he has an opportunity, vote for the elimination of moneys on the Estimates for providing telephonic and mail services in distant parts of the States - services which will never be payable-. </para>

                            <para>- I heard him trot out the hackneyed argument about the Tobacco and Match Monopoly in France. One grows sick and tired of hearing of it. I was a member of a Committee which was appointed by the Senate some time ago to inquire into the operation of an alleged combine - the 'Tobacco Monopoly in Australia. There is no doubt that it is a monopoly. Whilst we were taking evidence, the same statement was made in regard to the Tobacco and Match Monopoly in France. But the people cannot be continually hoodwinked. The truth is that the citizens of France get exactly the kind of tobacco which is palatable to them. They get the article that they want. </para>

                                Bakhap's  idea is violent opposition to enterprise by the States, though better examples of municipal Socialism than those in his own State of Tasmania cannot be found anywhere. The people are anxiously awaiting the opportunity to alter the Federal Constitution. Different members of the party to which honorable senators opposite belong have admitted that it needs alteration. Years have passed since it was framed and adopted by the people, and in the whirligig of time, which changes every sphere of human activity, remarkable changes have taken place. At that time people were of the opinion that many of the powers then and now possessed by the States would be taken away from them, and that the Commonwealth Parliament would have supreme power in regard to a large number of matters' affecting the welfare of the citizens of Australia. But they have been sadly disappointed. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has in his possession a list of legal decisions which shows that the  very  persons who took a hand in the framing of our Constitution, being of the opinion that the 'Commonwealth possessed certain powers, introduced measures in this Parliament which, when they were tested in the High Court, were declared

Because it threatened to paralyze the wheels of industry, not merely in New South Wales, but in every State of Australia, Newcastle being the base of the supply of coal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that though a strike may hold up the railways of New South Wales, and perhaps inconvenience that State, the Commonwealth should not have the power, on behalf of the five other States, to intervene and interfere with that State's instrumentality.

It is because I am in favour of the Commonwealth having supreme power over the States in regard to such matters that I want to see these Bills go through, and the people voting " Yes " upon them. </para>

                    <para class="block">If my memory serves me rightly, the Act just mentioned was intended to do justice to seamen in all parts of Australia.' If a seaman in the course of following his usual employment was injured, the Act gave him the opportunity of securing compensation from his employers, but I believe that a case was tested, and it was held that, if a man working for an Inter-State shipping company, and employed on a ship trading from State to State, happened to be injured in any one State, although the ship at the time might be but a few yards from the boundary of another State, it was impossible for him under the Act to get the justice to which he was entitled. Is that a fair thing, when, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> interjects, the man might be crippled for life? If the accident had happened a few minutes later, and a few yards farther on, the Act would have been  valid, and he would have been entitled to full compensation. It is to remedy that, and many other things, that these measures are introduced. The return continues - </para>

When the framers of the Constitution played their part in drafting its provisions, they were of the opinion that the Commonwealth would have the powers which the High Court said we do not possess. Some members of the High Court were members of the Convention; some members of the High Court were members of this Parliament, and some members of the High Court were responsible for the introduction of some of those measures into Parliament. The time has arrived - it arrived long ago - for the Commonwealth Parliament to be clothed with such" powers as will adequately protect, not the citizens of any one State, but the citizens of all the States in the Commonwealth. If the people are given an opportunity, as they will be - because these Bills are certain to go through - they will be able to say "Yes" or " No." My opinion is that an immense majority will say " Yes," and it is because our opponents fear that result that they are resorting to every device known to them to oppose these measures. Petitions are part of the game. Petitions here, petitions there-, petitions everywhere ! -From whom, and for what purpose? To prevent the referenda proposals from go ing to the people, because, our opponents say, this is war time. But did they not do all in their power to block the proposals in peace time? Have they not opposed the measures whether the time has been peaceful or warlike? It is because we have always been in favour of the proposals, both in peace time and war time, and because we believe that they are absolutely necessary in the interests of this Parliament and the people of Australia, that we hope that they will be carried on this occasion by majorities in at least a majority of the States of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened this afternoon to the Leader of the . Opposition here delivering one of those characteristic speeches which we expect to hear from every platform when an opponent of these proposals addresses the electors. I think that the honorable senator was very unfortunate as regards the manner in which he set out to furnish reasons why the proposals should not be put before the people at present. He drew a picture of our troops fighting at the front; he drew a picture of the hills of Gallipoli dripping with Australian blood, and the inference was clearly to be drawn that he doubted very much whether the members of the Labour party were concerned over that blood-dripping or not; that we cared more for the carrying of these proposals than we did for the lives of our sons who have been and are being sacrificed in defence of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- " Business as usual," said the Leader of the Opposition. That was the text upon which he made an indictment against the Government for going on with these referenda proposals at the present time; but if that is to be the text of his party during the forthcoming struggle - it is quite evident that they are going to make it a struggle - I feel confident that members on this side of the chamber, and those who think as we do, will have no difficulty in replying effectively to that criticism. We find that, notwithstanding the war that is being waged in Europe, business is going on as usual in every department of life in this and every other country. We have heard reported this afternoon innumerable instances where business is not only going on as usual, but robbery, and robbery of the very worst kind, is going on. </para>

                            <para>- I will deal with that point a little later. I observe that the remark has fallen from certain members of the Opposition that these referenda questions have been put to the people already on two occasions. The Opposition have fought them with all their skill and all their ability and all their wealth every time they have been placed before the people, and I have no doubt, judging by the indications we have already had, that on the next occasion they will be fought even more strenuously and with a greater amount of vindictiveness. Notwithstanding the existence of the war there will be a more lavish, expenditure of money in fighting them than ever there was before. In 1911, when these proposals were put to the people, they were rejected by a considerable majority. In 1913, when they were again submitted, they were once more rejected, but by a very much diminished majority. In 1911 19 per cent of the aggregate votes was cast against the Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) Bill, which was the most important of all the proposals. But in 1913, with a very much larger vote, the majority against that Bill had decreased to 1.2 per cent, of the votes cast, showing very clearly that the people had begun to realize the necessity for some amendment of the Constitution in order to secure relief from the burdens under which they were labouring. I have no doubt that at the forthcoming referenda the majority against these proposals will not only disappear, but that there will be a large majority in favour of them. Why do I say that? I say it for the reason that "business" in the meantime has been going on as usual, and the cost of living . has been increasing. Everything that the people can purchase, and that can possibly be cornered by interested persons, is being cornered, with the result that prices are rising in consequence. For that reason I have no doubt that when the questions are submitted to the people again this question of the cost of living will become very prominent right throughout the country, and the people will seek relief by giving to the Commonwealth power to apply a remedy. On the last occasion there were over 170,000 informal votes, equal to seven times the number of electors necessary . to carry the Bill relating to monopolies. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, infinitely more, but we are confident that, on the next occasion, the questions will be placed before the people in such a way that there will be less risk of informal votes, because the electors will thoroughly understand them. We have heard from certain honorable senators who have spoken, that the States should each be sovereign within its own boundaries. If they are sovereign in their own spheres of legislative activity, why, in the name of common sense, should the Commonwealth not be sovereign within its sphere? The State Parliaments can pass such laws as they deem desirable.  But what is the position of the Commonwealth? We can pass whatever legislation we please here, but that legislation has to run the gauntlet of the High Court, and is subject to review on any appeal. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is making quite a mistake in that matter. I have every respect for the Federal Constitution, but I am aware that it is defective, and I am also aware than the legal members of the honorable senator's own party have time and again pointed out its shortcomings. I have so much respect for the Constitution that I am most anxious to remove the anomalies that exist, and make it workable as it was supposed to be by the framers, many of whom subsequently came into this Chamber and attempted to pass legislation under a Constitution which was their own handiwork, only to find that the High Court blocked them. We are bound to admit, therefore, that the work which they thought was perfect is imperfect and inadequate. We had a right to impose a Federal land tax, and recently we passed an amendment to impose a tax upon leaseholds, with the result that interested parties came along, and put the machinery of the High Court into motion. That Court decided that the Federal Parliament had the power to impose taxation upon leaseholds, but we now find that the appellants are taking the question to the Privy Council. If the Privy Council upholds the decision of the High Court in Australia, well and good ; but if the Privy Council decides that the Commonwealth does not possess this power, there, will be another proof that the Constitution is unworkable. </para>

If he were to vote as he speaks he would vote in support of at least some of these proposals. The honorable senator speaks here in one direction and votes in another - a thing which no honorable, senator on this side does. The intention of the Constitution was that trad© should be perfectly free between the States. Now that it is found that that is- not the case we are anxious to that extent to remedy matters, but the honorable senator is not: </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator is prepared to do that he&gt; is speaking on one side and voting on the other. The same' anomaly is clearly shown in industrial matters. In order to get a case before the Federal Arbitration Court we have to create a dispute - as happened with the Brisbane tramway strike and in many other instances - extending beyond the limits of one State.. That is surely a ridiculous position. There should be no need to extend a dispute in order to bring about its peaceful settlement in the Arbitration Court. TheCourt should have power to settle industrial disputes without waiting for the wheels of industry to be stopped. Those who are opposing our amendment of the constitutional provisions regarding industrial disputes are clearly in favour of continuing the pernicious system of the strike. That must be true of all who are not in favour of amending the Constitution so that the industrial laws of the Commonwealth may be operative in a reasonable and sensible way. The High Court limits the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, but does not interfere with the State laws. Those who are opposing these amendments are therefore anxious that the High Court, and not the Commonwealth Parliament, should continue to govern Australia. We have in the Commonwealth practically one race, of one colour and one tongue; yet its affairs have to be governed by six separate State Parliaments. The framers of the Constitution, and the electors who agreed to it as originally submitted to them, have been disappointed. They were satisfied that it provided for just what it said, and that the difficult question of monopolies, trusts, and combines, and other troubles that were beginning to grow up in the States, would be dealt with by the Federal authority. The shortcomings of the Constitution are coming home to the people from day to day with greater force than they ever did before. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> told us this afternoon of some of the operations of trusts and combines that are well known to every honorable senator. </para>

                            <para>- But for the fear that the trusts will be " hit up " by these amendments, we should not have the same opposition from honorable senators opposite as we have had on this occasion and on every other occasion when they have been put before Parliament. Many monopolies exist in the open light of day, and make no apology for their existence ; nor do they try to conceal their operations. There are other monopolies carried on practically without any visible organization. These are known as "honorable understandings," by which a number of men combine together by mutual agreement and corner the requirements of the people. They keep no books or minutes, and pay no secretary, simply giving the gentleman who acts in that capacity a.n honorarium. We found that that existed in South Australia in connexion with wheat. I happened to be a member of the Wheat Commission in that State. We found, by the examination of certain members of the Combine, and of the gentleman who acted as secretary of the " honorable understanding," exactly the work they were doing. Every morning the price of wheat was fixed over the telephone, and no records were kept ; but we knew perfectly well that an "honorable understanding " existed, and shortly after the Commission unearthed the fact the "honorable understanding " fell, more or less, to pieces. I am satisfied that to-day the same system is flourishing as strongly as ever it did. We have heard a good deal about the Beef Trust - a worse combine than even the Wheat Combine in South Australia was. No one doubts its existence; yet at the time the referenda proposals were last before the people the idea of the existence of a Beef Trust in Australia was scouted by all our opponents. </para>

                            <para>- He came to those conclusions on the evidence submitted to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> knows that' certain questions were asked and not answered, and certain information was denied. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Street could not possibly ascertain it, but there is no doubt in the mind of any man in Australia that a Beef Trust exists. There is no doubt in the minds of honorable senators opposite. We all know it is in operation. Some members of the Opposition are fair-minded enough to wish to see the operations of that Trust stopped, if possible, but they are not anxious to go so far as to vote for these proposals simply because they have been put forward by the Labour party. That fact is sufficient to condemn them in the eyes of our opponents, no matter how clearly we put them forward. Go to the northwest of Western Australia, to Northern Queensland, to the small butcher selling meat in any part of the Commonwealth, and ask whether there is a Beef Trust in Australia. The practical men, the men under the heel of the Trust, will tell you their difficulties in carrying on their business in the interest of the community, owing to the operations of the Trust. Only this morning a cable appeared in the newspapers in reference to an incident which occurred a couple of weeks ago. On that occasion, we learn that a British man-of-war took certain vessels, which were laden with meat, to a British port to be searched. Those vessels were unquestionably carrying beef to the enemy. It is quite possible that a considerable portion of that beef came from Australia, and I ask honorable senators opposite whether they are prepared to support any organization which will take the meat produced in Australia to feed the German troops? Is that fair? I think not. If there had been no suspicion of that character, would a British man-of-war have taken those vessels to port to be searched? Certainly not. That warship had no doubt whatever that the ultimate destination of the beef was Germany. The value of £hose cargoes of meat was approximately £5,000,000. We know that the Chicago packers and the other people who are behind the Beef Trust exerted all their influence to secure the release of those cargoes, so that they might reach their destination. In the end, they arrived at an agreement, but the fact remains that they had made a bargain. They, had made a considerable amount of money out of the deal, and before a satisfactory arrangement was arrived at, the British Government had to accede to their terms. We in Australia believe that all the meat we export should go to Great Britain to feed our fellow countrymen, or our soldiers, who are fighting our battles in Europe. But the Beef Trust care very little as to the destination of the meat controlled by them, so long as their profits are secured to them. Some time ago the Commonwealth very wisely prohibited the export of beef to any country other than Great Britain or those of her Allies. What happened? We are told that the Trust immediately put their meat into cool stores, or refused -to kill it until their terms were complied with. In addition, the meat was supplied just when it suited them. All this is being done by private individuals who have formed themselves into an organization, caring not whether the people are fed or starved, so long as they put huge profits into their own pockets. Can honorable senators opposite justify their attitude in defending organizations of this description? They tell us that the time is inopportune for the passing of these Bills. Personally, I know of no better time. In view of the very bad season which we have experienced - a season in which our crops proved a comparative failure - and seeing that our meat supplies are short whilst the cost of living is increasing by leaps and bounds, it seems to me  that there can be no better time to put them before the electors. It has been urged that we are forcing these Bills on an unwilling people. That i3 sheer nonsense. We merely give them the right to say whether they are prepared to live under existing conditions, or whether they desire to improve those conditions. In every policy-speech by the Prime Minister he has made the position perfectly clear. He has shown that it is our intention to put these questions to the people despite the wealth that is arrayed against us, and despite the influence of the press. It is nonsense to urge that we have brought them forward without due consideration. At the last elections we told the people that if the Labour party were returned to power we would give them an opportunity of voting upon these  ques.tions  at the earliest possible moment. We have been pledged . to these proposals ever since a Labour manifesto was issued; and because the Leader of the Opposition says that business is not being carried on as usual, are we to back down?' That would be quite the usual course it our politics and policy were those of the Liberal party. But the Labour party have always respected their .pledges to the electors. I have no desire to quote from the speeches which have been delivered, from time to time, not only by the Prime* Minister, but by the Attorney-General, and other leaders of the Labour movement. Those speeches all go to show that we were determined to put these questions to the people at the earliest opportunity. When speaking upon the subject of trusts, I overlooked one trust* which is well worthy of our attention - I refer to the Steel Trust. We had a bitter experience of its operations only a few years ago - an experience which proved a. very costly and inconvenient one to Australia. At the time of which I speak the Commonwealth Government were calling for tenders for steel rails in connexion with the construction of the transcontinental railway. </para>

                            <para>- That journal, despite the fact that it supported the referenda proposals on a previous occasion, is now opposed to their submission to the people. But we must recollect that that publication, and, indeed, no metropolitan newspaper, has ever been a very strong advocate of Labour principles or ideals. The advertisements flow into them, and I have no doubt that they cater for the class of trade which pays them best. But this is what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said of the Steel Trust on the 28th October, 1911, at the time the Commonwealth Government were up against the operations of that trust - </para>

                    <para>Australia, through the trans-continental railway and the National Executive, has experienced within the past months the remorseless power of the international ring of iron masters known as the Steel Trust. After a dramatic and exciting struggle, the Executive has had to capitulate to the ring - for a time. </para>
                    <para class="block">How long is that state of affairs to last ? Luckily the steel works recently established in Australia have relieved the situation to an extent, but we do not know how soon the Steel Trust may be in operation here, because money will buy all the steel works in Australia not owned by the Government, and the American Steel Trust has, or did have, enough money at its command to purchase all the steel works here. However, we agree with the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that, for a time, the Federal Government had to capitulate, but the time has now arrived when we need nob capitulate any longer - by the carrying of the referenda proposals it will be impossible for the Steel Trust, or any other trust, to form an organization which will be detrimental to the Government of Australia. If for no other reason than that the Commonwealth is expanding, and railway requirements are likewise expanding, and will continue to grow for many years to come, a Government which would neglect the opportunity of placing the Commonwealth outside the power of any trust would not be doing its duty to the country or to the people. We have good grounds for congratulating ourselves when the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which is not a particular friend of the Labour party, takes the stand it did on that occasion : but we are sorry to see that, like most Liberal organizations, it is, as it were, closing its doors to the emancipation of the people . from the power of trusts and combines. </para>

On the last occasion on which they were submitted matters of this kind had .a considerable effect upon the people. </para>

A great error was committed in not submitting the referenda proposals at the last election, and the honorable senator and his party are responsible_ solely for whatever expenditure may bo incurred in submitting the proposals in December next. The Senate specially requested that the referenda proposals should be submitted to the people. </para>

                            <para>- The Liberal party were  outed  much more effectively than were the referenda proposals on the last occasion they were submitted. If I am any judge of the feelings of the people, they will be carried long before the Liberal party come back to the Treasury bench. During this debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> made some reference to the- price of butter. We have been told that it is quite impossible for the Commonwealth Parliament to fix the price of commodities, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is a great advocate of private enterprise fixing prices to suit its own pockets. So long as men can corner the requirements of the people, or the food of the people, they can fix the prices of commodities, and trusts and combines can rob the people in any way they choose and have the approval and blessing of honorable senators opposite; but we on this side maintain that if a combination of commercial men can fix the price of commodities to suit their own pockets, the Government should be able to do something to checkmate them. That is all the power we ask. The fact that the Government of New South Wales had fixed the price of butter was quoted as proof of the fact that a Government could not successfully fix the price of any commodity.. </para>

They are exporting it from New South Wales in order to get a fictitious price. In fact, while New South Wales butter is being sold all over the Commonwealth, the people of that State have had to import butter from America.

Being the apple of the honorable senator's eye, he cannot do anything wrong, and must not be interfered with.  His  profits  must not go down in any circumstances. The idea of passing the referenda proposals in order that such wicked  things  can be stopped is unthinkable to" honorable senators opposite, and they must, therefore, carry on the good old practice of giving the middleman the lion's share of  the  profit on whatever he handles. </para>

                            <para>- No, I have not referred to the  honorable's  senator's arguments. Furthermore, the export of 22,800,000 lbs. of butter from New South Wales shows an increase of 5,400.000 lbs. over the export for the corresponding period of the previous year, proving that, after all, there was not such a shortage of butter as we are asked to believe by honorable senators, who have been pleading for the middleman in Sussex-street who never produced a POUnd of butter in his life. Indeed he knows better than to go on the land and do any farming. These are the men who farm the farmers all the time. The Sussex-street farmers, the George-street farmers, the Bourke-street farmers, and the rest of the street farmers are always pleading for the farmers on the land with tears in their voices, and the Labour party is represented as those who are invariably trying to down them on every occasion. We want to show the farmers, if we can, that such statements are not in accordance with facts. I ask honorable senators opposite to tell me where is a difference between the trader - the highly-prized middleman - who keeps the necessary food away from the people of Australia and the German Huns who are sending the food of the people of England to the bottom of the sea to-day ? There is not one whit of difference. One is as i  reprehensible  as the other. Our newspapers denounce the Germans for sending our foodstuffs to the bottom of the sea by means of torpedoes. But the same publications, and the same political party are holding up and defending for all they are worth those gentlemen who are cornering the' foodstuffs of the people, and who care not whether people starve or not, so long as they can get profits for their own pockets. In my estimation there is no difference between one and the other, and both of them deserve the same treatment. In conclusion, I desire to say a few words on the statements which our opponents make about burying the hatchet at the present time. They assert that the referenda proposals will cause a tremendous upheaval in the country, that the people cannot think of two things at the same time, that while the war is being waged it is impossible for the electors to give due consideration to these weighty proposals. </para>

                            <para>- I am satisfied that it will not. I believe that the war will not prevent one man or woman from exercising the suffrage. I am as much concerned as any man in the Commonwealth about the success of our troops, not only in Gallipoli, but in Europe. If I thought that their submission was likely to interfere in any shape or form with the people, I should not be advocating the proposals as I am doing. I feel quite confident that the cry of " Bury the hatchet "' is raised again for political purposes. Our opponents are prepared to resort to anything to gain delay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> referred to the case of a man in Melbourne who has. made £80,000 out of dealings in chaff during the last five or six months.

                            <para>- There is no qualification about a proceeding of that kind if it is true. The man who made that profit out of the necessities of the people of Australia, the man who cared not whether he starved the stock of people, the man who cared not whether the dairyman, the drayman, the cabdriver, or anybody else, lived or starved while he made a profit of £80,000 should be taken out and shot. That is my opinion of men who deal in that way. Is it any wonder, then, that I am  anxious that the referenda proposals should be carried if it will stop in the slightest degree such wickedness on the part of the middleman ? </para>

The source from which I got the information is so reliable that I have no doubt about its truthfulness. Whilst I do not know of such a large profit being made, I do know of tremendous profits being made in Australia to-day as the result of the operations of trusts and combines, composed of men who do not care a snap of the finger and thumb whether men or stock starve so long as their bank balance is increased by their wicked and pernicious transactions. To come back to the question of burying the hatchet, I wish to show how honorable senators opposite are burying it at present. A petition was presented to the Senate to-day from an organization in Victoria; I am not quite sure whether it came from the Australian Women's National League or not- </para>

It did not matter whether there were fifty representatives of Victoria in the Senate, so long as they were all Labour men the organization would turn them down. Let us see how our honorable friends are burying the hatchet. I have here a cutting from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of no more recent date than the 6th July, that is, during the great recruiting campaign. I have no hesitation in saying that the campaign is being used by our opponents for political purposes, and I regret to say so. There was a meeting of a branch of this great political organization held at Toorak, an aristocratic- quarter of Melbourne, where the members of the body live and have their being. I propose to quote a few words from a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who is, or ought to be, a big enough man, both physically and politically, to get beyond that kind of thing at the present time.

                            <para>- Ever since the Labour party came into Federal politics we have told the people that we would amend the Constitution as soon as we could. What is the use of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest saying that we are not free ? ' We are absolutely free. We have given a promise to the people. We are not free to break any pledge, if the members of the Opposition are. Here is an utterance by another distinguished member of the House of Representatives, a gentleman by tile name of Watt. </para>

Watt dealt still more vigorously with the situation, and declared that National Government, as it had hitherto been known in Australia, was dead, and control had passed into the hands of the Labour Conference. " The great ancestral institutions which we took from the Motherland and reared with such care," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> " have been crippled and thrown out of use, and in their place has risen a hostile organization which rules the statute-book and all the proceedings of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> declares that he is a free agent, but his freedom and that of his colleagues is only that of the tethered goat."- </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the kind of language which one can expect to hear from a distinguished gentleman who, a few years ago, was horsewhipped - a distinguished gentleman who ran away from his electorate because he was not game to face his electors. It came with a very bad grace from a gentleman like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> to refer to the great Labour party in such terms. I tell him that the members of that party are no more like tethered goats than he is. At the present time he more resembles a tethered goat than anything else I know of. I have read these extracts to show that these gentlemen, while they talk about burying the hatchet, tell the people that this is no time to raise political issues. These two gentlemen went out and led the van in stirring up political hatred, if it is possible to do so, amongst the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It is a way which the Liberal party have in politics. After having said the worst they can con.cerning political opponents, they  turn  round and ask favours of them. The sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> were applauded by the ladies present at the meeting, and I believe that the petition presented to-day asks us to call a political halt, and not to go on with the referenda proposals, because to do so would be to stir up political strife. They themselves are showing the way in stirring up strife at a time when, at any rate, theY should "be perfectly silent, that is, while the recruiting campaign is proceeding. We are not singular in Australia in having a political campaign during war time. We are not the only country that has gone through that experience. Italy had an election just before she entered the war, and I believe that, as the result of that election, Italy came into the conflict. We know that the people of Italy did not take the advice which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> now tenders to the Government of this country, but -that, on the contrary, they changed horses whilst crossing the stream, with the result that to-day we have Italy as an ally in this great war. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it was. Then, in the Federal arena, two of our members, .touched by the hand of death., dropped out of our ranks. But did our Liberal friends bury the political hatchet ? Of course they did not. On the contrary., ' they went out and fought those elections with the greatest bitterness and vilification of our party. There was no question of ceasing political strife so long as they thought they could win two seats that belonged to the Labour party, and if they thought they could win these referenda proposals now, they would not be- so keen about ceasing political strife at the present juncture. It is the fear that the Labour party will win that is troubling them, and not the question of putting the proposals to the people at all. We know also that, in Tasmania, there was an election recently in the Bass district, and that the Liberal party fought very bitterly. The Labour party had a majority of only one, and if the Liberal party had won that seat, the Government of Tasmania would have been obliged to go to the country, and Tasmania would have been plunged into a general election. </para>

                            <para>- Surely, in the face of all this, honorable senators opposite will not dare to suggest that we should declare a political truce ? Do they think they are going to fight us on every occasion, and that we are going to back down in this matter after being pledged for the last ten years to press it forward to a successful issue? I must not forget what occurred in my own State, where the ex-Premier was among the slaughtered politicians. A gentleman representing another district was induced to resign his seat, and the ex-Premier contested it. Here again all the bitterness that could possibly be imported into an election was introduced by the ex-Premier on a very recent occasion. I want to say, in conclusion, concerning the action of the Liberal party in another place, that I think - if I understand party warfare - it was. the duty of the Leader of that party to stand in his place and fight these referenda proposals. But what did he do ? He led his gallant band of followers out through the door with the best grace that he could command. </para>

                            <para>- We can have no regard for gentlemen who put that adage into practice. I did intend to reply to some statements made here by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap;</inline> but I think I have spoken long enough on these questions to-night. I want to say, however, that the honorable senator made a statement to the effect that we, the members of the Labour party, were driven into this action by a Conference that sat recently in Adelaide. Now, that statement - I will describe it by language as strong as" is permitted in this chamber - is absolutely contrary to fact, and the honorable senator knows it. </para>

                            <para>- The Conference sat to discuss future action, and I have already pointed out that the Labour party here has advocated these referenda questions for years, so what is the use of honorable senators making statements of that sort to get them ' into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard?</inline> Afterwards probably they will quote them, and say, "We said this in the Senate," or "in the House of Representatives, and it was never contradicted." . So far as the reference to the Adelaide Conference is concerned, and to a certain gentleman in Melbourne, I say the statement is absolutely contrary to fact. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that is so. My whole point in referring to the Conference is that I want to contradict absolutely the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that the Conference had any influence over this Parliament in regard to these matters, so that when he or any other members of his party take the platform they will not be in a position to say that their statements were not contradicted. The honorable senator is doing his best to carry out a well-known Latin proverb that has been used by his party for so long. </para>

                            <para>- That is a statement that might come very well from a Liberal Union platform. It is easy for honorable senators to sit on these benches and hurl interjections of that kind across the chamber, but it is difficult to prove them. They know better than to attempt that, because they realize it would be impossible. Members of the Adelaide Conference were as free to discuss these questions as anything else. The only persons who have any right to dictate to or have any control over members of this party are the general body of the electors of the State that sends us here. We have no right, nor have we any intention, to deny the right of the electors to control, their representatives in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I had thought that the debate would end earlier, and intended to make my remarks very brief, but the longer the debate goes on, and the more speakers we have, the greater seems to be the duty that falls upon those who follow. I shall not go again over the ground covered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who referred to the political impropriety of dealing with this matter at the present juncture. I indorse what he said on that subject, and leave it at that. But I do not care that these Bills should pass through Parliament and go to the electors without some analysis of their provisions, however brief, to indicate the reasons why I think they should not be submitted to . the people to vote "Yes" or "No" upon. </para>

                            <para>- - At any time. I believe, as I have said here, and in my own and other States, both on the platform and through the press, that the Constitution needs amendment, but the  procedure  we are following to effect necessary amendments of the Constitution is not the best. So far from being the best, it is even undesirable. I wish to deal with these amendments to-night as free as possible from anything that may savour of party spirit. I have upon the parer a motion the discussion upon which I may not anticipate. One of the worst ways to approach the important task of amending the provisions of the Constitution is the one now being adopted. I say that apart altogether from the question of what party is in power. It is not very long since the people had submitted to them practically these proposals, but these are not actually what were submitted to the people two years ago. </para>

I am not asking him to stay here. The amendment we 'were asked to consider, in 1913 was not this amendment. We were asked then to amend the Constitution by striking out the words " with other countries and among the States," and insert " but not including trade and commerce upon  railways the property of a State except so far as it is trade and commerce with other countries or among the States." We were asked in 1913 to strike out certain words and insert others cutting down the power. We are asked now to strike out certain words and leave the words " trade and commerce " standing. In the interval between 1913 and 1915 circumstances have evidently arisen which have warranted in the minds of those responsible for drafting the amendment a further alteration of their then proposal. Had we carried that amendment in 1913, we should presumably be now asked again to amend the Constitution by striking out the limitation on our powers with respect to trade and commerce carried on the railways. </para>

                    <para>Take now the monopoly amendment. When we were asked in 1913 to amend the Constitution by giving this Parliament the power to nationalize certain monopolies, we made provision enabling Parliament to declare - as a monopoly, and as a consequence of that declaration to nationalize it - any concern engaged in the industry or business of "producing, manufacturing, or supplying any specified service." I pointed out in Tasmania that the people were being urged to insert that amendment in the Constitution on the ground that in exercise of that power Parliament would be able to nationalize an industry, like the sugar industry, whereas Parliament would not have that power. I said the sugar industry was not an industry engaged in " producing, manufacturing, or supplying any specified service." It was engaged in the producing, manufacturing, or supplying of goods, but not of services. Services were what gas companies, railway companies, .electric lighting companies, transport and traffic companies, and corporations provided us with. I pointed out that the proposed power of nationalization would not cover a monopoly concerned with the manufacture, production, or sale of goods. </para>

                            <para>- What is the meaning of "service"? We speak of <inline font-style="italic">s&gt;</inline> tramway service, a steam-ship service, a lighting service, a water service, or a gas service. I was particularly pressed with, regard to this view by some of my hearers at a place called Bothwell, and I elaborated it. The matter was referred to in the papers, and made the subject of an article. The nationalization of monopolies proposal now put forward is the same, except that the words " supplying any specified goods, or supplying any specified services" appear. </para>

Substantially these amendments were submitted to the people for the first "time in 1911. I opposed them then from the platform in Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I can, and there are other honorable senators who perhaps can suggest something better. That is why I think the procedure that  is  being followed in this all-important matter is wrong. No matter what  Government  may be in power, who prepares any proposed constitutional amendments ? Nominally, the Attorney- General,  but as  a matter of practice they are prepared  by  an officer of his Department. Then they are submitted to the Cabinet, which naturally and properly leans very much on the recommendation of  its  chief legal adviser. The amendments thus become the amendments of  the  Cabinet, and pass into the House of Representatives, where they become  the  amendments of the Labour party,  or of  the Liberal party, as the case may  be.  There is no round-table discussion  of  them, as there would be  if  a convention were held for the purpose of framing them. What I have suggested in  that  connexion is that the functions of  my  proposed convention should be limited  to  a consideration of the provisions of section 51 of our Constitution. In relation to these particular amendments, I  took  my own platform- </para>

                            <para>- I think not. If we exceed our jurisdiction, and the High Court points out that we have done so, it is merely fulfilling its duty. If these amendments be ratified by the people, I believe that, great as has 'been the volume of business occupying the attention of the High Court in connexion with Commonwealth legislation, it will be but as a drop in the bucket compared with the volume which will occupy its attention in the future. </para>

                            <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council has invited me to argue on the assumption that the proposed trade and commerce amendment will not confer an exclusive but a concurrent power upon this Parliament - that is to say, if the people ratify the Bill, this Parliament will have power to make laws in respect of trade and commerce - Inter-State, foreign, and Intrastate. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In that case the State Parliaments will also have the power to make laws in regard to trade and commerce within their own borders. The result will be that as Australia grows in wealth and population its transactions will necessarily be much more numerous, much more complex, and much more varied in character, and it will then be the duty of persons carrying on trade and commerce in any city, or between two parts of any State, to always guard against the possibility of there being two law3 governing their transactions - the law of the State and the law of the Commonwealth. They will have to ascertain what law, if any, applies to their transactions. </para>

                            <para>- Then why does the honorable senator seek to bring it into every trade and commerce transaction throughout the  Commonwealth? Is it not bad enough to have the trouble confined to the patents law and other particular instances? Do honorable senators reflect upon the meaning of trade and commerce? It is anything in the nature of buying, selling, bargaining, engaging to buy, contracting, or anything of the kind. Things we do half-a-dozen, twenty, thirty, or forty times a day, come under trade and commerce. At present the Commonwealth can deal with trade and commerce so long as it partakes of an Inter-State or external or foreign character, while each STate has full power over every transaction in relation to trade and commerce within its own borders. </para>

When in Sydney recently, I noticed an advertisement to this effect : ' ' We issue green coupons; we advise our customers to obtain them because we believe in giving them rather than in spending money on advertising " ; and it recalled to my mind a procedure followed by a number of traders some years ago, known as the issue of trading stamps. The issue of trading stamps was suppressed by law in </para>

                    <para class="block">Tasmania, and I believe in certain other States, but it was a new form of trading that had cropped up in recent years. If something similar were to occur in future, and be so prevalent, say, in Queensland, as to become objectionable, what would be the position ? The State Parliament could legislate it out of existence, as was done with regard to trading stamps in several of the States, but responsible members of the State Parliament might very well turn to those who would urge that course, and say, " The fact of the matter is that the Federal Parliament has jurisdiction in this matter; why do you not get it to interfere?" But on approaching the Federal Parliament, those anxious to have this form of trading legislated upon might be informed, " So far as we know, this evil is not extended beyond Queensland. You had better go back to your own Parliament, and ask it to deal with the matter." Thus those who would be anxious to get legislation on the subject would find themselves, like Mahomet's coffin, suspended between Heaven and earth, and would be able to get nothing from either legislative body. </para>

I have given an instance of the exercise of concurrent powers. The' presence of these concurrent powers on this important matter in our Constitution will lead to uncertainty, confusion, and litigation. We have to remember that the powers set out in section 51 were defined with the- idea of giving to a Federal, rather than a unified, Parliament powers which it should exercise for the common good) of all' the component parts of the Federation; but many of us are apt to regard Federalism as something in the nature of complete union, or Unification. More than once in the course of this debate, honorable senators have referred to the people as if the people of Australia were the sole determining authority in regard to the matters to which honorable senators were at the time referring.  The  people, as  a  people, are not, in a Federal system of government, the sole determining authority. The people and the States are. The Federal principle of union  is  totally different from that of an ordinary Unification. </para>

                            <para>- That was the Bills of Exchange Bill; that was not  an  instance of concurrent power. Our Constitution provides for the Commonwealth passing a Bills of Exchange Act, and consequently, we made the bills of exchange law uniform for the Commonwealth; but so far as the revenue which the States had been deriving from bills of exchange issued within their borders was concerned, we did not seek to deprive them of it. The Bill was not introduced for the purpose of getting for the Commonwealth the comparatively little revenue which the States had been collecting. We did not seek to deprive them of that, but we sought to get uniformity  in  regard to the law dealing with bills of exchange. </para>

                    <para>To revert to what I was saying, we should always remember that, so far as our Federation is concerned, the. union is a union of political partnership, a union of six partners. If six persons go into partnership they become, for all the purposes of the partnership, one; but for ad other purposes than those of the partnership they still remain six. In business they are regarded by outsiders, and they regard themselves, as one, and, in the same way, the six peoples of the States of the Commonwealth, on all the matters contained in the Constitution, are one; but for all their domestic matters each State is, like each individual in the trading partnership, single and completely master of itself. Our' Federal union is not  a  complete union; it is a political partnership. No individual partner would allow  the whole or any of the others in the partnership to enter into, or deal with what might be called his own domestic or private affairs. When the six States decided to federate by the votes of their electors, they decided to become one for all the matters laid down in the Commonwealth Constitution, the deed of political partnership; but for all other matters they were to preserve to the full the powers they had always previously enjoyed under their respective Constitutions. Section 51 of our Constitution is most important, because it gives the powers to this Parliament. It is the section which distributes the powers of legislation as between the partnership, otherwise the Commonwealth, and the individual members of the partnership, otherwise the States. We have to remember that in bringing this about we had a Parliament as the legislative authority of this Federal union. And though the House of Representatives represents the people ' of the six States taken as one people, in this far that it is proportioned to the number of people in each State - so we find that New South Wales, with its twenty-seven representatives or more, Tasmania and Western Australia with a minimum of five representatives each, Victoria with its twenty-two representatives, and so on - the Senate represents the other feature of that partnership, not a union of the people, but a union of the several States. The population of Tasmania, though it be only 200,000, is equally represented here with the population of New South Wales, which is about eight times that number. Before we entered into the political partnership, each of the States in every Convention or Conference which was called for the purpose of discussing the terms of Federal union had been equally represented, whether it was in the Conference of 1890, when they were each represented by seven, or whether it was in the Convention of 1891, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, when they were each again equally represented, or whether it was in the Convention that framed the Constitution under which we have been legislating, when they were each represented by ten elected representatives. Each of the States, before the Union, was regarded as a sovereign political entity; each was regarded as equal, irrespective of its territory or its population, and each negotiated with the others towards Federal union as an equal, and so we had equality. When we decided on a Federal form of union, rather than a complete union, we decided that, for the purposes set out in the Constitution, we should be one; but that for all other purposes we should remain as before - six States, separate, sovereign, and equal. Hence equality of representation in the Senate - just as there was before Federation equality of representation in every Conference or Convention. It is by reason of the fact that we have centralized, or become one, on only the definite matters in the Constitution, assigned to the Federal Parliament, and by reason of the consequent fact that, as regards all other matters, we are still six separate, sovereign, equal States, that we have equality of representation here. This equality of representation has been challenged. It has been attacked by certain individuals at different times, in the name of what ? In the name of the people - in the name of Democracy, because it is said that the Senate does not properly represent the voice of the people,, but the voices of the six unequally populous States. I venture to say that, if we extend the powers of this Parliament in the direction indicated by the proposed amendments; if it is given the power to deal with matters which can be and have been dealt with by the State Parliaments, we shall he giving added force and strength to those arguments which' have been used, and arc still being used, against equality of representation of each of the States in this branch of the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the proposed extension of the powers of the Federal Parliament will recoil on us as a boomerang. I do not, for one moment, suggest that there is now any sustainable ground for disturbing the principle of equality of representation. Briefly, tonight I have sketched the history and the necessity of it. In connexion with all pre-Federation Conferences, each State was regarded as equal and sovereign, irrespective of its size or population, and that principle of equality of representation in this Chamber was carried into the Constitution largely, I might say solely, because of the limited powers of this Parliament in comparison with the unlimited powers of the States. It was not carried unanimously. It was not carried without considerable difficulty, and though it was carried, we know that there have been, arc, and will continue to be, attempts to assail that principle; and whatever force there may have been in the arguments of those who have assailed and are assailing it, that force will be strengthened by the course we are invited to take to-day. I ask leave, sir, to resume my remarks at another sitting. </para>
