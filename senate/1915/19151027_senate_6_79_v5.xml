                        <para>- On this question, I should like to say that our channel of communication for information is, of course, the High Commissioner's office. The reports we have received through that channel are from the officers deputed by the High Commissioner to visit the various hospitals. In all these reports it is certainly claimed that every attention has been given to Australian wounded soldiers. The chief cause of complaint amongst them at first was that, being under British Army regulations, no money was payable to them whilst they were in hospital. There is a reason for that. The High Commissioner, however, inaugurated a system of chits, by which men were able to get whatever comforts they desired without actually obtaining money, the goods being purchased and debited to them. . The reason for refusing to allow them to draw money whilst they are in hospital is that it is feared that men who are invalids might purchase something which would be injurious. This particular complaint is overcome by the inauguration of the system of chits, by which the men can obtain what they require if the medical officer in charge sees no objection to them doing so. We are informed that, since this system was inaugurated, the complaints have practically died away. I may add that information received from other sources, that of visitors to hospitals in England, who have thought it well to correspond with the Department, indicates that the conditions were very favorable. We have not lately seen any complaints from wounded soldiers. The only recent complaint made was that by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise, the Agent-General for New South Wales, and' inquiries are now being made as to the justification for the statements made by him. </para>
