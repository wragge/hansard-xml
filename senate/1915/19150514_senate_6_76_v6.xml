                        <para>. - When I moved the adjournment of this debate on Friday last I recognised that the measure had only just previously come into the Senate from another place. I knew that it had occupied the attention of that. House for a considerable time, and, though I am not thoroughly familiar with, I had some idea of the nature of, the discussion which had taken place  there in regard to certain &#39; of its provisions. I had nob at the time it was circulated here in its present form an opportunity of comparing its provisions with those contained in the original Bill as introduced to Parliament, and a copy of which the members of both Houses had received with their papers some time previously. Since the adjournment of the debate I have had that opportunity, and noticed that the Bill now contains provisions which it did not have when it was originally launched in Parliament. The mere presence of those provisions renders it unnecessary for me to subject the Bill to anything like the criticism I had intended had it come here in its original form. The additional provisions are contained in sub-clauses 2 and 3 of clause 4. It will be recollected that early this session we passed an amending Bill on patents, designs, and trade marks; in fact, we passed two. This is the third of such amending Bills, and I would not be in the least surprised if before the session closes, or, at any rate, in the near future, we have to pass another or further amending measures. When I say that, I do not intend to cast any reflection on the Government. We are dealing with a very delicate and technical subject, and whatever legislation we pass must be motived by considerations arising not merely from our foresight, but largely out of our experience. A patent is a monopoly - a monopoly granted by the Crown, but granted for a term only, and on certain conditions. At one time in English history it was competent for the Crown to grant monopolies without any restriction. Great abuses arose and, as a consequence of that, patent legislation came into force, and the granting of monopolies has since been regulated by what is known as the patents law. One of the conditions of obtaining a patent is that it shall be for something which is new and useful. When I say &#34;new,&#34; I mean that it must be something which previously was not known to or used by the public. The person who secured a patent right secured it in consideration of what he gave to the public. If the public already knew or used that particular invention there was no consideration, and his patent was <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> good. Now, as a matter of fact, when a patent right is secured under our legislation or under the legislation of any other portion of the British </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Empire, it does not confer on the patentee an indefeasible right, even for the period of fourteen years for which the patent is granted. I mean by that that if anybody else apparently infringes his patent, apparently uses an invention to which he alone is entitled, that person may be proceeded against by the patentee for damages, and the patentee may also apply to the Court for an injunction to restrain that person from further infringing his patent. But if the person so proceeded against civilly can establish that the invention is not novel at all, that it lacks one of the essentials on which a patent is granted, the patent may be declared void. There is in existence in every country a number of what I may call voidable patents. They are in force, but if an individual has the hardihood to use a particular invention, believing that it is not the subject of a proper patent, although it is the subject of a recorded patent, that no patent should ever have been granted in fact, he may use it, but he does so, of course, at his own risk. If he is proceeded against civilly for damages or an application is made for an injunction against him it is competent for him to take up in the Court an attitude which will cause the patent to be voided. That was the position of the law. What we did by our amending legislation earlier in the session was to grant a power to the Minister, that is to the Attorney-General, to suspend in whole or in part or nullify or void totally any patent. The object of the legislation was that Australia should not be deprived of the benefit and advantage of certain requirements which at the present time German patentees have the sole right to produce in Australia. It was a very good object. We aimed at providing that the public of Australia should not be penalized by reason of the fact that Germans held patents in respect to requirements of the public. We did then, as I think, very clearly provide that the Minister might avoid or suspend in whole or in part a patent. We did that in the interests of the community. We made provision also that tiler Attorney-General might grant a licence or licences to persons in Australia to manufacture or produce and vend those articles which otherwise in peace times would be the subjects of these patents. We provided, too, that as1 a condition certain payments might be attached to such a licence. </para>

I do not think there have been many successful applications. &#34;We made a singular omission in our legislation at that time. While the Minister might suspend or avoid a patent and grant a licence to another person to manufacture and vend the article, the licensee was in no way protected from outside competition. Consequently, if the Minister avoided any particular patent wholly, it was open to any member of the public to disregard the patent and manufacture and vend the article. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in a position to say what the consequences were. We also gave the Minister power to suspend a patent in whole or in part, and grant a licence to some person to manufacture and vend the article. We did not protect the licensee from competition, and that omission this Bill is intended to rectify. Clause 4 provides that any person other than the licensee who uses, exercises, or vends the invention shall be guilty of an offence, and liable to a penalty not exceeding &#163;500. Here the position of the licensee is different from that of the original patentee, because if an unauthorized person infringes an ordinary patent, not avoided or suspended, and not belonging to an enemy subject, he cannot be prosecuted. All the patentee can do is to bring against him a civil action for damages, and apply for aninjunction. </para>

                            <para>- The Act we passed last year provides a general power to avoid or suspend, the understanding being that it was to be exercised only in regard to enemy-owned patents. By this legislation as originally introduced, it was proposed to protect a licensee more strongly than an original patentee was protected, and more strongly than an Australian, neutral, or British patentee would be protected in the future. Yielding to criticism on the point, the Government have now introduced sub-clauses 2 and 3 of clause 4, of which sub-clause 3 provides that no prosecution shall be taken under the section except by the Attorney-General or person authorized by him in that behalf. That to some extent meets the criticism levelled at the measure, but another anomaly has been rectified. Under the normal law of patents a person charged with infringing an ordinary patent right could, when proceeded against, attack the validity of the patent, but the person proceeded against under this legislation for infringing the right of a licensee could not do so. That defence, if successfully set up, could cause the patent to be declared void by the Court. As this Bill stood originally, any person prosecuted at the instance of a licensee for alleged infringement could not attack the validity of the patent, so that he was in a worse position than if he had infringed the rights of the original patentee. The Government, however, provide by sub-clause 2 of clause 4, that it shall be a defence to a prosecution under this section if the defendant satisfies the Court that a petition for the revocation of the patent, or for the removal of the trade mark or design from the register, would be successful. That is a right provision, because we should not put our own Australian patentees in. a worse position than a person who received a licence in respect of a German patent. </para>

                            <para>- It is a good provision for the public, and puts the licensee in no better or worse position than the original patentee. If there is in the community a man plucky enough to make or vend the article, and establish that the German had no right to the patent originally, why should he not be able in a similar way to show that the licensee in his turn has no right to a monopoly? The inclusion of these two provisions has remedied defects which occasioned a. great deal of criticism of the Bill as originally introduced. I understand that the Attorney-General announced that further amendments suggested would be considered either before the Bill reached the Senate or before it is finally dealt with here. One very important matter requiring consideration is as to whether the only remedy for infringement of the terms of his licence which the licensee of a patent is to have is that provided in clause 4 upon procedure for an offence, or whether he should also be given a remedy in the form of a suit for damages in a civil Court. As I have already said, I should not be surprised if we found it necessary to still further add to our patents legislation, and it might be found necessary to make the provision to which I have just referred. I quite realize that this apparent tinkering with our patents legislation is due to the novel circumstances in which we find ourselves, and to the fact that we are dealing with a very difficult technical and delicate matter. The Bill, as we have it, is very much more satisfactory than as it was when originally circulated, and it was only because of the apparent defects in the Bill as originally circulated, and because I was not aware of the changes made in it during its passage through another place, that I asked for the adjournment of the debate upon the second reading. Had I at the time been aware of the amendments upon the original measure made in another place I should have been prepared a week ago to have continued the discussion upon the second reading of the measure. I intend to support the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - Those of us who have been with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> members of the Senate for some years are aware that he has made a special study of patents legislation, and from time to time has dealt with the question of patents in a very able manner. &#34;With his legal knowledge of the subject the honorable senator can more easily discuss it than a lay member of the Senate could expect to do. Still, I feel that many of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> remarks this morning, while doubtless quite appropriate to the consideration of a Patents Bill introduced in ordinary circumstances, are not as appropriate in the discussion of the Bill now before us. There are international rights and observances in connexion with patents that are not recognised with respect to Tariff, commercial, or other industrial legislation. In dealing with a measure of this kind we have first of all to recognise that we are at war with a country whose patents have played a most important part in its progress and prosperity. <inline font-style="italic">Not</inline> only have the patent laws helped to foster the prosperity of Germany, but probably no other legislation has contributed so largely to German advancement. In the circumstances, it is a great mistake to consider a measure of this kind as though we were not at war, and as if the commerce of the various nations were going on in the usual even way. We have to consider the war conditions under which we are living, and which have urged us to bring forward emergency legislation of this kind. I need scarcely say that I am an enthusiastic supporter of this kind of legislation, but I consider that this Bill is far from perfect. When such legislation is introduced it should not be a mere pretence to do something which will end in our doing nothing. I feel compelled to say that the legislation we have passed in this connexion so far has been mere make-believe. I am sorry to have to criticise in this manner Bills which have been introduced by the Government I support, but the truth must be told. The fact that no use has been made of the legislation which we have already passed obliges me to say that if when it becomes law this measure is to be allowed to remain inoperative in the same way, it will not be worth the paper it is printed on. Certain outrages have been committed by Germans, and we are anxious to get level with them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the honorable senator could possibly come down to their level, and I did not suggest anything of the kind. We are all anxious to hit back when we have been attacked, without proving ourselves to be as degenerate as the Germans. I hope that we shall be able to do something of that kind under legislation of this sort. We have already given the Government power to take action in regard to enemy patents, and so far nothing has been done. Unless they make up their minds to be a little more in earnest in future than they have shown themselves to be in the past, they might as well shut up shop and pass no more of this emergency legislation. Apart from this view of the matter, we are all anxious to have as much work done in this country as possible. We know that the Free Traders have sunk their principles and hauled down their flag, until to-day it can &#39;be said that throughout Australia Ave are all Protectionists. </para>

                                is so ardent a land taxer, and is so ready on all occasions to bring forward his favorite topic, that perhaps we should deal delicately with him. If we are to do nothing to interfere with patents belonging to the subjects of the countries with which we are at war, our industries will be placed at a very great disadvantage. If there is one patent which more than another has come under consideration during the discussion of this measure, it is that for what is known as the thermit welding process - a process for the welding of steel and iron, which is used to a very great extent in the construction of tramways. We have had, and have at the present time, a considerable amount of tramway construction going on in Australia. The patent to which I refer is the only effective patent in existence, although it represents by no means the only invention connected with the business, and if the thermit welding process is not used, the effect must be to put a stop to a very great deal of work which was going on before the war started. If we concentrate our attention upon this matter we shall better understand the real reason for the introduction of this Bill. We are all anxious to see use made of every German patent in Australia, for the benefit of our own industries. But I am sorry to say that the right to use this thermit welding patent has been safeguarded by the Government in a manner that is scarcely credible. Up to the present time all the protection which the Commonwealth can give to it has been given to it.

                            <para>- He has made no use of it, and yet applications for a licence by private persons who desired to make use of it have been refused. That is my charge against the Government;  and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council can answer it, I shall he very pleased. If no more use is to be made of this patent by the Government than has already been made of it, the war will have concluded before it can be utilized to our advantage. Time is a very essential factor in this question, because as soon as the war terminates, this legislation will cease, and the patentees will then be able to take action in our civil Courts. The moment peace is proclaimed this measure will become so much waste paper. Before going further, I would like to direct attention to an amendment which has been made in the Bill in the other Chamber. The effect of the adoption of that amendment will be to prolong the delay of which I am complaining. To my mind, it is a very foolish amendment, inasmuch as it will permit of the continuance of that sort of litigation which is now occupying the attention of a civil Court in Adelaide, where the action of a German in trading with the enemy has been challenged. Whilst such legislation may prove profitable to the lawyers, the litigation it provokes is certainly not edifying to the country. I hold that if, under sub-clause 2 of clause 4 of this Bill, the holder of any patent is. empowered to go into Court and defend his patent right, there will be no end to litigation. The result of such legislation may be delay, until it is impossible to take action owing to the termination of the war. <inline font-style="italic">If</inline> the object of this legislation is defeated, it will be due to the amendment to which I have directed attention more than to anything else. I trust that the Government will see their way to restore the Bill to its original form. I am afraid that the Attorney-General exhibited too much readiness to listen to the critics of the measure in another place, instead of boldly standing by its provisions. Regarding the thermit welding process of which I have spoken, I question if the Government had authority to do what they have done. Under the Act which we passed last session, any person was empowered to apply for the suspension of an enemy patent. At least two gentlemen who are well known in the Commonwealth made application for the suspension of the patent relating to the thermit welding process. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HenryChinn,</inline> both of whom are interested in tramway construction. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> has been working on an invention of his own, with  a  similar object in view, for quite a considerable time, but, because of some lack of originality, he failed to obtain  a  patent for it. The raw material for his invention is produced in Australia; whereas the raw material for the thermit welding process has to be imported from Germany. A German named Goldschmidt is the principal in the Thermit Limited, Sydney, and another German is the manager. As a matter of fact, nine-tenths of the shares in the company are held by Germans. Strange to say, this patent has been dealt with in Australia in rather a peculiar way. Probably it is within the recollection of honorable senators that when certain charges were made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> in another place, it was alleged, amongst other things, that he had infringed a particular patent. The patent in question was the German thermit welding process patent. When those charges were investigated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges, who was appointed a Royal Commission for the purpose by the then Fisher Government, it was found that there was no substance in this particular allegation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges reported that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was quite justified in his action, having done nothing which he was not entitled to do under the law. It will be seen, therefore, that this thermit welding process has something of a history. After the Act of last year was passed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> applied for  a  voidance of the thermit welding process patent. That patent was suspended ;but, instead of the applicants being granted  a  licence to use it, a licence was issued to a person who was not an applicant at all - I refer to the Engineer-in-Chief of the Commonwealth railways. Had the Governmentintended to make use of that licence for the public benefit, there might have been some justification for their action in straining the law, as they undoubtedly did. </para>

                            <para>- I know that. The same consideration should have been shown to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> as to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonks,</inline> who was successful in his application for another patent. I know that at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> applied for the avoidance of the thermit-welding patent they both had works on hand in connexion with which this patent could have been used. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had a tramway contract running from Malvern down through Glenhuntly past my door, and consequently he could have used the German patent there, but a licence was refused. I know, also, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had several contracts waiting, and it was most unsatisfactory that his application should have been refused. Altogether, he has been harshly dealt with by the Government, for he was thrown out of employment on the transcontinental railway and has had no means of obtaining employment since then. The fact that he was refused a licence for this thermit-welding process does not redound to the credit of the Government or of the Attorney-General, and, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonks</inline> was given a licence for a German patent, I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was refused. </para>

Whatever be determined as to the distribution of royalties collected under the amending Act of 1914, the patentee whose patent has been suspended or avoided is placed by this Bill in a better position to recover after the war whatever he may be entitled to. </para>
                    <para class="block">This statement shows, then, that by this Bill we are actually placing patentees in a better position than they were in before the war. For instance, if any honorable senator applied for and got a licence to use the thermit process, according to the Attorney-General the German company would at the close of the war have a legitimate ground for action for infringement of the patent, and would be in a better position under this Bill than it would have been formerly. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I want to see a law passed so that persons may use those patents for the benefit of the country without any risk to themselves. Referring again to the applications by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to suspend the thermit patent, I might remind the Senate that, after the first or second day of the hearing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith withdrew, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> went on. He fought the case at considerable expense to himself, and, in the end, he was refused the licence. My information concerning this thermit-welding process has been obtained from the best authority,  and I am interested to know what the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is in charge of this Bill, will have to say in answer to my statements. Notwithstanding his successful action against the German patent, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> obtainednot the slightest benefit, because he was refused the licence. </para>

                        <para>. - I thank honorable senators for their criticism of the Bill. The chief point of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Heating&#39;s</inline> criticism was whether it will be wise to allow the Bill to go through with a provision for penalties to be obtained by only the Attorney-General. I do not know whether I am not in agreement with him; but, as he hinted, with a great knowledge of measures of this character, further legislation may be needed. If the Government find that such legislation is necessary, that almost apparent defect may be remedied. </para>

                            <para>- It is always easy to make a suggestion of that kind, and there is always a very drastic method of doing anything. This is urgent legislation which is required for war time only, and, in the anxiety to do extreme things in the time of war, it is not wise, I think, to bring down a comprehensive measure dealing with many personal interests. The course we have taken is, perhaps, better than the more free-and-easy method of settling the matter at once by a consolidating measure. I think that in the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> there is also an indication of the feeling of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. </para>

                            <para>- In connexion with hurried legislation of this kind, if one could foresee the difficulties which the experience of a few months&#39; practical working may discover, we might resort to that method ; but even with comprehensive legislation such as suggested by the honorable senator, the experience of perhaps a week might discover a defect, even in a direction to which much thought had been given. However, I think, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> that a penalty of &#163;500 for the infringement of a patent, to be obtained by the Government through the Courts, is perhaps unjust to the licensee, who maybe expending large sums of money in producing an article, and would have his business considerably interfered with. That aspect of the matter will receive attention. At present I am bent upon getting this Bill through. It is necessary for me to refer to some statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. He commenced his speech by assuring us that he was friendly towards the measure. I feel rather pleased that there are not many more friends like the honorable senator here. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator made the sweeping statement that the Bill we passed some months ago was so much waste paper, and that nothing had been done under its provisions. I interjected, perhaps somewhat rudely, that the statement was not correct, because much&#39; has been done under that legislation. I will come right to the very patent to which the honorable senator referred, and that is the patent for the thermit welding process. The Government have suspended that patent, and taken it out of the hands of the Germans. When the honorable senator reads his proofs he will see that his earlier statement would lead the Senate and people outside who read his speech to believe that the Government were really conserving the interests of the Germans interested in the patent. But that is not the case. </para>

Experience in connexion with our legislation taught us - although we did not intend it - that when patents were voided and licences were given to persons to take them up, any person not licensed could set to work in competition with those who were licensed. Therefore, we introduced this Bill, which makes it an offence for any one else to interfere with the use of a licensed patent. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill only needs to be read by any person to see the justice of its provisions. We discovered, as I said, a defect in the first measure, and that is that, after voiding a patent, any person except the original patentee could use it. We remedy that defect by providing that the Attorney-General may take action, and imposing a penalty of &#163;500 upon any person infringing a patent or the rights of a licensee. In regard to the patent for the thermit welding process, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said that the Government had done nothing. If he considers that the annulment&#39; of the rights of the German patentee is nothing, he is entitled to his views. If he says that the vesting of that patent in an officer of the Commonwealth is .nothing, he will find it difficult to get others to believe him. Now, what was the position of the Government in regard to this case? I am sorry that the honorable senator introduced the personal element into the discussion. </para>

It is generally used by the State Governments in welding rails for the tramways. Would it have been a wise act for the Commonwealth Government, altogether apart from whether it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> to hand over to a private person a monopoly, the chief users of which are the public of this country ? </para>

                            <para>- The Government of New South Wales are largely using this process in the welding of rails. So far as I know, the chief users of the patent will be the State Governments in Australia. That, I hold, is one of the patents for which a monopoly should not have been given to any private person. I can quite understand the eagerness of a private person to get a patent for the process. I can quite understand that a private person imagines that he is suffering a great injustice when he does not get a patent for it. But 1 ask honorable senators to give their attention to that aspect of the question, because we are charged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie with having done nothing under the recent legislation. What we did in this particular case was, instead of handing over the patent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> to maintain it for the Commonwealth of Australia, and not for a German patentee, and the Commonwealth is permitting the use of the patent. The licensee is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> the Engineer-in - Chief for Railways. The licence was not given to him personally, but as an officer of the Commonwealth. </para>

If the expenditure of a large sum is required for the erection of a plant to work any particular process, the Government will issue a licence which will carry the user over a period considerably beyond the duration of the war. </para>

                            <para>- I have shown clearly, I think, that in this particular case we have not only not done nothing, but done something very considerable in. the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. We prevented a private person from getting a monopoly of a process which is chiefly used for, and directly paid for by, the State Governments. Other patents have been dealt with, but I do not propose to read out a list of them. There was, for intance, the patent granted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonks</inline> to manufacture glass pavements, if I may use that term, for lighting basements. </para>

                            <para>- All these matters were fully investigated. The capacity of an individual to conduct the business and give a fair service to the community was very closely inquired into by a Board. Let me now get to the question of lysol, in further answer to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that nothing has been done. Lysol is one of those chemical preparations which are used in almost every household in the Commonwealth. Four persons have been licensed to manufacture the article. The licences were granted after a public investigation. It was unnecessary to give one person a monopoly. It was necessary to let persons manufacturing the article know that if they incurred an expenditure in the erection of plant, they would be safeguarded to some extent. </para>

                            <para>- I thought I dealt sufficiently with that question. I admire the honorable senator&#39;s pertinacity, but wish he would exercise it in a better cause. The royalty in the case of lysol is such sum as the Minister from time to time fixes, but not exceeding 10 per cent. on the cost of the article. The chief intention of the measure is to enable the Government to protect the people to whom they issue licences, by preventing outside persons competing with them. </para>

Not only have we not safeguarded and protected the German patentee of Che particular article in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is chiefly interested, but we have already avoided his patent, the use of it is at the disposal of the people, and the profits accruing from it are going into the coffers of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie seems to have an impression that in all our war legislation we should aim at getting even with the Germans. We have adopted a more far-reaching and effective method by sending our men to meet the Germans on the field of battle, where we shall eventually win out. Some people would like to stick pins into all the Germans they see. That would give them pleasure and the Germans pain, but it would not add to the reputation of the British people or bring us a day nearer ultimate victory. We have introduced this legislation because it is the most effective and straightforward way of dealing with enemy subjects, who by the laws of nations are not permitted to trade in this country <inline font-style="italic">during</inline> the time of war. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is not in his ordinary frame of mind which enables him to take reasonable views. He appears to have allowed the thermit patent to overshadow everything else, and, perhaps, because the patent did not go in the direction that he wanted it to go, he is inclined to find fault generally. I hope the Senate will recognise that we have used the powers conferred on us a little more than six months ago to conserve the rights of the people, and I trust it will agree that we are not asking too much in seeking for power to further protect the persons to whom we issue licences. </para>

                    <para class="block">I submit this amendment for the purpose of safeguarding the rights of applicants for the suspension or avoidance of a patent. They have in the past been in a very difficult position. A person who desires to use any of the patents which are dealt with under this measure should be given every facility to approach the tribunal dealing with the matter as cheaply and as easily as possible. I am aware that the successful applicant for the suspension of the patent for the thermit welding process, to which so much reference has been made this morning, secured legal assistance and was at considerable trouble and expense in prosecuting his application, but after he was successful the licence to use the patent was given not to him, but to a third party, who had made no application for the suspension of the patent at all. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and, notwithstanding all that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said, I quite agree that the Government should keep the operation of this patent in their own hands, provided always that, having got it, they make use of it. According to the Act as it stands, only one party is entitled to a licence to operate any of these patents, and that person is the successful applicant for its suspension. As there was only one successful applicant for the suspension of the patent referred to, it was, in my opinion, an injustice to that applicant to refuse him the licence. Should my amendment be agreed to, if a similar case arose in the future, the person who went to the trouble and expense of successfully prosecuting an .application for the suspension of a patent might at least look forward to recovering the costs he had incurred. In the case which has been referred to, the patent was held by a wealthy German company, established and carrying on business in Australia under an English name - the Australian Thermit Welding Company Limited. The man who came forward to fight that company, and was successful in his application for the suspension of their patent, ought at least to be given the expenses he incurred in prosecuting his application. </para>

                            <para>. - I suppose that honorable senators, in introducing Bills, are responsible for the form in which they are introduced, but personally I have no objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment, since its object appears to be to confer more power on the Minister under this Bill and to make him absolute master of the situation. I am prepared to accept the amendment if the Committee force it upon the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says that this is a reasonable amendment, and there is always a certain amount of reasonableness about a hard case. It proposes to- give powers to the Minister which, in ordinary circumstances, Legislatures are not inclined to give to any Ministers. I take the moving of this amendment, especially coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, as a most friendly act. It goes to show that the honorable senator has absolute confidence in the present Government. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that this is an emergency measure. In another place, when a measure was submitted to deal with cases of the greatest emergency, considerable exception was taken to the powers proposed to be given not to a single Minister, but to the whole Government. It is a kind of embarrassment of riches to have powers thrust upon us in the way proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I shall, as Minister in charge of the Bill, call for a division on the amendment, should that be necessary, but personally I can take no strong exception to the proposal if a majority of honorable senators see their way to grant powers to the Minister under this Bill which are not usually granted without protest, and with which it may not be wise to intrust to a Minister. </para>

                        <para>- No one will deny that the Germans possess a very great deal of technical skill and scientific knowledge. Many prominent orientalists attribute eastern stagnation to the fact that never in the history of any oriental country has there been such a thing as a patents law. The possessors of inventive ability in such countries have been discouraged, because when a man invented anything it became at once the property of the public, and he derived no pecuniary advantage from his invention, unless it was one the secret of which might be held solely by himself. In revolutions and turmoils in those countries, whole families disappeared, and with them the secrets of many inventors. Modern civilization is particularly distinguished by the endeavour to preserve for an inventor the power to profit by his invention. This condition of things has been interfered with by the existence of the war. But the war as we are waging it is to maintain, and not to subvert, civilization, and we have to consider what will be the condition of things existing when the peace for which we all hope is declared. Some people are sanguine enough to believe that peace will be declared in two or three months&#39; time, and others, who are not quite so optimistic, believe that it will be declared in a year or two. We all hope that ultimately we shall enjoy a fairly permanent peace. There are British holders of patents which are no doubt suspended in Germany at the present time, but when peace is declared I think that all patentees will expect to be treated upon civilized lines, and to be re-established in possession of the rights enjoyed under their patents. </para>

                            <para>- I am one of those who believe that it is necessary for us to defeat our enemies in the present struggle by force of arms. It is repugnant to one&#39;s idea of justice to affirm, not only that an enemy patent may be voided on the application of one of our own people, but that damages may be awarded against the holder of that patent. This somewhat-to-be-deprecated policy will certainly cut both ways, for I assume that there are British holders of very lucrative patents in Germany, and if we attempt to put into force legislation of this character, the Germans will be sure to retaliate tenfold. </para>

                            <para>- The application of such a principle is repugnant to civilized thought. If that is the intention of the honorable senator&#39;s amendment, I am afraid that I cannot support it. If the Commonwealth is going to suspend an enemy patent, but is not going to issue a licence to a private individual to use it, obviously the Government intend to derive some pecuniary benefit from it. In that case, I am willing to empower the Minister to grant the successful applicant at least his expenses. We have no accurate knowledge of the important patents which are held in Germany by British subjects, and if we enact this sort of legislation, we may find some British inventor, who has sweated his brain for years in perfecting his invention, invoking curses upon our heads. </para>

                            <para>- The German Government is certainly very unscrupulous in the methods by which it wages war, and I believe that some of its financial dispositions have worked out greatly to the injury of British manufacturers. But when peace is restored, I have no doubt that patentees in that country will be reestablished in the position which they occupied prior to the outbreak of war. We must recollect that, as patentees, they have committed no crime, and it would be a retrograde step to penalize men who have been guilty of no offence, but who happen to be the possessors of processes which we believe should be utilized for the benefit of this country. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the honorable senator will not vote against the clause, because very big interests will be involved, and the Bill makes no provision for a licensee taking action on his own behalf. Consequently, it might pay a man to infringe the licensee&#39;s right, in which case a penalty of &#163;500, instead of being too large, would be too small. </para>

                    <para>The measure provides for the transfer to the Commonwealth of 18,000 acres of land, some privately owned, but the great bulk owned by the State of New South Wales. As honorable senators are aware, when the Federal Territory was transferred from New South Wales to the Commonwealth Government, full powers over all land were vested in the Commonwealth. It has been found advisable that the Federal Government should secure control over the land connecting the Federal Territory with the sea, and, therefore, it is proposed, under this Bill, to vest those powers in the National Government. The Naval College is on the property, and, of course, dockyards and other buildings required for Commonwealth purposes will be constructed in due course. This new territory will come under the provisions of the Commonwealth laws, such as the Commonwealth Arbitration Act and other measures. The Bill practically gives effect to an agreement on the part of New South Wales to transfer certain land to the Commonwealth, and embraces no more and no less than the act of surrendering 18,000 acres of land by New South Wales to the Commonwealth Government. The date upon which it will come into operation will be fixed by proclamation ; but as a similar Bill has passed the New South Wales Parliament it is reasonable to assume that it will come into operation at the earliest possible date after its passage through both Houses of the Federal Parliament. Under the Lands Acquisition Act there is provision to prevent private individuals from obtaining any advantage in the way of unearned increment, and that measure will operate with regard to the present Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - When speaking to a motion yesterday, I said I had good authority for saying that certain blocks of offices at the corner of Queen and Collins streets, Melbourne, were the property of a German company, and that the Kaiser had an interest in them. This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GeorgeFairbairn,</inline> a respected ex-member of the other House, waited on me, and assured me that there was no truth whatever in the report. He invited me to make inquiries, so that I could either substantiate the statement I had made, or explain that it was not correct. At <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn&#39;s</inline> request, I saw the manager of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, as this company has the largest interest in the chief block of offices at the corner of Queen and Collins streets. That gentleman told me that there was no truth in the report. He admitted that it had been commonly reported for a number of years that German money &#34;was in those buildings. He also said that while it was only a rumour they had nothing to contradict, and he was rather glad that a definite statement had been made which gave him the opportunity to deny it, because a statement of that kind might possibly injure an Australian company in so far that some of their tenants might feel inclined to vacate the premises if it were true. I have since received the following statement from the manager of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company: - </para>
