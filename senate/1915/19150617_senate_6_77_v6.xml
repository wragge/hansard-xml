                    <para>The daily ration of the troops of the Australian Imperial Force consists of: - <inline font-style="italic">li</inline> lbs. bread, <inline font-style="italic">H</inline> lbs, fresh meat, J oz. coffee, 1-32 oz. pepper, 8 oz. mixed  vegetables  or 2 oz. cheese, 1 lb. potatoes, 3 oz. sugar, <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> oz. salt, <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> ox. tea, <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> lb. Jam. </para>
                    <para>Its distribution into the three meals of breakfast,, dinner, and tea, depends largely on circumstances, viz., the nature of the training which the troops are undergoing at the time, which probably varies from day to day, and the individual tastes of the men themselves. In the initial stages of training, when soldiers arc being principally exercised at' drill, the meals can be arranged and distributed into three regular portions, the principal meal,  a  hot one, being usually partaken of  in  the middle of the day. When  engaged in  manoeuvres, field training or musketry, the principal meals would usually be breakfast, and a hot meal at tea-time, the midday ration being carried in the haversack </para>
                    <para>It would be almost impossible, mid certainly injudicious, to lay down hard and fast lines as to the distribution of the entire ration into three proportionate parts for breakfast, dinner and tea. Adequate provision is always mode for one hot meal, in addition to breakfast, whether it be cooked at mid-day or in the evening, but some men prefer to have the whole of the residue of their meat ration at breakfast, whilst others like to retain a portion for the tea time. The full ration is considered ample for the men's wants, and it lias been found best to allow sonic little latitude as to its apportionment. </para>
                    <para>The above-mentioned procedure would doubt- less obtain in the case of troops training in Western Australia. The Commandant of that district has been instructed by lettergram to furnish detailed information in this connexion,  with  a view to ascertaining whether any unusual departure from the recognised procedure in regard to the distribution of meals has obtained in his command. </para>

He lias nobody that he could detail to do this, nor, if lie had, could his services be spared in the present pressure. The same applies to the ammunition question, but, the parts being smaller, he could supply parts 18-pounder shell and cartridge case at various stages of manufacture, and samples, empty and filled (dummy), of the 80 fuse. These, with specifications and drawings, would doubtless be of assistance to one who had studied their manufacture; but previous study would certainly be essential. As regards foremen, he has not enough for his own services, .and could spare none to go to any colony at present.

On the 18th November, 1914, the assistant manager of the Small Arms Factory - who, I may say, has had previous experience in supervising the installation of a plant in America - was instructed to get out an estimate of what he considered it would cost to instal a plant in Australia for the manufacture of 18- pounder ammunition. On the 18th November he sent forward an estimate of £83,175 for the cost of machinery, and £15,000 for buildings- a total of £98,175. </para>

                    <para class="block">On 26th December a cable was received from the Secretary of State to say that facilities to visit Royal factories had been given to Coghill, but the Army Council wished to utilize the valuable services of Captain Watts until the end of the war. The High Commissioner was cabled on the 31st December to obtain quotes for the "manufacture of a complete plant for the manufacture of 18-pounder ammunition, 200 rounds daily, forging and finishing, fuse making, power plant not included. Payment made on turn out of first 100 rounds." A reply was received from the High Commissioner stating that the work was in hand. On the 10th April a cable was received from the High Commissioner that Prat and Whitney had submitted a brief outline and estimated cost, £51,000, f.o.b. New York, six months from date of order, the detailed proposition to be submitted by post. On 10 th May a letter was received from the High Commissioner attaching an offer from W. Todd, Ohio, for specifications of forging process and a blue print of same. On 29th May a cablegram was despatched to the High Commissioner, asking him to forward, as soon as possible, specification of steel manufacture, and drawing 18- pounder high explosive and shrapnel shell. Now I want to say that the statement has been made that, until the press agitation commenced in Australia - which was since the beginning of the present month - it had never dawned on me to take any action with regard to utilizing local engineering works for the manufacture of munitions; but I would point out that on the 22nd February, 1915, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> McKay, of McKay Brothers, had an interview with me, and told me that he thought they could manufacture shells in their works. I was pleased to hear that, and told him that we had been making certain inquiries. I asked him to see the Chief of Ordnance, who was dealing with this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> did see the Chief of Ordnance, and took away certain information. Later on he saw me and told me that, after investigating the information he had, he had come to the conclusion that it was a very stiff proposition, and that more information  would be required before he could definitely say that he could commence the manufacture of shells in Australia. He also told me that, going on the information that he then had, he was cabling to his London agents with the idea of seeing if additional plant could be obtained to carry out that work. From that time, not only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> but a number of other manufacturers, had inquired about this matter, before ever this press agitation had begun at all, and each of them was given the same facilities as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was given. Now the statement, was made that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was prepared to take a contract for 20,000 shells from the War Office. In fact, it was hinted, that he had already been given a contract, but I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> never at any time told me that he was in the position to make shells yet. He never at any time told me that he had a contract. He has told me that seeing that' the firm proposed to go into the matter, he had instructed their London agent to make inquiries in order that they might be able to say whether they would be in a position to make shells if the War Office gave them an order. It will be remembered that during the period over which these communications extended, not only was there no suggestion from Parliament, or from any member of it, that we should commence this work, but there was no suggestion that the Allies were short of munitions of war. That suggestion was of a very much more recent date than December of last year. It will be seen that, not only did I go into the matter thoroughly, but I dealt with it as an urgent matter. The cables I have read from the Army Council show that they practically told us that, owing to the pressure in Great Britain, they were unable to give us the assistance we require. From time to time we have received reports from Captain Coghill, . based upon information he had obtained from the Royal Gun Factory, and also from the catalogues  of various business firms. The position was that, up till the end of last year, I was pursuing my inquiries with a view to the establishment at the earliest possible moment of the manufacture of shells and guns in the Commonwealth. As soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> came to me to suggest that it might be possible for local firms to assist in this matter, I cordially met all his advances, and those of other firms, and gave them all the information I had to give them. Up to the present no firm in Australia has been in a position to say that they can, or will, make shells for us, or for the War Office. On the strength of the information we have received I have submitted to the Government a proposition, which is now under consideration, for commencing the manufacture of shells and guns in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No; it will be necessary to import the plant. I have submitted a proposal to the Government that we should get the necessary plant, erect the buildings, and commence ourselves the manufacture of shells and guns. This would be in consonance with the general policy of the present Government. But I want to say that if any firms in Australia are able to do this work, we intend in the present crisis to assist them to the utmost of the ability of the Defence Department, realizing as we do that, with their existing plants or with some modification of them, they would be able to turn out shells very much earlier than we could hope to do from the Government establishment I have suggested. In order that the information obtained from time to time might be thoroughly sifted, and might be made available not only to the Department, but to any private firm that wished to take up this matter, I some time ago instructed the Chief of Ordnance to get into touch with the officers of his own branch, with the managers of the Broken Hill Proprietary Steel Works, and with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who, as a local manufacturer, had taken a leading part in the inquiries, and at the earliest possible moment to submit reports as to what might be done in this regard.  Colonel Dangar,  the Chief of Ordnance, had a number of interviews with a representative of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and I believe that as a result of their being approached in the matter, they cabled to their representative in London to discover the composition of the steel from which shell cases are made. They received information by cable from their representative, which he in turn obtained from the War Office, as to the composition of the steel. But I am in a position to say that they still have to await the arrival of the mail for a letter giving fuller particulars than those contained in the cable. They are unable, with the information they have at present, to give us a guarantee that they will be able to make the steel required for the manufacture of shells. </para>

The Departmental Committee to which reference has been made has been put into a more formal shape during the last week by the appointment of an expert officer from the naval side as well as from the military side. The Committee now consists of the Second Naval Member, who is an experienced gunnery officer; the Director of Naval Ordnance, an experienced ordnance man; the Chief of Ordnance on the military side; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> the chemical adviser to the Defence Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> McKay and a representative of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company have been appointed consultative members of the Committee. </para>

They are coming before the Committee from day to day to give them the knowledge they possess. The Committee are able to sift it and make use of what is valuable. I may add that since the cables to which reference has been made were sent, urgent cables have been despatched to the High Commissioner and the War Office asking for expedition in the despatch of information, and I hone that as a result of what has been done we shall very shortly be in a position to utilize, first of all the services of private manufacturers in Australia in turning out shells to the utmost capacity of their works, and, secondly, to establish a Government factory for the manufacture of shells and guns. </para>

                        <para>It is understood by the Commissioner that the question means, how much extra revenue would be produced from each State - (1) by fixing the rate of Federal land tax at a figure which would give an increment of tax of Is. on the last ?1 of a taxable balance of ?75,000, and taking that increment of tax as a flat rate applicable to the whole taxable balance of ?75,000; (2) by working from the amended rate thus ascertained in order to calculate the increment of tax on the last ?1 of any taxable balance and utilizing such increment as a flat rate applicable to the whole of the taxable balance. </para>

                        <para>The Government of New South Wales agreed on 5th November, 1914, to borrow ?7,400,000 from the Commonwealth Government, and not to borrow otherwise during a period of twelve months, except for renewals of existing loans falling due, and except by way of sales of Treasury-bonds to an amount not exceeding sales in a normal year. On the 24th February, 1915, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth agreed that, in addition to the loan of ?7,400,000, the Government of New South Wales should be at liberty to borrow in all ?1,950,000 up to the 30th of November, 1915. On the 10th March, 1915, the Commonwealth Treasurer informed the various Premiers that, as it was understood that the British Government proposed to support State loans to be placed on the London market during March, the Commonwealth would not insist on the clause in the agreement limiting the borrowing operations of the States. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that it has been stringent and thoroughly live criticism, but when the arguments of these friendly critics are summed up, it will be seen that the fault they find with the Bill is not so much that it contains any inherent defects as- that it is such a little bantling so far as insurance legislation is concerned, and does not go far enough to suit their views, especially the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. In the course of his extremely interesting speech the other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> referred to this measure as a " flimsy " one, and as "a ramshackle structure." I scarcely think that these were fair similes. I regard the Bill as one which provides us with a rather sound foundation. I do not think that it can reasonably be regarded as a superstructure. It represents but the beginning  of insurance legislation. It provides us with a sound, almost, perhaps, a conservative foundation, but one upon which we can construct an edifice of national insurance - an edifice which, I hope, will be crowned with the cupola of social insurance, and which will give us an insurance system from which the people will derive great benefits. </para>

                    <para>It is scarcely fair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> to argue that because a Bill does not go far enough it is necessarily bad. I would remind him that many Bills have been introduced into this Chamber, which honorable senators upon this side have supported as an instalment of reform with a view of securing a better and more far-reaching measure in the immediate future. Coming to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior's</inline> chief complaint - that this Bill does not deal with compulsory insurance - I would point out that, from information supplied to me by competent constitutional authorities, there is at any rate a doubt as to whether we can constitutionally enact legislation providing for a complete and comprehensive system of national insurance. That is the opinion which I have formed after consulting the best authorities upon this matter. Some of them think that we can institute such a system. But even these point out that, as on numerous other occasions, the High Court might take an entirely contrary view, with the result that a Bill providing for such a system might be adjudged to be partially <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> On the other hand, there are those who frankly maintain that we have not the power to do what the honorable senator suggests. </para>

                            <para>- No. I believe there is a stronger reason why a compulsory insurance system should not be undertaken at the present juncture. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> himself probably put the position with more force than I can do. He affirmed that before a Bill providing for social insurance was introduced, a comprehensive inquiry should be conducted, and the whole of the available data' studied, with a view to the drafting of a measure which would be acceptable to the Democracy of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> expressed a similar opinion. Indeed, that, opinion is generally held by honorable senators upon this side of the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has had a large experience of the work of friendly societies - work which in its incidence is closely allied to that of insurance companies. In Tasmania, indeed, these organizations have notably contributed to the welfare of the workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> stated that we ought to conduct an exhaustive inquiry into the question before introducing legislation providing for compulsory insurance. </para>

This Bill is largely in the nature of a machinery measure which is based upon State Acts, and which, at any rate, will provide 'us with some meed of progress. It is a consolidating Bill, the effect of which will be to put all matters relating to insurance upon a more business-like basis. </para>

                            <para>- That is a point which my honorable friend mentioned in his speech, and one on which I will be pleased to hear him again at the Committee stage. In speaking of national insurance a large number of matters occur to one's mind. There is no  question  of the woeful waste which goes on at present. My honorable colleague from Tasmania stressed that point in his speech, and it was mentioned, too, by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in introducing the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> pointed out pithily that, in England, 10s. per annum is the average charge for a £10 industrial insurance policy. Surely that is a very heavy and a very wasteful premium ! On this subject, I have had conversations with friends who are interested in insurance questions. They told me that a similar state of affairs pervades Australia; that industrial insurance is not only highly costly, but is a class of insurance which necessitates a duplication of organizations by the various companies. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. If we could organize, as we could with a system of national insurance, there is no doubt that great savings could be made in that direction. I believe that this measure will do something to pave the way for the introduction of social insurance. I hope, too, that it will cause friendly societies, and persons who are more directly concerned in insurance legislation, to take an ever increasing interest in social insurance. If the addresses of my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> and other senators who have spoken, have that effect, I think that good will come out of the measure there, because we certainly have to work, as far as possible, in' consonance with the views of friendly societies, in introducing legislation such as social insurance. Their help and assistance, and I make bold to say experience, will be of immense value to us. Before leaving this phase of the subject, I turned up a valuable report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> on social insurance. He gives such a splendid summary of the benefits of social insurance that I cannot refrain from quoting his words. Under the heading of, " The Desirability of State Insurance," he sets out the advantages so lucidly that no words of mine could assist to convey their meaning more clearly. He says - </para>

                        <para>If  freed  from the prevailing circumlocutory methods, a State institution would have manifest advantages over those privately organized and managed, (a) In the first place, it could offer security impossible to be obtained by a private corporation, and this security could be attained without the accumulation of any reserve. The State must endure through all ordinary vicissitudes in political and financial affairs. (6) Secondly, the State, subject to the same proviso, could provide insurance at a minimum cost, being able to gain the attention of working men without the expenses of agents' commissions, .advertising, fees, &amp;c. Further, a Government institution docs not require to make profits, (c) Thirdly, the actuarial questions involved in a scientific system of social insurance are difficult and intricate, and require the mathematical analysis of complicated statistics. These statistics the State is best qualified to procure with economy and accuracy, and to prepare reliable tables of mortality, morbidity, and accident-frequency. Already the Commonwealth is partially equipped for such work, and procures for other purposes some of the data required. With the exorcise of the full powers conferred by the Constitution Act in respect of statistics, and a careful determination of the scope of the data required, all other necessary particulars could readily bo collected. (&lt;Z) Fourthly, the workman requires to have the minimum cost of insurance authoritatively stated. The individual knows but little of the actual risks which assail  him  or of what the proper cost of insurance against any class of risks would be. No other agency or source of information could command as great confidence as a properly organized State bureau, (p)  Fifthly,  State insurance affords facilities for the collective insurance of workmen by the employers. For example, it is difficult for any but the largest employers of labour to attempt to create a system for insurance against accidents; the State, therefore, offers to small employers an institution conducted on the most economical and scientific lines, and in which all the necessary arrangements for management and abstruse actuarial calculations have already  been  made. (/) One of the greatest advantages offered by the State institutions is the facility afforded for the organization of compulsory social insurance. </para>

                            <para>- What is the position as regards the payments? It is most unsatisfactory to me as a supporter of Labour. In England I have heard of many Labour leaders who criticise strongly the legislation and the basis of the scale of payments. Why ? It has been, and still is, pointed out that under our present economic wage system practically the whole of that 7d. per week falls on the shoulders of the worker. Why does it? The payment of his own contribution of 3d. per week he cannot escape. The 3d. per week which the employer pays is promptly passed on in the shape of increased profits. Any person who is acquainted with mercantile economy and has had experience of a costing system is aware that when an employer of labour, or a manufacturer, or a business man, makes up the cost of an article there is always so much per cent, added for every contingency which is likely to arise, even fire insurance. </para>

                            <para>- As my honorable friend interjects, an additional 2d. is passed on to the consumer, and, therefore, the worker pays the whole 6d., and sometimes an extra profit of 3d. Surely the system is Dot as economically sound as we would wish, especially when we remember that, in addition, the bulk of the money which is contributed by the State is derived largely from taxation paid by the workers. The probability is that the worker pays the greater share of the penny. When the time comes to deal with the question of national insurance, we ought to look very carefully into the contributory basis, because that is the very bedrock of the scheme. The closest investigation should be made, because, to my mind, this is one of the most important points of the whole system. One is tempted to speak on this very fascinating subject at some length. </para>

                    <para>Coming to the provisions of the Bill, I wish to refer to one or two matters which arise out of certain clauses. It has been, stated to me by representatives of fire insurance companies whom I happen to know that more than one set of returns will have to be made under the measure. They may not be right in their view, and, as I- read the Bill, they are not right. It is provided very clearly in clause 5 that various State Acts shall, subject to this measure, cease to apply in relation to insurance business; but an impression has got abroad that the companies will have to make returns to the States as well as to the Commonwealth, though I do not think so. </para>

                            <para>- The representatives of these companies might have been referring to that point. One of the advantages of the measure is the codification of the State laws and the simplification of the duties of insurance societies. In future the societies will only have to deal 'with one authority, instead of with six conflicting authorities. But I think it ought to be made clear that the companies will only have to deal with one authority. I desire to get a little light in regard to clause 17. When I was engaged in business I had some little connexion with fire insurance, being the representative for various companies. The clause reads - </para>

They are continually lapsing, and continually being taken up again ; there is no continuity about such policies. Will a fire insurance society have to give notice of amalgamation to every one of its policy-holders? I take it that under the Bill it will. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will look into this point, because I do not think that the companies should be required to serve all these notices on persons who are only taking up policies for very short periods, and continually allowing them to lapse, and taking them up again. </para>

I cannot see why a fire insurance company should be compelled to send a notice to every little policy-holder. It has been represented to me by some of the insurance offices concerned that clause 41 will be harassing to companies not Australian. I do not hold a brief for such companies. I think that Australian companies should get preference over foreign companies every time, but there is a little provision which ought to be looked into carefully to see if it will work well in practice.

                    <para class="block">That means that an English company within three months of the expiration of the financial year will have to send a return, giving the details as provided for in this Bill. I think we ought to allow at least three months after the annual meeting, for the companies do not always hold their annual meetings at the end of the financial year. They may hold these meetings a little later, but, according to this Bill, they will be required to furnish returns within three months after the expiration of the financial year, and within six months after the date of investigation in the case of the abstract and statement, they will be required again to bend returns in. I think that, in Committee, we might very well consider the advisability of altering the clause by inserting the words, " three months after the annual meeting," instead of the words, " three months after the expiration of the financial year." That would be fairer to the companies concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure it is not considered so progressive that it cannot be altered in this respect. I know that in the case of many country fires the local agent is accepted by both parties as a reliable assessor. He lives there, he knows the conditions, and the value of everything in his particular district. Why not allow him to assess damages if he is accepted by both parties ? I know that in some cases the local policeman acts as assessor, and very often he is well qualified to undertake that task. It appears to me that the clause in its operation will be harassing to the companies; and, further, it might fall unduly on the policyholders. The Bill largely is one for Committee. Whatever its de* tractors may say, from "a business stand-point, I welcome it; and, as a shareholder myself in three mutual life assurance companies in Australia, I welcome it. It will make the law, I hope, clearer. It will make the law, in some respects, more definite; and it will be * start on the road of progress on which I feel sure this party, once it has put its hand to the plough, will long continue. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [4.20].- I have comparatively little to say in criticism of this Bill. I recognise that, on broad general principles, it is very desirable that the law governing fire and life insurance should be of universal application in the Commonwealth, and that there should be no provisions of the law peculiar to any one State. I gather from the debate which has taken place that certain honorable senators are tinder some misapprehension as to the purpose of the Bill. I have read
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior's</inline>
                        very interesting address upon the second reading, and the honorable senator will pardon me for saying that a very great deal of it was scarcely applicable to the Bill now under the consideration of the Senate. It was applicable, however, to a principle of insurance legislation which we are not called upon to consider at the present time.

                            <para>- I do not wish it to be supposed that I criticise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior's</inline> address in any hostile way at all. I realize, however, that it is the purpose of the Bill now before us to recognise the position with which we are confronted to-day in dealing with the large number of fire and life insurance companies that are doing business throughout the Commonwealth. We have not yet taken up the question of. national insurance which was contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline> That is a question which must be dealt with sooner or later, and probably the sooner it is dealt with the better it will be for the community at large. I know that a great many men have given close attention to that question. I think it was mentioned in a Governor-General's Speech, some time ago, that a national system of insurance was one of the questions upon which the Government of the day proposed to legislate. That system of insurance, however, stands quite apart from the matters we are called upon to deal with in this Bill. We are here asked to decide how existing fire and life insurance companies shall carry on their business, and the object 'is to bring all carrying on business in any of the States under one comprehensive Act. For one class of insurance a certain deposit is required in Victoria, whilst in New South Wales companies carrying on the same class of insurance are not called upon to make any deposit at all. Should there be a deposit in such cases? If we decide that there should, the provision ought certainly to be applicable to every insurance company carrying on that business in any part of Australia. So far as fire insurance is concerned, I take no exception to the amount of the deposit required under this Bill. A fire insurance policy may be looked to not only as a means of obtaining the value of property destroyed by fire to the extent covered by the policy, but as a mercantile commodity. If the owner of a house goes to a financial institution to raise money upon it, he is asked whether it is insured to the full extent of the advance which he requires. People lending money are very keen to see that the office issuing a policy upon the property offered them .as security for their advances is one which will be in a position to make the policy of value in the event of the necessity of realization. </para>

He will not be satisfied if the property is insured in a new office in a small way of business, but will look for a policy issued by an established fire insurance office that has disclosed the soundness of its position by its balance-sheets. I have no objection to established insurance companies being called upon to put up a reasonable deposit, but I should like to direct attention to the provision in this regard for companies newly established.

                    <para class="block">If a small insurance company were started to-day, and this Bill came into force to-morrow, the company would be called upon, under clause 19, to make, within six months a deposit of £20,000; but if the company were started the day after the measure came into force it would, under clause 21, be called upon to deposit only £2,000 in the first instance, and then 25 per centum of its premium- income. I think that discretion might be given to the Commissioner to permit the registration of a new company upon. the payment of a comparatively small deposit in the first instance, requiring, as provided for in the Bill, the subsequent payment of 25 per cent, of the premium income until the deposit had reached a reasonable amount. The question has often arisen of the possibility of establishing fire and life insurance companies upon the purely mutual and co-operative basis. I am afraid that clause 20 of this Bill would have the effect of strangling a proposal of that kind at its very initiation. I speak with some knowledge and experience on this matter. I had an opportunity some time ago of listening to &amp; very interesting and instructive address by  His Excellency  the Governor of Victoria, who has taken a great deal of interest in the co-operative movement in the Old Country. He mentioned that in his county in England it was desired to establish a co-operative fire insurance company, but those concerned were confronted with the difficulty that they were unable io give the public any assurance that their policies would be made good. Twenty, thirty, or 200 farmers might come together and be satisfied that a proposal for a mutual business would be all right, but the moment they went to any one to borrow money they were confronted with the difficulty that they had no subscribed capital. The result was that  His Excellency,  with others interested in the movement, undertook to provide debenture capital to the extent of £10,000 or £20,000, on which they were guaranteed interest at 5 per cent. They -did so with a desire to assist in the establishment of the co-operative business rather than with a desire for a remunerative investment of their capital. Any proposal to establish a co-operative insurance company here would be met with the same difficulty. Some one would have to advance capital by way of debentures, or .an arrangement would have to be made with an established company to carry the smaller mutual concern upon its shoulders until it could stand alone. Taking this into consideration, it would, I think, be well to reduce the deposit required from such companies to the smallest possible amount. Of course, the Commissioner would have to be satisfied before registering a company that one or two email fires would not destroy it. I admit that the matter is one of great difficulty, but we should look to the establishment, if possible, of insurance companies upon the mutual or co-operative principle. When ' we come to consider life insurance, we have before us an entirely different matter. A fire insurance policy last3 but for one year, and is realized upon if the property insured is destroyed by fire during the year, but in the case of a life insurance policy the man who takes it out continues it during the whole period for which it was taken in the first instance. </para>

                            <para>- That is not always so, because in these days the companies permit a policy to be kept in force so long as the premiums can be paid out of the surrender value. When the surrender value of the policy is exhausted by the payment of the premiums it must, of course, lapse. Under clause 19, a company doing life insurance business only is compelled to put up a deposit of £20,000. One of the most successful insurance offices, not only in Australia, but in the British Dominions, is the Australian Mutual Provident Society. That has been a purely mutual life insurance office from the commencement to the present time. There are no holders of debentures in that company to whom special sums are paid by way of interest upon capital advanced. A limited number of gentlemen who, more than fifty years ago, believed in the cooperative or mutual principle, established this company. From very small beginnings it has grown to the magnificent position it occupies to-day. I mention it because it is the oldest and strongest of the Australian life insurance companies. With the exception of one of two small companies, all the life insurance companies that have since been started in Australia, such as the National Mutual Insurance Company, a great company doing business in Victoria, and others have been started on the mutual principle. Every large office that we have to-day  in  Australia of colonial origin is a purely mutual office. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. If we take some of the great American offices that are doing business here, we are told that they are mutual offices, and. distribute bonuses regularly, but in most cases they have an initial capital of £20,000, on which they are compelled to pay a certain rate of interest. The persons who contributed this capital are stockholders, who control the company. In the case of a purely mutual company, every policy-holder has a voice at the meetings of the company to decide the way in which its business shall be carried on. The history of insurance business in Australia has proved that the mutual principle is a safe and sound principle on which to work. There is not the same prospect of a realization upon' the face value of the policy in any given twelve months with regard to life offices, because the whole of the life business is done upon an actuarial basis. Although individual life is uncertain, the actuarial tables are so absolutely certain that it can be relied on that, within a few thousand pounds, a certain number of claims in each individual year will be made upon the funds of the company. The premiums are so regulated and weighted that there can be no difficulty or doubt as to the safety of the policy, once the company is on an established basis, although there is a certain amount of risk in the earlier stages. It may be asked why large premiums should be charged by purely mutual companies, but where these are in excess of the amount required for the conduct of the business and the keeping up of reserve funds, every penny is returned to the policy-holders themselves. There can therefore be no complaint that men are not getting full value for their money. If a man pays £10 for his policy, and only £7 is actuarially necessary, the other £3 is utilized to pay the expenses of the business and establish reserve funds to insure the stability of the company, the balance being returned in the shape of bonuses to the policy-holders. </para>

Not only the individual, but all the other policy holders in the company, must be protected. My life might, according to actuarial tables, . be worth twenty-five years ; but a defect might reduce its value to twenty years. The policy would therefore be loaded; or I might, if I chose, take out a policy for a smaller sum, subject to the larger amount being paid if I attained a certain age. That is the disadvantage which must be suffered by a man who is not sound and healthy, but it is only fair and just to all the other policy-holders. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. I should feel that I was not in a very safe position. We ought to reconsider in Committee whether life insurance companies should be required to put up any sum. If we demand a deposit of £20,000, not another purely mutual insurance office will be established in Australia. This may not matter very much, but people should certainly be allowed the opportunity to establish other mutual offices if they think fit. We should also be very careful as to the amount of money we require from a newly-established fire insurance company, or from any other fire insurance offices which are honestly and <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> endeavouring to work, as far as they can, on a co-operative or mutual principle amongst those who insure with them. There are certain methods of getting over difficulties, but these are not always quite satisfactory, and may create a good deal of doubt in people's minds as  to whether they are being worked fairly and justly. It should not be forgotten that in Australia nearly every fire office is what is called a tariff office. Certain tariffs are established; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> urged that it was difficult to determine whether a particular tariff was fair and reasonable. They are fixed from time to time by insurance men, who take into consideration the risks under particular policies and in particular localities. If a Melbourne business man wishes to effect a fire insurance policy ona property in Flinders-lane, he will pay a much heavier rate than if the property is in Lonsdale or Latrobe street, or even in Bourke or Collins street. There are certain fire zones where the history of the last forty or fifty years has shown that. the risks are much more pronounced. That is the way in which one must determine what is a fair and reasonable rate. Any honorable senator who visits an insurance office and sees their maps and books, will find that the city of Melbourne is divided into zones, some of which are regarded as more dangerous than others, the premiums being correspondingly higher. </para>

                                do not. There is competition amongst the insurance offices.; but they do one thing which is of great benefit and value to the people, and which is done all over the world - they effect reinsurances amongst themselves. If an insurance office issued to the honorable senator a policy for £20,000 over his stock in business premises, they would not hold the whole risk themselves, although they would be primarily responsible to him for it. They would distribute it amongst other offices, who give and take. In this way the risk is distributed, it is made much more easy for the companies to meet their obligations when the time comes for repayment, and there is no possibility of an office being wiped out.

                            <para>- If the honorable senator could get the various fire insurance offices into direct competition with one another, he would soon have failure after failure, in stead of the whole of them conducting safely the business intrusted to them. Under the conditions of which he speaks, the honorable senator might approach one office, which would stipulate for a premium of 5s. or 10s. per cent., and another office, anxious to get the business, might offer to do it for 2s. 6d. instead of 5s., or for 7s. 6d. instead of 10s. If, then, a big blow came to that office, it might not be in a position to meet the whole of its engagements. That sort of competition degenerates too often into cut-throat competition, and it is much safer to have the one rate throughout the 'whole of the offices. The honorable senator would like to see the State monopolize the whole of the fire insurance business; but he must realize that certain rates would have to be fixed that would reasonably recoup the State for any loss it might make. Unless one great fund w,as created, and the State was not allowed to utilize the money for any other purpose, it would inevitably go into the Consolidated Revenue, or into some fund or other where it would not be readily accessible in the event of great destruction entailing heavy repayments. </para>

                        <para>From the replies received from the representatives of the various companies in response to a query concerning the method by which fire insurance premiums payable in the Commonwealth were' determined, it appears that the major portion of the business is conducted on rates determined by tariff associations. These rates represent the combined experience of the offices connected with the association, which, in the absence of a complete scheme of classification and tabulation of risks and losses, such as that referred to in section 24 above, appears to furnish a fairly satisfactory method of determining a reasonable basis of operations. </para>
                        <para>An objection which is sometimes urged against such an association is that it tends to maintain rates at an unduly high level," and that if there were unrestricted competition amongst the offices the public would benefit. </para>

                        <para>Your commissioners are strongly of opinion that the only sound method of fire insurance is that which is based upon very widely-distributed risks of relatively small amounts, and in their opinion such a method would be impossible under any practical system of either State or municipal fire insurance which did not involve co-operation with private insurance companies for the purpose of widely distributing the risks by re-insurance..... </para>
                        <para class="block">As the result of inquiries made by the Prime Minister, at the instance of your commissioners, information has been received from the Premiers of the several States, which indicates that the general practice at present obtaining is for the Government in each case to carry its own fire risks, usually without the provision' of a special fire insurance fund, and this no doubt has influenced the Commonwealth Government in adopting the policy indicated. Nevertheless, for the reasons specified above, your commissioners consider that the practice is unwise: and that, even if it were possible to so arrange that Commonwealth and State Governments should contribute to a common fund to cover any losses that might arise by fire to the properties of any of them, the large amounts which would necessarily be concentrated in single risks are such as to render inapplicable the basic principle of averages unless extensive  re-insurances  were effected. . . . From these replies, it appears that in many cases the maximum amount carried alone on a single risk docs not exceed £5,000, and in 80iiib instances is much lower, while in no case was a higher amount than £15,000 mentioned as being so carried. </para>

                    <para>I would remind honorable senators of what happened many years ago when a great fire practically destroyed the city of Chicago. That conflagration resulted in the downfall of a large number of fire insurance companies, which had not distributed their risks, and which collapsed like the veriest house of cards. On that occasion the insured found themselves in exactly the same position as those persons who had never insured. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the Government are acting wisely by providing in this Bill, which is a consolidating measure, for the solvency of private . insurance companies. So far as life insurance companies are concerned, we want to give a little more play to our people in their dealings with them. We do not want to encourage the establishment of insurance offices, which, in their conduct of business, would create a large number of additional offices of profit and also reduce the bonuses that would be payable to policy-holders under the mutual system. If it ' is desired to establish reserves they should be established from the premiums which are payable each year. These reserves will then be visible to the  people  generally. There is a large number of small firms in the city which establish insurance funds within their own ambits. There is no doubt that the Bill will press rather heavily upon them. </para>

On the other hand, they may find that it is more advantageous for them to deal with insurance companies which are doing business here at the present time. We know that before any company can underwrite an accident insurance in Victoria, it must  establish  its solvency to the satisfaction of the Government of this State. </para>

My object in rising was to speak only on the broad principles of the measure, leaving its details to be dealt with in Committee. If those details do not evoke a good deal of discussion in this chamber they certainly will do so in another place. It frequently happens that the public do not voice their opinions upon measures which originate in the Senate, until after those measures have gone to another branch of the Legislature, which is then bombarded with all sorts of objections to them. The result is that honorable senators are deprived of an early opportunity of expressing their opinions in respect of the views held by insurance experts. I hope that this Bill will emerge from Committee in a form which will commend it not only to honorable senators, but to the public, and also to the insurance companies. I have no doubt that those companies recognise that it contains very valuable provisions which must add to their stability, particularly in the case of fire insurance companies.

                            <para>- I never do anything to connect myself with measures before the Senate. I am responsible, of course, for the measures I introduce, and I will stick to that responsibility ; but, so far as criticism is concerned, I let a measure take the criticism, and, of course, the sting is then all the easier for me to bear. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said he was disappointed with the Bill because it was not sufficiently progressive, and, therefore, he desired the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the whole matter, and make the. Government better acquainted with what the Commonwealth should receive at the present time". I did hope that I had made it quite clear that this was a measure to deal with existing companies - that is, to bring the companies transacting business in all the States under the control of the. Government, and, therefore, of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. When we hear an honorable senator say that doing that is not doing enough, we are amazed. To my mind, if we do a little well, and do it in the manner in which it should be done, it is better than to rush in some great measure dealing "with matters so far-reaching that they would be discussed during the whole life of a Parliament, and nothing would be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was quite fair in his criticism and quite candid, but I venture to say that his disappointment was due to the fact that the Bill did not foreshadow a Government insurance proposal to come into competition with existing insurance companies. He concluded his remarks by saying that possibly the Government had such a proposal in mind. I do want honorable senators to understand our attitude. I hope that, instead of proclaiming promises ahead, instead of making fine promises, we will do good work. I hope that, instead of saying what we are going to do, we will do something, and when it comes to do the next thing we will do it in the same methodical, matter-of-fact way, without making any loud proclamation of what our intentions are in this or that direction.  I make that statement because as regards the business of the Government, both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie know just as much about what our intentions are with regard to this particular matter as- 1 do. I do not complain of my honorable friends' criticism, but I do think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior's</inline> might have been couched in milder and kindlier language. I suppose that a stranger reading in cold print his references to the Government and the Bill would not imagine that it was 'a generous supporter, as we know him to be, who was levelling the criticism. But that is a matter for the honorable senator himself to consider, and not for me to complain of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, made a remarkable criticism, which to some extent might mislead honorable senators. He sought to show * that with regard to the making of regulations, we were taking exceptional powers which had not been taken in other measures. I can only regard it as evidencing one of the infirmities of a great mind when I have regard to the fact that in the Arbitration Act, the Census Act, the Excise Act, the Australian Notes Act, the Copyright Act; the Coinage Act, the Electoral Act, the Immigration Act, and other Acts, we find the identical wording to which he takes exception in this measure. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will understand that in a factory where Bills are being turned out. if there is one suitable pattern which will fit all the time, it is the pattern which is used. In this measure, we are not asking for exceptional powers with regard to regulations, we are sticking hard and fast to the same phraseology as is contained in the Acts I enumerated, and possibly in all other Acts. I make these remarks in order to disabuse the minds of honorable senators of the idea that exceptional powers are being asked for. </para>

                    <para class="block">The honorable senator, of course, will remember making that statement. I presume that we may conclude from his language .that if any reasonable excuse had been given by my own remarks, it would not have been so severe as it was. The whole tenor of his speech was a complaint that we had not introduced a national insurance scheme, or, as he phrased it, a Bill to deal with the widows, the maimed, and the sick. It ill-becomes any one to taunt the present Government with having forgotten the invalid, the old, the maimed, and those who are unable to look after themselves. Because, if ever there was a party in the Commonwealth, or any other part of the world, that deserved well at the hands of the unfortunates, it is the party of which I am a representative. Not only have we not forgotten these people, but we have taken a foremost stand, and introduced legislation which has placed unfortunate persons on as good a footing as they are in, I venture to say, in any other part of the world. We have led the way with progressive legislation. With our old-age pension, our invalid pension, and our maternity allowance, we have set an example which will be followed by any civilized nation. Yet, on a Bill of this kind, we are taunted with neglect of duty to those classes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> quoted a statement I made that the Bill would benefit the companies. There was quite a tone of triumph in his voice as he pointed out that it would benefit all companies, and he wanted to know if it would benefit any one else. I am rather pleased with his reference to the benefit which this legislation will be to the companies, because most of them are mutual companies. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that there never was a Bill introduced yet in which the mind of man could not suggest some huge improvement. But this is a real hard, practical business measure, to bring all those insurance companies whose business comes so much in touch with the daily life of the people of Australia under the control of whom ? Of one Parliament, elected by the people of Australia on the broadest franchise imaginable. If that is not progress, I do not know what progress is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> said that " the Bill would- benefit not one soul in Australia." I see an immediate benefit to the insurance companies; I see a great improvement in the practice of the companies, and a great advantage to the policy-holders in them, and, above all that, I see an Insurance Bill that will be controlled by a Government which is controlled by the Democracy of Australia. That may be no benefit or no gain at present, in the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline> Then, as regards national insurance, or matters of that kind, I venture to say that when this Bill is passed, and all matters of insurance are placed in the hands of this Parliament, its business, when the time is ripe, will, be to take whatever steps it desires, and let it go so far as it will, it will not go further than I am willing to go, in the direction of improving the conditions of insurance, making it much cheaper, more profitable, and more beneficial to the citizens of this country. But even if it is desired to do that, the foundation work has to be done first. The complaints of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> remind me of the complaint of the man who went to look at a house to be built, and who, when he saw the men taking out the foundation, said, " Instead of building a house, they are digging a hole." That, I think, sums up the criticism of the honorable senator. This is constructive legislation. I venture to say that when the honorable senator has time to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will find that his was a most interesting speech on national insurance. </para>

I am not complaining of his criticism, except that it was levelled in a wrong direction. Instead of dealing with the principles of the Bill, he dealt with something not in the measure, and something, to my mind, which is better left out of it. The introduction, of national insurance would not be expedited by dealing with the subject in a Bill of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am digging for the foundation upon which the edifice of a National Insurance Act will be reared, and I hope that before we are through Committee we shall have erected a structure that will prove exceedingly valuable. I have no objection to honorable senators airing their views on national insurance, but I do ask them not to too closely connect me with their criticisms. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are not opposed to any suggestions for improvement of the measure. Only yesterday a deputation from the fire insurance companies waited on the Government in connexion with this matter, and I recognise that some of their suggestions must receive consideration. The Bill has not been hurried. It is more than six weeks since it was introduced, and the  debate was adjourned to suit the convenience of honorable senators, and also 'to give those people who are deeply interested in the measure an opportunity of considering the legislation we are introducing. I know from what has occurred that they have taken an intelligent interest in the matter, and, just as we have had the views of the fire insurance companies placed before us, I venture to say we will have the views of the life insurance societies. When the measure becomes law, I feel sure we shall have a first-class Act, consolidating for the first time in our history the whole of our insurance laws, and also providing for control by this Parliament and this Government. Of the criticism of the measure itself by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Senator Senior,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was the first to point out the indefiniteness of the clause dealing with what was a just and reasonable rate. With a larger experience of the matter, I think we shall have to be more definite, and say what we mean by what is just and reasonable. Wherever improvements can be made, I will not be backward in accepting them if convinced that they are improvements.I can assure honorable senators that I will not refuse to accept amendments simply for the sake of standing to the Bill as it has <inline font-style="italic">"been</inline> printed ; but if I am satisfied that an improvement can be made I will accept it from whatever quarter it may come. I have endeavoured to make myself acquainted with the Bill, and to see how the amendments will work in. If I have omitted to mention any matters referred to by honorable senators in the debate, I hope, when we come to the clauses <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the Bill, they will call my attention to them - because this is one of those Bills which we can best deal with in Committee - and they will be carefully discussed . I thank honorable senators - even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> for his criticism, severe as it was - for the manner in which they have received this Bill, and I hope, when it goes into Committee in a <inline font-style="italic">pro formd</inline> manner, we will adjourn it in order to allow another measure to be dealt with. I hope, also, that when we get to the Bill again we shall so deal with it that eventually we will have a very valuable measure placed on the statute-books of the country. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to do that. The Bill is not one in which any great principle is at stake. It is purely and' simply a- departmental measure. There was a desire, when granting protection to Australian whisky, to secure an absolutely pure article. That is a very laudable intention, no doubt, but I want to draw attention to the fact that, in the desire to establish the distilling industry in Australia for the production of pure whisky, the standard was so set as to be almost impossible of attainment. The distillers have not been successful in extracting, perhaps, the principal ingredient, fusel oil, with the result that, the standard being so high, there is a prejudice against Australian whisky. <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator BAKHAP.</inline> - Is it not correct that the Australian whisky distillers - I do not know if there are many of them - have made representations against this Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- I am sure of it. Might I point out that when the Tariff Commission recommended that " thirty-five per cent, overproof " be established as the regulation quality, the desire was undoubtedly to produce a good whisky, but it has been found that, despite the fact that the whisky was held in bulk for two years - which is considered the world over as a reasonable time to mature - it was still full of fusel oil, which made it, if not unsaleable, an unpalatable 'article. This has led to Australian whisky being seldom sold as such. It is sold in large quantities, but is blended with other whiskies. I do not hold any brief for the whisky industry - far from it - but I say that if our people are to consume whisky, they might as well consume Australian whisky, provided it is not in any way inferior to imported whiskies. I have one or two quotations to make to show that a mistake was made here in fixing the standard for Australian whisky at 35 per cent, overproof. In a paper upon " The Establishment of Standards for Whisky in Western Australia," I find the following: - </para>

                    <para>The restriction of the strength at which whisky may be distilled to 35 deg. O.P. would entirely eliminate some of the finest Irish pot still whisky, and certainly also some of the grain or patent still whiskies. While the  Royals  Commission (final report of the Royal Commission on whisky and other potable" spirits, 1000, page 8) came to the conclusion that the materials from which whisky might be made should be restricted to malted and unlimited grain, they refused (page 21) to place any restrictions on the processes by which whisky might be produced. In my opinion the proposed restriction of the distilling strength to 35 O.P. is entirely arbitrary and without justification. </para>

We. can all sympathize with the desire that whisky produced in Australia should be pure and of good quality; but those who fixed the standard at 35 O.P. rather overstepped the mark, with the result that the industry cannot be established so long as the existing standard is maintained. No standards are fixed for whisky produced in England, Scotland, or Ireland. We can protect Australian whisky consumers, because we have power under the Pure Foods Act and the Excise Act to insure compliance with a standard of purity before whisky manufactured here is sold to the public. I trust that honorable senators will permit the measure to go through. It has already been passed by the House of Representatives, and will really form a part of the Excise Tariff. When all is said and done, it deals with a purely technical matter, and is approved of by the experts of the Customs </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with interest to what the Minister has had to say in support of this Bill, and I confess that I know more about it now than I did when it was presented to us in December last. I have received a circular, which I presume other honorable senators have also received, from Messrs. Joshua Brothers on the whisky duties. I find that a great deal of what  the Assistant Minister has . said is confirmed by the statements appearing in it. The information it contains, I think, justifies us in passing this Bill. In 1906 we passed a Spirits Act, in section 3 of which we provided for an " Australian Standard Malt Whisky," and also an " Australian Standard Blended Whisky." <inline font-style="italic">In each</inline> case we provided that they must have been distilled wholly from barley malt by a pot-still or similar process, and at a strength not exceeding 35 per cent, overproof. This measure is designed to increase the strength of distillation from 35 to 45 per cent. At first blush I thought that the effect of that would be to render the whisky stronger and more intoxicating, but I find, from what the Minister has said, that that is not the case. I find that an increase of the percentage overproof reduces the fusel oil, which is probably one of the worst concomitants of whisky. In their circular, Messrs. Joshua Brothers begin by saying - </para>

                <para>Since last we addressed you on this subject, the Inter-State Commission has issued its report, and has certainly paid us some fine compliments, thus: - " The purity of Australian whisky has never been questioned..... A very large amount of capital has been invested by manufacturers in this industry, and the fact that their operations have not been profitable is not due to want of equipment, or of raw material, or of the most modern appliances." The report further admits the truth of our contention that there is practically no sale for pure-malt, pot-still whisky, and never likely to be. </para>
                <para>Later on they say - </para>
                <para>You have now seen what one Commission in 1906 recommended as the only " true " whisky, and the only sort worthy of encouragement, another Commission in 1915 admits to be practically unsaleable. </para>
                <para>The moral is not likely to be overlooked. </para>
                <para>Since the attempt to stereotype a new process of whisky-making has clearly failed of its object, it might be well in the future to leave to practical distillers such technicalities as the due proportion of malt-whisky in a blend, the advantage or otherwise of the " patent " over the "pot" still, and the question of distilling at low strengths, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> retaining the fusel oil, or at high strength, i.e., leaving it out. </para>

It is less intoxicating. </para>

                        <para>. - Last week, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> was making a very interesting speech, he implied that while the Liberal party allowed its members freedom of action the members of the Labour party were not allowed the same freedom. I interjected that I heard the honorable senator make a statement in the Tasmanian Parliament that both parties were equally bound. The honorable senator denied this. I admit that one cannot remember everything one says over a lengthy period, but I remembered the incident well, and said I could produce it in print. The Tasmanian Parliament has no <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and has to depend for the records  of its  debates on the reports in the two daily papers. These are cut out, and an official of the House of Assembly pastes them in a scrap-book, which constitutes the only record of the debates of the Tasmanian Parliament. I sent to Hobart for a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> of 5th July, 1912, and in it the following appears: - </para>

                        <para>. - I had no conception that my utterances were deemed so important by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> as to cause him to burrow in the musty archives of Tasmanian parliamentary history in order to resurrect them ; but he need not imagine that I am at all appalled by the discovery ho thinks he has made. Last week, when. I was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> made an interjection to the effect that the nature of the obligations which bound together the members of the two parties into which Australia is divided at the present time were exactly similar, but I was endeavouring to make it quite clear that the organization of the Liberal party did not enjoin upon its members absolute adhesion to any programme promulgated by the Leader of the party. I was justifying some criticism which I said I intended to advance on the attitude of my leader in connexion with certain debates that had transpired in another place. I made a statement regarding the internal organization of the party, and I again maintain its absolute accuracy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> very cleverly I suppose from his own stand-point, now " rings in " some paragraphs from a debate on a no-confidence motion in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. The motion was moved very early in the history of a new Parliament, in which the tenure of office of the Government depended upon the attitude of one member. The conditions were such as are not very frequently presented in any Parliament where the system of party government and more particularly the system of dissolving Ministries, obtains. I said that the system of elective Ministries would to a large extent do away with party government, and permit every member to vote in absolute accordance with his convictions on any measure, because then the fate of the Ministry would not be involved. When I alluded to the fact that practically every member of that Legislature was not in a position to vote as his conscience dictated on any measure brought before the House, because the fate of the Government was involved, I was dealing with the position of parties in the </para>

                    <para>House itself, and was not alluding in any way whatever to the internal organization of the respective parties outside. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> cannot see the difference, I do not feel called upon to make any apology for or further explanation, of my utterances of two or three years ago. </para>

The Labour party is elected on a platform in which we all believe, and which we advocate before the electors. We are bound on all questions affecting the platform to sit. solidly together as one party. That applies to all details of the platform to which we unitedly subscribe. We are pledged only on the details of the platform, but nt&gt; Labour man or Government supporter will admit that we are pledged to vote for measures in which we do not believe. We are entirely free on all matters outside our platform. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Bakhap's  admission which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has resurrected clearly shows the position which the members of the Liberal party  are in, while they accuse us of being' caucus-bound. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Senate an article which is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of this morning. It is headed, " Boot's for Soldiers," " Wholesale Rejection," and "Incompetent Inspectors." With the permission of honorable senators I should like to read two or three paragraphs from it. They are as follow: - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Recently statements were made in Brisbane that boots of a very poor quality were being supplied to members of the Australian Imperial Force. The allegation was made by a manufacturer, who spoke of what he himself had seen. That his statements were justified is shown by the fact that at least one consignment of boots, consisting of 600 pairs, had been rejected, and- returned to Australia from Egypt. Probably other consignments have shared a similar fate. Large quantities of these rejected boots are now being sold in Melbourne and various other parts of Victoria. </para>
                        <para>No official statement has yet been made, although it is known that the allegations have been investigated, and a report forwarded to the Minister of Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> It lias been found that certain Victorian manufacturers have sold to the Defence Department boots of a very inferior type. Nor is the quality the most important aspect of the affair. These rejected boots have been found to be positively injurious to troops on active service. One of the strange features of the matter is that the rejected boots were passed by the Defence Department's own inspectors, all of whom are members of the Australian Boot' Trade Employees' Federation. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Last night, a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> was shown a boot, bearing the stamp of an inspector, the first sole of which, when slightly wet, became so spongy as to appear almost useless. " This," said the manufacturer who showed it, " is only one of thousands." This leather would hold water. Yet this boot has been passed. This boot is also riveted with nails, and is capable of crippling a soldier. In England these nails alone would be quite enough to insure its rejection." </para>
                        <para>When investigations were made by skilled men, the incompetence of the Government inspectors concerned was severely criticised. While the inquiry was proceeding, boots were returned to the makers every day. One result was that three of the inspectors were discharged. Others were severely censured for having passed serious defects in workmanship and low-quality material. An employer in a section of the boot trade stated that he, personally, know one man who, with only a limited experience in repairing boots, was appointed as an inspector. " Men who have not the ability to hold a position in a factory," he' continued, "were, through political influence at the Trades Hall, given these jobs." To all intents and purposes, these so-called inspectors were appointed by the secretary of the union. Competent men would have stopped the whole business at the outset. </para>

                        <para>. - Before the Minister replies, I wish to invite attention to the very unsatisfactory answer which I received this morning to a simple question that I addressed to the Land Tax Commissioner. At the head of that branch we have a highly -paid official. So far as I can ascertain, there has been no limit placed on the number of employees whom he can call to his aid. Yet when he is asked a simple question as to how much revenue an alteration in the Federal land tax will produce, he is unable to answer it. That is a condition of affairs which ought not to be permitted to continue for H single day longer than is necessary. L wish to know whether the Minister is prepared to give that officer more assistance, so that when information is required by members of this Parliament it may be made available to them in a less period than that indicated in the answer which has been supplied to me. He says that under the most favorable circumstances he could not reply to my question in le3S than six months. </para>

                            <para>- I may tell honorable senators that 300,000 pairs of boots have been tendered for and accepted by the Defence Department. Obviously in the supply of such a large quantity "of boots a number will be rejected, and some boots will pass the inspectors which are not quite up to sample. A little time ago some boots did come under our notice which were not up to sample. These were reported on by the inspectors. On the report from Queensland, whither they had been sent, we ascertained what inspectors were responsible for passing them, and those inspectors were discharged. It must be remembered that the supply of boots we have accepted prior to this year did not represent one-eighth of the quantity we have had to accept since the outbreak of the war. As a result we have had to immensely increase our staff of temporary inspectors. In taking on these temporary inspectors, the Government have adopted the principle of preference to unionists. It is that fact which is worrying the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and not the question of the quality of the boots supplied to the soldiers. That can be plainly seen by the contemptuous reference to the ability of these inspectors at the end of the article. What is the charge against these inspectors? It is that they are men who worked at a trade. That is a nice thing to urge by way of disqualification of an inspector. If there are any persons who should know something about boot3, obviously they are the men who have made boots. </para>

                            <para>- Every man appointed was a member of the Bootmakers Union. Consequently he had either to he a man who was earning his living by making boots by hand, or one who was employed in a boot factory. Now, a boot repairer knows more about boots than does a man who works in a boot factory. Obviously the best inspector we can get is a boot repairer, because he makes all parts of boots, whereas an employee in a factory may not make all those parts. Yet the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> trots that man out as an instance of the inferior class of men who have been appointed as inspectors. </para>

                            <para>- He is a cobbler, but he is the man who is required for the position. We have other information on this subject. We have the report of a General Officer Commanding which was1 sent to the Department just before he took his troops to Gallipoli after a test had been made, and he reported that the boots and uniforms were splendid. It was a most glowing report as to the equipment, and the way it stood the test. Again, we have the report of the war correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> who was sent to Egypt, and reported that the Australian equipment was better than any equipment he had ever seen, and he wrote after he had had experience of the regular armies of Great Britain and other countries. There is this point to be borne in mind - and I am quite conscious of it - that we are obtaining our boots more cheaply than boots are being obtained in the Old Country. It may, perhaps, be brought forward as a striking tribute to the success of the Protectionist policy of Australia that our manufacturers are able to turn out boots, although they pay higher wages, more cheaply than is done in England, and even in New Zealand. There has been an increase in the price of leather, and the question as to whether we should increase the price of boots is now under consideration. With the increase in the cost of the raw material it has been represented by the manufacturers that the price of the boots should increase proportionately, and that  question ib being investigated by experts in the Department. Considering the magnitude of the contracts we  have  had in hand - 300,000 pairs of hoots - I think that the inspectors  have  done marvellous work, and very valuable work, too. They have absolutely justified the policy of the Government in picking practical men for the positions, rather' than resorting to the old system of selecting men who followed clerical occupations. We have obtained .in that way over 100 inspectors, and it is a tribute to that method that we have had to discharge only three or four of them. If I  found  an inspector passing inferior boots I would not hesitate for  one  minute to discharge him. </para>
