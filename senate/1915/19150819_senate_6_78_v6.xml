                            <para>- What I am concerned about is the alteration of the form in which this question was decided upon by the Senate. Why does the War Committee desire to smother up a question which deals with, possibly, &#163;700,000,000 worth of property in this Commonwealth ? So far as I can see, no objection could be taken to the sub-paragraph in the form in which it left the Senate. But the War Committee, for some reason of which we are not aware, because it holds its meetings in secret, has made an alteration which ought not to be tolerated. I, therefore, submit this motion, the effect of which will be to disallow the regulation, with a view, of course,  to the substitution of the paragraph as it left the Senate. </para>

I pin him down to his own reply on a former occasion, that if any alterations were made they would be submitted to this Senate.  His  reply to-day is that the Attorney-General said that the alterations were so slight that it was not necessary to submit them to the Senate. I was not bothering about the Attorney-General. I do not know him in the Senate, but I know the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and I want him to take the responsibility he promised to assume of submitting to the Senate any alterations made in the schedule. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> had not submitted his motion, the alteration of the second schedule would have been allowed to go by default, and no one would have been any the wiser. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council, when replying to this debate, explain why that schedule has been altered, and why, before the alterations have been submitted to Parliament, the press has been given information concerning them? There is too much of this kind of thing going on. The press receive reports of a private character before Parliament knows anything at all about them. I shall vote for the disallowance of this statutory rule, because I desire to&#39; see the second schedule to the War Census Act left as the Senate and Parliament passed it. If in that form it will not secure all the information the Government desire, they can bring down an amending schedule and let Parliament revise it. So long as I am a member of the Senate I shall be no party to any Committee of Parliament overriding its authority. </para>

                            <para>- It would die out if the War Committee and some other persons like the honorable senator, who is a typical opponent of all reform, had their way. The expression &#34;unimproved capital value of land&#34; is one which is thoroughly understood by any one who has taken an interest in this matter. It was with the unanimous approval of the Senate that subparagraph <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of paragraph 6 was amended in order to set out clearly and distinctly the unimproved capital value of the lands of the Commonwealth. I have an idea that some other Bill is coming behind this, for which this information will be valuable. Then sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">viii</inline> of that question dealt with the improvements on the land in order to give the community a clear knowledge of the capital value of all the land in the Commonwealth with the improvements thereon. Framed in that way the question could have been clearly understood by nineteentwentieths of those who give any attention to this matter, and, therefore, it did not require any alteration by the War Committee. We find, however, that under Statutory Rules No. 138, not only has the War Committee altered that subparagraph in the schedule, but it has completely re-arranged all the sub-paragraphs. It has put the least important first, and has endeavoured, apparently, to smother up this important question somewhere about the middle of the schedule. For instance, the first question now to be asked under the heading of property is, how much cash a person has in hand on the 30th June, 1915. </para>

If it referred to the cash in hand at the moment, a person might, perhaps, be able to answer it; but, as the question is now framed, it will be utterly impossible for a man to say how much money he had in hand or in his pocket on the 30th June, 1915. The subparagraph dealing with the value of land and improvements now appears as No. xi., and as it is framed a person is asked to give the value of his land, inclusive of improvements, while sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> asks for the value of the land, exclusive of improvements. It is not now proposed to show in detail, as was decided by the Senate, the value of the land apart from the value of the improvements. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Schedules have appeared in many Bills which have been discussed since I have been a member of this Parliament, but the power to alter them has been contained in the measures to which they have been attached. Before the War Census Bill was passed we were informed that the Attorney-General proposed to submit the schedules to the War Committee, even after Parliament had decided what they should contain.. When the Bill was under discussion in this Chamber several honorable senators resented that suggestion, and urged that the decision of Parliament as to what the schedules should contain should be final. </para>

If the Governor-General in Council wished to revise the schedules of the War Census Act the revision should have been referred to this Parliament, and not to the War Committee. I admit that the War Committee is a very necessary body to-day, but even if it made recommendations before this Government accepted them, and published them in the columns of the press, thus ignoring Parliament in two ways, it was their duty to submit the proposed  alterations to Parliament. The War Committee, which is the creation of &#60; a merely party arrangement, and was not appointed by Parliament- </para>

                            <para>- I shall give the honorable senator that grain of consolation. The Committee is not responsible to this Parliament. It has made a recommendation which the Government have immediately accepted without consulting Parliament; and, even after accepting it. the Government have not informed Parliament that they have done so, though they have published the information in the columns of the press. All this has been done despite the promise of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that any alterations made in the schedules to the War Census Act would be submitted for the approval of Parliament before they became operative. If honorable senators generally are prepared to stand this kind of treatment, I am not. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council might, in accordance with his promise, have submitted the alterations as the recommendations of the War Committee, for approval or rejection by the Senate. We have the alterations before us now, but they have been brought before us by a private member of the Senate, and not by a representative of the Government. I blame the Government in this matter for going behind the back of Parliament. I shall vote for the disallowance of the statutory rule if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will push his motion to a division. I do not see why the War Committee should become a super-Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care how many withdrawals are made. When an honorable senator stands up here, and says that this question would not have come before the Senate but for the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> the rules do not allow me to say that he deliberately misrepresents me. I leave honorable senators to form their own judgment of the matter. It will be remembered that, in distinct and clear language, I promised how the regulations would come before the Senate. My answer to-day is the same as the answer I gave on the 5th August, and the same as the statement I made on a previous occasion. </para>

                        may have made a mistake, but I knew well how any alterations would come before Parliament. I knew the only means by which they could be submitted. I took an opportunity to see that the regulations would be tabled before the Senate rose, in order that honorable senators might get the opportunity which they now have. I do not mind them taking advantage of the opportunity, but I do object to statements being made here, and spread broadcast throughout the country, that, but for the action of

                            <para>- If my honorable friend thinks that the rest of the electors of Australia have not as much intelligence as he has to read the return clearly, he is very much mistaken. When the schedule was before the Senate there was a good deal of discussion on it. It arose out of a. promise made in the other place by the Attorney-General, that the War Committee - would have power to alter the schedule, and I gave a promise here, that if any alterations were made the. Senate would have an opportunity to dealt with them. I do not make any promise lightly. If any honorable senator thought that I intended to convey the idea that when the War Committee had dealt with the schedule I would bring the amendments forward here for approval, I tell him, without wishing to give offence to the War Committee, that I am not prepared to exalt it to such a position that it will have a voice in legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The reason is that we have to put a number of questions to a great many persons in order to elicit certain information. To every question that is to be put, another question might easily be drafted, which would result in providing us with more information, but which would not put the inquiry more clearly to the individual. We have provided for a statement of the value of land exclusive of improvements, and for its value inclusive of improvements. If any honorable senator thinks that we had any intention of flouting the Senate, I can assure him that he is mistaken. This regulation would have been tabled to-day if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> had not spoken. The law provides that it must be laid on the table within a certain period. I regret that there has been any misunderstanding, and 1 still more regret these continual insinuations of underground practices- </para>

                            <para>- I wish the honorable senator to understand that I -&#62;do not desire to squabble over the matter. The Act provides that statutory rules shall be laid on the table of the Senate within a certain period, and honorable senators then have the right to refer them back to the Government if they wish to do so. If the War Committee or the Government have in any way altered the sense of the second schedule, the Senate will be perfectly justified in adopting that course. Not only has the decision of this Chamber been adhered to, but, in my judgment, that decision has been made much clearer,. I exceedingly regret the complaint which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> regarding this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I have just been thinking that there must be something peculiarly fatal about the preparation of a census so far as the Senate is concerned. I recollect proposals for the taking of a census having been brought forward here on two occasions, and on both they formed the subject of a spirited -debate. On the present occasion it seems to me that those who have criticised the Government have done so without giving close attention to the words of the Ministerial reply regarding this matter. I am under no incentive to. put the Minister&#39;s case for him. He has- already put it for himself. But I would direct attention to two words in his reply which I think effectually disposes of any suggestion that he has done other than he promised. He said - 1 understand that slight alterations were made in the list of questions and that the Government will gazette the altered provisions as regulations. </para>

                            <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council has carried out his promise. It seems to me that to the letter he has redeemed the assurance which he gave to the Senate. Turning to the other portions of the debate, I cannot get away from the idea that there is a feeling of resentment in this Chamber against the War Committee. Now what lias that innocent Committee done? In the first place I desire to point out that it is not a self-created body. It was constituted as the result of action on the part of honorable senators opposite who have to share in the responsibility connected with that act. </para>

                            <para>- My point is that that Committee did not create itself. Nor was it created by the Government. The Government, it is true, took the initiative in calling it into existence, but it was the members of this Parliament who, through their respective party rooms, were responsible for its creation. Not only did they indorse its creation, but they were told that it would be called upon to consider such matters- as the Government referred to it. In the course of events (he Government referred this matter to it, and told the Senate that they intended to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Individual members may have done so. There is no reason for the use of harsh words against the War Committee, though whether it will justify its existence remains to be seen. But this matter, having been referred to it by the Government, the Committee has considered it, and made a certain recommendation. That recommendation has been put forward in the belief that it constitutes an improvement on the schedule to the Bill. The matter having again come into the hands of the Government, the latter are bound to accept or reject it. The responsibility belongs to the Government, and, consequently, there is no foundation for the suggestion that the Committee is overriding the decision of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are not smothering up anything - not even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant. His</inline> first complaint is that the Committee has altered the order in which the questions were stated. That is perfectly true. Of course, I am not free to disclose what takes place in that Committee. But honorable senators do not suppose that, out of a mere idle freak, the Committee effected that alteration. As a matter of fact, it was made after consultation with the Statistician, and other officers who are familiar with the form in which schedules are prepared. There was a reason behind the action of the War Committee. We must recollect that, in preparing a schedule, there are other things to consider besides the question of unimproved land values, important though it may be. What the Senate desired when the Bill was under consideration here was a clear statement as to the unimproved capital value of the lands of Australia, and an equally clear statement as to the value of the improvements upon those lands. This information will be obtained as the result of the questions which will be put to the people. The owner of any land is asked to state the value of his land, and also the value of his improvements. Under the proposal approved by the War Committee, he will be asked to state the total value of his estates - including land and improvements - and also the value of his land only. By deducting one from the other, we shall get the third. I need hardly point out that the space provided on the war census papers is necessarily limited. That is a factor -which we have to consider. There are three things that we require to learn in connexion with this census, namely, the value of the lands in Australia, the value of the improvements upon those lands, and the value of the total wealth. </para>

                            <para>- Is my honorable friend concerned about an asterisk? There are three things it is necessary to obtain - the value of the land, the value of the improvements, and the total of those two put together. As the schedule left the Senate there was provision for only two of those, and to get the third it was necessary to add the two together. As the schedule has been approved by the Committee you will get the first two, and to get the third you will have to make a deduction. That is the only difference between the two questions. As a matter of fact, we shall get exactly the particulars that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> wants. And further, after having set out the total value of a man&#39;s property, you will be able immediately to proceed to find the total value of the lauded estates, and should the Government require later on to take action upon this information, it will be available, and there will be no delay. </para>

                            <para>- I think it will be admitted that it is desirable and important to know, when we are dealing with leaseholds, whether they are held from private estates or whether they are leases from the Crown. This is the second alteration which the War Committee made. This alteration does not mean that the value of leased lands will not be declared, because the owner will have to supply that information in the schedule in the form provided. A3 we sent the schedule out from this Chamber it would have been impossible to get a return giving information of that kind. It is necessary to have it, and certainly very desirable, if, on the information obtained by means of this Act, there is to be any subsequent legislation. I am not going to say that the War Committee prepared a perfect schedule, because members of that body are only human, but I think that it will take more than the unsupported assertion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> before the Senate will reverse the work done by the Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - It is to he deplored that practically every time honorable senators on this side of the Senate differ from the Government, Ministers should subject them to a  lecturette  on loyalty to the party. Surely we are not shackled to the extent that if a Government does wrong we cannot object. Certainly I am not in that position. </para>

He will find that my record is much better than his. However, that is not the question at issue, so why should we worry about it? The Vice-President of the Executive Council said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> had misrepresented him on this matter; but I carefully listened to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> and also to those made by the Minister, both to-day and on the occasion when the War Census Bill was before the Senate, and I thoroughly concur in the statement made to-day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> that Ave had what I regard as an assurance that nothing would be done to alter the schedules until Parliament was consulted, if Parliament could be consulted. In support of that statement, I want to read the following extract from a speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in the Senate when we were dealing with this matter itself in Committee - </para>

                            <para>- Yes, a very material alteration is made, and it is useless now for the Minister to say that he is giving Parliament an opportunity to discuss the matter, because the schedules have been sent out. I challenge the Minister to deny the statement. That being the case, how can the Minister tell us that we have the remedy in our own hands? We have a remedy, it is true;, but if we exercise our right we shall de* lay the taking of this census by at least a month or six weeks. If the Ministercommences to play trickery like this - because, in my opinion, it is nothing short of trickery - I shall certainly resent it. </para>

I moved that provision should be made in the schedule for an exemption of contributions to friendly societies&#39; funds. After the midnight adjournment, and after hours of debate in which most members of the Senate took part, the Vice-President of the Executive Council accepted my amendment. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter what the honorable senator tried to do; the fact remains that he accepted my amendment, and the Senate decided to include in the deductions which might be made contributions to friendly societies. Having accepted that amendment, the Minister, by means of the War Committee, has flouted the deliberate decision of the Senate. That is not fair. I have the War Census Act as passed by the Senate before me, and I find that in the second schedule/ amongst the list of deductions which may be made, there is the line &#34; Contributions to friendly societies.&#34; In the provisional regulations, on which the amended schedule, which has already been sent out to the people, is founded, there is no reference whatever to contributions to friendly societies. If I had not regarded that as an important matter, and if honorable senators generally had not so regarded it, we should not have kept the Senate sitting until 3 o&#39;clock in the morning discussing it. After the Minister accepted the amendment, through the back door of the War Committee he evades the decision of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is now shifting his ground. The Senate fully discussed this matter, and received the promise of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that any recommendations for alterations made by the War Committee would be revised by this Chamber. But the Government have gone about this matter in such a way as to prevent Parliament revising1 the alterations that have been made. I say that we have no power to revise the altered schedule now. We can disallow this statutory rule, but that would only involve the useless expenditure of thousands of pounds. The papers have already been sent out to remote parts of the Commonwealth, and one of the schedules has been wholly printed. </para>

                            <para>- I think it ought to do so, but the result would be that through the bungling of the Government the census would be postponed for six weeks. There is another matter to which I wish to take exception in the revised schedule. There is a provision in the schedule to the War Census Act that premiums paid on insurance may be included amongst the deductions. That is as necessary as the inclusion amongst the deductions of contributions to friendly societies, but that has also been omitted. </para>

                            <para>- No, it is not. It was not on that point that we had the debate in the Senate, but as to the wisdom or otherwise of including in the list of deductions contributions to friendly societies. The Senate decided that  they  should be included; the War Committee has excluded them, and the Vice-President of the .Executive Council has not fulfilled his promise. The Government have in this matter ignored the Senate. They have recognised as a super-Parliament a War Committee that is not responsible to Parliament. I am certainly not going to agree to anything of this sort. Whether the representatives of the Government in this chamber like it or not, and whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> desires to deliver lecturettes  on loyalty to party or not, so far as I am concerned, if a Government does anything that I think is underhand, is not clean and above board, in order to circumvent a decision of the Senate, that Government will never have ray support. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that a very good case has been made out for entering a protest against the attitude which the Government have taken up with respect to the schedule to the War Census Act. Honorable senators who were present at the all-night sitting when the Bill was under discussion will recollect the unbending attitude which representatives of the Government in this Chamber took up towards any amendments proposed in Committee. They must recognise also the great difference there is between the&#62; stiffness the Government exhibited on that occasion and the agreeable and easy manner in which apparently they have accepted suggestions from this super-Parliament, this War Committee, whose duties are so undefined that no one can say what  they  are. When the War Census Bill was before the Senate the Government demanded the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill. The slightest alteration suggested was violently resisted and refused, and it required an all-night sitting to induce the Vice-President of the Executive Council to accept any amendment of the measure. If the Government wish to be fair to their own supporters they should not take up such an unbending attitude when suggestions are made from their own side. No one really knows what the War Committee was called into existence for, or what it may do or leave undone. Apparently, it may usurp the functions of the Senate, and also of the other branch of the Federal Legislature, and the Government, in the most agreeable way possible, accept its recommendations without protest. After an  all-night  sitting of the Senate, an alteration was effected in the second schedule as submitted, but it has since been submitted to the super-Parliament, and it comes back here now with other alterations. </para>

                            <para>- -I question that statement. I believe that the schedule, as amended in accordance with the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> was much clearer than we have it now. Why should there be so much opposition shown to a question intended to elicit clearly and definitely the unimproved value of land in the Commonwealth? Why should any attempt be made by one party or the other to confuse that issue? The unimproved value of land is a question which has agitated politics for many years, and yet I will defy any one to point to statistics of the States or of the Commonwealth which will give clear information as to what that value is. We should be extremely careful in framing a clear question to discover the unimproved value of land in the Commonwealth through this war census. </para>

It may be due merely to the vanity of the War Committee that the schedule has been altered from the form agreed to in the Senate and in another place. This Committee, apparently, is to be in a position to put all our other institutions in the background. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government the War Committee is more powerful than the Senate. It will be remembered that we had to sit up all night and debate the second schedule in order to effect the slightest alteration. We were obliged to resort to a practice with which, I believe, most of us are loath to have anything &#34;to do, because it means the loss of a night&#39;s sleep. When the Bill was returned to the other House the Government caved in, and agreed to our amendments, and afterwards the schedule was referred to an undefinable Committee. What business the Committee has in hand the Lord only knows, because nobody else does. It would need a clairvoyant to throw the slightest light on the nature of its functions. As regards its work, its duties, and its powers, nobody seems to have any knowledge. It is at the beginning of its career. Before we establish a precedent we ought to exercise great care as to what we are prepared to permit the War Committee to do. I, for one, am not prepared to concede to the War Committee the privilege of reviewing the legislation of this ^Parliament. Any honorable senator who permits himself to be juggled into that position will be taking up. not only a very foolish attitude, but a very dangerous one. He will be conceding to the War Committee powers which we have not the right to give away. We were sent here with full authority as legislators. We have not been given the right to delegate our powers to any Committee which may be created. I protest as vigorously and as definitely as I can against any revising work of this kind being undertaken by the War Committee. We are on the eve of a long adjournment. If the Committee has power to do such things while Parliament is in session, what may it not do during a long adjournment? It will run, not only the Government, but the whole affairs of the country. In any case, what have the alterations in the second schedule to the War Census Act to do with war? It will be remembered that while the measure was under consideration I was obliged to make wild guesses in order to extract the slightest knowledge as to what use was to be made of the statistics. In the first instance, I made what the Vice-President of the Executive Council described as a rash statement. I said that probably a certain thing would be done with the statistics, and he remarked that I was entirely wrong. Then, in order to extract some information, I made another wild guess, if anything wilder than the former guess. So we endeavoured to find out the use to which the statistics were likely to be put, but we could not get any information, and we are still in that position. </para>

                            <para>- No ; I would rather take to myself the discredit of not having the mental capacity to understand. Seeing that we are still in so much doubt as to the use to be made of the census, it behoves us to review with exceeding care the work of the War Committee. What it may do in the future if its first act is permitted to pass here without a protest, it is difficult to imagine. When it has blundered into a serious position, and the country is, perhaps, hostile to its acts, and I am asked by my constituents to say why I allowed the Committee to be created, or to do this, that, and the other thing, what explanation can I make? A position may be brought about which no one anticipated when the appointment of the Committee was first suggested. Regarding the alterations which have been made, I do not see any important improvement in the schedule. In Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> brought forward avery definite question, and, at his suggestion, it. was placed in the schedule. Why should the honorable senator, who devotes the most of his time to the question of land taxation, be robbed of the glory of having effected an alteration in the schedule ? I recognise that the census should be compiled on clear and definite lines. Seeing that a very large sum of public money is to be spent on this effort to get information which has never been secured before, we should take care that the questions put to the public shall elicit definite replies. In my opinion, it was foolish and wrong on the part of the Government to agree to the alterations made in the circumstances, especially having regard to their unbending attitude when the Bill was under discussion here. </para>

                            <para>- How did the Committee come into existence - did it grow, like Topsy? It is impossible for any one to say that the Committee came into existence without the consent of both Houses. Whether it was brought into existence by a formal resolution or by the selection of individual members, it was agreed that a certain number of members should be taken from each House and from each party. The War Committee came into existence with the full cognisance of Parliament, although it may not have approved of the Committee assuming certain powers. Honorable senators have asked what is its constitution, and what are its powers. It is a very good thing that its powers were not defined, otherwise we might have found ourselves with a body which would be able to dictate to Parliament its own opinion regarding certain matters placed under its jurisdiction. In this case, understand the Government consulted the War Committee. It was stated in the debate on the War Census Bill that they would take that course. Whether it was due to the influence of the Committee or not, the Government, who are the responsible body, consulted the Committee, and accepted certain recommendations, perhaps with modifications. The Government, as representative of the dominant party in politics, have approved of the regulations. It was pointed out clearly to honorable senators that clause 8 of the War Census Bill gave great powers to the Government of the day to make modifications and alterations, and that the only opportunity which eitherHouse would have to hold up any regulations would be by a member taking the course which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has taken. It ought to be clear to honorable senators, as the result of this debate, that it is a fatal mistake to empower the Government to legislate by means of regulations in a direction directly opposite to, or considerably different from, the determination of Parliament. We assumed at the time that the schedules were the best which Parliament could adopt. At the same time we agreed to section 8, which provides that the forms required to be filled in shall be in accordance with the forms of the first and second schedules to the Act, with such modifications or additions as are prescribed. I submit that amy determination by Parliament ought not to be altered by the Government except through Parliament. If this debate has no other result than to cause honorable senators to recognise the dangerous ground upon which we are treading when we allow our deliberate judgment to be thus overridden, it will have accomplished same- good. Until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> spoke, I was not aware that the schedules to the Act have already been distributed broadcast throughout the country. As that has been done, we are necessarily impaled on the horns of a dilemma. Either we must get fresh schedules printed and distributed - in which ease confusion may possibly arise in the minds of electors as to the particular schedules: they are expected to fillin. </para>

Then the decision of Parliament in respect of the, exemption from taxation of contributions to pension or superannuation funds has been disregarded. That provision was inserted as the result of a long and strenuous debate in this chamber. We exempted from taxation contributions to. pension or superannuation funds, and also to friendly societies.

                            <para>- I am not in the confidence of the Government, and therefore cannot say. My point is. that the desired information will be supplied in the census returns, though not in the particular form which the honorable senator desires. I think that the abrogation of the decision of the Senate in regard to contributions to friendly societies is an important question. Ought we to accept the regulation in the form in which it now stands, or ought we to reject it, and thus cause delay and loss to the Commonwealth ? If the matter be one of urgency the Government should obtain the authority of Parliament to deduct the contributions paid to friendly societies from the amount shown as the wealth of any particular member of the community. We all assume that the expenditure of &#163;150,000 which will be incurred in the taking of this census- </para>

                            <para>.- No. But if Parliament is to rise in the course of a week or so, it is obvious that we cannot deal with the matter in the way that we might otherwise deal with it. If, for example, a wealth tax is at the bottom of it, we cannot deal with that question. If we throw out this regulation, will not the Government procure the requisite information in connexion with the imposition of a wealth tax quite as early as will be necessary ? Ministers talk of going into recess within a week or ten days. If we do so we shall have no opportunity of dealing with this return, and Parliament will not be likely to meet again for some months - possibly not until after the New Year. Personally, I hope that there will be no need for it to re-assemble before the New Year. The Government have told us how they intend to finance matters during the current financial year. They have submitted their income-tax proposals, which embody the additional taxation that they regard as necessary at the present time. Surely five or six months hence will be soon enough for them to take in hand the imposition of a wealth tax if the circumstances of the occasion then demand it. I fail to see any great urgency in connexion with this matter, and I think that honorable senators might fairly throw this regulation on one side, seeing that it is imperfect and that it ignores the decision of this Chamber in regard to contributions to friendly societies. If the framing of these regulations had been delayed till Parliament was in recess, we should have been absolutely powerless. In other words, the Government would have been in a position to do exactly what they liked. If Parliament is going to preserve its own rights, it ought not to acquiesce in a provision similar to that which is contained in section 8 of the Act. </para>

Some honorable senators appear to be under the impression that Ministers alone are responsible for what has been done. </para>

                    <para class="block">Others, again, have risen to attack the War Committee. I am a member of that Committee, and when an attack is made upon me I would be less than human if I did not rise in my place, to defend my actions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was very anxious to know what are the functions of that Committee. He stated that the Senate is absolutely in the dark in respect to its workings. I am sorry that the honorable senator is not in his place, because he knows perfectly well - I do not suppose anybody in this Chamber knows better - what are the functions of that body. Yet he professed not to know them. That is what annoys me. Who appointed this Committee? Who appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> and myself members of it? The answer is: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and other members of this Chamber - other members of the Labour party. </para>

That is not playing the game; and when a man does not play the game I will give him one to go on with. Every member of the Labour party knows that the War Committee is powerless to do anything until it is asked to undertake certain work by the Government of the day. Who elected the Government of the day? Who but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan, Senator Needham,</inline> and other members of the Labour party? And members of the Labour party knew that when the War Committee assembled, the  chairman  for the time being would be the responsible Minister, who would submit business for the Committee&#39;s consideration. Members of the Labour party were told that, and if they do not remember it, it is not my fault. </para>

                            <para>- Dealing now with the war census, some honorable senators have said that there is no improvement in the schedules as they left the hands of the War Committee, compared with the schedules as they left the Senate. I venture to say, however, that the two honorable senators who take this stand have not taken the trouble to compare the schedules. I ask any fair-minded member of this Senate to get the Bill  containing  the two schedules as agreed to by the Senate, and compare them with the schedules in their completed form as agreed to by the Government. If they do that, they can come to no other conclusion than that they are a distinct improvement. We have beer told also that the War Committee is a sort of super-Parliament. It is an honorary Committee, the members of which give their time without fee or reward, and with the one desire to do their best in the interests of Australia and in defence of the Empire at this critical period of our existence; but to judge by the utterances of some members of this Chamber, one would think they were actuated by some ulterior motive, and desired to amend the schedules in such a way that it would be impossible for the people to give accurate information. </para>

                            <para>- The schedule that was referred to the Committee was considered in a business-like way. Will any honorable senator say that an assemblage as large as this Senate could deal with the details of such a schedule as quickly and in such a business-like way, as a small Committee, which set out for that specific purpose? I want to point out also that after the Committee had dealt with the matter it was powerless to do anything other than to get an assurance from the Government that the proposed alterations would be considered. It was for the Government to accept or reject the alterations, and the Government, in their wisdom accepted them. The Government could have said, &#34;We refuse to indorse or accept these recommendations.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter if 50,000 have gone out. Parliament can disallow them, if the majority of members are of the opinion that they should be1 disallowed. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> says we must be careful with respect to this War Committee, and with respect to statutory rules, because, supposing they were framed during the recess, we would be powerless to do anything. Of course, we would; but does the honorable senator desire that Parliament should he specially convened to consider statutory rules framed during recess? At ail events, I do not, and I venture to say that not every member of the Senate reads all the statutory rules that are printed and circulated from time to time. After all, the real reason for the discussion this afternoon was simply that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> took exception to the way in which two questions were placed on schedule No. 2. They were put differently from the way in which he desired to ask certain information; but I cannot understand why any solid objection should be taken to those questions as they appear now. I am as keen as any other member of this Chamber to get at the information regarding the value of the unimproved land in Australia. </para>

I hope, have an opportunity of perusing the personal schedules of individuals in the Commonwealth. I will not be a party to doing anything to satisfy an idle curiosity. In the question, as it appears now, it is quite clear that the value, exclusive of improvements, means the value of the land. To whom will these schedules be sent? </para>

                            <para>- I do not know who is making this speech. There is in the Commonwealth an organization known as the Single Tax League. It is composed of gentlemen who give very serious consideration to the land question. In travelling round Australia, and particularly in Victoria, I have met a number of these gentlemen, especially in the border towns. They are without doubt men anxious to bring about reform, but of all the bigoted men in Christendom, commend me to the single taxers. They are bigoted in the sense that they believe that no question is worthy of consideration but the single-tax question, and that no man knows anything of economics unless he is a single taxer. </para>

I feel that in this matter the Government have one desire only, and that is to secure the fullest information through the war census. It would appear that some honorable senators consider it their special duty and privilege to have a &#34; go &#34; at the Government whenever an opportunity presents itself. I do not mind having a &#34;go&#34; at the Government when I think they deserve to be criticised. But there is no warrant. for the attack made upon the Government to-day. As a member of the War Committee, I resent the references which have been made to that body. I am certain that every member of the Committee, whether he belongs to the Labour party or to the Liberal party, will be loyal to every other member of it. </para>

During his outburst he expressed his astonishment that he should himself have risen to speak on the motion. I think that we are all somewhat astonished, from the remarks he has made, that he did think it necessary to rise, I have come to the conclusion that he was only manifesting the perfervid enthusiasm of the recent convert. I have a very vivid recollection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> on more than one occasion in this Chamber, being most jealous of the rights of the Senate and of Parliament. I have heard him criticise more than once the extensive powers given to Governments by regulations. I heard the honorable senator, in connexion with this Bill, and right beside my ear, speak of the enormous advantage which would accrue from the passing of the War Census Bill, if certain questions were included in the schedules, because the result would be that each member of this Parliament would be supplied with vast information upon details about which we now have little or none. He said that it was his desire that the Bill should be made the means of supplying a great amount of information which would be of value to honorable senators in connexion with municipal activities, amongst other things. Now he tells <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> that he will not be one who, by means of the schedules to the Act, will obtain information for honorable senators. </para>

Perhaps some other honorable senators are in the same position. I have said that the honorable senator has given us an example of the perfervid enthusiasm of the recent convert. It seems to me that since he became a member of the War Committee he has viewed the matter with which we have dealt this afternoon in a different light. I wish to say here and now that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> persists with his motion I propose to support if. I shall not support it for the reasons given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> though!! recognise that in regard to the matter he has dealt with there has been a deviation, from the original schedule. I do not think that it is as material or substantial as the honorable senator would have us believe. But there have been other material and substantial deviations from the schedule of the War Census Bill as it wa3 passed by Parliament. These have been sufficient in number and importance to warrant us in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> motion, and having the second schedule, if the Government think that desirable, again remitted to the War Committee. There could be no mistake on the part of the Government as to the tone and temper of Parliament with respect to the form which the schedules to the War Census Bill should take. The matter was fully discussed in another place, and it was discussed here throughout the night. The Government must have marked the persistence with which some honorable senators endeavoured to have certain provisions incorporated in the second schedule. They must have realized that the Senate felt strongly about the form of the schedule. We all knew that it was to go before the War Committee, because the Vice-President of the Executive Council frankly informed us to that effect, but he mentioned that the Senate would have an opportunity to revise the work of the War Committee should  it alter the schedule. We have that opportunity now. It has been suggested that the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not take the proper course, because he did not in some direct way bring under the notice of the Senate the alterations made by the War Committee. I do not go so far as that, but I say that if these schedules have been printed in hundreds of thousands- </para>

                            <para>- And have been sent out, the Government should have been mindful of the fact that at any time within fourteen days from the day on which statutory rules are tabled they may be annulled. The Government must be responsible for not having regard to that fact. If they have sent out the schedules without adverting to that fact, it is inattention on their part. If they have sent them out after adverting to that fact, it is on their part daring, since they have taken the risk of the annulment of the statutory rules by the House of Representatives or by the Senate. Honorable senators should bear in mind that these statutory rules may be annulled, not by an Act of Parliament, not by a joint resolution of both Houses, but by a resolution of either House within fourteen days from the time they are tabled. These statutory rules have been tabled, and are in provisional operation until fourteen days have elapsed, but within that time it is competent for either the Senate or the House of Representatives to annul them. Until that time has elapsed the Government take that risk, and that is their affair. I do not know why we should be bound by that. If the second schedule is again modified, it may be that the modification will be of such a character, from a printing point of view, that it may be telegraphed throughout the Commonwealth, and the schedules altered accordingly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has referred to the first item on page 3, &#34; Cash in hand on 30th June, 1915.&#34; I doubt if very many persons will be able to honestly declare what cash they had in hand on that date. How many members of the Senate, for instance, will be able to say what cash they had in hand then? </para>

                            <para>- In order to be technically correct, let me say that the War Committee recommended going back, and the Government accepted the recommendation, and thereby went in direct contradiction to what the Senate sat up all night to assert. That is the position, and, to use the eloquent phraseology of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> &#34;Are we going to take it lying down?&#34; Again, as the War Census Bill left the Senate we had this item in the second schedule - &#34;Property. - What was the approximate value of real and personal property owned or held by you in Australia at 31st December, 1914?&#34; </para>

                    <para class="block">The item comprised eleven divisions of property. But now in what I, for convenience&#39; sake, although it may not be exactly correct, call the War Committee&#39;s schedule, the date has been altered to the 30th June, 1915. What is the significance of that alteration? When the Bill was introduced to Parliament the date was 30th June, 1915. The date was criticised in the other House, but it was agreed that all the returns should be made up to the 30th June of this year. In my second reading speech I suggested that the date should be altered to the 31st December, 1914. The Minister said - that he himself was going to make that alteration, and it was made here with the full concurrence of the Senate, and adopted by the other House. As the law stood, the 31st December, 1914, was to be the date in respect to which the returns were to be made. But the new schedule makes the date again 30th June, 1915. One of the reasons why the earlier date appealed to so many persons as being the more suitable date was that in several of the States the income tax returns had been made up as to that date, and that it would obviate the necessity of making up separate returns to the 30th June, 1915. The return to the 30th June, 1915, I consider a very serious deviation from the schedule as it passed both Houses. </para>
                    <para>When the Bill was under consideration <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> whom I. must say the two Ministers met, very considerately pointed out that there are a number of cases in which the trustees of estates are obliged by the law of the State to make returns to the Court, and that those returns have to be made, say, twelve months after probate was granted or letters of administration issued. It. may so happen that a return was made in May or April last, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> suggested that the last return of that kind should be accepted irrespective of whether the 31st December,. 1914, or the 30th June, 1915, was to be taken as the ordinary date, and Ministers, without expressly saying so in words, promised to give favorable consideration to the suggestion. That promise was made before our dinner adjournment that evening, and later it was pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that probably the War Committee would have regard to it. What has been done? On page 3 of the provisional rule there appears at the end of the first schedule these words: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Note. - With respect to trade assets and liabilities only, the particulars as per the latest balancing date since the 30th June, 1914, and prior to 23rd July, 1915, may be used for the purposes of this schedule. , </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That is very much more restricted than what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> indicated, and it is very much more restricted than the occasion demands. It is not only in relation to trade assets and liabilities that those accounts are filed. One of the bonds entered into by an executor or administrator is that, within six or twelve months from the grant of probate or the issue of letters of administration, and thereafter regularly, he will file an account of the estate in the Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> asked that in all those instances the last account should be taken. That does not apply merely to the estate of a trader. The paragraph is now restricted to trade assets and liabilities. Besides the cases of the estates of deceased persons there are institutions and companies which have their accounts made up to a certain date periodically. I think that consideration might have been had to their position, and they might have been given the opportunity of filing their last statement within a certain limit nearest to the date which is ultimately adopted in the schedule. It is for these reasons that I think that, though there may be improvements in some particulars in the schedule, the improvements are counterbalanced by the defects. They are counterbalanced by the disadvantages which had been produced and are likely to arise from the alterations. I intend to support the motion. </para>

They are here to support the Government when they believe that the Government are right. They are not here to support the Government when they believe that the Government are wrong. They believe that in this case the Government are wrong; at least, I do. I do not usually take exception to such remarks, but the Minister went on to state that he was getting far more support from the members of the Opposition than from members of our party. It is a bad look-out for a Government who are in that position, especially when they have a large &#34; number of supporters on their own side. When they are able to say that they are getting more support from members of the Opposition, what does it mean ? It only means that, in the opinion of members of the Opposition, &#163;he Government are playing the game of the Opposition - and he knows that as well as I do. </para>

                            <para>- It was not on the war question, but on the general question that the Minister was speaking. It was on the question of the general support which the Government were getting from members of the Liberal party. I object to that sort of slur being thrown at the members of the Labour party. I believe that the members of the Labour party are here to carry out its policy, not only in connexion with their general platform, but in connexion with the war, and they are prepared to support the Government in carrying out that policy. </para>

                            <para>- A Government is in a bad way when a Minister is able to get up and say to the members of his party that the Government are getting better support from the members of the Opposition than from their own side. I do not go back on that statement for a moment. The honorable senator wants, to tie down the remark of the Minister to the question of the war, but it was nothing of the sort. It&#39; was a general statement, and one quite independent of the question that is now under consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> appeared to be very touchy upon the question of the functions of the War Committee, and incidentally he went for single-taxers as a lot of bigoted creatures. Now, I have always understood that the honorable senator himself was a single-taxer, and that he was claimed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> as a brother of the faith. I can quite understand the advocates of the single-tax being shaken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> but I think that such a shaking up would have come a long way better from somebody who was not a member of the single-tax organization.&#34; I am not a member of any such organization, and I have never professed to believe in the single tax. </para>

                                seemed to be under a misapprehension in respect to the constitution of the War Committee. He said that Parliament had appointed that Committee, and had marked out its functions. Parliament did nothing of the sort. As the result of an agitation throughout the length and breadth of Australia some time ago, a feeling appeared to be growing that a coalition Government should be formed in the Commonwealth for the duration of the war, just as similar Governments have been formed in Great Britain and New Zealand. I am not one of those who believe in such a coalition. But as there was a considerable amount of work to be done - more than the Minister of Defence could cope with - the idea was formed outside the walls of Parliament that a Committee should be constituted, consisting of an equal number of members from both political parties, to deal with matters which might be referred to. it by the Government. The question was not mentioned to Parliament at all.

                            <para>- Not before the whole thing had been arranged. As a matter of fact, a question was asked by the Leader of the Opposition in another place as to the election of this Committee by Parliament. Anybody who chooses to look up Hansard can verify that fact for himself. Originally the idea was that the Committee should be elected by the Parliament. Later on, however, it was thought that it would be better to have a Committee composed of an equal number of members from both political parties, with the Minister to preside over its deliberations. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators know perfectly well why the Committee was not appointed by Parliament. It was generally understood that that body would have certain matters of administration submitted to it in respect to which it would make recommendations to the Government. The latter were to be free to accept or reject recommendations. But nobody ever dreamed that the Committee would make recommendations in regard to the alteration of Acts of Parliament. In one respect, I admit that it has done good work, namely, in separating leaseholds from private individuals from leaseholds from the Crown. </para>

It never for a moment struck me that they had been expressly omitted from the schedule, and,  accordingly, I consulted the Vice-President of the Executive Council on the subject.

I left the chamber some time after 11 o&#39;clock that evening. Before my departure,  I  said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> &#34; You are interested in this matter just as much as  I  am. I think that we ought to endeavour to secure the inclusion amongst the exemptions of contributions to friendly societies. Will you see it through?&#34; Next morning  I  was surprised to read in the newspapers that the Senate had sat pretty well all night.  I  thought that the Government would have accepted the proposal- </para>

                            <para>- The War Committee might have found reasons for altering it, or even for altering the Act itself, if the Act had been submitted to it for its consideration. The Committee is evidently under the impression that members of friendly societies do not count as compared with those persons who contribute to pension and superannuation funds. The Minister of Defence has just pointed out to me that before the War Committee was created he made an announcement concerning it in this Chamber which will be found reported in <inline font-style="italic">nansard</inline> of the present  session, page 4671. When we realize the enormous benefits which are conferred by friendly societies, we can readily appreciate why honorable senators take exception to the War Committee, or the Government, amending an Act of Parliament without first causing the regulations affecting them to be submitted to the Legislature. We find according to the last <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Book,</inline> that in the various States of the Commonwealth there were 476,993 members of friendly societies in actual benefit. </para>

                            <para>- I presume they do. We find also that the expenditure for sick pay, medical attendance, and other services, involved an expenditure in 1915 of &#163;1,456,000. 1  contend that the people who belong to such societies are deserving of consideration at the hands of the Government, and, moreover, the Government accepted the particular question relating to them. On that ground, therefore, I intend to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> motion. There is no reason at all why such exemption should not be allowed just as it is allowed with regard to payment&#174; into a superannuation fund, because a member of a friendly society pays all the time, from year&#39;s end to year&#39;s end, to protect himself and his family against the time when illness may overtake him . </para>

It seems that we were right in making that amendment, and the Government were wrong in allowing the War Committee to alter it. There is another matter upon which I should like some information, and here let me say that when the Vice-President of the Executive Council rose to address the Senate, he must have known the whole of the alterations that had been recommended by the War Committee, and he should have explained why they had been made. We would then have understood the position exactly. The Minister, however, referred to two small Hues in the schedule, and did not give the Senate any information concerning the other alterations, or the reason why. the Government accepted them. </para>

But we are not in the habit of asking the honorable senator if any discussion we originate is justifiable or not, and we do not say that any discussion he originates is unjustifiable, because he must be the best judge of that. So it is with us. Now he says that it is not usual to give reasons for an alteration of a measure agreed to by the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- Whether he calls it statutory rules or not, he cannot get away from the fact that this is an alteration of an Act of Parliament. As we passed this Act, it was provided that the income was to mean the amount received during the twelve months ending the 31st December, 1914, including stipend, salary, or wages. If honorable senators will look at the schedule as now presented they will see that something has been left out, and that an Act of Parliament has been amended again, because in the second schedule we provided for information regarding income from fees, commissions, or bonuses. That was a very fair question to put, but yet we find that the War Committee did not see any necessity to get information with regard to bonuses. </para>

                            <para>- But is it not just as well to have information furnished in a manner provided by Parliament % What I object to is that the Government should try to alter Acts of Parliament by regulation. It is true this was considered by the War Committee, and I believe the Committee gave its best consideration to the matters placed before it. But when we pass a special law providing the machinery to &#34;obtain information in a certain way, it is not right that alterations should be made by any irresponsible body. This omission of the word &#34; bonus &#34; is important because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> knows, in mining ventures in the north of Queensland, many years ago, oftentimes after declaring a dividend, an annual bonus was declared, and yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> one of the &#34; war lords,&#34; now says this money received as a bonus would be included .in &#34;other sources&#34; of income. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> it appears, considers himself called upon to defend the Government t&#93;&#39;om attacks by members who sit on this side of the chamber. But I would point out that there have been no attacks on the Government at all, but upon these &#34; war lords,&#34; of whom the honorable senator is one. I am not quarrelling with the honorable senator on that account, but I am objecting that any Committee or Government should, by regulation, alter any Act of Parliament approved by this Senate. </para>

                    <para class="block">Action of the Government in printing and sending out the forms. Yesterday, I asked if the information in the press to the effect that the schedules had been printed, and that the census would be taken shortly, was correct, and the Minister replied, &#34; Yes.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> made inquiries, and found out that not &#39;only were the schedules printed, but that they had been sent to the outlying portions of Australia. Therefore, we really have not had an opportunity to deal with this matter at all, and I want to know whether this is the kind of action that should be taken by a Government that is going to trust Parliament? I am satisfied that had these matters come before Parliament, the alterations would not have been agreed to. Parliament now has practically no redress. It seems that Parliament is expected to swallow this schedule, as altered by the War Committee, unless it is prepared to order the return of the schedules that have been sent out, and if that is done, there will be an enormous bill to meet on account of the printing. I am prepared to take the responsibility of that. I intend to vote for the disallowance of this regulation. We were told that the schedules were to be considered by the War Committee, and that we should subsequently have an opportunity to consider any alterations made in them before they were sent out to the people. As a matter of fact, we know that through the action_ of&#39; the Government in permitting the schedules, as amended, to be sent out. we are deprived of that opportunity. I am sorry that they should have taken such action. It should make honorable senators only the more jealous of the powers of the Senate and more careful about delegating them to any irresponsible Committee such as the War Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not going to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> motion, and, having stated that, perhaps the few words I intend to say will be received by the Administration and by honorable members of the Senate as not being offered in a caustic or vitriolic spirit. In my opinion, the War Committee is capable of doing very good work. In some respects it has done good work in connexion with the schedule to the War Census Act. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee is quite satisfactory. I think that it i3 rather an unwieldy Committee, but that is no reflection upon the <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline> I think, that too much of the war business is being- conducted along debating society lines. It is laid down as ah axiom by historians- of great wars that if the conduct of a war is left to one or two &#34;men, the result may be disastrous, but it is possible that the makings of a Napoleon Bonaparte or a great commander may be discovered who will be able to bring the war to a successful conclusion. These historians also lay it down that wars are never successfully waged by debating societies-. It is- because I wish to. see everything connected with the war in which we are at present engaged done speedily that I shall not vote for the motion, which would result in the recall of the schedules which have already been posted. The Administration have acted in connexion with this matter, I will not say unwisely, but a little injudiciously. Although they were technically within their rights in securing certain modifications of the schedule, I think it was clearly the intention of the Legislature not to permit the elimination of anything which had been so newly enacted. It was understood that the schedules as passed by Parliament might be amplified, but that nothing should&#39; be eliminated from them. Ministers did not, I think, act with discretion in asking the War Committee to review practically new legislation. That is something which should not have been relegated to the War Committee. I have said that I believe that it is capable of doing excellent work. </para>

I was one who applauded it. It was established to focus the legislative efforts of this Parliament, and to assist the Government in the conduct of the war. The Committee will do good work, although I am positive that the Administration requires to exercise a little discretion in regard to the matters which it asks the Committee to inquire into. </para>

                    <para>SenatorBAKHAP. - It is remarkable that a measure like the War Census Act, hot from the legislative oven, so to speak, should have been sent to the War Committee for the purpose of revision. It contained a principle in the schedule for which honorable senators fought hard and suffered an all-night sitting, namely, the principle of permitting the members of friendly societies to deduct from their incomes contributions paid to their organization. For the Administration within a few days after that decision by the Senate to take it upon themselves to excise the provision is remarkable, and is a clear flouting of the intention of the Legislature. With the best wishes in the world for a successful outcome of the labours of the War Committee, and for the success of the efforts of the Government in their conduct of the war, I hope they will not adopt such a course again. They had the power to modify the schedule undoubtedly, but it was not the desire of Parliament that the War Committee should be permitted to completely eliminate from the schedule a principle adopted by the Senate as a body only a few days before. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying that the second schedule has not been improved in some respects. The honorable senator was probably not. present when I admitted that it has been improved. But I believe that it was not the intention of Parliament that any important principle should be eliminated, though it was understood that certain modifications might legitimately be made which would clarify the intention of the Legislature. It is going far beyond the limit to say that after the Senate had fought hard to secure the inclusion of a certain principle the Government should, within a few days, totally eliminate that important provision. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The question was hotly debated, and the Senatorial opinion collectively was most emphatic upon it. I hope that the Administration will not do this sort of thing again, as it is calculated to submit the work of the War Committee to quite unnecessary challenge. I do not care to see its work hindered by the carrying  of  such a motion as that submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> Personally, I prefer the term &#34; land value &#34; to the term &#34;unimproved value,&#34; and I believe that in this respect the Committee have improved the schedule. The Government will enable the Committee to do the best work by not asking it to immediately revise legislation, not a year or two years old, but not even a fortnight old. I am sorry that the provision including contributions  to  friendly societies in the deductions which might be made has been omitted from the schedule, but I am not going  to  boggle about the matter. If the war continues for a year or two the States  or  the Commonwealth will have to come  to  the assistance of friendly societies. That.  being so, the matter is comparatively trivial. As I believe in promptitude in the conduct of the war, I am prepared to shut my eyes to minor defects of the schedule 1&#34; shall vote against the motion in the hope that it will not be found necessary to recall the schedules which have already been posted. I hope that we shall  secure  information that will enable us to hurl at the enemy all our resources of men and material, in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Despatch is the motto &#39;for to-day. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened carefully to the prolonged discussion which has taken place on my motion. If I had heard any arguments that would justify &#39;me in withdrawing it I should do so; but neither the Vice-President of the Executive Council nor those who supported his view have given any reasons whatever for the action which the Government have taken on the recommendation of the War Committee. In submitting the motion, I reminded honorable senators of the form in which the second schedule appeared when it first came before us for consideration. The taxpayer was asked to furnish in one answer the total value of his land and property. On an amendment submitted by myself the Senate and the Government agreed that the taxpayer should be asked to disclose, first, the unimproved value of his land, and secondly, the value of the improvements  thereon  . </para>

                            <para>- I quite understand that; but I have no doubt that the Commonwealth Statistician will be able later on to furnish us with valuable information from this census. My point is that he could obtain it much more easily, and the taxpayer could fill in the second schedule more easily,  if it had been permitted to remain in the form in which the Senate and Parliament agreed to it. I pointed out that the sub-paragraph following will lead to some confusion, and that in the sub-paragraph dealing with leases the value of the improvements thereon is not separated, even in the present schedule, from the value of the leases. Those were my reasons for asking that the schedule be disallowed, with the intention that the Government should, as soon as possible, review the matter, and act in conformity with the wishes of the Senate. I was doubtful as to what the real work of the War Committee would be. I understood that it was to be a consultative body that, after the consideration of any matters referred to it, would make suggestions to the Government. It would be interesting to know why the Attorney-General refused to permit the first schedule to go before the War Committee. We have not been given any information on that point. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to accept the Minister&#39;s explanation, but I understand that the Attorney-General was quite emphatic in his  statement  that the first schedule was not to be touched by the War Committee. I do not blame the Government, in a way, for accepting the recommendations from that body, but they must take the consequences of such acceptance. The War Committee have flouted the almost unanimous decision of the Senate regarding the returns of land and property, and also the sub-paragraph relating to friendly societies. It may be urged that, because some printing has been done, therefore, on the score   of  economy, I should not press the motion to a division, but the mere fact that a few pounds have been expended - nothing like &#163;150,000 have been expended - and a few thousand forms have been distributed, ought not to prevent the Senate from expressing its opinion. I would like to know where the urgency lies in regard to this census. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council, or any other honorable senator, had shown that there was any extreme urgency in getting the returns, I would have hesitated before interfering in the slightest possible way with any action to organize our material resources in opposition to the enemy. No honorable senator has shown that there is any urgency in the matter. Therefore, both on the score of expense, and on the score of urgency, there is no reason why the Senate should not disallow the regulation. The remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> were very interesting, but somewhat wide of the mark. During the present session, we have not had an opportunity here to discuss the relative merits of land value taxation and other forms of taxation; but no doubt by-and-by, when we get that opportunity, we shall hear the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> In the meantime, that question is not before the Senate, and the fact that there are some honorable senators in favour of land value taxation, whilst others are opposed to its imposition, is no justification for this attempt to so amend the second schedule of the War Census Act as to make the returns more obscure than otherwise they would be. I am not prepared to say that the schedule as it left the Senate was as good as it could have been made. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to admit that it was not perfect at that time; but we were limited for space then, as we are now. The only item that is not set out in the column is that of land values. The rent, the furniture, the income, the cash in hand, in fact, every other item, is shown separately, and I want to know why the Government are determined to obscure the item of land values of the Commonwealth, which, I understand, amount to the (fairly substantial sum of about &#163;700,000,000? I am glad that this discussion has taken place. I hope that honorable senators will support my motion, and refuse to approve the action of the Government in issuing the schedules to the taxpayers before the Senate had an opportunity to express its opinion. I disagree altogether with. the action of the Government in that respect. In my opinion, they had no right to have the printing completed, and the matter partially distributed, before the regulation was approved by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>; - It is now some time since I addressed myself to this motion, and it will be remembered that on that occasion the Senate kindly granted me permission to resume my remarks on some future date, because at a late hour I had only opened the subject. To-night, I find myself in somewhat of a difficulty in that I suffer from an embarrassment of riches in respect of&#39; the arguments which I am able to adduce in support of my proposal. I do not anticipate that within a speech of even two hours&#39; duration I could exhaust one-tenth of the sound and solid arguments which might be advanced in support of the motion. Since I first addressed myself to it, I have been deluged with congratulatory correspondence in regard to it. Singular to say all persons writing in terms of congratulation have expressed themselves in most patriotic language, have shown that they are deadly in earnest, and, in addition, have granted me permission to use their names in connexion with any remarks that I may make on this subject at any time. </para>

                            <para>- I did receive one threatening communication - a letter threatening me with personal violence because of certain terms that I used in addressing myself to this subject. It was an anonymous, communication, and singular to say, nine-tenths of the correspondence which has reached me dealing, with my action in deprecatory terms, has been of an anonymous&#34; character. These letters have not only been anonymous, but abusive. I will admit that there are many persons opposed to conscription who are not afraid to declare their antagonism to it in courteous terms.. But strange to relate, the correspondence which has been addressed to me in an antagonistic vein has been scurrilous, to say the least of it, and in every case it has been anonymous. I do not propose to make an emotional appeal on behalf of conscription. I promised the Senate, when I opened this subject, that my address would be of a very matter-of-fact character, and that I would appeal to the reason of the nation rather than to its emotions. <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Ferricks,</inline> who, unfortunately, is absent this evening, and who is opposed to this proposal, handed me what he regards as a most conclusive- account of what transferred at an anti-conscription meeting in the township of Ayre, in Queensland. I refer to this gathering because of the arguments used at it by anti-conscriptionist speakers. A clerical gentleman - I believe a canon - stated that there should be no such thing as conscription, because one volunteer is worth ten pressed men. Loose, flamboyant assertions of that character were used to counteract the solid arguments which might be used every legislative day of the week in support of conscription as a national policy at this juncture, and one of the most necessary factors for determining the war in our favour. Now, our national conduct at the present time may bc characteristic of great national strength - may bc indicative of the fact that when we do more we shall move with the force and violence of giants - or it may point to the circumstance that we are an obtuse people, and do not see what it is necessary for us to do in order to secure unqualified victory. Does any man really believe that one volunteer is worth ten pressed men? Does anybody really believe that at this crisis in the Empire&#39;s fortunes one volunteer is worth two conscripted men? If he does, I go beyond the bounds of. courteous language which I usually observe, and say that he is a fool. </para>

                            <para>- Most decidedly; but some persons like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> fall into the mistake of assuming that our system is purely a voluntary, one. It is nothing of the sort, as I shall proceed to show. Instead of being a purely voluntary system, the fact is that in some respects we are justifying the Continental criticism that we are in some small degree hypocritical. Ours is not a voluntary system by any means, for pressure has been applied in dozens of directions with a view to making our men enlist. Outside bodies and State authorities are using pressure to do what? To compel men to enter the ranks of our Expeditionary Forces. I do not propose to weary honorable senators by dangling before them newspaper clippings, but they can rest assured that I am not making idle statements. I can give chapter and verse for every one of my statements. Our Harbor Trusts are saying that they will not engage .single men whose services, are required at the front. Is that a phase of a purely voluntary system, or is it the application of pressure? Managers of large business emporiums, large: stores, and large industrial enterprises ar&#38; in forming their men that if they do not volunteer it will be undesirable for them to present themselves for employment after the next pay-day. What sort of voluntarism is that? It is the exercise of pressure in a special manner by business men and State authorities who are doing what the nation should do. Trafalgar was a great naval victory, and so also was Copenhagen. Our British maritime supremacy was not achieved by fleets manned entirely by volunteers. Can it be claimed that the credit of the achievements of the British Navy is due to the voluntary system? What about the merchantmen who were raided by men-of-war right through the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, who had their crews taken away and hardly sufficient men left on board them to hoist the sail necessary to enable them to make port? Did not those men fight well? Did they not write their name in letters of gold on the pages of our maritime history? What about the press gang? What about the men who were fairly bludgeoned into service - who were picked up in all sorts of places and impressed? Did they fight well? History gives my answer. They did fight well, and in quite a number of cases the British Navy, for more than 100 years, was largely manned by pressed men. </para>

                    <para class="block">I ask, Did the men in South Africa uphold the glory of the voluntary system? Rome little time ago I mentioned that probably one of the greatest men in history had appeared in South Africa. I referred to General Botha before he had achieved that marked success lately reported in the conquering of the German South-West African Colony. I would ask those honorable senators who are sticklers for the voluntary system what kind of force was it that General Botha led ? Were they not conscript men? To use a familiar African phrase, they were &#34; on commando &#34; : that is to say, the nation had called them out for service, and they did magnificent service for their country, for did they not march through the  thornbush  and the sand 30 and 40 miles a day; did they not overcome the difficulties and dangers of poisoned wells, and beat the enemy that had recourse to every unchivalrous device; and did they not add as a fresh Dominion to the British Empire a tract of country which they have expressed themselves as determined to retain ? More power to them. The South African Army were, in fact, a conscripted force, and  they  achieved one of the most considerable land successes that the troops of the Empire have gained up to the present. After all, what is conscription but organization ? Do honorable senators subscribe to the opinion that a nation that is not, so to speak, armed and organized in every respect, is the equal of nations that have organized standing armies to uphold their respective cause ? Do they not believe that a standing army is superior to a loose, unorganized, although perhaps an armed and courageous mob ? That nation which is unorganized, be its people never so brave, will go down before the disciplined forces- of a fully organized enemy. Organization of the very best kind will be found to be necessary to enable our Empire to win through in this terrible world struggle, to reach a conclusion which is absolutely essential to our national existence and our Imperial continuance. Let us be defeated in this struggle, let it even end in an unsatisfactory manner, and of a surety to a considerable extent our prestige will suffer, and in the course of a few years there will be none so poor as to do us reverence. We have committed ourselves to see this struggle through, and we must employ every means at our disposal to achieve that object. I intend now to refer to coal, which is one of the essentials for the successful continuance of a war, and I trust honorable senators wilt bear with me a moment. One of the most reputable publications in the Old Country, the <inline font-style="italic">Fortnightly Review,</inline> the editor of which is a man of sound judgment, and the contributors to which are intelligent  men  with a thorough knowledge of the world&#39;s affairs, has something to say on this subject. .One of its contributors, a member of the Imperial Legislature, referring to the enlistment of skilled labour, says: -  </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Prime Minister added that these cases were illustrations which could easily be multiplied. In the same speech he pointed out that the shortage of labour in coal mining was a factor in the rise of the price of coal. He quoted the Board of Trade as  saying,  &#34; The quantity of coal at present being raised is not known; but ft considerable reduction can be inferred from the figures relating to employment. By December of last year, 13.9 per cent, of those employed in July in coal-mining were known to have joined the Forces, and their places have been filled to the extent of 3.4 per cent, only, leaving a net reduction of 10.5 per cent. As it is likely that, on the whole, the stronger and better class of men have enlisted, there is no doubt that the loss in working efficiency is greater than the actual figures themselves.&#34; He added for himself that the enlistment of coal-miners was &#34; a very creditable record.&#34; </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Yes, it was creditable to the miners, but not creditable to the statesmen of the Old Country - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>These things were said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> in a particular connexion, and from one point of view. I desire to direct attention to their general meaning in connexion with the problem of organizing the nation as a whole for war. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Owing to the fact that an unduly large enlistment of coal-miners had taken place, the price of coal rose several shillings per ton, and thus materially affected the position of tile Old Country as an organized nation in this struggle. Now I want to allude to the fact - it is now regrettably admitted - that a very large number of men who have enlisted in Kitchener&#39;s armies are married, men who flocked to the standard nine or twelve months ago. Statistics at present available show that the British losses in killed do not exceed 75,000 men, and, owing to the very large enlistment of married men, the birth rate in the Old Country at the present time is the lowest on record. I have a definite statement to the effect that the births in the United Kingdom are 1,500 per week less than they were during the corresponding period of last year. Now, 1,500 per week spread over a year gives a total greater than the total of killed at the front in the war up to the present. That is to say, the population of the Empire is less -6-v that total of unborn lives consequent on the lack of proper organization, as the result of which lack a considerable proportion of the enlistment in Kitchener&#39;s army comprised married men. Historians tell us that the Spartans, who made a trade and a national profession of war, recognised that in a nation of trained soldiers certain important effects would be noted ,in the social conditions of the community, and they adopted means which are not permissible in modern communities to remedy the evil thus created, for they regularly sent from the front delegations of men whose business it was to see that the national birth rate did not fall. The statesmen of a country, particularly of an unfilled country like Australia, ought to have some consideration of the social effects due to the indiscriminate enlistment of men in our Expeditionary Forces. In Australia, we have half a million men of an ideal military age - men who are not married - yet in the face of the situation as I have described it we continue the enlistment of married men. I hope that we will discuss this question&#39; irrespective of the political views of any honorable members of the Senate, and with the one object of bringing success to our. arms. I notice that the matter came under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hannan,</inline> a member of the other branch of the Legislature, some time ago, and he spoke in great alarm of a case that had occurred in his own electorate of a man who had lost his life at the front and had left a wife with a number of children behind him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hannan</inline> appeared to be astonished to find that this involved the community in the payment of a very large sum of money as compensation to the widow up to&#39; the time that the youngest child would reach the age of sixteen years; and it dawned upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hannan</inline> that this system of enlistment of married men when there is a multitude of single men available is not calculated to advance the best interests of the nation, or to enable us to wage this war on such an economic basis as to make victory a matter of additional certitude, if I may be permitted to use that phrase. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming,</inline> who holds the same political opinions as I do, also came forward with a similar case in his electorate, and mentioned the fact that a man who had lost his life in the service of his country had left behind him a wife and twelve children. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming,</inline> with the sun of common sense breaking through the clouds, made a calculation, and found that this case would cost the Commonwealth about &#163;4,000 in compensation before the youngest child would reach the age of sixteen years. I am not responsible for the calculations. I saw them in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> They were so attractive in regard to the point they gave to certain phases of the existing situation that they were reported in the daily press when Messrs. Hannan and Fleming spoke in another place. There is one argument, which I will admit is fairly effective, that will be used against this motion. I shall be told that it is the Old Country that is carrying on the war. There must be a head-quarters staff in the prosecution of any war, and, apart from any political aspects of the question, the Imperial Administration may be regarded as our head-quarters staff. If they do not consider conscription necessary at this juncture it may be contended that it would be futile and unnecessary for us to adopt the system. I admit that that is a fairly strong argument, but I do not admit that it is as strong as it appears to be on the surface. We are not altogether governed by the Old Country. We owe it affectionate and proper allegiance, and I am glad to say that we are quite prepared to render that affectionate and proper allegiance to the full. But we are not prepared to be legislated for at Westminster. We believe in having our own Parliament, in order that we may be able to give legislative expression to our national ideals, and provide along the best lines for our present needs, our Australian requirements. I believe that if Australia tomorrow adopted the principle of compulsory service in regard to operations overseas, organized itself systematically, prepared to wage war until the inevitable successful issue is arrived at, in the Old Country, where public opinion is rapidly hardening in the direction of giving legislative authority to compulsory service, that opinion would harden at an accelerated rate. I believe, in fact, that we should give the Old Country a lead. We have given the people of the Old Country a lead before. It should be remembered that Great Britain is hardly a Democracy in the Australian sense. We say that we are more democratic here; we have greater democratic privileges, and undoubtedly that is so. Although, like most Englishmen, we may love a lord, there is no Australian aristocracy. The Old Country is in some respects, if I may use terms that appear contradictory, an oligarchical Democracy. Many things difficult &#62;of  achievement  in England might be given legislative effect in Australia very speedily. Here we have compulsory education, compulsory enrolment, and we are going to have compulsory voting. Are we to apply the principle of compulsion in this democratic country in every direction, tout to hold off when it comes to a question of the .defence and salvation of the Empire, and the buttressing of our cause? On that question  compulsory  service is, we are invited to believe, an infringement of an alleged democratic principle. </para>

                            <para>- I say that there are not enough men going, and who will dare to say me nay ? We may eventually have to put 500,000 Australians into the field, or to send that many to the front, before the war is at an end. No one can tell when the Allies put forth all their strength what the waste of the human factor in war will be. We must be prepared to throw the whole of our resources into the scale. We may have to send men in far greater numbers than we at present dream of. It is not a counsel of perfection to say that we should get ready now, that we should be training these men, and preparing for the drain upon our resources. That is a matter of common sense. If we organize the forces of the nation, and call out 50,-000 or 100,000 men at the present juncture, who will say that that would be an error if it were subsequently found that it would be unnecessary to send them to the front? No one can deny that it would be a most desirable form of insurance, and a most sensible thing to do. I have supported the present Administration in regard to their war measures as earnestly and steadfastly as any of their political supporters have done, and I adjure them now to take time by the forelock, to take occasion in hand, and marry it, and prepare for calls greater in extent than even Imperial statesmen dream of at the present time. If we could say that the war would come to an end inside of six months, could any honorable senator say that that would be satisfactory, when not only is Poland occupied by the enemy, but other provinces of Russia; when practically the whole of the Kingdom of Belgium is still under the heel of the invader-; and when the Germans have sown 250,000 acres of French soil with crops that Frenchmen will not reap? Is the end of the war in sight? I tell honorable senators that, in my opinion, if we are to have the unqualified victory with which alone we should be satisfied, the war is only just beginning. If it is only just beginning now, do honorable senators not think that we should prepare, not to make war in driblets, but to throw the whole of our Forces into the scale ? Will honorable senators deny that if, when the war first started we took the step of calling out 100,000 -men, and gave them training, if only of the gymnasium and the barrack-yard kind, that the men who have gone to Gallipoli, brave as they have shown themselves to be, and marvellous as their achievements have been, would not be in the &#38;ame class, so far as physical fitness is concerned, as would men conscripted &#34;twelve months ago? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will do me the credit of conceding  that I have admitted that conscription is only one of the factors necessary to a successful issue of the war. In the last resort, men will be required. The war is being waged, for supremacy over mankind, and men in the last resort will dominate men.  President  Garfield said that no nation is worthy to be saved unless it will go down into the battle arena and throw the whole of its manhood, force, and resources, into the scale, prepared to compass for itself either measureless ruin or unqualified victory. If the &#34;British Empire is not markedly successful in this war, it means measureless ruin for it as an Empire. Other portions of the King&#39;s dominions, such as our own continent, may reach a great stage of national efflorescence, and we may become a great southern Empire or Democracy; &#34;but the British Empire, as we know it now as an entity which we hope to see exercise a marked influence on mankind in the future as it has done in the past will cease to be. An Empire greater than ancient Rome will cease to be. There can be no half victory, and no patched-up peace which will enable the British Empire to retain its present status. It must &#34;be the unqualified victor in this, struggle before we can shake hands, with ourselves and say that we are. what we thought we were, and lack neither resolution nor courage, nor the necessary intelligence, without which resolution and courage are of no avail. I have spoken of. the moral effect of conscription.  It is deprecated very much at Home when any one hints that there might be a possibility of some of our Allies not being satisfied with the Imperial efforts. I am going to put forward the statement that the moral effect of conscription would be incalculable, and in this connexion I propose to quote from a military man, a Captain  Battine,  another contributor to the <inline font-style="italic">Fortnightly Review</inline> He speaks of the moral effect of conscription, not only upon our present Allies, but on neutral nations, who, to use an Australian phrase, are sitting on the fence at the present juncture. He refers, also, to the moral effect upon our foes. He says - </para>

                        <para>Hardly less important than the moral effect in Germany which would be the result of England&#39;s adopting conscription would be the influence it would have upon the neutral Powers now hesitating as to their policy. It is well known that we enjoy the sympathy of more than, one State whose alliance is important to us, but, owing to the doubtful aspect of the campaign, does not venture to take the plunge. When all the world knows for certain that the British people are resolved to conquer in this war (and the only proof they will accept of that resolve is the obvious precaution adopted by all other civilized States of conceding to its able-bodied manhood the privilege of bearing arms in its defence) ; when this precaution is definitely taken, then, indeed, friends and neutrals will quickly respond, and foes will be shaken in resolution. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to think it would. That is one of the reasons, why I advocate conscription in Australia. By the adoption of this principle we shall glue to our sides our present Allies, and will attract, as1 a magnet attracts steel filings, the small nations whose fortunes are now so varied, and whose present situation is so. precarious that they hesitate for the moment which side to take. They are concerned only about preserving their national existence. If they learned that Great Britain was imperially, nationally, racially, and socially resolved to throw her whole force into the scale without limitation, I have no hesitation, in saying that the cables about the attitude which Bulgaria and Greece are assuming need not concern us any more,, for they would be very soon upon our side. This is a democratic country. Anything that is equitable and just should appeal with particular force to a generous and genuine Democracy. What is more equitable or democratic than conscription?&#39; With conscription would we have any of these recriminations as to which class in the community is furnishing the greater number of men to our Expeditionary Forces? Would we have any discrimination between rich and poor? Would we have honorable senators saying that New South Wales, Victoria, or Tasmania, as the ease may be, has furnished the greatest percentage of recruits? No; we should be no longer names, but one in desire, associated and co-ordinated in one great effort. We should not have one woman saying, &#34; Lo, I have three or four sons, and have given them to the Empire. Why does not the woman across the. street, whose social circumstances are better or worse than mine, give one at least of her family of five or six sons?&#34; Do not let honorable senators fall into the error of thinking that an individual who has already enlisted is a regular paragon of courage as compared with an individual who up to the present has not done so. I have spoken of the British Fleet, and have quoted in illustration the fact &#39;that many of its members right through the Napoleonic wars were pressed men. But what did they do just before the battle of the Nile ? The British Fleet had swept the Mediterranean, under the command of Nelson, week after week, searching for the French Fleet, which had transported the forces of Napoleon from the south of France to Egypt. The French Fleet had escaped, because of the vicissitudes of the sea, the notice of the British Fleet, although on one occasion I believe the two fleets were very close together indeed. But when the French Fleet was sighted in the Bay of  Aboukir,  what did the pressed men do ? They cheered with exultation at the prospects of the coming fight. </para>

                            <para>- Not all; but a very large percentage of them were. Did they not fight valiantly? After the space of a few hours there was hardly a French ship left. They fought not the less valiantly because they were pressed men. I am going to give what will probably be the most unpalatable, and certainly the most unpopular, feature of the arguments which I am presenting to the attention of honorable senators. We are told that this is a war of resources, and Ministers have very properly spoken about the necessity of economy. They have spoken about certain difficulties in regard to finance which present themselves to the richest nations in time of war. We know that we. are appealing for money to the capitalists of Australia, who, I hope, are responding most patriotically - and, indeed, they will disappoint me if they are not. We are appealing to them to provide us with the sinews of war, and wo are talking of a contest of endurance. We were told very early in the war that a great Japanese statesman, with experience of the difficulties that are attendant on the financing of a great war, said that the victory would be to the people who had the last battalion of men and the last &#163;100. Of course, he illustrated the fact that this was going to be a war not only of armies, but of national resources. Now, conscription is economical, and I have no hesitation in saying that I expect one of the corollaries of a system of conscription to be the giving of a very much smaller pay to the conscripted men than that which we are giving to our volunteers at present. If we must credit the trained German mind with, seeing many things up to the present which did not before show themselves to us; if we recognise to the full the triumph of organization which has exhibited itself in connexion with the German efforts, we will have a keener appreciation of the statement that the war is likely to be one of material resources and of finance, as well as a war to be fought out ou the battlefield. There is another war going on all the time. The men at Sheffield are fighting the men at Essen, altheugh they are not on a battle-field; the coal-miners in Westphalia are fighting the coal miners in the black country of England, although they are only handling picks and shovels. The scientists at the British universities, and the men who are making a study of physics, are fighting the spectacled German scientist and the spectacled German professor. Here is another feature of organization. The Rotterdam correspondent of an English newspaper the other day said that he met, of course in the neutral city of Rotterdam, a young German chemist of his acquaintance. &#34; Halloo,&#34; he said, &#34; how is it that you are not at the war?&#34; The young man replied, &#34; There is no German chemist at the front. A chemist is too valuable to be sent there; he is worth a whole battalion of men, and we do not risk a chemist in the firing line.&#34; That is another instance of organization. But, going back to finance, we pay our men a  large  wage - and the same remark can be applied to the officers - not that I grudge them the money, because national service is really a jewel beyond all price. Could we afford it, I would give the men &#163;1 or &#163;2 a day, hut I am prepared to exhibit generosity to them according to the strength of the national finance when they return. I am prepared to have a most liberal pension scheme. I have supported the Government scheme, and would support any enlargement of it which they felt themselves justified in arranging for. But I submit that we must be prepared to fight for our country for nothing. The German is fighting for his country for nothing. A German soldier gets nothing per day. An Italian soldier, who is fighting on our side - on the side of liberty - gets about  2 1/2d.  a day, and I think that he is about the best paid of the Allied Forces, with the exception of those of Great Britain. A French soldier gets a trifle of a few pence a day. A Russian soldier gets the equivalent of an English half-penny. But my latest information is that a German soldier gets nothing. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter of military organization, and I have no doubt that the German soldiers do not lack in that regard. In fact, all the evidence I can glean from neutral sources and from articles written by such a man as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Beveridge,</inline> a member of the United States Congress, is to the effect that the Germans make the_ most ample arrangements in regard to the commissariat. German soldiers are well fed and very comfortably cared for. All the English prints indicate that the German soldiers are a very well-found lot indeed : so that the German organization certainly does not lack in that regard. But in Australia we are paying the men - and the officers on a commensurate scale - more than the State Governments are paying the police. Do honorable senators think that in any parsimonious spirit I regret the fact that the men are getting this money? I would willingly, if we felt sure that we could afford it, give them &#163;1 a day, for even that would not be sufficient remuneration for their services. But we have to win the war, and if it is going to be a contest of endurance, let us economize on every line that presents itself to us. Let us have conscription. Let us pay our men - and make the officers fight on the same basis - sufficient, perhaps, to allow them the small comfort of tobacco and so on. But let us economize and make sure that we are going to carry the war along the present lines to a successful conclusion. Are we sure that we can do that? We are not sure, and, even if we were very nearly sure, it would be well for us to adopt the most economical system. What is the effect, again, in Great Britain of the indiscriminate &#39; recruiting of married men ? </para>

                            <para>- According to a proper system of organization I purpose taking first those men who have comparatively no dependants. That is a logical and scientific way to arrange the matter. Then, when you take the men who have dependants, arrange for the support of the dependants along such lines and in such measure as the national resources will permit. Honorable senators must address themselves to a right consideration of the arguments I am putting before them, for this is really a most serious business. What do I care! I have spoken in this strain before. I know that I was met by soldiers after I had spoken before who said, &#34; You are the man who would make us go and fight for 2s. a day.&#34; I said, &#34;If I had my way an Australian soldier going to the Dardanelles would be a conscripted man, and would not be getting 2s. a day.&#34; I know that there was a very large body of public opinion highly antagonistic to me over this matter, incensed because - the eyes of the public take some opening - they thought that I was opposed to the welfare of the poor soldier, that I wished to cut off his privileges, that I wanted to deprive him of something that he was justly entitled to. I do not desire to do anything of the sort, but the supreme consideration with me is to see the Forces of the British Empire come out of this struggle successfully. Even if we paid the men nothing and won the war, and found that we were able to do it, we could give the survivors &#163;100 each, for the men who had died on the field of battle -would require nothing. All that we would have to do would be to keep their dependants, if any. We could give the survivors &#163;100 or &#163;50 each, and then I venture to say the returned veterans would have more money in their possession than they would be likely to have if we paid them 10s.a day. I went to condole with a young woman who, unfortunately, had lost her brother, an officer, at the front a few weeks ago, and, to my surprise, she expressed herself as holding the belief that my idea was the correct one, and that if we. gave the soldiers on their return a lump sum they would be in much better financial trim than if we kept on paying them the comparatively large sum which we are giving them at present. What about the soldiers who, though getting 6s. a day, came back here, and, so the Senate has been informed, did not have a shilling with which to buy a meal between Melbourne and Sydney! What had become of their money? </para>

                            <para>- The men do not have it very long, anyhow, because some of them are practically mendicants. Honorable senators are well aware that what I am telling them has a most substantial element of truth, and, therefore, they cannot shut their eyes to this phase of the question, although support of my arguments might, perhaps, for a moment bring them a little unpopularity. Are they sure that the war will end this year? Are they sure that it will end i next year ? Are they sure that it will end in 1917 ? They cannot be sure as to when it will end, and, therefore, they should make the most ample provision. They should proceed upon the most scientific organization in every direction, and, therefore, they must consider the economics of the war. They must ask themselves the question : If it is going to be a contest of endurance, if the statesmen in the Old Country are even now urging economy, are we likely to survive to the end of the struggle when we pay our men on the most extensive scale ever adopted by a nation waging Avar as compared with the German nation, whose men are sent to thu front in pursuance of a citizen duty? I can assure honorable senators that this is a phase of the question which is well worthy of consideration. I recommend the adoption of conscription because of its economic character, and I have no hesitation in saying to the young men of Australia, &#34; If you want to enlist, come along now and be with the paid division, for if Bakhap has anything to say in the matter you will presently be brought in, and you will be in the unpaid division. He knows you so well as to believe that you will fight just as effectively in an unpaid division as you would in a paid division.&#34; I have no fear whatever as to the class of men we would secure under conscription. I have no hesitation in saying that, under conscription, I could get 70,000 single men in Australia to-day who would not be less than 5 ft. 8 in. in height, and who would have a chest measurement infinitely superior to the very low physical standard that has been adopted . </para>

                            <para>- They would have to come. Does the honorable senator believe that the Australian people who subscribe to the profession of their political leaders, that we will wage this war to the last man and the last shilling, would refuse to come forward if service to their country meant that they would not be paid ? I have a higher conception of their patriotism than that. As the member of the Imperial Legislature whom I have already quoted, has observed, paradoxical though it may appear, there are hundreds of thousands of men who will go willingly when they are compelled to do so. Many nien fail to recognise the need of the nation at the present time. They think that when the nation does not resort to compulsion the need for national service cannot be as pressing as we are told it is - that the situation cannot have in it any element of peril. Men are variously constituted. They are not all lacking in patriotism merely because they do not enlist, or those who enlisted only last week must be sadly deficient in this quality, seeing that they did not enlist twelve months ago. The men who will enlist three months hence will not be less patriotic than those who are enlisting now. Men&#39;s actions are, to a large extent, governed by environment. It is not every man who can cut himself loose, and say, &#34; Lo, I will go to the war.&#34; At a celebration in Tasmania only on Saturday evening last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> informs me that a  Colonel in  the Military Forces said that he would welcome a law which would compel him to go to the front, because there are certain circumstances which constrain him to remain at his present post. That is the position in which dozens of men &#34;find themselves to-day. They are not one whit less brave or patriotic than those who have been practically compelled to enlist because avenues of employment were designedly closed to them in order to force them to go to the front under an alleged voluntary system. Arguments such as these have been used by men who think as I do, right throughout the Empire. Only the other day a recruiting association at Cooma adopted a resolution in favour of compulsory service. There are organizations throughout the country which are at present passing resolutions in support of co-ordinated national effort. We talk about the beauty of voluntary service, and of the glorious valour of the voluntary Tommy. Who has sung the praises of the British Tommy; who has been his poet laureate to a greater extent than has Rudyard Kipling ? It was only the other day that I ascertained that Kipling is a conscriptionist. Who knows the emotions  of the British soldier as well as he does <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> He has embalmed them in verse which - without regarding him as a Shakspeare - will endure for centuries to come, and will be quoted so long as the English language retains its present form. At a recruiting meeting recently he expressed himself as being altogether opposed to the present voluntary system. He recognises that it is along conscriptionist lines that victory must be achieved. It will be seen, therefore, that if I err on this matter, I err in the company of Rudyard Kipling, a man who understands what British arms have achieved very much better than I do. I err in the company of British statesmen, in the company of the most able writers, the most distinguished patriots; of those cool, calculating men who recognise all the essential elements of victory, who believe that the moral and materia&#93; effect of the adoption of conscription by the British Empire would be to very greatly damp the courage and resolution of our enemy, and who realize that the welfare of our Empire is the welfare of all lovers of liberty throughout the world. I have sheaves of arguments here which I might use but for the fact that I have no desire to weary honorable senators. The present is about the fifth or sixth occasion upon which I have addressed myself to this question. It is no newly-found fad with me. Although I am not a soldier, I served for some years in the Defence Forces of Australia, and I have been a close student of the military art and of the history of the great wars of the past. I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the adoption of compulsory service is one of the factors essential to the achievement of that victory which is still a long way off, unless human judgment is somewhat at fault. The war has already lasted a year. Most people thought it was impossible for it to last more than a few months; that when such great masses of men. were thrown into the field against each other decisive victory would be inevitable. But it is possible that it may be a longer war than any which has been waged for a century. It is possible that the struggle with a disciplined Empire like that of Germany will have to proceed until the foe has reached the last stage of exhaustion. We must not forget that an organized people is in a somewhat different position from an unorganized people. German organization has been perfecting itself, not for forty years, but for the past century - from the time of Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, historic German names. The very fact that those names were selected for German war vessels is indicative of what the German people believe they owe to the men whose organization rescued Germany from the grip of Napoleon, who removed the stain of humiliation that had been placed on the German escutcheon because of the triumphs of Napoleon over the German arms. These people have been organized for a century, and they will have to be worn to the very bone before complete victory can be achieved. They may possibly suggest a sort of interim peace if they think that the chances of the war are going against them. Should our statesmen prove weak enough, such a peace may be arranged, with disastrous consequences to posterity. I hope that the British nation will prove as inflexible as were the Romans in the time of the Punic wars. I hope they will wage this struggle until Germany as a military power will be under our feet, and consequently I appeal to honorable senators, who must confess that the war is likely to .be a long one, to support my motion. I ask them to do so in the full confidence that it is a patriotic, equitable, and democratic proposal, and one which above all will prove thoroughly effective. I thank honorable senators for having granted me permission some weeks ago to continue my remarks upon this question, but, recognising that if I spoke for ten hours I could not exhaust all the arguments in favour of the motion, I will content myself with recommending it to the Senate in the belief that in a full spirit of patriotism and of calculated intelligence it will meet with hearty support, and thus indicate to the Empire the inflexible determination of the Australian people to proceed along practical lines till victory is achieved in this great world struggle. </para>

                            <para>. - When dealing with this motion yesterday, I pointed out, first of all, what I considered was the impropriety, in a political sense, of submitting; the motion to the Senate at this juncture. I also dealt with some of the arguments that had been brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> including the references to the manager nf the Small Arms Factory, the assistant manager, and the original manager, Captain Clarkson. I also quoted from the utterances of these gentlemen given before the Public Works Committee, and I pointed out that in my opinion it was highly undesirable as a &#34;general principle that we should over-centralize our industries in Australia. I particularly emphasized my own objections to the over-centralization of anything in the nature of the manufacture of war materiel, and cue of the reasons I gave was that in the future the enemy would attack from the air rather than from the sea or land. </para>

                        <para>I am surprised to hear that experts have informed the Committee that, if the selection of a site for the Small Arms Factory had been left to them, they would not have chosen Lithgow. I know of no higher expert than Lord Kitchener, who visited the site just after the first sod had been turned, and who declared at that time that it was a very nice one. I understand, also, that  Colonel Legge,  Chief of Staff, was one of the selectors of the site. </para>

                    <para class="block">Now, one of the arguments used by the Minister in advocating the transfer of the Factory to Canberra was the difficulty of obtaining land except at a high price. I pointed out yesterday that although a sum was given as the possible price for land that might be required for workmen&#39;s homes, at Lithgow, yet the Committee had had no definite area of land indicated to it as likely to cost that amount. Since I spoke yesterday I have been still more confirmed in the view that the evidence before the Committee disclosed no particular area that was likely to be required at Lithgow. The authority for the statement as to the price of land admits that he had no definite area in his mind, and I, accordingly, say it is fallacious now to reason that the land will cost so much on the basis of values received for land in any definite position. The land to which I referred yesterday, an area of acres, may be described as town land. </para>

                        <para>The scheme of extensions now before the Committee makes no provision for workmen&#39;s cottages. In my recommendation of three years ago, in regard to the acquisition of the land up to Main-street, I strongly recommended that the Government should take&#34; into consideration thu purchasing of that area, and the selling of it in building blocks at a nominal cost to employees, who are willing to erect their own cottages with financial assistance from the Government. I have urged that scheme two or three times. A number of the Factory employees have built their own cottages on the flat below the Factory, and there is also a long row of cottages which were built by a private citizen, and are rented by the employees, who pay lis. a week, and 6d. for sanitary fees. </para>

                        <para>As to the evidence given before the Committee that twenty acres of land in Lithgow were obtained at a cost of £ 10,000, or &#163;500 per acre, I can only say that when the Government go into the land market they will find - I think it is the general rule - that the owner of land is not very modest in his demands. I was speaking of the purchase of a large area of land when I mentioned &#163;50 or &#163;60 per acre as the price at which the Government would probably bc able to secure it. </para>

                    <para class="block">On this question we have also a statement made by the then mayor of Lithgow, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Pillans, who, for all I know to the contrary, may be the mayor at the present time. It might be said that his evidence on this point is of a very general character, but I would have honorable senators  remember that the evidence which is supposed to be in conflict with it is of a more vague character still. I refer to the evidence indicated by the Minister that the land required for extension would cost some extraordinary sum, because the authority for that statement.  Colonel Owen,  admits that he had no precise area in his mind at the time. As a matter of fact, it is a. random guess. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pillans,</inline> in his evidence on the 11th May, in answer to the  chairman,  said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Small Arms Factory is situated within the municipality of Lithgow, and there is a large area of land close to the works suitable for any extension of the Factory. On the opposite side of the road from the present Factory, between the rifle range and the academy, there is a considerable stretch of country of a suitable  character:  that is the land adjoining the western boundary of the Factory ground. That land runs right up to the main road, and on the opposite side of the road there is a good portion of fairly level land suitable for factories or workmen&#39;s dwellings. That land belongs to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> L. Brown, from whom the land on&#39; which the Factory is now situated was bought. I should say &#163;50 to f CO per acre is a reasonable valuation for good building land in that vicinity. The land which is now being built on has been sold at prices ranging from &#163;1 to &#163;3 per foot for picked blocks. The land to which I refer as being suitable for Factory extension  and workmen&#39;s dwellings is higher than the land which has been built on, although it is somewhat farther away from the mines and the ironworks. </para>

                    <para>The price mentioned by the Minister was evidently an exaggeration of the price at which suitable land could be obtained. Are we to take up land on the. city side of the Factory, at an enormous cost, in order to overcome a difficulty of that kind ? </para>

So has the Lithgow municipal council. The mayor gave a reason for his statement. He said - </para>

                        <para>We have not had time to make the roads on the newly-built portions of the town, because, as I have explained, the sub-division was taken over too hastily. There are no vacant houses in the town. Every fortnight the council deals with from six to ten applications for building permits. The present building operations are mainly on the subdivision between the Small Arms Factory and Main-street, but new buildings are being erected all over the place. T do not think that there would be any trouble about the housing of additional men if the Factory were increased. The extra 700 men whom the Factory may require will not arrive here immediately in one body. </para>

                        <para>There is plenty of land available for the extension of the Factory. None of it has been reclaimed, nor do I think it requires reclamation. Some of the land on the north side of the Factory has been levelled up, in order to improve the entrance to the factory. Prior to that the land was sloping towards Main-street for some distance. The land I am recommending is in its natural state, and is on about the same level as the land now occupied by the Factory. It would allow of the existing buildings being continued, and would not require the extension to be a separate structure. </para>

                        <para>If several hundred additional men were brought into the Factory within a short period, 1 think they could be accommodated in Lithgow. In the case of a sudden influx of workmen, I would suggest that the Federal Government should acquire, a subdivision for their employees. The only evidence I can give to the Committee as to the willingness of private capitalists to build extensively in order to meet any increased demand for houses is that there are several men in Lithgow who are building continually. </para>

                            <para>- Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> desire that I shall read the whole of the evidence? If I did so, the motion would never be carried. If honorable senators would themselves carefully read the whole of the evidence, without any preconceived opinion, they would not entertain the motion for a moment. I am convinced of that. There are conflicting statements in the evidence; but, allowing for all that, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that if it were submitted to an impartial man, without any preconceived opinions on the subject, he could come to only one conclusion, and that is that the Factory should be continued at Lithgow, and that the original proposition for its extension should be carried out. </para>

There is a power-house, but it is not yet completely installed. That is to say, there is not at the present time in that power-house the whole of the machinery with which it is intended it should be equipped. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the case; but even when the full machinery required is installed, the power which the existing power-house will be able to supply will not be sufficient to meet the whole of the requirements of the Federal Territory within the next few years. In view of that, the departmental officers who appeared before the Public Works Committee have intimated that in the course of a few years it will be necessary for the arsenal to have its own power plant. There will be other demands upon the power-house at present in existence at Canberra. There is the current required for the Cotter pumping scheme. There is the Duntroon Military College, the general lighting of the city, and, incidentally, demands for power in different parts of the Federal Territory. If there is to be anything in the nature of a tramway scheme, power will be required for that. Sooner or later, and possibly sooner rather than later, there must be a tramway scheme, because the area of the Federal Capital is somewhat extensive. It will not be a congested city, in which people will be crowded together. It will be a city of comparatively magnificent distances, which cannot be always conveniently travelled on foot. So that a tramway system must be established earlier in the history of Canberra than has been found necessary in most modern cities. That system will have to make a call upon the power supplied by the existing power-house. Recent evidence given before the Committee by the official representative of the Department of Home Affairs indicated particular demauds, and estimated what they would be, upon the power generated at the existing power-house. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say what is the distance at present. I believe the coal used there now comes from Sydney, but later on it may come from the south coast collieries when we have railway communication established with Jervis Bay. At Lithgow the coal is, to all intents and purposes, on the ground. It costs about 7s. or 8s. per ton. I believe that 8s. 6d. per ton will at all times cover the cost of coal delivered at the Lithgow Factory. The Small Arms Factory is a large consumer of gas, and it is supplied at Lithgow at 3s. 4d. per 1,000 cubic feet. How would the Melbourne people like that ? </para>

                            <para>- So would the people of every capital city of the Commonwealth. The low price charged at Lithgow is due to the fact that Lithgow is a coal district. Water in unlimited quantity is provided at Lithgow at 3d. per <inline font-style="italic">1,000</inline> gallons. In the city from which I come, and where we feel very proud of our water supply, we have to pay 9d. per 1,000 gallons, and the Commonwealth Government have had the offer made to them to provide a water supply for the Flinders Naval Base at something like1s. 6d. per 1,000 gallons by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. Lithgow provides the Small Arms Factory with water at 3d. per 1,000 gallons, and the municipal council regret that they cannot provide it at a cheaper rate. They would do so but for the fact that the law compels them to sell at not less than 3d. per 1,000 gallons. These factors cannot be eliminated from consideration when we are asked to determine this matter. </para>

                    <para>There is this outstanding fact, that the Lithgow Factory is in existence and in active operation. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe</inline> said they would not select the Lithgow site as an ideal site for the Small Arms Factory if we were beginning its establishment again. But each of them said that the Factory is there, and is a going concern, and each expressed doubt as to the wisdom of removing it. It is a going concern, and what are we asked to do ? At this critical juncture in the history of the Commonwealth we are asked to remove it to Canberra. On general principles I do not think that it should be removed, but every reason there is against its removal to Canberra is multiplied ten-fold when we come to consider what we are requiring of the Factory now. We are requiring an increased output, not in the dim and distant future, but immediately or sooner if possible. I think we should be making a fatal mistake if we proceeded with the removal of the Factor from Lithgow to Canberra at this juncture. It will be some time before a factory is erected at Canberra, and it will take some little time to transfer the machinery now at Lithgow to the Federal Capital. At page 8 of the report it will be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline> gave the following evidence in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story:</inline> - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>I do not favour the proposal to erect an additional unit of the Factory at Canberra, with a view to the ultimate removal there of the Lithgow plant. The supervision of two establishments so widely apart would present serious difficulties. You suggest that I and the assistant manager might be able to run the two establishments without serious inconvenience or loss during the time they would necessarily have to be conducted as separate concerns; but that would be a very difficult job. I have moved a factory a distance of 60 miles, and attended to the work at the old and the new sites; but there we had good facilities for travelling backwards and forwards between the two places. We had the best of railway facilities. We could load up a train at 5 o&#39;clock in the evening, and unload the cars at 7 o&#39;clock next morning. There would be no advantage in being able to run the railway trucks with our material right up to the Factory, instead of carrying it by motor-lorry as at present. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright&#39;s</inline> view as to the difficulties which would attend the transfer. </para>
                    <para class="block">What is it proposed to do ? We are asked to indicate to those who are interested in the turn-out of rifles at Lithgow that it is proposed at the earliest possible date to transfer their activities to Canberra. We know that there is room at Lithgow to extend the Factory and to establish workmen&#39;s homes in the vicinity. We know that there is any number of homes there which may be rented. We know that about ninety-five of the men have built, or are building, their own homes. We know that they view with dismay this prospect of transfer ; we know that practically the whole of their savings have been set aside for the purpose of building permanent homes at Lithgow, and now they are to be told that they are to be shifted. What sort of efficiency do honorable senators think that they are likely to get from the men with the ever-present threat of the roof that is over their head no longer sheltering them ? </para>
                    <para>The whole of the evidence discloses that the best course for us to follow would be to extend the present Factory. That being, in my opinion, the best course to follow, even in normal conditions, I think that we should do nothing at this juncture which would impair the morale or efficiency of the staff. I can conceive of nothing which is more calculated to impair that efficiency than to upset their balance, so to speak, by the prospect of shifting the Factory and removing the men from the homes which they have been sedulously building up. I sincerely hope that honorable senators will give this matter their consideration, and go through the evidence, and, apart from the sentimental considerations, which are very strong, I trust that they will consider the inadvisableness at this juncture, if they do not consider it generally, of adopting the motion. </para>

                            <para>. - As one of the members of the Public Works Committee who recommended the removal of the Small Arms Factory to Canberra, I desire to say a few words. I wish to enter a protest against the action of honorable members of both Houses who, with the object of bolstering up the cause they believe in, have misrepresented the principal officer in the Home Affairs Department.  Colonel Owen  was attacked in another place, and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was most unfair in dealing with the evidence given by that officer. Take the one point with regard to the value of land.  Colonel Owen  was asked by a member of the Committee to give an estimate of the cost of land at Lithgow. He explained that he had no data on which to give a correct estimate, but he estimated that the value of land would be about &#163;200 per acre. He was taken to task on that by members of the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has criticised him to-night, because he said that  Colonel Owen  was not able to point to any particular block of land on which he could put a special value. The honorable senator knows as well as I know that  Colonel Owen  explained to him how it was that he arrived at that value. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator knows that  Colonel Owen  explained that he had nothing tangible to go upon. He did not know the value of land in different localities, but he took prices which he knew had been paid for land in various places, and arrived at what he considered a very conservative estimate of what the land would cost if the Government had to purchase it for extending the Factory or building workmen&#39;s houses. We know, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is aware, that very recently the valuator employed by the Government valued some of the land near the Factory at nearly &#163;650 per acre. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> read some of the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright,</inline> but he did not tell the Senate that, in his evidence, that witness pointed out that, adjacent to the Factory, there were 13 acres of land which could not be purchased for less than about &#163;850 per acre. One of the workmen who said that he had purchased land told the Committee that he had to pay at the rate of &#163;250 per acre for his piece. The whole of the evidence went to show that if the Government wished to purchase any land for extending the Factory; or erecting workmen&#39;s houses, they would have to pay a very high price indeed. </para>

As soon as it was proposed to extend the Lithgow Factory the price of land went up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> quoted the evidence of the Mayor, who did not give a direct valuation, but merely expressed the opinion that land could be purchased at about &#163;50 or &#163;60 per acre. I may say that he was a special pleader, for he wanted extra work to be done there. Land might possibly be purchased within a few miles of Lithgow at that price, but I remind the Senate that the object ot providing residences for the workmen employed in the Factory in the first place </para>

                        <para class="block">WAS  to induce them to go and live at Lithgow. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright,</inline> in his evidence, pointed out that they had very great difficulty in inducing men to remain there. Some men went there, and started to work in the Factory, but found that the surroundings were depressing, that the climate did not suit them, and that the educational facilities for children were insufficient. It is very easy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> or any other honorable senator, to take the report, and pick out pieces of  evidence here and there to bolster up the case he is advocating. But I think that if honorable senators will carefully read the whole of the evidence they can come to only one conclusion, and that is  that  land at Lithgow is scarce and dear. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the principal witnesses, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright, Mr. Ratcliffe,</inline> and Captain Clarkson, agreed that Lithgow was an unsuitable place. They agreed certainly that it was undesirable <inline font-style="italic">at,</inline> the present moment to remove the Factory, but when  Colonel Owen  was called before the Committee, he, as Director-General of Works, thought it was his duty to advise that in all probability the Small Arms Factory was merely the nucleus of a Commonwealth arsenal which would embrace not only the manufacture of small arms, but the manufacture of machine guns, pistols, field guns, heavy gun cordite, ammunition, and other things. It must be patent to any one who gives proper consideration to the matter that an arsenal should be on Federal Territory, and absolutely under Federal control. There is a number of reasons in favour of the view, but I will give only one. It is within the bounds oi possibility that one, or some, of the States may declare war against the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- The State which the honorable senator represents has, on two occasions, if not more, defied the Commonwealth. If there is a State about which any uneasiness might be felt in that regard it is the State so ably represented by him. On page 3 of the report honorable senators will find a statement in which  Colonel Owen  gave a number of reasons why the Small Arms Factory should be established at Canberra. Another argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> which he rather laboured, and in which I think there is nothing, was that if the Commonwealth arsenal is established in one place we shall leave ourselves open to the possibility of having the whole of it destroyed by a hostile seaplane with bombs. It must be obvious to any honorable senator that if we had half-a-dozen or a dozen munition factories the enemy would have a plan of every one, and would know exactly where to go, and drop bombs. But the counter argument is that in the Federal Capital we shall have some magnificent buildings, and that all the valuable documents of the Commonwealth will be stored there. As a matter of fact, everything that is most worth defending will be centred there. Of course, it will be necessary to provide defences for the city against possible aerial raids. Anybody who has visited Canberra, and has observed the site for the proposed arsenal, will recognise that it will be extremely easy to defend that establishment. The one scheme of defence will suffice alike for the arsenal and for the public buildings of the city. In addition, it will involve very much less expense to concentrate all the factories associated with our defence in the Federal Territory than it would to have them scattered over the continent. However, I do not desire to labour this point. Anybody who considers the question in all its bearings must admit that the arsenal would be very much more secure in the neighbour hood of the Federal Capital than it would be elsewhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and some other honorable senators have complained of the action of the Government in submitting this motion to the Senate. Hitherto, these gentlemen have protested that this Chamber has not been consulted in regard to certain matters equally with the House of Representatives, and that, consequently, an attempt has been made to lower its status. Now, however, merely because a proposal has been submitted of which they do not approve, they roundly declare that the Government are humbugging the Senate. </para>

                                <para>- To my mind, a very good precedent has been established in connexion with this motion. The Government have recognised that the Senate should be consulted on questions of this character. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> &#39;and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> stressed the fact that the Public Works Committee Act lays it down that that Committee must report to the House of Representatives, and not to this Chamber. That is perfectly true; and if the question involved on this occasion had been that of the desirableness or otherwise of extending the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, only another place would have been consulted. But for various reasons the Public Works Committee decided to recommend the removal of the Factory from Lithgow to Canberra. </para>

If a Bill authorizing the removal of the Factory from Lithgow to Canberra were passed by the Senate in two consecutive sessions, it might be referred to the people of Australia for their decision. Certainly, the question is of quite as much importance as are some of the matters upon which the electors have been consulted. If the Senate twice passed such a measure, I believe that the present advisers of the Governor-General would recommend its submission to the people.

As a matter of fact, it is  estimated  that cottages at Canberra, for which the workmen will have to pay only  10s.  ner week, will be very much superior to the dwellings for which they are now paying 13s. 6d. per week at Lithgow. </para>

                                <para>- He stated that in the manufacture of wool a certain quality of water is absolutely essential. He examined Canberra, and pointed out that whilst the climate might be suitable, the water there was altogether unsuitable. There are other reasons why, for a time at least, the woollen mills should not be established at Canberra. But had Canberra been established before the Small Arms Factory was called into existence, I venture to say that that establishment would have been located there. All the witnesses agree that it is the more suitable site. The only objection which has been urged against it relates either to the cost of its removal or to the delay which will be incurred in connexion with that removal. Hence it has been stated that the war may be over before the Factory can be built at Canberra, and consequently we are assured that it would be idle to establish it there. A good deal of special pleading on behalf of the workers in the Factory has been indulged in by honorable senators, who, as a rule, do not exhibit_much interest in that direction. They have argued that the workmen should not be obliged to sell their homes at Lithgow for less than they paid for them. But does it not occur fo them that even if the workman lost &#163;50 upon the price which he  paid  for his land, so long as he could go to Canberra and secure twice as much land- </para>

                                <para>- In the course of this debate, much stress has been laid upon the loss and inconvenience that the men would suffer, and the expense and loss of time that would be incurred in moving machinery from Lithgow to Canberra; but all these arguments are answered by the evidence comprised in the report by the Public Works Committee. We know that we cannot get the machinery until the buildings are erected ; and we know, also, that there is an abundant supply of the raw material for buildings at Canberra, and that the houses could be erected at an enormously lower cost than if built in any other part of Australia. This fact will more than compensate for the cost of moving the machinery to the Federal Territory; and with regard to the loss of time in the manufacture of rifles, I am sure that the advantage of having the Factory on our own Territory will more than compensate for that also. If the majority of the present Parliament decided that it was desirable to duplicate the Factory at Lithgow now, hundreds more workmen would build their homes there; and if in fifteen or twenty years&#39; time a more intelligent Parliament than this decided that it was essential to have the arsenal, including the Small Arms Factory, at Canberra, there would be a much greater loss than if the change were made now. May I point out that, according to  Colonel Owen,  now is the time to make the change, for at present the loss would be comparatively insignificant, and the advantages would be very great indeed. I feel sure that, looking ahead twenty or fifty years, it is right that we should place our national arsenal on national territory. Then, again, the establishment of this Factory at Canberra will materially assist in settling a population on Federal Territory which otherwise must remain sparsely populated for a very long time. The only justification for spending any more money at Canberra within the next few years will be the establishment of this Factory there, because it will lead to the immediate settlement of 4,000 or 5,000 people, who might be regarded as the nucleus of the city which we all hope will ultimately be one of the big centres of population in Australia. On the other hand, should the Factory at Lithgow be duplicated, there will be nothing at the present time to take one to Canberra except a few hundred workmen engaged in the erection of public buildings. Does any one imagine that the fact that the Parliament House and administrative offices will be at Canberra, will make a </para>

We cannot assume that private manufacturers will go to the Federal Territory and establish factories, when they can get nearer to their markets at Melbourne and Sydney, and the other large towns of the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- It does not prove anything of the sort. I am willing to concede, however, that possibly private manufacturers would find it more difficult to carry on undertakings at Canberra than at Melbourne or Sydney ; but in this particular matter we are dealing with an industry which it is very desirable should not be established in either Melbourne or Sydney, or in any large town near the sea coast. The establishment of the Small Arms Factory on our Federal Territory will accelerate the progress of the place, and give it an impetus which will help to make it a city a generation sooner than if the Small Arms Factory were not removed to that site. I hope the motion will be carried, although, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> interjected, in itself it may not have very much effect. It will, however, show the other branch of the Legislature that the Senate is of opinion that, this course ought to be adopted, in the interests of the Commonwealth. I think, also, that the adoption of the motion will fortify the Government in giving effect to the policy of establishing the arsenal in the Federal Territory. I hope the motion will be carried, and that the Government will have the courage to start the work immediately. </para>
