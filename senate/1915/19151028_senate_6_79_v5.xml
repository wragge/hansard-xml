                                <para>- A conference of the State Governments and the Commonwealth Government was held very shortly after the outbreak of the war, and that was one of the questions which were dealt with. It was agreed by all the States and the Commonwealth that they would not make up the difference between what the men received as military pay and what they received as State or Federal officials. When the representatives of New South Wales returned to their State, however, they found that the same question had been raised there during their absence, and that a State Minister had given a promise that the difference would be made up, and since that time the State has made up the difference, but no other State has done so. The other States have observed the undertaking arrived at in the Conference, and so has the Commonwealth Government. </para>

Even there they are moved on by the police. They are enduring hardships, are friendless, are receiving no pay, and are stranded. &#34; Happily, a club has been opened for Australasians, where the women of England are humbly showing devotion to the Anzacs. Sixteen of our orderlies are attending to the housework, fourteen are waiting in the dining-room, and others are running the canteen.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- I did read the. cablegram with considerable surprise, because the conditions under which soldiers, are dealt with are that a soldier, if wounded or sick, is in a hospital where his wants are provided for, and when he leaves the hospital he receives his pay. The. statement in the cablegram is that the men are receiving no pay. Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> raised the same question, although it was not based on that par- . ticular cablegram, and I gave instructions&#39; for a cablegram to be sent to the High Commissioner drawing his attention to the fact that such statements were being made here, and asking him for a report. To-day we received a cablegram thatColonel Fetherston, the Acting Director-General of Medical Services, will arrive in England on 2nd November, and as the question is one which comes under the administration of medical services, I sent another cablegram to-day instructing that officer to make a special report. The High Commissioner is the officer who has. been administering the Australian portion of the hospitals in England, and all his communications have been to the effect that the wounded have received,. every attention, and arc quite in conflict with the cablegram in the newspaper. However, we shall have a report from not only the High Commissioner, but also the Acting Director-General of Medical Services, so that we shall have information from one whose administration is not challenged, for he is not responsible for what may have taken place. </para>

                            <para>- It has been altogether too long so far as quarantine is concerned. Many weaknesses have been found in administering the Act. The powers of the Department in relation to masters of ships, and passengers on snips - the cleansing of ships, and the taking of the steps necessary to preserve the general health of passengers - were not clear. It was also quite possible, if a dispute arose between a State Board of Health and the Commonwealth, for disease to spread throughout the States while the matter was being settled between the respective Cabinets, and it was, therefore, thought desirable to give the Commonwealth full power to deal with the disease first, and settle the dispute afterwards. The main force behind the introduction of this Bill is the opening of the Panama Canal and the anticipation that, in consequence, yellow fever may be introduced into Australia. It may be news to honorable senators that the species of mosquito, which is the only carrier &#39; of yellow fever, is to be found in all the ports of Queensland and south along the coast as far as Newcastle. I understand that, although it is agreed that the mosquito found on the Australian coast is of the same species as that which is Known to be a carrier of yellow fever, it has not yet been infected in Australia with this disease. Tt behoves us to take effective action to prevent the introduction of this or any other disease to Australia. The Bill is essentially one for consideration in Committee, and, as I have said, its purpose is to tighten up the provisions of the existing Act, and strengthen the hands of the Quarantine Department. </para>

                        <para>. - The Assistant Minister has been brief in submitting this motion, and his brevity is no doubt due to the fact that the object of the Bill is mainly, if not wholly, to tighten up the provisions of the existing Act. It has just been circulated, and I doubt whether any honorable senator has, so far, had an opportunity to read it through. I have been able to look only at the marginal notes, and to glance casually at some of the clauses. </para>

                    <para>SenatorKEATING .  - Possibly , but it seems to me that in clause 7 there is provision for an extension of the powers of a quarantine officer. He is given, under this clause, the power to ask any person subject to quarantine questions concerning his personal health or liability to infection, and the quarantine officer may require his questions to be answered by a declaration. That is an extension of the powers given to quarantine officers under the existing Act, and, in my view, it is a very desirable extension. I presume that it will apply in cases where persons who, although they may nob have been actually infected with disease, may very recently have been brought into relation to other persons and places that has exposed them to a liability to infection, which might not become evident until after subsequent development. </para>

                    <para>The possible danger of infection from yellow fever was adverted to when the original Act was under consideration in 1908. The Panama Canal was then in course of construction, and it was pointed out, on the introduction of that measure, that upon the opening of that canal, Australia would be faced with new problems in connexion with the maintenance of the health of the people. It will, as the Minister has said, probably be news to most people that the species of mosquito which is the principal vehicle of infection by &#34; yellow jack &#34; in the Panama Canal region is to be found in Australia, although, so far as we know, it has not yet been infected here, and is therefore not a vehicle for the communication of that disease. </para>

                            <para>- Efforts have been made with varying success to keep mosquitoes out of quite open and public places. The way in which &#34; yellow jack &#34; was combated in the Panama Canal zone was by keeping mosquitoes entirely away from water spaces and places they were known to frequent. That seemed a task almost impossible of accomplishment, but with science, energy, and enthusiasm, those charged with the responsibilities of performing that almost impossible task set about it and achieved it with an enormous amount of success. What has been done there could, no doubt, be done here. Our task should be easier because we have not to effect a cure, but to prevent the introduction of the disease. So far as we know, yellow fever has not yet occurred in Australia. We know that the variety of mosquito that conveys yellow fever to human beings exists in Australia, but it has not yet been discovered to be infectious. We want, as far as possible, bo preserve that condition of things at least, if we cannot improve upon it. </para>

                            <para>- By doing so mosquitoes are prevented from access to what would be their breeding grounds. Every measure which can be taken in this regard is to be commended. This Bill deals with one of those questions in connexion with which no expense should be spared. We have in Australia been free from many diseases that have devastated humanity in other parts of the world. It is highly desirable that we should preserve our freedom in that respect as long as we possibly can. Contacts with people in other parts of the world and communications with other parts of the world tend to increase our liability to the introduction of communicable diseases, and now that we have the opportunity we should endeavour, to the fullest measure of our power, to prevent the introduction into this community of any new deadly diseases. </para>

                    <para>As the Minister has said, this Bill is one that can be best dealt with in Committee. I do not know whether it is his intention to explain each clause as it is considered, but I notice that several of the proposed amendments appear to be merely verbal, and to be intended to make more clear what Parliament perhaps did not express as clearly a3 it might have done in the original measure. That Act has stood without amendment- except on one occasion - since 1908, and, as I said by way of interjection, that is almost a record in these days of amending legislation, and it is a tribute to the draftsman of the original measure. It was only natural to expect that with the increase of knowledge coupled with actual experience under the Act the necessity for some amendment would be disclosed.- The fact that it is proposed to amend it in 1915 is no reflection on the original measure of 1908. It merely evidences that this Parliament and the Quarantine Department are determined to keep abreast of modern science in relation to everything pertaining to the functions of quarantine. </para>

                        <para>. - I protest against the manner in which this measure has been introduced. The question of quarantine is a very important one. Science has discovered to us the fact that such apparently unimportant creatures as rats, mice, mosquitoes, and flies are the vehicles by which diseases of the most deadly character are spread amongst the community. That being so, one would imagine that any legislation dealing with a matter of this kind would be brought before Parliament in a decent fashion. But the Government have apparently forgotten that there is such a place as the Senate. If they have not forgotten it, they have evidently arrived at the conclusion that they have merely to introduce Bills into this Chamber, vouchsafe very little explanation of them, and afford honorable senators no time in which&#39; to gain information respecting them. </para>

I say that it is not now in order for him to refer to the suspension of the Standing Orders, or to the effect of their suspension, or to raise any objection to the course which has been adopted. Ample opportunity was afforded him to take exception to the procedure that has been adopted when the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders was moved a few minutes ago. Having allowed that motion to go by default, it is not now open to him, or to any other honorable senator, to question the propriety of suspending the .Standing Orders. </para>

The Minister in charge of the measure has given us no information as to the alterations which are proposed, and he has not afforded us an opportunity of acquiring that information for ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- But we have no time to discover what is in the Bill and what is not in it. I object to this system of legislation. When I was a member of the Queensland Parliament it was customary, when an amending measure was brought forward, for the alterations which it proposed to effect in the existing law to be shown upon its face. Thus, honorable members were enabled to intelligently discuss it. But nothing of the kind has been done here, and we have no opportunity of referring to the principal Act and ascertaining for ourselves what will be the effect of the proposed amendments. If this sort of thing is to be tolerated, then the sooner the Senate is abolished the better. Indeed, if such a system is to prevail, the sooner the Parliament is abolished the better, because if we acquiesce in it there is no earthly need for 111 members of this Parliament. All that is required is ten or eleven Ministers. They can very well run the whole show. Much money would thus be saved to the citizens of Australia at a time when the practice of economy is urgently required. A Government which&#39; brings forward measures in this fashion does not deserve to hold its position. Indeed, I go further, and say &#39;that a Senate which acquiesces in it has abandoned its self-respect, and is not discharging its duty to the people who elected it. I have no means of ascertaining the effect of any of the clauses embodied in this Bill, and, therefore, I will not attempt to discuss them. I shall content myself with again entering my protest against this method of introducing Bills and passing them through all stages without affording us time in which to obtain necessary information. </para>

                        <para>. - I would not have spoken upon this Bill but for an observation made by the Assistant Minister during the course of his second-reading speech, because I have not had time to peruse it and to make myself conversant with its aims. But the Assistant Minister stated that the purpose of tire measure was to make more emphatic the powers of the Quarantine Department in contradistinction to those possessed by the various Boards of Health. If that be so, I heartily welcome the measure. Though it may be a small Bill, I regard it as a very important one. If it will settle any differences in jurisdiction which exist to-day as between the central authorities and the State Boards of Health, I say that it is urgently needed. That has been brought home to me by the lack of action in regard to the present outbreak of meningitis, particularly in Victoria. I was somewhat astounded this morning when, for a purpose quite apart from that of this measure, I ascertained the effect of that malady up to a certain stage. The figures are really appalling. They go to show either that the quarantine departments did not have the necessary authority, or that they did not put into force whatever powers they had. The Victorian Board of Health has been almost criminally negligent in that regard. I found from reference to papers that, up to the 13th October, there had been 462 cases of meningitis in Victoria, namely, 193 cases from the metropolitan area, 179 cases amongst soldiers, and 90 cases from the rural districts. The number of deaths was 150, or a percentage of 34.2. That position of affairs seems to me to call for the loudest protest on behalf of the people of Victoria, as well as of Australia. I had a very close contact - as close as it could possibly be without being personal - with the small-pox scare in New South Wales some fifteen months ago. I am in a position to say that that outbreak was nothing more than an aggravated form of chicken-pox, which disappeared, leaving hardly any scars, and causing only one or two deaths. What was the position taken up then in New South Wales? The quarantine regulations were enforced very drastically. I make no complaint in that connexion, because I think it is the right course to take when the public health is endangered. For many months - in fact, for almost half-a-year - commercial Sydney complained very loudly against the retention of the quarantine restrictions. Indeed, the newspapers were full of complaints from commercial men ann others. It was said that the medical men of Sydney had raised the scare for their own advantage. I make no comment on that statement, taut I consider that the State authorities and the Federal Quarantine Department did the right thing on that occasion. If the powers of that Department are not sufficient to enable them to take drastic action in Victoria at the present time, I sincerely trust that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance in Committee that the Bill will grant the requisite authority, and that he will impress upon the Department the absolute necessity for taking some action. It appears to me that the Victorian Board of Health have taken no action, simply because this very serious outbreak has occurred just prior to a great annual festival, namely, the Melbourne Cup. If restrictions had been placed on the people as they should have been, it goes without saying that there would not have been the same influx to Melbourne as to previous Cup meetings. That would have been regrettable in many instances. Although I am not a racing man, I have no objection to racing. I have not yet seen &#39;a Melbourne Cup race, but I hope to do so on Tuesday next, whether the Senate adjourns or not, and when I go I generally speculate to the extent of a moderate half-sovereign. </para>

It is strange that the persons who have been afflicted, and those who, without being afflicted, may be carriers of the disease should be allowed their free will in travelling about this city in public conveyances and vehicles, thereby disseminating a very serious malady, and that not one effective preventive action has been taken by the responsible authorities. I sincerely trust that if this measure empowers the Quarantine Department to take action, the Minister will let us know when we come to the clause which confers that power. </para>

In regard to preventing the egress or ingress of mosquitoes, it may be at first view considered rather a light subject, and one to be dealt with in a not very serious manner, but I think it is a proper power for the Quarantine Department to acquire. In my opinion, it is a wise precaution to impose on the officers of vessels sailing into our waters or ports the responsibility of covering effectively such companionways, and so forth, as may liberate into Australia what I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> describe as prohibited immigrants - mosquitoes which might be the bearers of a great disease. </para>

                        has said regarding the importance of the subject; but in my opinion the Government would be open to a charge of laxity if, at such a stage as we have now reached, they were to resort to the usually slow and deliberate methods of introducing legislation. We all know that time does not permit of that course being taken. If we were beginning a session, instead of practically ending one, there might be something in the charge that we have not been allowed sufficient time for reflection. Undoubtedly the general health of the community is one of the most important questions upon which we could legislate. It is a question on which we are very much in the dark, and we have of necessity to grope our way, lay down our precedents, and find out methods of dealing with diseases. We know that it is of very little use to look to other countries for guidance. For instance, although we belong to the same race, the laws of the United Kingdom in this regard would be quite unsuited to our sunny country. It is more a geographical matter than a racial one. It would be a very grave mistake to adopt the methods of the Old Country in the hope of securing ourselves from diseases. Scarlet fever is not a quarantinable disease in the Old Land, but a fatal and quarantinable disease in India. Small-pox in India is considered of even less importance than scarlet fever, for it is not nearly so fatal to the Indians. It will be seen, therefore, that the question of the quarantine law is a very complicated one. I desire to say a few words regarding the mosquito. It has been the subject of a good many jokes. In my opinion we have not taken sufficient credit for the work which our doctors have done in dealing with the insect. In Papua
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jones,</inline>
                        of Samarai - I think that he is chief medical officer for the Territory - has undoubtedly done very great work as regards the abolition of the evil effects of mosquito bites. On the little island of Samarai, which is the principal seaport in the Territory,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jones,</inline>
                        by his firm administration and his inquiries into the harmful effects of the mosquito has been able to abolish serious evils, notwithstanding the fact that the people live in the tropics, and, therefore, are constantly in danger of contracting various diseases. We are informed that there is not a mosquito now on the island of Samarai, or in that particular seaport,
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">That excellent result has been obtained, I understand, by covering in the water deposits, and filling up waterholes, and thereby preventing water from stagnating. I am afraid that the people on the mainland have not taken sufficient warning from that lesson. We. know that there are many places at various seaports which are considered uncomfortable to live in simply because of the large number of mosquitoes existing there. I am surprised to think that in face of not only the well-known Panama case, but also the Samarai case, we on the mainland have not taken effective action in that direction. This is a matter in which the press might very well help by spreading the information that it is possible to abolish the mosquito. Newcastle has been mentioned&#39; as one of the ports where the mosquito pest is very prevalent, but if the same precautions were taken there as were taken in Papua, the mosquito pest could be abolished just as it has been in Samarai. We think we know all about the mosquito, but it is evident that we do not. Even in Newcastle, there are many varieties of this pest with regard to which we have yet a great deal to learn. It is expedient, therefore, that the local Boards of Health should be a little more energetic than they have been in the past. If we succeed in exterminating the mosquito we shall do a very great work for the people of this country. </para>

The result is that the Government feel it necessary, as soon-as possible, to place added power in the hands of the officers administering the quarantine laws, so as to afford more protection to the people of Australia&#34; owing to the fact that we shall be having more direct communication than  we  have had in the past with places where yellow fever is raging. The Constitution gives the Commonwealth absolute power  ever  quarantine matters. It is not necessary to consult the States in any way. The Commonwealth can legislate and administer legislation as far as quarantine  i3  concerned in any way that may be deemed desirable; but I remember that, when the principal Act was being discussed, it was pointed out that the best course to adopt was to seek the assistance of the State health authorities, so as to avoid any friction, and to provide for the more effective administration of the quarantine laws. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> is right in drawing attention to the serious aspect of a deadly disease in Victoria, but I would point out that there have been similar outbreaks in at least three of the States* - Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- I know there have been cases in Queensland and New South Wales, and that the health authorities there are dealing with it. I understand that the Defence Department requested the health authorities in those States to do all they possibly could to see that the law was carried out. It is quite true that a good deal can be done to prevent certain diseases finding a foothold in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot speak on that subject, but I think splendid work has been done by the institution established at Townsville to deal with tropical diseases. It is admitted that tropical fever and similar diseases are only met with in the tropics, and on account of the research work carried out by the Townsville institution, we know that the mosquito, which in other countries carries the germ of the yellow fever, exists in a very large part of Australia. But I gather from the reports of the Townsville institution that yellow fever is prevented from gaining a foothold in Australia because no yellow fever patients have reached Australia in such a , condition that the mosquito has been able to spread infection. As far as we can we ought to prevent such a state of affairs arising in this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has told us that the mosquito has been abolished in Samarai. I am glad to have that assurance, but I am rather doubtful about it. </para>

                            <para>- As far as Brisbane is concerned, I do not think the mosquito pest is nearly as troublesome as it was a few years ago for the simple reason that the health authorities have compelled the people to drain their land, and so do away with the breeding places. 1 The householders there have been put to a considerable expenditure. For instance they are not allowed to have rain-water tanks unless these are fitted with mosquito-proof strainers, even. to the overflow pipes from the tanks, so that in the event of mosquitoes breeding in the tanks, they will be unable to get out and thus spread disease, in any way. The Government are to be congratulated for having brought in the measure, even though it may be at an inconvenient time for&#39; honorable senators, who may thus not have an opportunity to look closely into its provisions. They are doing quite right in  asking the Senate to proceed with this Bill as soon as possible. </para>

It was not within my power to circulate the Bill until it had passed its first reading in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. and, therefore, I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> as he did not vote against the motion, supported the proposal for the suspension of the Standing Orders. The Bill contains no new vital principles whatever. All these were determined long ago, but it has been considered necessary to strengthen the principal Act, and stop up loopholes that have been discovered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> drew attention to the power to question an individual on a boat. Previously there was power to ask a captain <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> the surgeon of a boat about anybody on board. But a man anxious to reach his people immediately, and fearing that he may be prevented from landing, may very possibly try in every way to avoid being reported by the doctor, and in such a case the quarantine officer should rightly be able to make inquiries. I do not call this an original provision, but it is certainly a strengthening and tightening of the powers given in the Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is about the first man I ever heard who admired my eloquence, and wanted more of it. I cannot oblige him at this rather critical time, but, if on some future and more convenient occasion he repeats his request, I shall endeavour to oblige him. </para>

                        <para>. - Will the Minister indicate whether the Government have considered the advisableness of taking action about the present outbreak of meningitis in Victoria? So far, one person out of every three afflicted has died, and the total fatal cases in the Alfred Hospital have numbered 50 per cent. Plague, small-pox, and yellow fever are not &#34;in it&#34; with this disease. Certainly the plague as we knew it in Queensland was not &#34;in it.&#34; The people who died from the plague in Queensland were people who were pulled out of their beds in the middle of the night, and hurried long distances to hospitals while. in an advanced state of fever. I am justified in the statement that the fatalities from plague did not represent nearly so high a percentage as those which have occurred from meningitis. I am not one of those who blame the Defence Department for all the deaths that have occurred, because it is said that the soldiers have been carriers of infection. We might all be carriers unconsciously. I want to impress upon Ministers the seriousness of the matter, and I ask the Minister of Defence whether it might not be possible for him. under this clause to bring under the notice of his colleagues, not merely the advisableness, but the absolute necessity, of taking action in this matter, which has been, so callously neglected; by the Boards of Health, particularly in Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- I am looking forward with hope to the advent of warm weather&#39; on that account. Medical men have assured us that the disease is more or less endemic in Australia, and I quite believe that that is so, especially in the larger cities. I believe that New South Wales small-pox, which I described in that way for identification, is more or less endemic, and only occasionally breaks out in epidemic form. The present outbreak of meningitis is, I think, more serious than anything of the kind we have previously experienced in Australia, and it deserves, the serious consideration of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say a word or two on the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> as regards the outbreak of meningitis. First of all, meningitis has been with us for many years in practically all the States of the Commonwealth, but it has not been epidemic. There is undoubtedly a large percentage of fatalities from meningitis, but it should be remembered that there are many circumstances connected with an outbreak of meningitis which differentiate it entirely from other diseases of an infectious character. It is estimated by the Defence medical authorities that of the military cases more than 20 per cent, have occurred amongst men who, apparently, have not come in contact with the disease at all. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators will see that it is an extremely difficult disease to isolate. Its extension is probably due to the carrier who does not exhibit any signs of infection, but is yet capable of infecting others. I may inform the Committee that the matter has been by no means neglected. There has been a conference between the Victorian Board of Health and the military authorities, and a further conference has been arranged for. So far as the military camps are concerned, every precaution has been taken to combat the disease. Swabs were taken daily, and the nostrils of soldiers sprayed with eucalyptus and other disinfectants, and only half the previous number of men were accommodated in a tent. Where any person showed signs of influenza, which is very similar to the first stages of meningitis, he was kept under observation. </para>

                            <para>- No. The honorable senator refers to an unfortunate case of which I am aware. Mistakes are to be expected from human beings, and in one case to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> refers, a young fellow was sent home, whose illness was afterwards diagnosed as meningitis. In that particular case the doctor broke the instructions given to him, and honorable senators will agree that we cannot make any system fool-proof. The instructions given have, in the main, been observed, and everything possible has been done to prevent the spread of the disease. The question of its treatment by serum has been taken up, and a large quantity of serum has been obtained. As honorable senators are probably aware, it is the intention of the Government to establish a laboratory for the production of serum, not only for this, but for other&#39; diseases. I can only Bay that every means that has been suggested for combating the disease has been used. We have brought together the best minds in the Common wealth and State services to discover the best means of dealing with  the disease. I believe that it will disappear when the warm weather arrives. I am glad to be able to say that it has been completely stamped out in many of the military camps where it made its appearance. I understand that at the present time there are no cases of the disease at the Liverpool Camp, or in the camps in Tasmania, or in South Australia. </para>

Everything possible has been done by the Board of Health in Victoria, in co-operation with the officers of the Defence Department. It is undoubtedly a most difficult disease to deal with, but everything that medical science can suggest should be done is being done in order to cope with it. </para>

                        <para>. - In sub-clauses 2 and 3 of this clause an attempt is apparently made to give a dual authority - on the one hand, to a quarantine officer, and, on the other, to the Minister - to remove a ship from a given place to any other place. I should like to know whether the Minister considers this clause sufficiently clear to prevent a quarantine officer, by his interpretation of the words &#34;to an appointed place,&#34; in sub-clause 2, ordering the removal of a ship from the port &#34;In which she is to some other port? That might be prevented if the Minister thought it desirable by the insertion, after the word &#34;place,&#34; of the words &#34;not being another port.&#34; A vessel arriving at one of the north-western ports of Western Australia might, under this sub-clause, be ordered by a quarantine officer to go to Fremantle or Bunbury. In the same way, a vessel arriving in a Queensland port might be ordered to go to Brisbane, Maryborough, or Rockhampton. I presume that it is not intended to give such a power to any quarantine officer as would entitle him to order the removal of a ship from one port to another. </para>

We might blunder seriously if we did not give a quarantine officer the power conferred by this clause. Along our enormous coastline there is quite a number of small isolated ports. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It will be a manifest blunder if we do not endow quarantine officers at such ports with necessary powers. We all know that there are numbers of ports at which there is no quarantine station, and no fumigating plant. What will a quarantine officer do if a vessel is compelled to make one of those ports? He will be in a perfect dilemma. He will have no power to order the ship away, although its presence may be a menace to the health of the port. </para>

It may happen that the nearest port is the only port .which she is capable of making. If the quarantine officer there is not to have the power to order her to proceed to a port where she may be subjected to proper supervision, of what use is the Bill? I trust that the Minister will adhere to the clause as it stands. Some such provision is an absolute necessity. </para>

                        <para>. - There seems to be a little confusion in the minds of honorable senators, if I may judge by the remarks which have fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I merely wish to point out that all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> desires the Government to do is already provided for in the Bill. The view of the Government is that if it be necessary to order a ship from one port to another port, the matter is of a sufficiently serious character to warrant the necessary instruction emanating from the Minister alone. But if, for example, a disease broke out on a vessel lying at Victoria Dock, it will be within the power of a quarantine officer to order her into mid-stream. I trust that honorable senators will agree to the clause. </para>

                        <para>. -  Since the Assistant Minister made his explanation, I am hardly clear as to the intention of the clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> voiced the opinion that it is proposed to give possibly too much power to a quarantine officer. Let me take the case of a vessel upon which there is an outbreak of disease coming from the East, and whose first port of call is Cooktown, where there are no quarantine facilities. I take it that in such circumstances, the master of the vessel would not be permitted to take his ship out of port, unless under instructions from an officer of the Department. It seems only reasonable that we should vest in the quarantine officer at Cooktown the power to say to the master of any vessel upon which there is an outbreak of disease, &#34; I cannot deal with your vessel here. The best thing you can do is to take her to Townsville.&#34; But if, on the other hand, he has to wire to the Minister for the requisite instruction, we may be unnecessarily endangering life. &#34;We all know that the sooner the people on an infected vessel can be quarantined the better. But if a vessel has to be detained whilst wires are transmitted to Melbourne to secure the necessary Ministerial authority, delay will be inevitable. </para>

                        <para>. - This proposal seems to me to be perfectly clear. Paragraph 3 of the clause seeks to endow the Minister with certain powers, and to exclude any other person from exercising those powers. The use of the term &#34; the Minister &#34; implies that those powers are to be confined to him. As the Assistant Minister has already pointed out, it is proposed, under subclause 2, to vest in a quarantine officer the power to order the removal of an infected ship from one place to another. But that power relates only to places within a port. The officer will have no power to order the removal of a ship from one port to another. That authority is expressly reserved to the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- The clause is of a general character, and does&#39; not apply to any particular case. In certain circumstances it may be very important that a vessel lying alongside a wharf should be ordered away as quickly as possible without any reference to the head office. The officer on the spot may be trusted to realize the gravity and urgency of the situation, and, if necessary, to order her out into the stream. But the power to order a vessel from one port to another is intended to reside exclusively in the Minister. The proposed new sub-section will be applicable only to a vessel under a certain set of circumstances, which is expressly provided for in section 78a of the principal Act. </para>

                        <para>. - When I previously addressed myself to this question, I did so on the assumption that the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who had the principal Act before him, was correct. I now find that I was slightly misled by his remarks. Nevertheless, my contention still holds good. If, under the principal Act, a quarantine officer has not the power that I think he has, we ought certainly to clothe him with that power under this Bill. </para>

I am informed that, under a provision which is not mentioned in this measure, the quarantine officer possesses such power. </para>

                            <para>- We can readily understand the case of a ship calling in suddenly at an isolated port, perhaps in the north-west of the continent. If the quarantine officer at the port had not the necessary power to act he would require to telegraph to Melbourne to acquaint the Minister, and the Minister, on his part, would have to wire authority for the ship to proceed to another port. It can be easily understood that much valuable time would be lost by the delay, and that the spread of a very serious disease might take place. Take a case which is likely to occur. Suppose that a ship were to call in at a distant port on a Saturday. By the time a telegram could reach Melbourne, the Minister, perhaps, would be out of town and the office closed. The ship would have to remain at the port till Monday, and a serious disease would be raging on board before the quarantine officer could obtain the necessary power to order the ship to go on to another port. If, however, the necessary provision is already made in the principal Act, my contention is answered. </para>

                        <para>. - The remarks I have to address to the Committee will not refer to the subject-matter of this clause, but to the breviate or marginal note. Section 87 is the section of the original Act. which is proposed to be amended by this clause. I do not know what the section is, but we can guess at a glance that it deals with the regulations. If the Government cannot see their way to provide honorable senators with a copy of the original Act, showing the proposed amendments to be made, they might supply a little more information in the marginal note. If, for instance, the breviate to clause 9 of this Bill was &#34; Amendment of section 87 - Regulations,&#34; or if the Government would reprint the breviate of the original section which is to be amended, we would know what we were asked- to deal with. Going back to the last clause for the purpose of illustration, had we known the breviate to section 78a we would not probably have taken so long on the clause. We would have realized that it was amending a special, rather than a general, section. If the Government are forced by time and the printer to deprive us of the opportunity to see the original measure, they might help us considerably in Committee if they would print the breviate of the original section to be amended. It would give us a better idea of the provision of the Act with which a clause dealt. I hope that, in the future, honorable senators will be vouchsafed that small amount of information as a minimum. </para>

                        <para>. - At one time we had a practice which contributed very much to the convenience of honorable senators when they were discussing an amending Bill. Every provision to be omitted from the Act was shown by the use of erased type, and any new provision was printed in block type, so that the proposed alterations could be seen at a glance. If that practice were resumed, we would not require to have a copy of the Act in our hands, and to glance from one measure to the other. It is not an easy matter to look up an Act in the bound volumes. It takes some time to find a measure, and then, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> reminds me, there are not enough volumes to go round. In recent years that very admirable practice has been dropped, but I do not know why. I hope that it will be reverted to. </para>

I think that it also tends to facilitate business. Not only shall I note the suggestion made, but I will bring it under the notice of my colleagues, and, as far as it is possible for us against time, carry it out. I ask honorable senators to remember that the Government is a new one, being only two days old. We did not desire honorable senators to waste any time, but as we grow and become stronger I hope that there will be less complaints on this score. The clause before the Committee deals simply with the power to make regulations under the Act. It gives complete power to do all that may be deemed essential by the medical authorities to safeguard Australia against disease. </para>

                <para>I wish to refer to a matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> and referred to by some other honorable senators, concerning the distribution of Christmas gifts to our soldiers. Instructions were issued by my direction of 1st September last with a view to the organization of the supply of gifts being taken in hand in all States without delay. Action was immediately taken in the matter, and large consignments of Christmas comforts are already in transit to England and Egypt. The distribution will be effected under the supervision of the Red Cross Commissioners, Messrs. Adrian Knox and Brookes, in the case of sick and wounded and hospital staffs, and by the Patriotic Societies&#39; Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Budden, in the case of comforts for those at the front, and in training in Egypt. Every possible facility has been extended those engaged in forwarding gifts to men in the firing line to enable them to carry out the donors&#39; wishes to the fullest possible extent, and advice has been received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Budden</inline> stating that no effort has been spared by the responsible Military authorities to assist him in carrying out this work, opportunity having been provided him to visit men in the trenches and distribute goods with the help of the unit commanders. Advices are received from the distributing officers from time to time of the nature of the gifts and the comforts required, and the respective patriotic societies are at once communicated with in order that such articles may be promptly collected and shipped. The troops occupying the late German Pacific Islands are included in this scheme of distribution, as are the Australian troops in France, and the wounded Australian soldiers in England. Efforts are also being made with a view to providing a supply of such gifts for the Australian Aviation Corps on active service. On several occasions I have publicly referred to the excellence of the work carried out by the Bed Cross Society, - whose efforts in the cause of the amelioration of the condition pf sick and wounded have been undertaken so systematically and energetically and I am glad of this opportunity of inviting attention to the patriotic and public spirited action of those societies whose energies are directed in providing comforts additional to approved army issues to the actual -fighting troops, and to publicly convey to them the appreciation of the Department for the manner in which they have undertaken the work. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;5.251.  -  I wish to draw attention to the fact that, in answer to a question from me concerning the payment of Australian prisoners of war in Turkey, the Minister in April last said that provision was to be made by the Commonwealth Government for the payment to them of &#163;3 per month. I want now to bring under his notice the fact that one of our soldiers taken prisoner, John Keiran wrote, on 21st August, to his father in Coolamon, and stated -

                    <para>. - The statement read by the Minister showing what is being done with regard to the despatch of Christmas gifts to our troops must, I think, be satisfactory to all of us, as it will be to the public generally. I sincerely hope that the efforts now being made will be successful. Yesterday I asked a question with reference to the Australian troops at Basra, and I note that the Minister in his statement made reference to them, saying that efforts were being made to have the Australian Aviation Corps included in this scheme for the distribution of Christmas gifts. I do not think that it is very generally known, and certainly not as well known as it might be, that a number of Australians are doing fine work for the Allies at Basra. We might say with regard to our troops at Gallipoli, in France, and elsewhere, that they are constantly in the public eye, and we might well imagine that their wants will not be forgotten during the forthcoming festive season. But those others to whom I refer are more remote, and they can hardly be expected to come so much under public notice. By reason of that fact our interest in them might well he a little stimulated. Those who have relatives there have found that the rates of postage on mail matter are comparatively high, and altogether out of proportion to the rates prevailing on mail matter and parcels between Australia and Egypt or Gallipoli. It has to he remembered that the present rates to Egypt and Gallipoli are not normal charges, hut have been reduced since the war began to bring them into line with rates on mail matter going to England, I understand from inquiries made that the Indian Government have been communicated with concerning the rates on mail matter and parcels for our troops at Basra, and I trust that the communications which are passing between the authorities here and the authorities in India will be pushed speedily to a successful conclusion. I feel assured that if the Indian Government are responsible in any way they will be quite prepared to meet the Commonwealth Government in the same way as the British authorities have met us concerning postage rates to Egypt and Gallipoli. The Australians at Basra are more remote from their friends than are those in Egypt and Gallipoli, and it is to be hoped that they will not be forgotten during this Christmas season. I earnestly hope that the negotiations which I know are passing between the Commonwealth and the Indian Governments will soon be successful and that those Australians who have taken their lives in their hands in that remote area of this great conflict will be reminded of the fact that we in Australia are not unmindful of them and of their heroic efforts on behalf of the Empire. </para>
