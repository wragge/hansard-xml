                            <para>- It is the desire of the Commonwealth, and I speak now, not only of the Government, but of the whole people, to assist Great Britain and her Allies in the supply of munitions of war. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, all arrangements for the placing of contracts for munitions of war must be made, in the first place, by the Minister of Munitions of the Imperial Government. When the Commonwealth approached that Government on this matter, it was with a view to ascertaining whether the resources of this Government and of private enterprise throughout the Commonwealth could be utilized to supply munitions of war generally, and high explosive shell in particular, and whether they could in this way be of assistance to the Mother Country. After,, as honorable senators know, a very long delay, we received a final and definite reply that such assistance would be welcomed. The Minister of Munitions has further intimated that he is prepared to take an unlimited quantity of high explosive shells, not shrapnel, and has stated the price he is prepared to pay. He has further intimated that for this purpose the Commonwealth Government is his representative in Australia. We have six State Governments in Australia, all of whom possess well-equipped manufacturing works in the shape of their railway workshops. Many of these are, perhaps, the best manufacturing workshops in the iron trade in the different States. We have, in addition, many very highly developed manufacturing establishments controlled by private enterprise. The Commonwealth Government desire to utilize to the fullest extent the State Government agencies and the workshops controlled by private enterprise, so as to secure a maximum output of the shells required from Australia. In order that the necessary in-  formation might be provided in a form in which it could be utilized by the State workshops and by those in charge of private establishments, I took occasion to establish what is known as the Central Munitions Committee associated with the Defence Department. That Committee has associated with it expert&#39;s in various matters, and has been at work at this particular business. </para>

                            <para>- The supply to State Government workshops and those controlled by private enterprise of the information necessary to enable them to determine whether they can take any part in the work of turning out high explosive shells for the Minister of Munitions in the Old Country. In the various States, at the time this question was given prominence in the press, greater or less activity was displayed by manufacturers, and in some cases by State Governments, to ascertain whether they could do anything in this regard. In New South Wales, the State Government called together representatives of the manufacturing interest, and associated with them representatives of their own manufacturing shops, upon a Committee which they charged with the duty of determining whether New South Wales could do anything in the direction of supplying munitions. That action was taken after the action taken here to form the Central Munitions Committee. In Victoria, the lead in the matter was taken by the Chamber of Manufactures, but they also had associated with them in their inquiries persons not directly connected with that chamber. In other States similar action was taken. For instance, in Western Australia, the Chamber of Manufactures and the Chamber of Commerce held a conference at which representatives of Labour organizations were also present. They approached the Government of Western Australia, and, as a result, that Government sent a joint deputation to Melbourne to interview me, and also to attend any conference that might be called in this city. The deputation represented the Chamber of Manufactures and the State Government workshops. The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures took action to call together, in the first instance, representatives of the Chambers of Manufactures in each of the States, so that a conference might be held to discuss what they could do in this matter in the different States. When they learned that other bodies were taking action in the matter, they extended their invitation, and called a conference, not only of the Chambers of Manufactures in the different States, but of representatives of other bodies that were not associated with those chambers. At the time of the convening of that conference, the definite information I have referred to as to the requirements of the Minister of Munitions had not been received, but before the conference met it was received. I was then asked to attend the Conference and explain what part the Commonwealth Government thought the various bodies could play in carrying out the manufacture of munitions in Australia, and in what way their efforts might be best directed. I attended the Conference, which I may say was a thoroughly representative one. There were present at it representatives of all the States with the exception of South Australia, the absence of whose representatives was due to an unfortunate and unavoidable accident. There were present representatives of the State Governments, Chambers of Manufactures, mining interests, and the employees in the engineering trades. The Iron. Trades Council and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers were both represented. At that Conference I explained the steps which the Government were taking, and suggested that in each State there should be an amalgamation of the various bodies which had been making inquiries into this matter so that they might form a State Munitions Committee, the convening body connected with that amalgamation being the State Government. In other words, I suggested that the State Governments should call these various bodies together in their respective territories, and that their amalgamation should constitute a State Munitions Committee. </para>

                            <para>- No. The idea was that each State Committee should nominate a representative of that State to the Central Munitions Committee, which is associated&#39; with the Defence Department. The Central Munitions Committee is largely composed of experts. As it is the body which will have to place the orders for shells, which will have to arrange for the workers and for the delivery of the shells, and as it will require to be in close touch with the State Committees in order that it may know what quantity of shells each State can manufacture, and where orders can be placed, it is necessary to have on that Committee a direct representative of each State Munitions Committee. That proposal was unanimously adopted by the Conference; and, acting upon it, the Commonwealth Government have communicated with the Government of each State, asking them to take steps for such amalgamation, and to convene a State Munitions Committee. Some misapprehension appears to have cropped up in regard to this matter, but I think it is due to a lack of knowledge as to the exact part which these State Committees are to play. We believe that decentralization in the carrying out of the work is desirable. We think that State Munitions Committees, constituted in the way I have outlined, will have a better knowledge of the capacity of the workshops of their respective States than will a Committee of departmental officers with whom are associated certain experts. It will be for the Central Munitions Committee to obtain the desired information, and to then disburse the orders received from the Ministry of Munitions in England, according to the ability of the different States to manufacture the requisite number of shells. If the State Committees are constituted upon these lines, we shall have cohesion, and it will be a working arrangement which will link up the various interests concerned. The workers who are interested will have a representative on each State Munitions Committee, so also will the manufacturers, and each State Government. On the Central Munitions Committee we shall have a representative of each of the State Munitions Committees, as well as a number of experts, naval, military, chemical, &#38;c, including university professors and others who possess special ability to sift information and decide about inspection, and all that sort of thing! I trust that these remarks will assist in clearing the atmosphere, and in removing any misapprehension which may exist outside as to what is really being aimed at. </para>

                            <para>- Captain Thring is an expert ordnance officer - that is to say, his whole training in the British Navy has been in connexion with ordnance, which includes, not shell manufacture, but the using of shells and a knowledge of their composition.  Colonel Dangar has  had a similar training on the artillery side in our land Forces. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marcus</inline> Bell is the chief chemical adviser of the Commonwealth. He has a knowledge of chemistry and a special knowledge of explosives. For many years he has been in charge of our cordite supplies inspection branch, and of all matters connected therewith. Professor Payne is the Professor of mechanical engineering at the Melbourne University. He is a specialist in that particular line. He, too, has not been primarily connected with the manufacture of shells, but the making of shells is one of those subjects which come within the range of his general knowledge. Professor Masson is professor of chemistry at the Melbourne University, and is an expert in that particular line. It was in that sense that I referred to these gentlemen as experts, and not in the narrower sense that they are experts in the making of shells. </para>

(representing the Ministerial side) . It is intended that the Committee shall deal with all such questions as are referred to it by the Government, and that the Minister whose Department may be affected by any particular question referred to it shall preside over the meeting dealing with that question. It has also been decided that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition shall be <inline font-style="italic">ex-officio</inline> members of it. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to know from the Minister of Defence if any definite scheme has been laid down in connexion with the return of wounded soldiers from the hospitals to Australia; whether soldiers who have been only slightly wounded are allowed to return to the Commonwealth in the hope that they will be sufficiently recovered in a few weeks to return to the front ? Is it the custom for the Minister of Defence, through his officers, to determine whether a wounded soldier may return to Australia or not? </para>

                        <para>- A soldier remains a soldier after he is wounded, and he is still under military orders. He has to go to the hospital to which he is sent, and he cannot return to Australia by his own choice. It is for the War Office to determine where he shall go and when he shall go; it is not a question for the individual soldier at all. If he is wounded, the General Officer Commanding determines to which hospital he shall be sent, and when he shall be sent; and the officer in charge of the hospital determines when a soldier is sufficiently recovered to return to the front, or whether he shall be sent back to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Department is at present preparing a reprint of all regulations made under Commonwealth Acts from the establishment of the Commonwealth to the end of last year, and in force on 31st December last. In addition, the more important of the prerogative orders of the Commonwealth issued during that period will be included. The reprint will run into three volumes, two of which are expected to be ready within about a month, while the third volume will probably be available several months hence. The price of the reprint will be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 18s. for half-calf copies of the work, and &#163;3 3s. for cloth copies. In addition, the Department contemplates publishing each year a volume of the statutory rules issued during the year. This volume will be arranged on the same principle as the consolidated edition above referred to, and the price of it will be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 10s. for half-calf copies of the work, and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 5s. for cloth copies. It is also intended to issue the statutory rules, commencing with the present year, in monthly parts to subscribers to the annual volume. The cost of annual volumes and monthly parts for a year will be- half-calf <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 5s., cloth &#163;2. AH of the above publications will be obtainable from Butterworth and Company (Australia) Limited, of 180 Philip-street, Sydney. The Government Printer supplies copies of any Statutes to all persons applying for the same, and sending money in payment. The Statutes are supplied until the amount forwarded has been exhausted. The Government Printer has agents in most of the States, from whom the copies of the Statutes are obtained. </para>

                O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;3.36&#93;.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council would have done better to adhere to his first opinion that the amendment was one which the Government could accept. In this case first thoughts were better than second, for I failed to be convinced by the arguments he afterwards advanced against the proposal. We are taking stock of our available assets. There can be no question that it is for some ulterior purpose, and although no taxation proposals are before us now, the census may be the basis for some means of raising money later on. The Minister has given the Committee an assurance that churches, charities, friendly societies, &#38;c, which would be exempt under the amendment, are not to he taxed. Why, then, encumber the return with information that gives us no intelligence regarding anything that will be an available asset in respect of any action that may be taken later on ? These individuals and institutions should not be put to the trouble of making returns that will be of no subsequent value to the Government. The amendment follows the precedent of the exemption under the Commonwealth Land Tax Act.

                    <para>. -  The object of the amendment is, briefly, to leave out of account in connexion with the returns to be furnished under this Bill the charitable, educational, and religious establishments throughout the Commonwealth. Why should we lumber the proposed census with a mass of information that has no bearing whatever upon the purpose for which it is to be made? The .  Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that it is not the intention of the Government to take action in the matter of the imposition of taxation as the result of the operation of this Bill. We may readily acquit the Government of any such intention. The Minister went on to say that it is necessary for present purposes that the Government should know exactly what is the material wealth of the country. If that be the object of the Bill, there is neither point nor utility in asking those who have control of religious, educational, and charitable institutions to furnish a return under the measure. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but I point out that if they do furnish returns the Government will still be. far from knowing, from the information to be obtained&#39; under this Bill, what is the material or negotiable wealth of the country. For instance, no provision is made for a return of the value of the institutions controlled by the Education Departments of the various States. They are not to be asked to supply any inventory of the value of the schools and other forms of wealth which they control. If we are not to get this information in respect of institutions controlled by the State Governments, what possible purpose can be served in estimating the wealth of the Commonwealth by compelling returns to be furnished in regard to teaching institutions managed by sections of the community? In this matter the Bill makes a half-hearted, slip-shod, and ill-considered attempt to arrive at the wealth represented by educational establishments in Australia. There are other forms of wealth controlled by agencies of the State Governments, such as benevolent institutions, of which no return is to be made. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. What attempt is there made under this Bill to enforce returns of the wealth represented by State railways? If the object of the measure be to secure information of the material wealth of the Commonwealth, that the Government may be able later to consider what form drafts upon that wealth should take, how can it be effected if, while private citizens are compelled to furnish returns, State Governments and their agencies are to be under no such obligation in respect to the institutions under their control ? I might mention many other forms of wealth under the control of State Governments. In some cases mines are worked by State Governments. No return of the value of these mines is to be furnished under this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that every mine has some value, though the value of many mines is very low, as some of  US  know to our sorrow. When a Bill is submitted which will not accomplish the object of those who submit it, it cannot be supported upon solid ground. As to the means of arriving at a correct estimate of the value of some of the properties in connexion with which returns have to be made under the Bill as it stands. I take the case of a church in a remote part of the country. What value can be put upon it, and what system can be called into operation to assess the annual value of a church, charitable institution, or school ? </para>

                        <para>- There is no attempt made to exempt such properties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> need be under no illusion on that score. I should not support, any more than would the honorable senator, the exemption from enumeration under this Bill of any form of educational institutions returning a profit to those controlling it. I am dealing only with the folly of passing a measure which will not serve the purpose in view. How will it help us to advance our position on the European continent, or to perfect our local defences, to know how much money is invested in churches, educational and benevolent institutions that return no profit to those controlling them ? Such information would not have the slightest bearing upon our capacity to defend this country here, at Gallipoli, in France, or anywhere else. To ask for returns as to the value of churches for this purpose is to make ourselves ridiculous. Take the case of a charitable institution such as the Refuge at Abbotsford. Who could furnish an estimate of the value of that institution ? We are calling upon the people controlling such institutions to furnish these returns without any necessity, and to no end. Those in charge of religious, educational, and charitable institutions can have no serious objection to the furnishing of such returns other than that it would give them a great deal of trouble and difficulty to arrive at a correct estimate of the value of the institutions they control, and they would not put their hands to an inaccurate estimate, whilst the return, when furnished, would be of no advantage whatever in promoting the object for which this Bill has been introduced. </para>

                    <para>. - I suppose that no section of this Parliament would desire to levy taxation upon the lands or properties which it is the intention of the amendment to exempt from the provisions of the Bill. But there seems to me to be a middle course between taxing these properties and asking for a return of their value. It is quite true that many institutions have, in addition to lands and properties which they use for special purposes, from which no  profit  is derived, other properties in relation to which they stand in the position of an ordinary landlord. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that, but it seems to me that it would be a much more business-like way to treat those who control these establishments in the same way in which people are treated in connexion with the levy of an income tax. Under this Bill it is proposed that every person, no matter what his income may be, must furnish a return of it, but no one supposes that- there will not be a line of exemption in the imposition of an income tax. What the exemption will be I do not know, but if there is to be a tax levied on wealth, we know there will be some line of exemption drawn. If we are to exempt the properties proposed to be exempted from the necessity for a return under the amendment, because they are not to be taxed, to be logical we should provide that only those persons) whose incomes are above the amount to be taxed should furnish a return of their income. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed under this Bill that every person between the ages of eighteen and sixty years shall furnish a return of his income. If a man is in receipt of an income of only &#163;1 per week, he will have to furnish a return, but to tax a man receiving an income of only &#163;1 per week is unthinkable. Such a man is in the same position in regard to his income as the institutions which have been referred to are in with regard. to the properties  from  which they derive no profit. I am dealing with the argument of non-liability to taxation as a reason for not making a return. It seems to me that all should be liable to furnish these returns, and it should be left to the taxation officials to say what incomes and what properties should be exempt from taxation. They should be in a position t o say that the properties belonging to institutions of which a return had been furnished are not liable to taxation, just as it will be left to them, and not to the persons sending in a return, to say what incomes are not liable to income tax. </para>

There is, first, the constitutional difficulty of taxing the instrumentalities of a State, or of the Commonwealth Government: and there is also the consideration that there is no sense in taxing institutions which the people themselves maintain.

                        <para>- I have no objection to municipal authorities being called upon to furnish returns of the value of properties and land under their control. But there is a difference between a board and a private individual. We can always trace the property of such an institution as the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, for example. But sometimes a conflict arises as to who is the owner of a piece of land. There are quite a number of persons who. because of municipal rates, will- not disclose their ownership of l!ind. I have heard a member of this Chamber offer to give land away because his ownership of it was known and he was not able to divest himself of it. In such circumstances it is easy to understand that a conflict may. arise as to ownership. But if the ownership is disclosed in the returns sought under this Bill, no possible harm can result to the owner, because it is well understood that it is not intended to levy taxation on the owners of such property as is covered by the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I was under the impression that the honorable senator was. I say that the Parliament which would impose an income tax on incomes of &#163;1 a week&#39; would be guilty of anything. Under this Bill we are asking every farmer to supply us with a return showing the number of horses and mules that he possesses. But does anybody imagine that we are going to tax him upon the possession of those animals ? </para>

But we do not desire to create the impression that the things in regard to which the people are going to be taxed are those which they are asked to include in these returns. The Bill is intended to secure useful information. Although church lands may be of no value for taxation purposes, if once we permit of exemptions, where shall we leave off? Why, at a time like this should we shirk trouble? Why should any section of the community exclaim in a crisis such as that with which we are now faced, &#34; This is too much for us to be asked to do &#34; ? </para>

I regard the information which is being sought under this Bill as of greater importance than that which is apparently attached to it in connexion with taxation which may be imposed upon property held by the people of the Commonwealth. If there is one thing which ought to be known it is the wealth of our churches and benevolent institutions. If that .information served no other purpose than that of disclosing to the world the extent to which our people are imbued with those higher qualities which make for nationhood, I think that it should be supplied. </para>

I take it that the idea underlying this measure is that we should be furnished with complete knowledge of our possessions. To omit from these returns information as to our benevolent institutions would be to the lasting discredit of this Parliament. There is nothing in connexion with our religious and benevolent institutions of which we need feel ashamed. It will be no trouble to them to furnish the desired information. It would be a pity indeed if any false ideas prevented the supplying of that information which will stand to the credit of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - We must not lose sight of the possibility that within a year or two we may be called upon to resort to the extreme of taxing all wealth without any exemptions whatever. Should that time unfortunately arrive, if we now exempt certain properties from the necessity to supply returns - as is proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> - it may then be necessary to take another census. I do not think it is intended in the immediate future to tax charitable, religious, or educational institutions which are not being carried on for the sake of profit. But the fact remains that within a year or two we may be up against a stiffer financial proposition than that with which we are faced to-day, and it may then be quite impossible to exempt institutions in our midst which everybody acknowledges are doing splendid work. </para>

                        <para>- There might come a time when it will be necessary.. We must not forget that this taxation will be raised for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of defending all Australian property, and such properties will be included in that category, so that it is probable those who are responsible for the conduct of those institutions will, when the time comes, be quite satisfied to meet their share of the liability. I think &#39;that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> did not mean what he said just now, and that his interjection was made in a jocular manner. The time may come - we all hope it will not - when, if this war lasts longer than we hope it will, we shall be so financially embarrassed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will be of the same opinion as I am now regarding taxation of property. The time may come when these institutions which are exempted to-day under our Land Tax Act will be included under special war taxation ; but if we accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> amendment now, we shall not have the necessary information to guide us. I do not think any great harm can be done by allowing the information to be gathered in this census, especially while we are all of the opinion that such properties will not be included in any taxation measures proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I think we will. We know that in some of the States municipalities carry on various enterprises, employ labour, and enter into contracts for the performance of work in connexion with their respective undertakings. I read the other day a highly interesting interview in the Melbourne Herald with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ellery,</inline> a gentleman who, until lately, filled an important position as town clerk of Adelaide. In that interview, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ellery</inline> briefly but pithily stated what had been done by the City Council of Adelaide in certain directions. He stated that a considerable sum of money had been expended by the municipality in undertakings which would continue to be of material advantage to the citizens of the metropolitan area. Thousands of pounds had been expended in these works for the common good, and they were making substantial profits on those enterprises. That is typical of many municipalities in Australia ; and I, with other members of the Labour party, have for a long time been extremely anxious that we should have such information at our disposal as would enable those who favour the municipalization of such enterprises to place facts and figures before the people of Australia to convince them that enterprises carried on by municipalities are much better than private enterprises. In such circumstances, would not such a return as is contemplated under this schedule be invaluable to everybody? </para>

                        <para>- Well, they have their markets, and they derive revenue from these municipal undertakings as well as from lands upon which substantial buildings have been erected. The Council also control largely the electric lighting, and are interested in other enterprises. Valuable information with regard to such undertakings will not be available to us if this amendment is carried. Like other members of the Labour party, I am connected with trade unions which own buildings and lands, and I think a return giving first-hand information of their value would be extremely useful. </para>

                            suggests that we get that information from other sources, and my reply to his statement is that some members who have given their support to this Bill have said that it is unnecessary to introduce such a measure, because much, if not the whole, of the information sought under this schedule is already available in different statistical works. But I would point out that to find that information we have to fossick hour after hour, whereas if we had it in the form contemplated in this schedule it would be readily available.

                        <para>- Yes, if they are managed for pecuniary profit.; but I want to know what pecuniary profit means. I understand it to mean that some individuals who are engaged in a particular undertaking, make a profit, and thus derive a pecuniary profit from it for themselves. But in connexion with these religious enterprises to which I am referring, the profits are utilized afterwards for religious or educational purposes. No single person derives any pecuniary profit from their use, and the same applies to other kindred associations that are engaged in undertakings. Once you make an exemption, you open the door, and once the door is owen, as suggested by this amendment, the returns will not be so complete as is desired. </para>

We have every reason to expect that we shall have the hearty co-operation of municipal, State, and Federal authorities in respect of this return. If I had any doubt in. my mind that the Government proposed to tax enterprises controlled by municipal, State, or charitable organizations, I should hesitate before I would cast my vote against this amendment; but because we have received an assurance from the Government that there is no intention to tax any of these institutions, I am going to vote against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- You should get very close to it. If the Government found it imperative to resume, say, St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral corner to safeguard the interests of the citizens, does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> think that those responsible for the conduct of the church and grounds would not be able to approximate the value they desired to obtain from the Government? If they could not, they would not be business men. Not long ago the Government were anxious to purchase a municipal building and land, and the municipality was very quick to place on it the value . they thought they should obtain for it. I do not think the deal was ever effected. The main objection is that the Bill will cause trouble. No return asked for by the Government is considered by the average man easy to fill in. &#34;We shall be asking the physically strong and the physically weak, the halt, the maim, and the blind to fill up schedules, and I do not expect that a number of people will find it a very easy matter. </para>

If we ask all and sundry, literate and illiterate, to fill in the first schedule, it will be a mistake to exempt anybody in regard to either the first or the second schedule.

                        <para>- Then the Minister is about the only member of the Senate who does not intend it. If the land on which St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral stands was used for the same purpose as the building on the opposite corner, imagine the taxable value of the block then as against its present value! What taxation could the Government get out of St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral to-day? Used for its present purpose, the block has no taxable value. The simpler the form in which we get the information aimed at by the Bill the better. In questions of taxation we ought to be able to discriminate between wealth and capital. Take the case of private hospitals or public charitable hospitals, and St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital as a particular instance. How can any one value the land, building, or equipment of that institution for any purpose covered by this Bill ? I cannot believe that the day will ever come in this country when it will be proposed to tax charitable institutions such as that hospital. </para>

                        <para>- We may apply to some of them to take our returned wounded, but that argument only emphasizes the absurdity of thinking of taxing institutions of the kind. All these things show the advantage of carrying the amendment. Notwithstanding the assertions of the Minister, one of the ultimate objects of the Bill is the taxation of wealth. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot foresee the possibility of anything of the kind. The amendment does not exempt church property leased to third parties for purposes of profit, arid that fact should be sufficient to show that, the interests of the community will be safeguarded. If I thought there was any probability of the Government losing taxation to which they are justly entitled. I would not advocate this proposal, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> proposes to exclude from his amendment all information that is really required under the Bill to carry out what must be the ultimate object of the Government. That being so. if we do not exempt the institutions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> wants to exempt, we shall be building up a most elaborate return that will be very difficult to fill in. It is our duty, seeing that we want the census taken as quickly and as (  cheaply as  possible,  to simplify the schedules as much as we can, and the amendment will certainly simplify the second schedule. </para>

According to the honorable senator, it is a wicked and dangerous Bill, and no one can tell what may follow if it is passed. He informed us that nine out of every ten members of the Senate know that the Bill has been introduced for the purpose of establishing conscription. I can see no connexion between this Bill and conscription or taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to tell the honorable senator. The whole of the argument advanced this afternoon in support of the amendment amounts only to an objection to the Bill because of the trouble it will give the persons who&#62; will be responsible for making returns in respect of the properties which have been referred to. No taxation is suggested, and conscription is not suggested. The Minister says that he wants to get a fair  idea of the value of all property in the Commonwealth. </para>

Their whole objection to the inclusion of the properties to which reference has been made, amongst those for which returns must be furnished, is the trouble that it will give those who have control of such properties. If I have any fault to find with the Bill, it is that it does not make provision for sup plying all the information we require. It has been said that no return of the value of public utilities will have to be furnished under the Bill, and I remind those who have used that argument in support of the amendment that the best way to improve the Bill is not to exempt other properties, but to include public utilities amongst the forms of wealth for which returns must be furnished. </para>

                        <para>- Those are only personal returns. The Bill makes no provision for returns, of the value of State properties and public utilities. It should not be forgotten that information of the value of State and municipal utilities may be obtained from the balance-sheets which are issued in respect of them every year. No good case has been made out for the exemption of properties controlled by religious and charitable organizations. In my view the arguments which have been used in support of the amendment can only prejudice the measure beforehand in the minds of th,e people, with whom any proposal for the furnishing of inquisitorial returns is always sufficiently unpopular. I hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment, as no good reason has been given for the exemption of the properties1 which have been referred to. </para>

                    <para>. - I can scarcely understand why the amendment has been submitted. Information as to the value of the lands and properties controlled by religious and charitable organizations will surely be very useful. If we make the exemption proposed, where should we stop ? If we proceeded far in the direction of the amendment, the returns provided for would be so whittled down as to make the census of no value at all. If church and charitable organizations and friendly societies were consulted on the subject, I am afraid that not one-third of them would object to furnish these returns. I have for a very long time been connected with friendly societies, and I say for such societies throughout Australia that nine to one of their members would agree to send in the returns asked for, that the resources of Australia might be known. I have always been closely connected with church life, and, speaking also for church people. I say that they would have  no hesitation in furnishing returns of the value of their property. It has been said that it is a difficult matter to estimate the value of a church. I was reminded by that statement of the fact that in the little city where I live, the authorities of the denomination to which I belong were offered &#163;10,000 for a church which the intending purchaser proposed to convert into a warehouse. The church authorities refused to sell the property for that amount, but if the sale had been made the purchaser would, under this Bill, have been obliged to furnish a return of the value of the property. If any of the properties which have been referred to changed hands, returns would have to be furnished of their value. I have in mind a place where the authorities of a certain church in the early days received a large grant of land, which is called Glebe Land. That land at one time was comparatively idle, and I have myself seen crops of oats grown on it; but to-day there are scores of beautiful buildings erected on that land. The area is considerable, and portions of the land were sold on a ninety-nine years&#39; building lease. The buildings which have been erected will eventually come into the hands of the church to which the land belongs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> dealt with the question of the pecuniary profit derived from these properties, and I can say that the income from the property to which I have just referred, although very considerable, goes into the church funds, and makes it possible for larger stipends to be paid to the ministers of that church than perhaps could otherwise be paid to them. It might,  in the circumstances, be contended that the church in question is deriving no pecuniary profit from the possession of this land, in a legal sense. </para>

I am satisfied that the Government are sincere in the statement that they have no idea of taxing the institutions which have been specially referred to in connexion with the amendment, but when we get these returns we may discover something that ought to be taxed. I believe that some of these institutions that are in receipt of enormous incomes from lands which they use as private owners use their land, should be subject to taxation in respect of those lands. </para>

                    <para>. - In the discussion of the amendment, honorable senators are getting away from the purpose of the Bill, and! of this particular clause. The real object of the measure is to do in Australia what was done in England in the time of William the Conqueror, when the Doomsday Book was made up. Surely from such a measure as this we cannot exclude certain properties, and say in effect that they are outside of Australia. We have been told that the taking of this census will cost &#163;150,000, and it does seem common sense therefore to make it as complete and minute as possible. Even if we do not want the information this year, we may require it next year. The objection which I have to the Bill is that which has already been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> namely, that it does not go far enough, and that we should not only secure information in regard to our individual activities, but that we should also obtain the fullest particulars in regard to our municipalities and our friendly societies - indeed, in relation to all the activities of the State. I venture to say that if we do come up against a really evil day, we shall find that our churches are not averse to making any sacrifice which may be required for the defence of the Empire. It would be of value to know exactly what the State is spending in its charitable enterprises, and also what assets it possesses under that heading. I can see rib good purpose to be served by obscuring any portion of our activities. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly . If we obtain information in regard to our fire brigade strength the Minister will be able to say at once, &#34; Here is a class of man that we want.&#34; When the returns provided for under this Bill come to hand they will not only be dissected, but classified. We shall then be able to determine not only what is the engineering  strength  of the community, but what are the religious and charitable exercises of the people. I am in entire accord with the spirit of the Bill. Upon the motion for its second reading, I stated that my only objection to it. was that it did not go far enough. I hope that the amendment will not be pressed. My view is that we should practically obtain information as to the capital account of Australia. It would be a good thing if we could ascertain what Australia is spending upon its amusements - upon its racecourses, its theatres, and&#34; its picture shows - because undoubtedly if ever there was a time when we are faced with a serious position that time is now. </para>

                        <para>- Because this is a &#34; War Census Bill,&#34; and this clause is entitled &#34;Taking of war census.&#34; I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> urging how desirable it was that we should obtain information in regard to municipal activities. But, under cover of a &#34; war census,&#34; are we going to gratify his laudable curiosity in that connexion ? Under cover of a &#34; war census &#39; &#39; are we to add to the historical archives of the Commonwealth? If we want that information, let us get it straightforwardly, and in the most complete manner. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that it is most desirable that we should obtain information in regard to our municipal activities. But under cover of a &#34; war census,&#34; do not let us attempt to get it. To my mind, it is essential that the information sought under this Bill should be secured as expeditiously as possible- Why are we asking for information as to the number of horses and motor vehicles in. the Commonwealth? Simply because they may be turned to a useful purpose in case of war. If the Bill be passed in its present form, will the building in which we are assembled be included in the census? Certainly not. Will every one of the post-offices of the Commonwealth, the Customs Houses, the land and property occupied as fortifications, the defence works of Australia, and the civil establishments of the Commonwealth, be included ? I venture to think not. </para>

                        <para>- Are we looking for those valuations? No. We are really seeking to assess the capabilities of the people for the prosecution of the war - their personal capabilities and their property assets. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has assured us that the Bill is not intended to be the precursor of taxation. But I cannot subscribe to the doctrine that he would be held responsible for the ultimate consequences which may flow from this measure. Developments may occur which may compel resort to very drastic taxation. Then, if the data supplied in these returns were used for the purpose of assessing taxation, I could not hold him responsible. I repeat that developments may occur which may necessitate resort to these returns, either by the present or a subsequent Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has already admitted that aspect of the matter. Under the Bill it is not proposed to take stock of every property in the Commonwealth. I am seeking to exempt only those properties which are already exempt from land tax under the Land Tax Assessment Act. Some honorable senators have urged that church organizations hold properties from which they derive considerable rent. I merely wish to say that such properties will not be exempted from the operation of the Bill under my amendment. If there is any pecuniary revenue derived from them- </para>

                        <para>- I mean money revenue. If land is being used for purely charitable or ecclesiastical purposes, and it is yielding no money revenue, it is exempt from taxation. But if it is yielding money revenue, it is subject to taxation. If the Bill passes in its present form, I doubt very much whether it will be possible to obtain the information sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in regard to certain municipal activities, because I do not know that they will fall within the scope of the measure. In seeking information in regard to our charitable and religious organizations, we shall only be burdening the returns unnecessarily, and increasing the work which will have to be done in the taking of this census without serving any useful purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened carefully during the progress of this debate to the arguments of those who are in favour of the amendment, but I have to say they have not brought me round to their -way of thinking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I think, disclosed the real object of the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> in his remarks referred to the fact that in the future we may have to resort to drastic taxation, and said that if this information were available the Commonwealth might be induced to ask the owners &#39;of those properties to pay something towards the national revenue. That, in my opinion, is the reason why this amendment has been proposed, because, if it is carried, the information will not be available, and those responsible, if asked to pay something, will have the excuse that there would not be time to furnish the information. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the honorable senator is quite in favour of taxing a widow&#39;s land, no matter how poor she may be. The alleged trouble of filling in these returns is not the real objection to the schedule. The real objection is to disclose the value of property. As soon as the income tax is proposed property owners everywhere immediately set up a universal .howl throughout the country, objecting to the inquisitorial character of the tax. But it is not the inquisitorial character of the tax that they are opposed to so much as the painful operation of paying the tax, and I venture to say that is the objective of this amendment. However, we have the assurance of the Minister, that these properties will not be taxed, and I for one am quite prepared to accept it. </para>

It will not increase the cost to any  appreciable  extent if -we extended the schedule and asked for a good deal more information than is now contemplated. I hope the Senate will not be misled by any arguments adduced by those in support of the amendment, and that they will support the measure as it stands, so that we will know exactly what our resources are if, later on, we have to consider the necessity of imposing drastic taxation. So far as I am concerned, I accept the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that there is no present intention to tax these properties. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it might be applied to portable property; but it is clear to me that the taxation possibilities of the land can only have application to the war, and no good purpose can be served by skating over thin ice by saying that the Bill has nothing to do with taxation. I did not argue that the measure gave the Government a power of taxation, but, as I have already said, I. maintained that its ultimate object was - first, to promote recruiting in connexion with the war; and, second, to obtain information for the purpose of raising the wherewithal, the sinews of war, from property. Now we are discussing the kind of property to which we may be able to apply such taxation. We propose, under this amendment, to exempt certain classes of property, and any attempt to make us believe that it has no connexion with the war is only an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public. </para>

I want to be most emphatic on the point. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s argument held good, that we wanted a return of these properties for taxation purposes, every man with a few head of stock could take the same view, and say, &#34; Oh, the Government only want to. get a return of my stock in order to tax me.&#34; It would create a most unfortunate impression if we allowed a suggestion to go out from this Senate that we are asking for a return of the wealth of the country for the purpose of taxing it. We are doing nothing of the kind, and I assure the honorable senator that I was in earnest when I said that, as far as this Government were concerned, we had no such taxation proposals upon the stocks. </para>

                        <para>- We have that already. In connexion, with this matter, some honorable senators have endeavoured to put me in a wrong position. We are simply asking, for a return of the property in the schedule, and they ask that certain people shall be exempted. Because we ask for a return of that property, and they press for an exemption, they are trying to make out that we intend to tax that property, when, as a matter of fact, we have no such intention. When those who desire exemptions have people to speak&#39; in their interests, and claim exemption, it is about time the rest of us looked around to see who else can be exempted; but if we did that the whole thing would be a farce. I am in sympathy with the motives underlying the amendment, and I had hoped that I could accept it; but, after I had looked into the matter more carefully, I came to the conclusion that, if one section of the community claimed exemption, another would do likewise, and the census would not be worth taking. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie will not accept my assurance, and will persist in thinking that some future taxation is behind this proposal for a wealth census. Taxation is imminent, and it will be upon the Parliament and the country at an early date. But it will come in one of those ordinary forms of taxation which the country has been expecting for months, and the surprise is that the Government have held their hands so long. </para>

                        <para>- No1 official document issued by the Government of Victoria gives an accurate estimate of the value of the land on which the Yarra Bend Asylum stands. No Western Australian official return sets forth the value of the land upon which the Kalgoorlie Hospital stands. There is another hospital, not run by the Government, alongside that institution. Under this Bill, the Western Australian Government will not furnish a return regarding the one, but those conducting the other will have to furnish a return. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> remarks, there appears to be need to take an inventory of the schools in Australia to which some senators might well be sent, judging by the ignorance displayed in this debate.

                <para class="block">Croydon, in North Queensland, where I spent some time, there are schools, but the Queensland Government do not publish one line showing the value of the land on which their school stands, while those conducting other schools will be called on to furnish returns. Therefore, only partial information will be  obtained;  and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> gets up to say that the value of the land on which schools are erected is so much, he will be speaking from misleading and incomplete information, because no State Government will have recorded the value of the land on which State teaching or benevolent institutions are erected. This effort will, therefore, be misleading and fruitless and place us in a most ignominious position. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> and all the others who are going to gloat over the information, or expect some comfort from it, that they will get only a partial account of the value  of  lands employed for benevolent and educational activities. By passing the clause as it stands we shall, therefore, be showing ourselves in a foolish, ridiculous, and impossible light. </para>

                    <para>. -  I frankly and readily comply with the well-known practice  of  the Senate as regards accepting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> statements. All I can say is that there is a difference between min and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who introduced the measure in another place. It was argued there, originally, that if we were to have conscription of men we should also have conscription of property. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said that in the past we had always proceeded with our taxation without having sufficiently reliable statistics to go upon. He complained that that was an unscientific way to proceed, and that this Bill was introduced to get the accurate data of taxation before proceeding to impose it. He said he was going to reverse the old order by securing the information first, and the taxation measures would come before us later on. We are now informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> of the possibility of the taxation Bills coming before us before the information is secured by this Bill. If the case is so urgent, and the Government cannot wait for the information, it does not alter my argument, nor change the nature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> contention, that one of the objects of the Bill was to secure information regarding the taxable property  of the Commonwealth, in order that taxation measures might be introduced later. Those arguments prove what I have been contending all through : that while the Bill is not a measure by which taxation can be wrung out of the people of the Commonwealth, it is the first step in that direction, and has a direct connexion with the Bills that are coming later. </para>

There is no man in the chamber for whom I have a greater admiration and respect; but I think he was unfair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> and even to myself and others who are going to vote against the amendment.  His  unfairness consisted in specifying certain institutions, and making it appear to the readers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that we were interested only in getting returns from our charitable and religious institutions, and against a proposal to protect them, which enlisted the sympathy of every other member of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- For public purposes. I hope it will not happen, but it might be- necessary during this period, so very different from any other in the history of Australia, to utilize some of these show grounds for war purposes. The Flemington race-course covers a large area, and suggestions have been made in the columns of the press that the Defence Department might utilize that ground for the training and drilling of recruits. It might be found convenient also to use some of the show grounds in the same way. As a matter of fact, the Defence Department is to-day making use of the grounds of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria, adjacent to the Flemington racecourse. It has been suggested that the annual show of the society should not be held this year because of the war, and that on that account the Defence Department should pay a certain rental to the society for the use of the ground. It would be useful for us to know the area and value of the show grounds of Australia, so that if at any time it becomes necessary to rent them for public purposes we shall have some basis upon which to estimate the rent which should be paid for them. Then there are public gardens, recreation grounds, and reserves. We have been accustomed, in this State, to say, with a good deal of pride that, in proportion to its area Victoria has a greater number of recreation reserves than has any other State. Will it not be useful to know the area and approximate value of all our public reserves? Then, the different fire brigades throughout the Commonwealth control buildings of considerable value, especially in all the capital cities. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that we shall get the information, because the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that there will be no exemptions. Then, I may mention that that magnificent organization, the Australian Workers Union, possesses a number of buildings from which they do not derive pecuniary profit. If the amendment be carried, we shall get no information as to the value of the buildings and land owned by the Australian Workers Union. Information of the value of all the properties to which I have referred will be denied us if the amendment is carried. No injury will be done to any section of the community by insisting upon the furnishing of these returns. All that they will involve is a little labour and trouble. Let me repeat that if I had the least doubt about the object for which the Bill is being introduced, I should be found whole-heartedly supporting the amendment. It is because I have no doubt whatever that no attempt will be made to impose taxation upon the properties of religious, educational, and charitable institutions in this country that I am prepared to vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause deals with the preparation and issue of the forms which are required to take the census. It authorizes the Statistician to put into operation all the necessary machinery for the purpose. Now, I understand that many offers of voluntary assistance have been made to the Government in connexion with the taking of this census. Many members of the Commonwealth and State Public Services have offered their aid. It might be very well to accept their offers, but we ought to recollect that there are quite a large number of men and women in our midst to-day who are unemployed, and who are sufficiently skilled to undertake this work. Consequently, I desire the Vice-President of the Executive Council to publicly state that all unemployed men and women who are fit to discharge the duties involved in the taking of this war census will be employed before any voluntary offers of assistance are accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - The taking of this census will entail a large expenditure of money and effort. In that effort much labour will be employed. As soon as it was announced, through the columns of the daily press, that the Government intended to take a war census, a number of well-meaning citizens offered their services without, I feel sure, any expectation of fee or reward. Many of these offers came from persons who are already in employment, and who are so circumstanced that they are in a position to keep the wolf from the door. They offered their services in their spare time to&#62; the Government in connexion with the taking of this census. But there are quite a large number of persons in the Commonwealth who are not able to keep the wolf from the door. Whilst every sphere of industrial activity is affected by the drought and the war, I do not suppose that there is any section of the community which is feeling their disastrous consequences more than are the clerical workers. Whenever business is dull the clerical staffs are naturally reduced,, and the clerical employee cannot usually take on any other kind of work. When voluntary offers of assistance were made to the Government, a meeting of the clerical workers of this State was held, at which a resolution was adopted expressing the hope that their services would be availed of before any voluntary offers were accepted. I think that there is every justification for a resolution of that character. If, for example, a number of transports required to be fitted up, it would be unfair for carpenters in employment to come along and say that, in their spare time, they would fit up those vessels. Such an offer would be a generous one, but it ought not to be accepted if competent tradesmen were available to do the work and those tradesmen were unemployed. If voluntary offers of assistance are to be accepted, in the taking of this census, thus displacing clerical workers who would otherwise be employed, the same principle should be extended to every other branch of industry. I feel sure that the Government are sympathetic with these men who are unemployed, and that, whilst not unmindful of the generous offers made by patriotic citizens, they will not forget that there is quite an army of competent clerical workers idle in our midst. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to nip this debate in the bud by saying that the Government have had offers, from the State Governments and from other places which they cannot overlook in carrying out such a huge work as the taking of this war census. Probably my statement will set at rest any anxiety on the part of Senators Needham and Findley when I say that this work is so urgent that it will require the services of a large body of officials working two shifts, a day. Voluntary labour cannot, supply, this need. Labour which can only give its services, during its. spare time is useless in the compilation of statistics which must be prepared expeditiously. If there is one thing noticeable throughout the community, it is the intense desire of all to do something, however little, to assist in the prosecution of this great war. Whilst recognising that desire, I am informed by the Attorney-General that the services of a thousand clerks, working two shifts, a day, will be necessary to expeditiously complete this war census. Let no honorable senator imagine for a moment that the employment which will be offered in this&#39; connexion will partake in any way of. charitable employment. The undertaking will be a business one from beginning to end. None but efficients are- needed, and none but efficients will be employed. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to learn that the Government view this matter in. the common-sense way that has been outlined by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. We know that the clerical workers of Australia have an equal claim to recognition with the members of other trade unions. I hope, too, that in. the taking of the census, not merely male, but female clerks will be employed. There are quite a number of female clerical workers in our midst who ought not to be excluded from such an undertaking. I recognise that in the taking of this census we want to practise economy as far as possible. At the same time .1 hope that the Government will see that no cheap labour is engaged in the work until all unemployed clerical workers have been placed. </para>

                    <para>. - There can be no doubt that even now there are a large number of male and female clerks unemployed in the Commonwealth. Probably in the near future the number will be largely increased. The &#163;20,000,000 loan which the Government are about to float for war purposes will withdraw a large amount of capital from industries. This will certainly result in the discharge of a considerable number of persons from all occupations. Then, again, we hear rumours of war taxation. Such taxation will interfere with the course of industry. So far as I can see, the outlook in the immediate future is not promising. The probability is that before we know where we are we shall have a huge army of unemployed on our hands. These people must be provided for. They cannot be allowed to starve. The Prime Minister stated some time ago that in fighting the Germans we were prepared to expend our last man and our last shilling. But I think that fighting poverty within our own borders is even more important than fighting the Germans. Seeing that we have this prospect before us, I trust that the Government will not encourage the engagement of voluntary helpers. These people are in employment now. We all admire the generosity which inspires their offers, but we have to consider the persons who are idle, many of whom have families to provide for, and are in a semi-starving condition. Whilst such a state of things exists, and whilst we have a shilling to assist in keeping them supplied with food and shelter, no voluntary helper should be engaged in the taking of this census. I said before that it is proposed to squander &#163;150,000 in collecting information which is already available to the Government. If that money must be expended, let it be spent in assisting to keep a number of our own people out of the ditch of poverty. So far as I am concerned I shall never countenance the employment of any voluntary labour, and I am sorry we did not take steps, when clause 3 was under observation, to eliminate this. </para>

                        <para>- This clause practically presents a blank cheque to the Government, if we pass it in its present form. Attached to the Bill are two inquisitorial schedules, which, I think, Parliament should take the full responsibility of framing, so that we may know exactly what powers are to be given to the Government, and also that they will not be modified or added to. I am not prepared to give to this or to any other Government power to add to or to modify those schedules in any way; but, on the contrary, I would like to see the schedules, as they leave this Parliament, moulded in such a way .that they will accomplish the object of the Government. In legislation of this nature, which I recognise is necessary at this time, it would be unwise for Parliament to go into recess and leave the people practically at the mercy of the Government, with power to add further questions, and, as it were, to peer still more closely into the private affairs of their lives. I think the clause can very well stand with all the words after &#34; Act &#34; deleted. It will then he all the more imperative on the Committee to scrutinize carefully the schedules as they are going through, to see that they are sent to the people in a proper form, and without being too inquisitorial. In order to test the feeling of the Committee, I move - </para>

I do not say that this or any other Government have a right to ask for a blank cheque, as T realize that Parliament should know the limit of the power it is handing over., I am not questioning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> desire to see that the powers of Parliament should remain in the hands of members elected to conduct the business of Parliament ;- but I want to point out that it might happen that when we are preparing a proclamation dealing with this matter, it might be found that some simple question, concerning which there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt Parliament would approve, has been omitted, and if the amendment is carried we would have to call Parliament together to get over the difficulty. Government is always a question of cheques and balances. In this particular clause we have practically a blank cheque, but a Committee has been appointed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> when dealing with the matter in the other House, said that no questions other than those in the schedule would be put in, except with the approval of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- At the present time we are living under a condition of things previously unheard of, and extraordinary powers can be exercised at any moment by the Government, almost without the check of Parliament, and if the Government cannot be trusted with this small matter it is for the Senate to say so. When introducing the Bill I said that had we been living in ordinary times a measure of such an inquisitorial character would have received my opposition. Now that we are exercising such extended powers, why should there be hesitation as to whether the Government should have the DOWer embodied in this clause? I will put it to honorable senators that, in their caution to prevent us from doing something that may involve quite a remote danger, they may prevent us from doing something which is very useful and necessary, and something which Parliament would certainly approve if the matter were submitted to members. However, the matter is for the Committee to decide. Personally. I hope the amendment will not be carried, for the simple reason that there is no intention on the part of the Government to transgress upon the privileges of Parliament; but, as I have said, when we are issuing the proclamation we might find that something which should have been included has been left out, and we should have the power to include it. I really think we can be intrusted with this power, because, so far as I can see, no other question will be submitted. The Government only want to be in the position of knowing that if there is any omission it can be rectified. </para>

                    <para>I am entirely in the hands of the Committee in this matter. Two suggestions have been made. There is no difference of opinion on the point that the Second Schedule shall not como into force until it has been approved either by the War Committee or by this House. In my view, the War Committee could best deal with the matter, but I do not press that. I propose to make a number of amendments in that Schedule now, because I do not desire that the Bill should go to another place until wc have done the best we can with it. </para>

                        <para>- I thought I would give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> actual remarks for greater accuracy. Substantially what he said was that, whatever Parliament did, its work was to be disregarded, and that the War Lords appointed by the Government were to be supreme. That is a dangerous proposal, which no Parliament should tolerate, even in a crisis like the present. It would be better for Parliament to sit continuously than to hand over its powers to any Committee. I hope that, for the protection of Parliament, if for no other reason, we shall carry the amendment, which, to some extent, will clip the wings of the War Committee. </para>

                        <para>- By that interjection the honorable senator recognises that the Committee will be operative only when Parliament is not sitting. It is not an overriding of Parliament, but an additional safeguard to it. What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said, repeated by his colleague  here, is that if Parliament is in session the schedule, as amended, if it is amended, will naturally come before Parliament for approval; but if Parliament is not sitting we have the assurance that the Government will not amend the schedule unless the War Committee, which is equally representative of both sides, is in agreement with what they propose to do. If the Committee approve, and Parliament was in session, Parliament could still override the regulation. Parliament would be in no better position if the War Committee had no voice at all.

                        <para>- It will not, because Parliament, if not in session, would not be able to do anything. If the Committee did not exist, the Government would alter the schedule as they liked, and Parliament would not be overridden, although impotent for the time being. To bring in the Committee does not impair the rights or powers of Parliament, but merely means that the Government will buttress themselves with the assurance that a body of men representative of both sides is in full approval of what they are doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> when he said he agreed with me, reminded me of the possibility of a new and powerful alliance - between him and myself. </para>

                        <para>- There is a distinct difference between the proposal now submitted and that which I discussed last night. I urged, in connexion with the matter discussed last night, that no more power than is absolutely necessary to enable them to administer affairs should be intrusted to the Government. In connexion with that matter, there was no possible advantage in giving the Government the power proposed, and therefore the argument as to the folly of giving the Government a blank cheque applied; but in this case I think it can be shown that it is not only useful, but necessary, that the Government should have this power. Already suggestions for additions to the schedules have been urged as desirable, and it is quite conceivable that before the printer is called upon to do his work in connexion with this measure, further valuable suggestions may be offered for the modification of the schedules in, perhaps, vital particulars. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in introducing the Bill, said that the Government ought in ten days to have all the preliminary machinery for the war census ready for work. If that is so, and Parliament should be in session next week, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the Government will be in a position to inform the Senate, and honorable members of another place, what is&#39; contained in the schedules as revised up to that time. I feel certain that Ministers will be prepared to give an undertaking to bring down regulations framed under the Bill as early as possible; and as the Government are under considerable pressure to hasten the operation of the Bill, it seems to me unthinkable that there will be any necessity to revise the schedules after next week. If that be so, the regulation may still be brought before Parliament in the ordinary way before the anticipated adjournment, and Parliament will then be able to exercise its power of control. I can remind older senators, and by that I mean those who have been longer members of this Chamber than others, of an almost historic debate which took place in. this Chamber, and was very fruitful in its results. I remember an occasion when certain regulations were tabled, and a schedule of questions was successfully challenged, and the Government of the day called upon to modify them. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council could give the Committee an assurance that the schedules to this Bill will be revised in the course of a few days, and the regulations presented to Parliament before the proposed adjournment, the minds of some honorable senators would be greatly relieved. </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst I have no hesitation in giving the Committee the assurance that these matters will be pushed on with as quickly as possible, it is beyond my power to promise that the regulations will be tabled before the proposed adjournment. If Parliament continues to sit for three or four weeks longer, the regulations under this Bill will be presented ; but if the adjournment takes place next week, they will not. When the Bill is passed, the need will be very serious and urgent, indeed, that will induce the Government to modify or add to the schedules. They certainly will not alter the schedules wantonly. I know the work which the Crown Law Office has been called on to do within the last six months, and I cannot now make any promise that regulations will be drafted and submitted to Parliament without knowing how long it is likely to continue sitting. There is, apparently, a feeling of suspicion against the Government, though I do not say that it is entertained by the honorable senator who moved the amendment. </para>

If the amendment is carried the Government will be deprived of the power to make regulations which they are given by almost every Act that is passed. I remind honorable senators that Parliament has already given the Government powers in connexion with the conduct of the war which far exceed any powers they ask for in this Bill,&#39; and the powers which have already been given them might be used if they so desired to enable them to do all that they think it well to do under this Bill whether the amendment is carried or not. Why should honorable senators try to bind the Government in this way with a piece of string when Parliament has already given us sufficient power to break bands of steel ? </para>

                        <para>- We do need the Bill, because we desire to do everything that is necessary just as it should be done if we were living under normal conditions. We desire that all the power for which we ask shall be given the Government in a constitutional way. The Government have no desire to do in any underhand way what they are not prepared to openly ask Parliament to give them power to do. When honorable senators have agreed to the war powers which have already been intrusted to the Government, I can appeal to them to give us the small powers that are asked for under this Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council is not justified in complaining that in this matter he is not receiving the support of members of the party to which he belongs. There is no party matter at stake in connexion with this Bill. The honorable senator should not have suggested either that there is some suspicion of the Government on the part of honorable senators on this side. I have no suspicion of the Government, but I should take the same stand as I am taking in connexion with this Bill no matter what Government introduced it. I attach no weight to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to which the Vice-President of the Executive .Council has conditionally agreed, because the Government without the amendment will still have the power to modify or add to the schedules of this Bill, and that is what I object to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> referred to the statement made by the Attorney-General, and as he introduced the Bill, and is the legal adviser of the Crown, we are justified in attaching considerable importance to what he has had to say. He has said plainly that the schedules of this Bill will not become operative until they are agreed to by the War Committee. That is a strange statement for the honorable gentleman to make. This Parliament has been elected by the people to frame legislation for their protection. We have a Bill before us for consideration, and yet the Attorney-General says that the schedules to that Bill will not be enforced until they are approved by the War Committee. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the Attorney-General referred specifically to the wealth schedule of the War Census Bill. When that statement is analyzed, what it means is that twelve members of this Parliament are to supersede the Government and Parliament. The statement is embalmed in the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and we are compelled to take notice of it. The Government themselves propose to hand over to an irresponsible committee the powers for which they ask under this Bill. We have plenty of time in which to determine exactly the questions which we think should be submitted to the people in connexion with the proposed war census. While I am in favour of the principle of the Bill, and recognise its necessity, I want to safeguard the rights of Parliament, and by so doing protect the interests of the people. They have a right to complain if put to unnecessary inconvenience, and if there is too great an inquisition into their private affairs. I hope that the amendment will be accepted, because its object is only to enable Parliament to retain its authority. Honorable senators have to decide whether they will do that or will give the Government in this matter unlimited power. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has reminded the Committee that, even if the amendment is carried, the War Precautions Act will enable the Government to do all that they could do under this Bill without the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> very properly wished to know where -is the necessity for the introduction of this Bill if that be the case. The logical deduction from the statement made by the Minister is that, no matter what amendments may be made in this Bill, the Government may use the powers with which they have already been invested for the conduct of the war to defeat the decision of this Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">That would preclude the possibility of the Government making any number of additions to those forms, of which we are entirely ignorant at the present time. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has assured us that it is necessary that the Bill should he passed as quickly as possible. But surely we are not going to have some new questions sprung upon us within the next few days, although that might easily be done under the clause in its present form. If the Government have no desire to do that, why do they insist upon the retention of the provision as it now stands? I join with other honorable senators in objecting to give the Government power to add to the questions to be put to the people, seeing that the questions already prescribed in the schedule are sufficiently numerous. It is true that questions may be framed under regulations, but it is equally true that the moment any such regulations are made, they have the force of law, and may be acted upon before Parliament has time to disagree with them. </para>

                    <para>. - I would like to draw the attention of the Government to what I think is an error in the drafting of the clause which states that for the purpose of making any inquiries and observations necessary for the proper carrying out of this Act, all persons shall answer questions and produce documents. Clearly that is not sense, because for the purpose of making any inquiries a person does not answer questions. He asks them. The error has, I think, arisen through taking over the first two lines from another section of the Census Act. Those lines, I think, ought to be transferred in this Bill from clause 9 to clause 11. If honorable senators will look at clause 11, they will find that it reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That will give power to break open any safe; and, clearly, power to enter premises and to break open a safe ought to be a power under this Act. If honorable senators will turn to the Census Act, they will find a corresponding section 19, which states - </para>

We have put in the covering words contained in the first two lines, and I would suggest that if they go in anywhere they should be in clause 11. Clearly, they are out of place in clause 9, because for the purpose of making any inquiry a person does not answer questions. The authority to demand an answer to questions is contained in section 18 of the Census Act, which states - </para>

                            <para>. - The Minister, in introducing this Bill, described it as a measure for national stocktaking. It is the idea of the Government to be in a position to organize our military and industrial resources. If that be the object in view, I do not see why questions concerning the national stocktaking should be confined exclusively to males, as is the case in this first schedule. If the Bill does not mean conscription, and I accept the assurance of the Minister on that point, why are these questions confined to males? If we want to take a census of the productivity of labour, we should surely recognise the great number of females employed in factories. The number is approximately 82,000. There are, in addition, males and females under eighteen years of age to the number of 13,000, and they are not taken into consideration in this schedule at all. These persons represent approximately one-third of the total factory productivity of the Commonwealth, and yet they are not to be taken into consideration in this national stocktaking. Then we have to consider the enormous number of women who are employed in many other important industries. We should have some estimate of the value of their efforts, if the intention of the Bill is that we may have a real knowledge of the resources of the country. We might want to know, for instance, how many nurses and how many women who have a knowledge of first aid there are in the Commonwealth. Why not take some cognisance of those women? The Minister, in objecting to the exemptions suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> said that even although the Government did not want certain information they ought to get it. </para>

There are persons above even the age of sixty years employed in different industries. </para>

                            <para>. - For military purposes we require to know the number of males between eighteen and sixty .years of a/rc. We require to know whether they are married or single, .and their fitness for service. Under the card system, when we get the information required, there will be a division on something like these lines. Those between eighteen and thirty-five years of age will be first class fighting men, those between thirty-five and forty-five years of age will be second class, and those between forty-five and sixty year3 of age in the next class. We require to know exactly what our resources are in regard to men fit for service. I repeat that this is not for the purpose of compelling men to fight, because the Government believe that the services of every available man in the Commonwealth will be at their disposal. No doubt some honorable senators who believed that this Bill meant conscription have been disappointed. I have said that it does not mean conscription, and I now go further and say that if a Bill for conscription is introduced in the Senate, some Minister other than myself must introduce it. </para>

I have had a strange experience to-night. I have heard Senators de Largie and Mullan deliberately say that this Bill has been introduced for some purpose other than that for which I have assured the Senate it has been introduced. I have gone OUt of my way to make myself understood om this point, and I shall always put matters before the Senate in a straightforward manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> hast given the Committee the figures of those engaged in manufacturing industries. If the honorable senator has those figures,, what occasion is there to ask for the information again under this Bill ? </para>

                                <para>- Th6 alterations, of the schedule which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan:</inline> suggests would lead to the gathering ire of so much chaff and so little grain that after the returns were received it would be difficult to find the grain. For military purposes we propose to have a census taken which will give us information as to the available fighting population. I believe that there are many men over sixty years of age who could and would, if the necessity arose, render excellent service in fighting in Australia. </para>

                            <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council is mistaken when he says that I have not accepted his assurance that this Bill is not introduced for the purpose of conscription. The very amendments of the schedule which I have suggested should prove to the honorable senator that I have accepted his assurance. He has stated that such amendments of the schedule are unnecessary when I already have the information, but the figures 1 have given are only approximate. I could give further approximate figures. The approximate value of the product of manufacturing industries in the Commonwealth last year was &#163;161,000,000; the wages paid, about &#163;33,000,000; the value of the raw material used, about &#163;96,000,000; the enhancement of value by manufacture, about &#163;65,000,000. But these figures are only approximate. We should have accurate information, and the Government are disregarding the necessity for that information in the taking of the proposed census. I could give approximate answers to practically every question that appears in the schedule, but the Minister would not accept that information. If the honorable senator is in earnest about securing a national stocktaking, he should in these schedules submit questions which will give the Government all the information that is required. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to invite the attention of the Committee to an amendment which I feel certain will be readily accepted. It has relation to the tabulation of the value of leasehold properties. All that this schedule calls upon people to return  is the capital value of land which they own, and, as honorable senators know, many people have a considerable value in land which is held under leasehold, the value of which is distinct, and apart altogether from the capital value. In Sydney, for instance, the City Council has leased land for a considerable period, and there is no provision under this schedule by which we can get a return of such values. Under the Land Tax Act provision is made, for leasehold interests are taxable under that Act, and what is wanted in this schedule is an additional paragraph providing for the return of leasehold value apart from the capital value. For instance, a man&#39;s leasehold value being worth  &#163;500,  and the capital value  &#163;10,000,  he would be called upon to return the capital value. This would be most misleading, because the owner would be required to make a similar return. That is not what the Government want. I suggest, therefore, that there should be a subdivision under question  6  to provide for a return of the leasehold value. </para>

                        <para>. -  I would point out that if we strike out any words from the question, and seek afterwards to insert them in another form, some honorable senator might raise the question whether we can do it at this sitting. I would suggest, therefore, that the  Chairman  should exercise the authority vested in him to make such verbal alterations as will enable the Committee to meet the difficulty with which we are confronted. We do not want so much to alter the question as to alter the form in which it is printed and I think the  Chairman,  having ascertained the wish of the Committee, has authority to do that. </para>

                            <para>- We have no right to delegate our business to any Committee. We should state freehold land clearly and explicitly, and clearly define leasehold lands. We should also mention conditional purchase land, which is both leasehold and freehold at one time. In Western Australia there is a good deal of land taken up under conditional purchase, which means payment on the instalment principle for a number of years, generally twenty. When the last instalment is paid the land becomes freehold. </para>

                        <para>. - Only that I believe the Government and the Committee generally are in favour of what I propose, I should not now take the course of suggesting an adjournment of this matter, and that steps be taken for a further revision of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has raised some doubt in my mind as to whether we shall achieve the full object sought by the amendment. The doubt is strengthened by a reference to the Land Tax Assessment Act. What is wanted is not merely the value of land which is held under lease. That will be returned by the owner of the freehold. What we want to get at is the lessee&#39;s interest in the land. There are many kinds of leases. Land is held under lease from a private owner, and under settlement leases with varying currencies up to twenty-eight years from the Crown; and there is also the perpetual lease, which, to all intents and purposes, is a freehold, though it is legally a leasehold. These varieties give rise to many complications. What I suggest, especially in view of the fact that the Government have other business to go on with, is that this matter might be adjourned now; or I should be satisfied if the Vice-President of the Executive Council would notify that the Government are willing, if the schedule is passed now, to have it further revised. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Under the amendment as  amended,  the lessee will not return the capital value of the land, but only the value of his estate or interest in the land. The owner of the land will return the capital value in another form. In the Land Tax Assessment &#39;Act, we recognised two distinct values - the value to the owner of the land and the value of the estate or interest held by the lessee. The Land Tax Assessment Act carries that through a process of refinement from one section to another, but that is not necessary in this case. </para>

                        <para>. - The road is now clear for me to offer a further suggestion. This subparagraph is intended to secure information as to the value of machinery and plant, including implements, vehicles, and tools of all kinds. I cannot conceive that information as to the value of machinery and plant used in carrying on the ordinary business of the country would be of half as much value to the Government as information giving the nature of the machinery. I feel sure that the Government do not contemplate a serious inroad upon the machinery employed on the farms or in the factories of the  country but  it is important that  they  should know the character of the machinery, if there is to be organization. It is of more importance that the Government should know what engineering plant there is which might be used for military purposes than that they should know that plant and machinery to the value of so many thousands of pounds is possessed by people throughout the Commonwealth when it may be made up by the valuation put upon a number of unimportant implements. It appears to me that there has been an important omission, and that the schedule should provide for a return of the character of machinery employed. </para>

                            <para>- Whenever any honorable senator dares to challenge the utility of any of these questions the Vice-President of the Executive Council appears to resent it. We are here to enact wise legislation. Before the honorable gentleman gives utterance to such interjections I desire to know why there should be such an inquisitorial examination into a person&#39;s household property? Why should every man or woman tell the value of the chairs or tables or hurricane lamps which he or she possesses? If the Vice-President of the Executive Council will tell us of what use is sub-paragraph 10 I will listen to him patiently, and will not make offensive interjections such as he has been guilty of himself. </para>

                        <para>. - I preface my remarks with an apology for the offensive way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> imagines that I referred to him. When the honorable senator spoke of socks and stockings I confess that I did feel that he was unnecessarily exaggerating the position. The paragraph seeks information as to the approximate value of the furniture and personal and household effects of every man in the community. I would point out that a man may have in his house personal property worth thousands of pounds, and it will not add much to the difficulty of any householder if he has to state approximately the value of that property. If some persons possess household and personal effects which are worth thousands of pounds, I think that we should have a record of them. I appeal to honorable senators not to unnecessarily delay the passing of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- If he had done so I would have supported the amendment. I understood the Minister of Defence to interject a few moments ago to the effect that if a man had valuable pictures, and did not give their approximate value, we would not get a fair estimate of the amount of wealth in the country. But what is the idea of getting an estimate of that value if it is not to arrive at its taxable value for the purposes of taxation? There is no question about that at all. Everybody knows that the main reason for submitting all these questions, and going to all this expense and trouble, is to find out where the wealth of the country is, what it is, and who owns it. The idea is to ascertain the realizable value of that wealth for taxation purposes, and it seems to me that the item under discussion will hardly serve any useful purpose. I am not particular how it goes, but I would point out that the approximate value of one man&#39;s furniture might be &#163;37. if he bought it second hand, and &#163;100 if he bought it new, and the approximate value of another man&#39;s furniture, &#163;3,700. </para>

We want a little more order and system to be introduced into the lives of the people of this country, and by the operation of a measure like this, I believe we shall be taking the first step in that direction. We want to see a little more thoroughness in the habits of our people, and by taking stock of their position from year to year I believe we shall effect an improvement in this, respect. It has been said that we should not agree to the inclusion of this item, on the ground that it is of a petty or inquisitorial character. I would direct the attention of honorable senators who hold that opinion to the fact that in this country we have people of varied fortunes, and some who are not very much blessed with this world&#39;s wealth will be called upon by this Bill to furnish a return of everything  they  have. We can imagine that some people in remote parts of the country, who have not many horses or horned stock, but have half-a-dozen goats- </para>

I have indicated that it may be essential for the Commonwealth to appeal to the patriotism of the people to hand over to the Commonwealth any articles of gold and silver, and receive Commonwealth notes in exchange, thereby furnishing a reserve of precious metals which would enable the Government to issue notes to the value of another &#163;40,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly : I want the honorable senator&#39;s scarf-pin and sleeve-links. If it is deemed patriotic to appeal to people to give their services as soldiers, it is reasonable to appeal to their patriotism to render up articles of gold and silver which have no particular utilitarian value, and are used merely as articles of personal adornment or household furnishings. I have gone carefully into the matter, and I estimate that there is &#163;10,000,000 &#39;worth of gold in an uncoined form in the possession of the citizens of Australia. People, in filling in the schedule, may not understand that precious metals are particularly indicated, and I desire the fact to be made clear that we do require a return of the gold and silver in their possession. </para>

                        I perused this schedule with others, before it was brought to the Senate, and I can assure the Committee that there are thousands of questions which we could reasonably ask, but what we sought to do was to get the information we required by the employment of as few questions as possible. If we were ever likely to be driven to such a position that the valuables of the community would be needed, the people of the country would give them. I believe.

                        <para>. - The schedule would be much better received by the people in the country if the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> were agreed to. The omission of the demand for a statement of furniture and personal effects would result in the schedule being filled in with less friction and annoyance to the community. But if we are to take a census of the value of the personal effects of the people, I wish to know why jewellery, which may have a considerable amount of value, is to be omitted? As to personal effects, I do not know that there is not quite a number of other things that could be included as well as jewellery, which, however, is most valuable. Some ridicule has been hurled at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> for his reference to stockings and clothing generally; but I think that jewellery ought to be under a separate heading, seeing that some people hold enormous wealth in this form. However, I prefer that this line of the schedule should be struck out, because I can see that it may lead to much trouble and confusion. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather struck by the fact that honorable senators opposite have consented to call upon a carpenter to make a return as to his tools of trade, and yet: they enter a strong protest when it comes to people who may possess furniture of some considerable value. Of course, it will be inconvenient for people to make a return as to the value of their furniture, but similar or greater inconvenience will be experienced by the washerwoman whom honorable senators opposite are quite content to call upon to make a return as to her scanty income. There seems to he a vast difference between asking a woman like this to make a return, and asking a big furniture owner to show the value of his possessions. This is a most unusual schedule-; and we must get rid of the idea that it is to be used as the basis of any taxation. It is a national stocktaking, in order that we may know what the nation possesses; and we have lo right to leave out the item of furniture. </para>

But we _ must get rid of ideas of that kind. I venture to say that some of the European nations supply returns in almost every conceivable direction; and I do not see why a man who owns &#163;2,000 worth, or, it may be, &#163;10,000 worth, of furniture, should be afraid or &#34; ashamed to disclose the fact, for we must suppose that he has come into possession of it honestly and legitimately. I trust that the schedule will be adopted. </para>

I am in favour of the Government having a fair inventory of the wealth of the community, but I maintain that it is absolutely wrong to ask every man and woman in Australia to supply this information. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> will press the amendment to a division. I am sorry that honorable senators did not receive with greater seriousness the sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> It is not very often that I have the pleasure of agreeing with that honorable senator, but there was more in his remarks than honorable senators, judging by their demeanour, were prepared to admit. It is rather anomalous that we should ask for returns as to the value of a person&#39;s furniture while superfluities such as jewellery are left unnoticed. Perhaps they may be accounted for under the heading of &#34; personal effects,&#34; but, in my opinion, they should be itemized. I am sanguine as to the standing and credit of the Australian note issue, but I realize that an increase in our gold reserve would give a great impetus to the note issue, and if, in the name of patriotism, we can transform gold jewellery and ornaments into coin of the realm, it will lead to an increase in the value of the note issue and be true nationalism. Apparently Australia could have unlimited credit in that regard. We have just agreed to one question which asks citizens to enumerate the debts owing to them. I would not care to enumerate the amount or the number of the debts owing to me; and even were I in a position to do so, I certainly could not claim them all as assets. I do not think that the misplacement referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has been rectified by the amendments agreed to, but, having regard to the questions adopted by the Committee, it seems a pity that we should now descend to the enumeration of such a comparatively small matter as the value of a householder&#39;s furniture or effects. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> will go further in regard to his amendment. </para>

What we desire is to ascertain the realizable wealth of the community in order that it may be taxed. What will be gained by ascertaining the wealth of the tens of thousands of householders who have none of them &#163;100 worth of furniture and effects? There is something in the contention of the Minister of Defence that an idea of a man&#39;s wealth may be obtained by knowing the value of his pictures or of his furniture when that is very costly, but nothing will be gained, by going below a valuation of &#163;100. </para>

                        <para>. - I see nothing in the Bill to exempt certain persons from the duty of making returns. As I read the measure, all persons of the age of eighteen years and upwards must make a return, no matter how much they may possess. Now, there are thousands of houses in this country, especially in the bush and on new gold-fields, where the furniture consists chiefly of grocery boxes, serving its purpose well enough, but perhaps not worth &#163;1 in any particular case. Would it not be ridiculous to ask these householders to state the value of their belongings? In my opinion, we should fix a minimum, though it should be lower than that suggested. I know of mining townships where there is not &#163;100 worth of furniture altogether. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators know what sort of houses are often met with in farming districts - small buildings built of bush timber, with the furniture more or less of the same kind, while the personal effects are limited, in many cases, to a pair of dungarees, a shirt, and a pair of boots. What is the use of asking for information as to such furniture? If we do not intend to make this return absolutely ridiculous, we should introduce a minimum, but one lower than that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> I would appeal to the Minister to introduce such a minimum, and so prevent the Bill from becoming a laughingstock throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

A matter of some importance referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has reference to the amount of gold or silver that may be in the possession of various individuals.

                        <para>. - I cannot agree with the suggestion that the minimum should be stated by proclamation. I believe, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> that if we cannot have the item struck out altogether, a minimum should be established. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> suggested that if there were many homes&#39; in Australia possessing  only &#163;10 worth of furniture, that we should have information on the point. I am quite in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> in that respect. If there are so many homes in Australia where the value of the furniture, together with their personal effects, is less than &#163;10, it is not our business to expose the poverty of these people to the world. It is our duty, as a Parliament, to so improve the position of these people that they may have more than &#163;10 worth of value in their homes. &#39;As members of the Labour party it is our duty to see that there are in Australia fewer homes the furniture in which is worth only &#163;10. The publication of the poverty of these people would not be a means of increasing the value of their personal property. </para>

                        <para>. - It was not my intention to speak, but so much loquacity has been exhibited tonight, that I feel constrained to offer a few observations. I have had as varied an experience as has any honorable senator, and I do not hesitate to say that the people of Australia will not feel at all humiliated by being called upon to fill in a form which will make it known that in some cases they have only &#163;5 or &#163;10 worth of furniture in their homes. If there are such homes, I can only say it is time that this country heard something of them. The workers of this or any other country - and I have made this statement from many a platform - have nothing whatever to fear from investigation or publicity of any kind. It is because the workers of many countries have seen fit to smother up many of the disabilities under which they labour that they have not had them remedied. Those people who have made the most row have generally secured the best results. It has been said that the filling in of this schedule will be a difficult matter for many people. I venture to say that I could fill it in with my eyes shut, and that the same may be said of all who will be called upon to furnish this return. I am sure that no humiliation will attach to it. The common sense of the people will lead them to recognise that there is a purpose behind this action on the part of the Government, and that that purpose is to ascertain what are the capabilities and the capacity of Australia. </para>

It says something for the common sense of the Government that they have at last realized the necessity for gathering together facts that will enable them to organize the capacities of the people of Australia. I am satisfied that the people of Australia - to use a colloquialism - are well able to keep up their end of the stick. They have demonstrated this again and again, and the passing of this Bill will enable them to do a little more in that direction. </para>

This is not a question of furnishing a return to supply information, but of permitting deductions to be made in estimating the amount of a person&#39;s income. The Government propose to permit deductions for life, fire, or other insurance premiums, and believing it to be fair and equitable, I cordially support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan&#39;s</inline> suggestion that provision should be made in the schedule for the deduction of contributions to friendly societies. </para>

                        <para>. - &#34;When deductions are permitted in respect of life, fire, and other insurance premiums, and contributions to pension or superannuation funds, we ought to permit deductions in the case of contributions to friendly societies. It is absurd of the Minister to say that members of friendly societies will be no worse off if this deduction is not permitted, because the same argument would apply to those who are given permission to make the other deductions provided for. If this were the only amendment made in the Bill, and it alone would necessitate the further consideration of the Bill in another place, I should not think of moving it. </para>

Under the schedule a man is required to state the amount of rent? he has to pay. Is there any stronger reason why he should supply information of that kind than there is why he should set out his payments to friendly societies? He is also obliged to state the amount which he pays in water rates and gas rates. Yet important information affecting a quarter of our population is not to be supplied in connexion with this census. It is estimated that one-fourth of the people of the Commonwealth are directly connected with friendly societies. But the Vice-President of the Executive Council is prepared to ignore . this large proportion of our citizens. </para>

                        <para>. - I join in the appeal which has been addressed to the Vice-President of the Executive Council by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan.</inline> But I put my appeal upon quite a different footing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has pointed out that it is unfair that people who contribute to friendly societies should not be allowed to deduct such contributions from the amount of their incomes. He is evidently under the impression that if they were allowed to do so, a benefit would be conferred upon them. The position reminds me of an argument which I heard in the New South Wales Parliament many years ago, upon the question of capital punishment. In lieu of the capital penalty, it was suggested that there should be imprisonment for life. Somebody thereupon urged that that would be a harsher form of punishment than would be the execution of a man . I recollect that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes then inquired what the author of that statement would think if he had been sentenced to imprisonment for life, and somebody came along and intimated that, in order to be merciful to him, he was to be taken out and executed. That is the sort of mercy which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is meting out to these people. But I want to ignore the interests of the individual altogether, and I say that the return will be incomplete unless we adopt the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> for the reason that a man filling in a return will show his gross income, and then will take away a portion, leaving, as the result, his net income, which is the only factor which can interest this country to any great extent. If we are going to allow a man to deduct the &#163;20 or &#163;30 he pays upon an Australian Mutual Provident Society policy, and refuse to allow him to strike off the &#163;4 or &#163;5 he might pay to a friendly society for exactly similar benefits the return will be quite misleading. I hope the Minister will see that if it is good to reduce the schedule so far as life insurance societies are concerned, to make it complete it will be necessary to make a similar exemption with regard to the contributions to friendly societies. I thought at once that when this matter was brought forward <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would readily accept it. </para>

He is fearful that if that suggestion be adopted it will entail considerable trouble on members of friendly societies; but quite the opposite will be the effect. In paragraph 4 of the deductions, a request is made for a return of the life, fire, and other insurance premiums paid. If a citizen is called upon to mention the amount he pays for life insurance, I see no reason why he should not be required to mention the amount paid to a friendly society. The Minister was emphatic in saying that there was no need to exempt the friendly societies, because there was no intention to tax them. Now he appears to be of quite the opposite mind. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> advanced an argument, which he seemed to regard as conclusive, that as we did not include any income which a man might receive by way of pay from friendly societies, we ought not, therefore, to put on the other side of the statement the amount he has paid to such societies. If a man does receive any payment from a friendly society, he has to mention it in his return under the heading of income from &#34;all other sources,&#34; but he is now allowed to offset the amount he pays into the society. As the reason advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is no longer tenable, I hope he will see the advisability of urging his colleague to accept the amendment. The Minister can urge no strong reason against including payments to friendly societies. </para>

                            <para>- That statement indicates that the Minister would have returned as the income of the people of Australia their gross income. That would be an absolutely unfair and false basis to proceed upon. The amount a man has for his own use is not the gross amount he collects, but that amount, less the expense incurred in carrying on his operations. It is clear that the Government had decided that there should be some exemptions, and, in order to determine what is a man&#39;s income, certain deductions from his gross income may be made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> halving yielded to pressure which compels him to do something he does not wish to do, has provided that if an individual obtains sick pay or other benefits from the society to which he contributes, he shall enter such amount as income. </para>

Below that, he certifies that he has paid to the society &#163;4. Surely, it would be only fair to allow a man to include such a payment in the return. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has informed us that he pays &#163;14 or &#163;15 a year to one of the recognised lifo institutions of Australia; and yet, because another man happens to pay into a friendly society, that man is not to enjoy the same benefit as does the honorable senator! I think we ought to treat all citizens with an approach to equality and fairness; and T must express my amazement that the Government should reject an amendment which is in conformity with the spirit or the schedule, and should have been accepted long ago. </para>

                        (South Australia) friendly society for over forty years, and during that time 1 have been fortunate enough, or unfortunate enough, to draw sick pay for only one fortnight. The point is that, according to this schedule, I should have to return the sick allowance in income from other sources, though I am not allowed to put in, as a set-off. the amount of money I have paid in during the whole of the forty years. No business man would regard a stocktaking as complete unless the debit as well as the credit were shown. As the Bill stands, I can deduct payments on account of fire insurance, but I may not deduct my contributions to any friendly society, though these may be double or three times that of the insurance society liability.

                            <para>- I am not allowed to make that deduction; and I think the Minister is wrong. I venture to say that, where there is one guarantee paid as contemplated under the fidelity and guarantee return, there are 500 payments to friendly societies; and yet one may be deducted while the other may not. I do not see on what ground the Minister can defend his position. Then again, I am allowed to deduct interest on borrowed money; but if I am not allowed to deduct all my actual payments, I cannot give a complete and true return. These payments to friendly societies are quite as necessary as any payments to provide shelter for my family; and I must draw attention to the insincerity and inconsistency of the Minister in this connexion. I fancy that what is in the honorable gentleman&#39;s mind is that the friendly societies will have to give these returns; but I take it that that is not so. Each individual himself must give particulars as to his position, as under the various State Acts; and it certainly is necessary in order to arrive at the net income. Whatever the purpose of the Bill may be, the immediate object is to secure a correct return of the net income of the people of Australia, showing such deductions as are necessary. The Minister appears to have taken up the position that, rather than allow this one ex-  emotion. he would wipe out all the others. </para>

                            <para>- There will be just as much benefit to the individual as is given by any of the other deductions that are allowed. Our object should be to arrive at a correct return of a citizen&#39;s income, and if we do not allow a deduction in regard to payments to friendly societies, we shall not get a correct return. The attitude taken up by Ministers is a small one. I cannot see why the Vice-President of the Executive Council cannot concede the request put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> who has done a wise thing in calling attention to this omission from the schedule. It is a reflection on Ministers that they cannot see their way clear to make this concession to persons who choose, by their thrift, to save the Commonwealth a vast amount of money </para>

                            <para>- It has been best put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who describes the purpose of the Bill as a national stock-taking, and that is a matter which has no connexion with taxation. If the omission of the deductions suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> would mean that the members of friendly societies would be taxed on the amounts they were not allowed to deduct, I would be with the honorable senator, but that will not be so. Why, then, should the honorable senator insist on putting thousands of people to the trouble of computing the exact amounts they pay to friendly societies? Why should we not also allow the amounts paid to unions to be deducted? If a man pays &#163;3 into a friendly society, &#163;1 10s. of this amount usually goes towards medical attendance, yet it is not proposed to allow persons not in friendly societies to deduct the amount they pay annually for medical attendance. My attitude is to stand by the schedule as printed, and if deductions for life and fire insurance had not been in the schedule, I would have opposed their inclusion, because I do not desire to alter the Bill. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has to introduce another Bill, of wider scope, which will keep us fully occupied until 4 o&#39;clock tomorrow afternoon with a continuous sitting, I ask honorable senators to allow this matter to go through. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether the closing remarks of the Minister are to be taken as a threat, but such remarks will not help him to get business through. I consider this Bill, not from the amount of time that we have at our disposal, but the strength of the reasons that are brought forward in urging alterations. The object of the Bill has not been fully explained. A perusal of the measure helps us to understand it, but the explanations given by the Minister as to its object have given rise to confusion and differences of opinion. T dare say that discussion would be materially curtailed if we could only discover what its real purpose is. A perusal of the schedules leads one to the conclusion that these statistics are &#34;required for some particular reason, but we cannot ascertain what that reason is. One honorable senator has described this as a national stock-taking, and that is the latest explanation advanced by the Minister. Why, then, should we not have as complete a stock-taking as we can possibly get? If the object of the Bill is to ascertain what amount of money the various institutions of the country control, we should have some record of the financial position and activities of the friendly societies. Certainly, if the purpose is to collect information on which taxation may be based, the funds of friendly societies should be exempted. These institutions are even more valuable than the insurance societies. They do more charitable and social work, and their ramifications are greater, providing as they do assistance for the sick and funeral expenses for the relatives of deceased members. I do not know whether it is intended to require returns from trade unions, but that, to my mind, is necessary if full social statistics are to be obtained. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so. There is no more obvious need in a country whose population desires advanced social and democratic legislation than the most complete statistics bearing on all its industries and activities. It is proposed to spend &#163;150,000 in employing a host of collectors and an army of clerks to gather from every household, and from almost every person in the community, elaborate statements regarding health, age, possessions, and many other things, and yet no regard is being paid to the work done by the friendly societies. If we adopt a national scheme for insurance against sickness and accident, statistics relating to friendly societies will be absolutely necessary for its intelligent discussion. If we are to know the exact position of affairs after this Bill has become law,, the schedules should be made more complete than they are. Either we are asking for too much detail, or for net enough; but the request for such trifling information as that regarding personal effects strikes me as carrying legislation to the height of absurdity. When the schedule arrives at the average workingman&#39;s home, we shall see John Brown, asking his neighbour, &#34;What is the meaning of this item?&#34; or, &#34; What have I to pub down as my personal effects?&#34; Unless an elaborate explanation goes out with this schedule, it will be impossible for any one to know exactly what is required, just as it will be impossible for any one to know, after he has filled in the schedule, whether he has complied, with the terms of the Act. Yet all the time a fine will be hanging over his head. </para>

Reverting to the friendly society aspect of the question, it cannot be argued that these societies are not just as much entitled to the opportunity of placing before the country the importance of their work as other institutions - fire insurance companies, for instance. What is fire insurance or life insurance in comparison to the work of friendly societies ? One might talk for a month without exhausting the subject of friendly society work, and the honorable gentleman must see the wisdom of accepting the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan.</inline> He pointed out the importance of the matter, and honorable senators who have spoken since have furnished further reasons for the acceptance of the amendment. I do not wish to detain the Committee much longer, but the Minister must see that, unless some amendments on the lines that have been suggested are made to the schedule, the large expenditure that will be incurred by the passage of this Bill will give the Government no more information than we have at the present time, and the operation of the Bill will have been little less than a wilful waste of public money. In another place it was stated that hitherto we had proceeded on wrong lines by legislating when complete statistics were not available, and of subsequently seeking reasons for that legislation. Now, it was also stated, we are going to reverse that order of things, and get the statistics first, and when the statistics are complete, certain measures are to be presented to Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- And so he ought to do. This return will be incomplete unless such items appear. I find that the expenditure of the friendly societies of Australia last year amounted to &#163;1,456,000, and a very large proportion of this would relate to sick pay. All these items are to be eliminated from this national balance-sheet. A stock-taking is of no use unless complete. The Minister&#39;s unyielding attitude is like that of a man who tells a lie and regards the fact as the strongest reason why he should stick to it. </para>

                        <para>. - The more I look at the schedule the more I am amazed at the attitude of Ministers. As mature judgment is vouchsafed to them, they will look back with feelings of sincere gratitude to those of us who tried to save them from the awful blunder with which they are confronted. They are going to exempt what a man pays as fidelity guarantee to insure his moral health, and refuse to exempt what he pays as a sort of guarantee for his physical health. They allow him to deduct the bill for repairs and maintenance of his property, but not the bill for the maintenance and repair of his own person. The sum of &#163;1,600,000 paid, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan,</inline> in sick Benefits to members of friendly societies will, unless struck out of the schedule, appear as an inflation of the income of the people. The statistics, if they are to be worth the money they will cost to collect, ought at least to be accurate. The premiums paid on life policies to insurance societies are to be exempt; those paid to friendly societies are not. The only difference is that the first are generally paid by the wealthier men, and the second by the poorer. Why do the Government propose to distinguish between them, to the disadvantage of the latter? Apparently the real reason for holding up the business to-night is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> having pronounced against the amendment yesterday, feels that he cannot accept it today without endangering his reputation as a strong man. </para>

The measure with which we are now invited to deal is an exceedingly important one, proposing the raising of, perhaps, the biggest loan known in the history of Australia. I do not rise to delay business, but I feel sure that if the consideration of this important measure is postponed until we meet at the usual hour in the morning, honorable senators will be in a better frame of mind to deal with it than they can be expected to be at nearly 2 o&#39;clock in the morning. I do not know how far the Government propose to go with the Bill before adjourning. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> took an important stand on that occasion. I do not say that the two cases are analogous, but there is a certain similarity between them. In the absence of discussion, my own opinion is that this Bill is not in order if it is subject to another measure, until that measure has received  the Royal assent and&#34; has become an Act. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> raised his point of order purported to amend a measure the Royal assent to which had not, at the time, been reported to Parliament. This Bill refers in the second clause to the &#34; Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-1915.&#34; Why should you, sir, be called upon to assume that the figures &#34; 1915 &#34; are not a misprint? If, instead of referring to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-15,- the Bill referred to the Commonwealth Debenture Stock Act 1915, and there was no such Act in existence, could it be held that the measure was out of order? It has been laid down again and again by successive Presidents that you, sir, are not called upon to interpret our Constitution. Equally, I contend that you sir, are not called upon to interpret the legality of our Statutes. If this Bill became an Act, and there was something faulty in its draftsmanship, and if a case were taken to the law Courts, it would be quite proper to argue that no action could be taken under it, because the Act to which it referred was not in existence. But you, sir, are not called upon to decide as to the legality of an Act. If the position were otherwise, you could be asked to rule out of order any Bill because of some imperfection in its draftsmanship. How can you, sir, know that when we reach the clause to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has directed attention, a Minister will not move&#39; to strike out that portion to which exception has been taken ? The only point which you are called upon to determine is whether the Bill is in accordance with our Standing Orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has not quoted any standing order to which the Bill does not conform. I submit that when a point of order is raised it must be based on the ground that our Standing Orders have been contravened. </para>

                        <para>- Of course we must. But to argue that because of something in it which may be merely an error of draftsmanship it should be ruled out of order is absurd. I now wish to show that there is a precedent for the procedure which has been adopted in connexion with this measure. In the early days of the Federation, when we were dealing with the sugar question, honorable senators will recollect that two Bills were simultaneously introduced dealing with that subject. One of them was the Sugar Bounty Bill, and the other the Sugar Excise Bill. They were intimately related one to the other. If honorable senators will take the trouble to turn up those measures they will find that the Sugar Bounty Bill referred to the Sugar Excise Act, and the Sugar Excise Bill referred to the Sugar Bounty Act. Yet at the time ne&#39;ither of those measures was in existence as an Act. Both Bills were dealt with concurrently. They were simultaneously brought before both branches of the Legislature, and they were intimately related to one another. Consequently, a precedent exists for the action that has been followed on the present occasion. I submit that the point of order should not be sustained - first, because no standing order has been contravened, and, secondly, because of the precedent which I have quoted. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> has referred to a ruling which you, sir, gave last year, during the course of the present session. &#34;Upon that occasion you ruled that a motion for the first reading of a Bill purporting to amend an Act which did not exist could not be received. The point of order taken on the present occasion has reference to something that is contained in one of the clauses of this measure. The Bill is entitled, &#34; A Bill for an Act to authorize the raisins&#39; and expending of the sum of &#163;20,000,000 for war purposes.&#34; In its title it has no relation to any particular Act. Its purpose is set out in its title. If there be anything in the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> this is not the time to urge it. When the Bill reaches Committee it will be competent for him to point out that the provision embodied in clause 2 is based upon a wrong assumption. But apart from that I would direct attention to the fact that there is iri existence a Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911. If an amending Act be passed -this year it will probably declare that it shall be read and construed with the principal Act. It will also provide that the two Acts are to be referred to as the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-15. But whether we have reached that stage or not, the fact remains that there is in existence a Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911. So much for the merits of clause 2 itself when in Committee. At this stage all that has to be considered is whether the motion itself is in order. </para>

                        <para>- In deciding this point,  perhaps  a little explanation may be necessary for the guidance of honorable senators with regard to future cases of this kind. In the first place, I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> that the point which he has raised is not analogous to that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> as regards a certain Bill over twelve months ago. At that time a Bill was brought in to amend an Act which was not an Act, but which was really a Bill, .and on that occasion I ruled that as that Bill could be amended in the way prescribed by the Constitution itself, it was obvious that any other method of amending it must be out of order. In this Bill no such contingency arises, and I want to direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that the only thing I have to guide me as to whether or not a Bill is in order is, first, the Constitution, and, second, the Standing Orders. If both the Constitution and Standing Orders are silent on the point, I must refer to the practice of the House of Commons. I was informed some time ago that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> intended to raise this point, and, therefore, I looked up the authorities, with the re-  suit that I can find no precedent to guide me in ruling this Bill OUt of order. As was pointed out by the Minister of Defence, the provision to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan</inline> takes exception might be eliminated from the Bill altogether before it passes its third reading. There is also the further point that there might be a Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-15 before this Bill becomes an Act. It all depends on which receives the Royal assent first, or they both might receive the assent at the same time. I would point out, further, that if I had to look through all the provisions of a Bill to see if there were any legal points upon which I should rule whether they were in order or otherwise, I would be saddled with a burden that I should not be called upon to bear. It is no part of my duty to decide technical legalities of interpretation in any Bill. Therefore, I nile against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan&#39;s</inline> point of order. </para>

Attached to it there is no certificate of any sort, except an intimation that it passed its first reading in the House of Representatives over a week ago. It has come up to us by message from another place, and there is nothing to indicate that the Bill which has been placed in our hands is the Bill referred to in the message. I would point out, also, that the War Census Bill, when it was placed in our hands, had the following indorsement on the title page: - </para>

                    <para class="block">I need hardly call the attention of honorable senators to the seriousness of the present position, and to the extraordinary occasion for the introduction of a measure of this kind. As most honorable senators are aware, the raising of this sum of &#163;20,000,000 is rendered necessary by the unfortunate war now in progress in Europe. I need not go back to the origin of that war. Australia, as a Dominion of the Empire, is engaged in this great conflict, which was deemed by the Imperial Government and Parliament to be necessary in the interests of the liberty and freedom of peoples other than their own. We in this part of the Empire had no hesitation in joining forces, and in unanimously indorsing the decision of the Imperial Government that the war was inevitable for a country professing to represent free institutions and the liberties of peoples of all nations, creeds, and colours. Australia did not hesitate to declare her readiness to face the position up to the last man and the last shilling. I believe&#39; that the Australian people, knowing that they were engaging in this war side by side with the Old Country and the rest of the British Dominions, did not consider the financial liability for a single moment, but were prepared to stake their all upon maintaining what they believed to be the rights of free institutions and the liberties of all peoples. It is hardly necessary to say that the war has developed into the greatest the world has ever known, and certainly the greatest that the people of Australia have ever been engaged in. Consequently our obligations have grown tremendously, for the Commonwealth accepts&#39; the whole of the financial responsibility for the raising and maintenance of the Australian Army in the field, as well as of the Australian Navy. Up to the 10th July, 74,576 nien had left Australian shores fully armed and equipped in a fashion second to no other army in the world. On that date we had in training 16,921 men, making a total army of 91 j497 men. As a result of the recruiting since that date we are able to point to the fact that over 100,000 of the young men of Australia have expressed themselves willing and ready to risk life and limb in what they believe to be a just and holy cause. To the 30th June last we had expended on the Navy &#163;3,399,368. That sum relates, of course, only to the actual expense of equipping and maintaining our Naval Forces to participate with the Imperial Navy in this contest, and does not cover construction. On the Military Forces we have expended &#163;9,469,367. Other war forces - which I understand to refer to the mobilizing of the Defence Forces in Australia - cost &#163;135,100, making a total expenditure to the 30th June of &#163;13,003,825. The average cost of every man landed in Egypt fully equipped and ready for action was &#163;85.  It  was an entirely new position in which Australia found itself at the outbreak of this war, but I believe that the people of this Commonwealth entered into the contest knowing that they were tackling a big job and ready to shoulder the responsibility, whatever it might be. In the early stages of our war preparations, hardly any question of finance was involved at all, because we had always, as a Dominion, been able to raise in the Old Country the money we required. No sooner had the war broken out than negotiations were entered into with the Imperial Government, and they expressed their willingness to help us in financing our share in the war, and in meeting other difficulties. The Government felt that they were in a position to finance the war, so far as could be seen ahead at that time, without being altogether dependent on the Motherland; but there was a difficulty in the fact that the States, with the exception of Queensland, had, from time to time, borrowed money for public works and other purposes, and there was an increasing, difficulty on their part in borrowing on the London market as they had previously been able to do. The Government recognised that it would be of no use for the Commonwealth to be in a sound financial position if the States, in a year of drought and war combined, were not able to maintain their activities as in other years. Therefore, the Government made an offer to them, which was readily accepted, that we would help them to maintain their public works expenditure at the average rate of previous years. </para>

                        <para>- For one year. We asked the States to give to us a statement of their average expenditure on public works, and promised to endeavour to finance their requirements. This we have done, and the amount so advanced will have reached &#163;18,000,000 in November. It will be recognised that this would have been an impossible task to have undertaken from the ordinary sources of revenue open to the Commonwealth. But, as a result of negotiations, the British Government offered to lend the Commonwealth &#163;18,000,000 foi- war purposes only. This arrangement meant that, despite the big drain on the Commonwealth finances by the undertaking given to the States - an undertaking of a purely co-operative character - the Commonwealth was placed in exactly the same position as it would have occupied had no war loan taken effect. On the other hand, the war expenditure was increasing, but this expenditure, to a large extent, had been met by raising, with the aid of the Australian note issue, an amount equivalent to that which we received from the Imperial authorities. Therefore, we could claim that, with the exception of the increased liability on account of the note issue, the Commonwealth was not: in a worse financial position than it had occupied in previous years. A little later the British Government inquired if &#39; the Commonwealth would require further moneys for the conduct of the war; and, although the Government were not pressed for money at the time, they recognised that there might be difficulty in approaching the money market at a later date, and gladly accepted from the British Government a further loan of &#163;6,500,000, making the total advanced from that source &#163;24,500,000. Of that amount we have received to date - </para>

Out of the original loan we have received only &#163;12,000,000 from Great Britain, but we have lent &#163;12,125,000 to the States, or &#163;125,000 more than we originally contracted to lend. We have received &#163;15,600,000; but, at the time we entered into the contract with the States, we had only &#163;18,000,000 in view, and there was a mutual understanding in regard to that loan. The &#163;6,500,000 is simply for war purposes, and with this the States, of course, have nothing whatever to do. The balance that we have committed ourselves to lend to the States is &#163;5,875,000, making a total of &#163;18,000,000 in all. Practically, up to November last, both the Commonwealth and the States were in a sound financial position. No particular difficulty had arisen, nor was there any particular money pressure beyond the ordinary troubles of Government; so long as the market is open to the States, and money is available, there are no difficulties. But on 6th July this year, we received an intimation from the British Government. It could by no means be described as a command, nor as a refusal of assistance; indeed, it was very far from either, because the Home authorities were still prepared to help us. Nevertheless it was a clear intimation such as, I believe, any country with any regard for itself would take, that it was desirable, at the present stage, that Australia, if it did not finance itself as a whole, should at least take its share of the responsibility. The Commonwealth Government interpreted that message to mean that, while we did take our share of the responsibility, we would still have the hearty co-operation of the Home Government. We recognised that Australia could not always be regarded as a child, or as one who had to go cap in hand to the Home Government. We recognised that Australia had felt the touch of nationhood, and that the men at Gallipoli had shown distinctly the spirit of the Australian people, proving that they were excelled by none, and equal to any soldiery in the world. If our young men were prepared to give their lives for the benefit of the Empire, and in defence of our free institutions, we believe there was as great, it was not possible to be a greater, spirit at Home amongst those who could not go to the front, but were prepared to take their share of the financial responsibility. This loan is not put forward by any means as a begging appeal to the people of Australia, because such an appeal we regard as totally unnecessary. The loan is put forward in order to afford an opportunity to those who have to remain at home to participate with, we believe, the same spirit as actuated our brave boys who have laid down their lives at Gallipoli. We believe that the same patriotic spirit inspires both those at home and those at the front; and we ask those at home to make some sacrifice - to dip their hands into their pockets as one most useful way of assisting in the maintenance of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe that either Parliament or people are lacking in appreciation of the services of our men, and I would not like to say that the people at Home are lacking in the spirit displayed by their sons abroad. This is not a time of peace, when we have nothing to consider but public works; but a time when we are faced with an extraordinary task which will require the best efforts of both Parliament and people. That the people will rise to the occasion I, as an optimist, have every confidence. I believe we have the co-operation of the whole of the people, though, of course, there may be differences in regard to the best method of raising the money in Australia. The Government, whilst accepting the responsibility for leading in this matter, have not been so foolish as to believe that they possess all the financial knowledge. They have not been too proud, despite many differences of opinion, to take advantage of the wisdom of other people; and I am not drawing on my imagination when I say that the principle underlying the loan has the indorsement of the best financial authority in Australia to-day. The Bill provides for the raising of sums, by bonds, as low as &#163;10, or any multiple of &#163;10, and inscribed stock, to the amount of &#163;20,000,000. The object of the Government is to practically have four divisions, and raise four distinct loans of &#163;5,000,000. We are setting out on a new sea, so to speak, and if the people of Australia rise to their responsibilities and apply for more than the &#163;5,000,000, we shall be prepared to accept all that they are willing to subscribe. But we require at least &#163;5,000,000. Some people have said, &#34; Why not get &#163;20,000,000 at once?&#34; but we desire to raise the money as the necessity to spend it arises. Whatever steps we take to build up public institutions, or carry out public works, we should never do anything that will injure existing institutions, unless we are prepared to provide sounder and better ones. Private enterprise is dominant in Australia today. It carries on the business and trade and commerce of the Commonwealth, and, though I am anxious to see more collective and State enterprise, I have no hesitation in saying that commerce, with all its ramifications, only exists by consent of the people of the country. How long that condition of affairs will last I do not know ; but, at any rate, the Commonwealth Government have no desire to go into the money market and take &#163;20,000,000 of the coin of the people at one stroke. We will not require the full amount for some months, and, as bountiful nature has been so kind to us during this season, we hope that the money market will be so replenished as to enable* us to turn over the first &#163;5,000,000 during its currency ; and thus we may be enabled at all times to receive the full amount that we require, while at the same time we shall be doing no injury to any existing institution. The banks have met the Commonwealth Government readily, nob only in this matter, but also in regard to the advance of gold made some months ago. The banks recognise that this is no time for party sections, that we are all in the war, and that injury to one must mean injury to another. The recognition of this spirit has enabled the banks and private financial institutions to cooperate readily with the Commonwealth Government in helping to develop the country and maintain our Forces at the front,, while at the same time their own financial position has been preserved. The banks have met us to the extent that they will not charge any commission or any exchange. In fact, they are practically to act as voluntary agents for the Government in the matter of this loan. </para>

We will gladly pay them the 5s. per &#163;100. </para>

                            <para>- We like giving our services to the country as members of Parliament; but, unfortunately, we have to earn bread and butter for ourselves and those dependent on us, and probably many of these stockbrokers&#34; are in the -same position. At any rate, their charge is half of what has been previously paid, and if they bring in a good sum I do not think we will grudge them their fees. My hope is that the stockbrokers of Australian will earn big fees out of this loan. </para>

Bonds, like bank notes, can be passed from hand to hand, and one of the difficulties that country people may have is to find places of security in which to keep them; and as the Government believe that, for patriotic reasons, many country people will be inclined to purchase one or more of these bonds, special arrangements are being made through the Commonwealth Bank to take care of bonds at very small fee, if any fee at all is charged. The loan will not be underwritten. Subscriptions will close on the 31st August. A provision in the recent British loan arrested a good deal of attention, and honorable&#39; senators might be inclined to ask why it is not adopted in Australia. Tha British Government guaranteed that, in the event of a new loan being issued at a higher rate of interest those who hold stock in the earlier loan will have the </para>

The best advice we can get In Australia, and the information we can glean in regard to the money market, show that it is not desirable for the Commonwealth Government to make such a provision&#34; in regard to this loan, because we believe that all our requirements will be met, and that there will be no gain hy giving additional guarantees for what is practically the first Commonwealth loan issued in Australia. The bonds and inscribed stock will be free of stamp duty and State income tax, and, as the Prime Minister has already announced the intention to impose one, also the Federal income tax. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. Tha State of South Australia has the matter still under consideration. In the meantime we shall issue the prospectus, and proceed to raise the loan. It is believed that the coming season will be so prosperous that the borrowing of this money will in no way affect the industrial interests of Australia. Three-fourths of the money spent on war purposes by the Commonwealth remains in Australia. Even our soldiers who are serving abroad have left the bulk of their pay behind for the benefit of their wives and families. The stock will be issued in accordance with the Inscribed Stock Act 1911-15, and bonds will be convertible at the Treasury into inscribed stock, and inscribed stock into bonds. Ten per cent, of the amount applied for must be paid on application, 15 per cent, more will become payable on the 15th September, another 20 per cent, on the 15th October, another 25 per cent, on the 15th November, and the final instalment of 30 per cent, on the 30th November. Whilst we all regret the circumstances which make this loan necessary, and would prefer that the money, instead of being used for purposes of destruction, could be used for the construction of necessary public works, we must bow to the inevitable. It is for u&#187;, the people, of a young nation, to show that  we accept full responsibility for the management of our affairs, and are ready to finance the equipment and maintenance of an army to defend what we believe to be the best institutions in the world. The flotation of the loan is a test of the spirit of our people, and I feel sure that all efforts will be bent towards making it a success, with a view to securing victory for the British Empire and its Allies in the present struggle. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister of Defence, in reply to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan,</inline> has furnished figures showing the percentage which the recruits raised in each State bear to the population of that State. I ask the Minister whether the percentages were not arrived at by comparing the enlistments for each military division with the population of the State after which it is named. If so, they are misleading. The whole population of New South Wales is not contained within the New South Wales military district. A large part of the Northern River district of the State, though its population is credited to the State, forms part of the </para>

I should like the Minister of Defence  to  have those figures checked in order to ascertain whether that error has occurred or not. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite true, as stated by the honorable senator, that the military districts do not arbitrarily follow the State divisions; and it is therefore possible that the deductions he has made are also correct. I will have the figures looked into. </para>
