They were transported without any loss, and landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and have been in active fighting against the Turkish forces. The action has proceeded, and is proceeding, successfully.

I am aware that the prohibition has occasioned some inconvenience to the press, and, perhaps, to honorable members of Parliament, and also to the relatives and the friends of the Forces, but I think they will all realize now, when the whole of the facts are allowed to be made public, that it was done in the interests of the troops themselves, and that it- is essential that the strictest secrecy regarding movements of troops should be observed. I am glad, however, to be able to say, now that the transportation of the troops has been successfully carried out, that instructions have been issued that all news in possession of the press in regard to the operation may be published. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have decided to continue the payment of the separation allowance to wives- and families of&#39; members of the Australian Imperial Forces after leaving Australia on active service. The rate will be 10s. per week for the wife and 2s. 6d. per week for each child under sixteen years of age, to commence from 1st May. I may add that up to the present time the practice has been that the separation allowance was only paid until the soldiers left Australia, whereupon it ceased. But it is now proposed to pay the allowance until the soldiers return to the Commonwealth. </para>

These applications are to be considered in the first place by the Selection Committee of the district to which they are attached. The recommendation of the Selection Committee is not final ; it goes on to the Commandant, who also takes into consideration those factors. Then again, the recommendation is sent forward by him to the Military Board, the members of which are also in possession of all the information, and from the Military Board the recommendation goes on to the Minister. In each nf these cases instructions are that past services are to be taken into consideration. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter which has had attention, and the arrangements are these: - Prior to the publication of any casualty list, in the case of officers the Governor-General will convey the information through a suitable channel - generally a clergyman - to the relatives of the deceased officer. In the case of the rank and file this information will be conveyed by myself by means of a telegram, or if there is no telegraph station, by means of a special messenger, generally through a clergyman of the denomination to which the soldier belongs, so as to ensure that the first news of a casualty shall reach the relatives of a soldier. Until we are assured that the message has reached its destination no casualty lists will be published. When sufficient time has elapsed to enable these messages to reach the relatives of those concerned, the casualty lists will from time to time be made available. In case my reply may be misunderstood by the public, I should like to add that, up to the present time, with the exception of deaths due to sickness, the Government have not been advised of any casualties amongst our forces. </para>

                <para class="block">Minister of Defence, but I desire briefly to refer to one or two of the other matters that have been introduced into the discussion. I exceedingly regret that the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition for a party truce was not accepted in the spirit in which it was offered to honorable senators on the other side. They have, unfortunately, seen fit to think that it was not offered in a genuine spirit. I can assure them that the offer was genuinely made, and is genuinely made at this juncture. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> explained that the Labour party do not regard it as genuine, because opposition has been offered by our party to the Ministerial nominees at the by-elections for the other House. The Senate, however, must not forget that no truce has yet been arrived at. There is to-day no such thing as a political truce between the two parties. </para>

I shall not object, although I shall raise my voice in opposition to any measure which I do not consider is in the best interests of the whole of the people. Outside of that I have no desire to offer any criticism of the proposals of any Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not follow that interjection either. If the honorable senator exercises his privilege as an Irishman of speaking until he is understood, I think he will have to speak for a long time. I am sorry the offer of the Leader of the Opposition was not accepted in the spirit in which it was made. Honorable senators who have spoken to the question from the other side have adopted a stand-and-deliver attitude. They practically say, &#34; We are going to have what we want, no matter what you on the other side may say.&#34; If that is the attitude to be adopted by the Government and their followers, I do not mind, so long as we and the public know it. We shall know exactly where we are. I am always ready to take my own part, and if I do not agree with the Government I can raise my voice against their proposals. </para>

Very well, then, let the people of Australia know it. That is a stand-and-deliver attitude. It is the spirit of the highwayman; but is it the real patriotic spirit that ought to be shown at this juncture? Is it the spirit animating the people at a time when one cannot get half-a-dozen individuals anywhere in Australia to talk about anything but the war, with perhaps a word or two about the drought? </para>

                        <para>- I shall have a few words to say to the Honorary Minister on that subject. I regret that Australia generally is suffering from the double affliction of the war and the drought. We have had a war with the elements which has given our legislators in the Federal and State Parliaments the very gravest concern. I do not wish to cast the slightest reflection on the Prime Minister for alluding to it as a little drought. Probably he was trying to produce in the minds of the people generally the feeling that the drought was not so severe as it really was. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the words were used by him in that sense, because I give him credit for knowing better. Unfortunately, the drought throughout Australia to-day is so severe that every other in our history pales into insignificance. When I reckon up its effects I have not the slightest doubt that it will take Australia at least ten years to recover from it. Probably by that time we shall have experienced another drought. I &#34; know that in Australia to-day there are a great many people who believe that &#62;i&#39; is possible for meteorologists to make accurate weather forecasts for periods of from ten to fifty years ahead. But does it require a meteorologist to do that ? Yon , sir, who have had a considerable experience of Australia, know full well that one has merely to look at the history of this continent - and history has an unfortunate knack of repeating itself - to realize that at some period between 1922 and 1925 we shall be again visited by drought. </para>

                        <para>- And not to be misled. We all know that in 1902-3 we experienced a severe drought, and that the years 1912, 1913 and 1914 were also years of drought, or, at least, were years in which we lacked the normal rainfall. We may, therefore, conclude with reasonable certainty that droughts will recur at fairly regular intervals. Consequently it behoves the younger members of the Senate to take warning from our past experience, and to make provision to obviate the suffering which Australia will otherwise sustain when similar droughts again overtake it. There are only two ways in which such provision could be made. Water conservation is the prime necessity of this country, and it is incumbent upon us as legislators to make as much provision as possible for conserving the natural rainfall, because the quantity which goes to waste in normal years is ample to provide for the entire requirements of the Commonwealth in adverse years. It is our bounden duty, therefore, to go in for a system of water conservation by which we can be safeguarded against periodical droughts. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I am not a member of the South Australian Parliament, but  probably  my words will reach the Parliament of Western Australia through the medium of the  honorable  senator, and if so, my speech this afternoon will not have been in vain. I say that down the River Murray sufficient water annually runs to waste to prevent Australia from ever lacking a supply of this precious fluid if that waste were properly conserved. What is the other duty with which we are faced <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Obviously it is that, like Joseph of old, we should store up sufficient in the years of plenty to tide us over the years of adversity. That is the only way in which we can guard against drought. I hope that the older members of this Chamber will endeavour to &#39;give effect to some such policy, because ten years hence probably I shall not be here. During the course of  his remarks on this motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> called upon me to indorse his statement that the present Government are the true friends of the farmer, inasmuch as they have removed the duties upon fodder. If that simple act would brand them as the friends of the producer, I, as a farmer would say, &#34; Good luck to them.&#34; But has the suspension of the fodder duties assisted any farmer in Australia even in the slightest degree? Certainly not I There is not a farmer who has benefited by the suspension of those duties to the extant of a brass farthing. </para>

                        <para>- That is sheer nonsense, because the suspension of the duties enabled the farmers in this State to be supplied with cheap imported seed wheat. It enabled the farmers to get their wheat ls. per bushel cheaper than they otherwise would have done. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that the farmers of Australia have not benefited by the suspension of the fodder duties. In the bad season like that through which we have just passed, those farmers who had given large orders for bags suddenly found that a 10 per cent, impost had been levied upon&#34; all jute goods. Was not that helping the- farmer with a vengeance? As a matter of fact, the position to-day is that some farmers have not only had to pay an extra tax upon their bags, but have had to borrow the money with which to purchase them, and will also have to pay interest upon that borrowed money until next year before they will have an opportunity of filling those bags. Similarly we find that the farming community is being mulcted in a sum of &#163;300,000 per annum by reason of the duties upon agricultural implements and machinery. </para>

                        <para>- Practically a third of a million pounds per annum :s a very severe impost to levy on the farmers of the Commonwealth in this co (1nexion. If there is any industry in our midst which ought to be fostered it is the producing industry. All possible restrictions should be removed from it, and every encouragement should be offered for its expansion. The one great word in Australia should be &#34;Production.&#34; That should be the foremost word of every Government; whether it be State or Commonwealth. If &#39; that ia the attitude of a paternal Government to the producing interests. I think that the farmers will say, &#34; Lord, save us from our friends.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Who is going to pay the price of Dundee bags? If the farmers are called upon to put wheat in such bags, the sooner we have bulk handling the better. Wheat bags are not made in Australia, and we cannot even grow the material to make them from. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> wanted to know why Australia, having produced 50 per cent, more wheat last season that it did in 1902-3, the price should be so much higher to-day than it was then, and he suggested that there is a secret human agency at work to bring about such a result. I do not know why, as soon as a commodity gets a little scarce or begins to rise a little in price, honorable senators on the other side should always raise the cry that there is a ring, or combine, or trust in operation to bring about that result. I have a suspicion as to such honorable senators being truly honest in their remarks when they exhibit so much suspicion as they do. What is the position in reference to the wheat business in Australia to-day, compared with the position in 1903? It is well known that in 1903 we had an abnormally light crop, realizing only 12,378,068 bushels. We cannot get the whole of the figures for the last crop. The production in Victoria was estimated at 4,084,865 bushels, and the crop yielded 3,940,947 bushels. In South Australia the production was estimated at 4,664,761 bushels, and the crop yielded 3,527,428 bushels. In Western Australia tje  crop was estimated to yield 3,272,330 bushels, and the crop yielded 2,700,000 bushels. In those three States alone there was a deficiency of 1,853,581 bushels in the yield. In New South Wales it was estimated that there would be a yield of 15,700,000 bushels, in Queensland 1,486,419 bushels, and in Tasmania 371,229 bushels, making  a grand total of 17,557,648 bushels. Taking the figures for the three smaller States, where the crops were light, there is a deficiency of nearly 2,000,000 bushels. I shall be quite within the mark in saying that the yields in those States will fall 3,000,000 bushels below the estimated yields, and if they do, that will only give us a yield of 14,557,648 bushels from three States, which, added to the production of 10,168,375 bushels in the other States, will give a total yield of 24,726,023 bushels, whereas in 1902-3 the yield was only 12,378,068 bushels. That &#39;is an &#34;increase of 100 per rent. Yet we find that, whereas in those days wheat was only&#39; 5s. 6d. or 5s. 7d. a bushel in Australia, it is worth about 8s. a bushel to-day. For seed and flour, Australia requires approximately 37,000,000 bushels of wheat. As there is a deficit of about 12,300,000 bushels, and the carryover from last year was about 7,000,000 bushels, it will be seen that, to continue operations in the coming year, we require at least 5,300,000 bushels. In 1903 the yield was only a trifle over 12,000,000 bushels, and 9,114,490 bushels were imported. By whom - by the Governments of the States or by the Federal Government? No. By the trusts and combines - by the &#34;exploiters&#34; of the people whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> sometimes denounces with vitriolic vehemence. Those &#34; despoilers  &#34; of the people brought that quantity of wheat into Australia at an average cost of 4s. lid. a bushel, and kept the price here on a fairly equal basis. The highest average price ruling in the European market in 1903 was 26s. 9d. a quarter, while the highest weekly average was 30s. 3d., or less than 4s. a bushel in the world&#39;s market, when Australia raised only 12,000,000 bushels. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is not in his place, because lie desired to know, why wheat is so dear to-day in Australia, when it was so much cheaper in 1903, although we produced very much less wheat then. It is because the world&#39;s market rules the price. What is the world&#39;s price to-day? It is from 64s. to 66s. 6d. a quarter, or from 8s. to 8s. 4d. a bushel. We hear that wheat cannot be imported into Australia now at less than from 8s. 6d. to 9s. a bushel. It is- a very pertinent question for my honorable friend from Tasmania to ask why have not Australian merchants introduced wheat to-day. Because of the tinkering with the price by some of the State Ministries, they have been afraid to import, knowing that if they did, it could be commandeered at less than the cost price. It is for that reason that the merchants have refrained from introducing any wheat up to the present time. I do not know that any merchants will import under existing conditions, but wheat has to be imported by somebody to the extent of at least 5,300,000 bushels to meet the actual requirements of the Commonwealth, and there must always be a certain amount of carry-over. It may be said that at least 7,500,000 bushels will have to be imported, and there is a suggestion that the actual figures will fall very much below those which I have quoted. One State in Australia claimed that it was going to control the wheat business by fixing the price. I would not say so much about this matter, only that I think it ought to be an object lesson to honorable senators on the other side. I notice that the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> has said that it is a striking illustration to show that the Federal Parliament can fix prices, but in my humble opinion it has had the very opposite effect. The commandeering of wheat by New South Wales at 5s. a bushel only helped to get over a very small difficulty. Had there been enough wheat in the Commonwealth to meet the whole of the Australian requirements at 5s. a bushel, mid had that price been fixed- </para>

                        <para>- At the beginning Victorians might have bought some wheat, but to-day they could not  buy  at that price. Had the Government of New South Wales possessed any statesmanship then, instead of trying to fix the price locally for a bit of wheat, they would have gone into the world&#39;s market and bought wheat, and th&#169; people of the State would be in a much better position to-day, or in three months&#39; time, than they could possibly be under the commandeering act. In South Australia the Liberal Government did buy wheat abroad, and it is coming in now. They were pretty early in the market, and got a quantity of wheat at about 6s. a bushel. It would have been much better, I repeat, had the Government of New South Wales gone into the world&#39;s market and bought their requirements, instead of taking the wheat away from the farmers. </para>

                        <para>- No. During last year a Royal Commission sat, and recommended to the various States that no wheat or flour should be shipped out of Australia. I am sorry that the recommendation was not taken notice of, because it emanated from three of the finest men in the Commonwealth, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin, Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> The recommendation of those gentlemen ought to have been given effect to, because when they realized that there was a sufficient quantity of wheat and flour in Australia for the consumption of the people, it was a suicidal policy for any Government to allow wheat to be exported. It was really a case of starving our own people. But that does not get over the position of the State Government having seized a certain &#34;quantity of wheat at 5s. a bushel. Considered from any stand-point you like, it was an act of legalized robbery, done, not for the benefit of the whole of the people of the State, but for the benefit of a section. </para>

                        <para>- The Government of New South Wales commandeered the wheat at 5s. per bushel, and in order to maintain  supplies  they have now to go into the world&#39;s markets, and pav 8s. 6d., so that, instead of New South Wales reaping a benefit, the burden has to be borne by the farmers who have been denied the opportunity of getting? the market value for their product. As a matter of fact, they have been robbed of a certain percentage of their earnings, and a benefit has been conferred upon American farmers. Even if the merchants had made a profit over the wheat position in Australia, it would have been better than bringing about the present position, which has benefited the foreign producers of this product. </para>

                        <para>- That does not describe the position at all. The honorable senator is drawing a red herring across the trail. I personally admire the men who say that they will not have this system of espionage. If the condition be found to militate against the supply of military requirements, the Government will be well advised to hold their hands before enforcing it. It is not a question of preference to unionists. Clause 31a of the military contracts to which I refer makes provision, in my opinion, for a political spy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> says that it makes provision for a protector of the weak. Honorable senators may describe the officer as they please, but he is to be permitted to go into factories at certain hours and make certain inquiries, and such an officer is taken exception to by every manufacturer in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I know that very great exception is taken to it. I wish to say a word upon the proposed strategic railway. I have already commended <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> for what he had to say on the subject. The honorable senator directed special attention to the fact that the Northern Territory is now Federal territory, and is not the property of any one State. If I can assist him in bringing home that fact to the minds of honorable senators, I .shall be satisfied with what I have had to say this afternoon. Are we doing all that we can to develop that Federal territory? </para>

                        <para>- I said that the proposed strategic line would not be required for the next 100 years, and I have finished with that matter. I wish now to impress upon honorable senators the solemn obligation resting upon this Parliament. We accepted responsibility for the control of a very large area of country, which is at present being allowed to lie idle because nothing is being done to develop it. South Australia had to bear the burden of the Northern Territory for fifty .years, and it was known as a &#34;white elephant.&#34; Does the Federal Parliament want to become a by -word and reproach bv letting it be known that they could do nothing more with this Territory than let it become the &#34; white elephant&#34; of Australia? If honorable senators do not want that stigma to be cast on this Parliament, I ask them to rise above this pettifogging parochialism of Western Australia, or South Australia, or any other Australia, and to realize that we are Australians first. This Territory can certainly not be developed within its own borders. As was pointed out the other day, the best way to develop it is to carry out the contract under which it was handed over to the Commonwealth, and link &#34;p the north and south immediately by a line of railway. It is objected that the line so far constructed does not pav, but that is no wonder when we remember that it ends in probably one of the driest spots on the face of the earth. Oodnadatta does not enjoy a rainfall of 5 inches per annum. Honorable senators who do not want to carry the line any further because it does not pay. ending where it does, are like a man who built a bridge into the middle of the stream dividing his land, and then said it was no use going any further with it because he did not get any produce from the other side. If the line is continued northward at least as far as the Macdonnell Ranges, I indorse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> opinion that it will become a paying concern and help us to develop the Territory, of which we are the custodians. </para>

According to the honorable senator, the back-bone railway from north to south and the rib railway from east. to west would facilitate the approach of an  enemy;  but the suggested strategic line from Port Augusta to Brisbane would be one on which only our own forces could travel, and which the enemy could not use at all. If that is the honorable senator&#39;s argument, it is a very silly state of mind for him to get into, and the sooner he disabuses himself of it the better it will be for him and Australia generally. I want to emphasize the fact that the Commonwealth accepted the responsibility for the Territory, and must not shirk it.

An agreement in black and white was entered into by the Commonwealth and South Australia with regard to the Northern Territory. In the four corners of that agreement a distinct arrangement was made that a railway line should be constructed by the Commonwealth connecting Oodnadatta with the existing line in the Territory, which at that time ran to Pine Creek.

                        <para>.- I do not suggest that at the present juncture, when all our resources are taken up by the war, we should enter immediately into any undertaking of the sort. But the first Commonwealth work of any importance that should be undertaken is the carrying out of the agreement to build the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. I do not know sufficient about the proposal of the Government to build a strategic railway from Port Augusta to Brisbane to offer any comment with regard to it, but the north-south railway offers many advantages from a strategic point of view also. The Northern Territory is about the weakest point on the Australian coast so far as concerns the danger of invasion. There are no defences on our north coast, and we ought to take the earliest opportunity of establishing such means of communication as would enable us to send troops to defend it. The troops that would come from Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, and the greater part of Victoria would find the north-south line the quickest and most direct means of transportation to the Northern Territory, and when the line, which I believe is authorized, if not al ready begun, connecting Broken Hill with the main New South Wales railway system, is finished, which will probably be within not more than two or three years at the outside, the north-south line will be the easiest and quickest route by which to transfer New South Wales troops to Darwin. From &#34;a strategic point of view, therefore, the north-south line is the best proposition yet put forward. It will also, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> points out, be a very useful  developmental line. If the Territory had not been transferred to the Commonwealth three or four years ago, I believe that a railway from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges would be now in course of construction, if not already completed, by South Australia itself, because the Government of  South  Australia were so seized of the advantages offered by the line, and the absurdity of the present desert terminus, that they would have carried out the work themselves. However, the agreement exists, and ought honorably to be carried out. I am surprised that some of our Western Australian friends, who have got their own railway- </para>

Twenty- five years ago I was a member of a Ministry that entered into an agreement with Western Australia on the subject. Th9 two Governments were so satisfied of the necessity of constructing the east- west line, that they were prepared to agree to construct it themselves. It was only because Federation supervened soon after that the project was postponed, and the work regarded as a national undertaking. All we ask is that the agreement shall be carried out by both parties to it. </para>

I congratulate the Government on the very satisfactory position in which the Commonwealth finds itself in these times of extreme difficulty. I was very pleased to see the financial statement laid before another place by the Prime Minister, because I must admit that there was very great anxiety as to our financial position in view of the extreme stringency of the money market, and the situation created by the war. Before we adjourned over Christmas we were assured by Ministers that financial arrangements were completed to tide  us  over to the end of the financial year - 30th June next. We were aware that during the recess the sending away of our contingents, and making provision for additional contingents would involve a considerable increase of expenditure, and that some of the sources from which additional revenue was expected, particularly the probate duties and the land tax, had not come up to expectations. As a matter of fact, we have not received a penny from probate duties, nor are we likely to do so by the end of the financial year. I think the Treasurer could not have looked into that matter as carefully as we had a right to expect, or his estimate would not be so woefully astray. </para>

It is, however, satisfactory to know that the deficiency has occurred through our old pioneers being so tough that they are still outlasting the strenuous times through which we are passing, and living longer than the average. That is not a matter of which we have any reason to complain. Considerable anxiety was then felt as to how we would finance matters, seeing that the Estimates had not come up to expectations, and that we were obliged to incur a huge expenditure on account of the despatch and maintenance of the Australian troops who are now fighting in the cause of civilization at the front. I am very pleased to learn from the Ministerial statement that a further arrangement has been made which will dispel all cause for anxiety in this connexion, not only to the end of the financial, but to the end of the calendar, year. Under the arrangement which has been completed, the Commonwealth is to obtain a further loan of &#163;6,500,000 from the Imperial Government for war purposes, and &#163;3,500,000 to enable us to carry out public works which we have already undertaken. That is a very satisfactory statement to place before us. From the Budget delivered by the Prime Minister, prior to the adjournment of this Parliament in December last, I gathered that an arrangement had been concluded with the Imperial authorities for financing the States in the matter of their public works, and also for financing the Commonwealth in its war expenditure. We were expressly told that &#163;18,000,000 was to be provided by the Imperial Government specifically for war purposes, and that another &#163;18,000,000 was to be forthcoming to enable the wheels of industry to be kept going, and to permit of the States carrying on their public works. This course was rendered absolutely necessary by reason of the fact that it was impossible for the States to raise money on the London market at anything like the ordinary rate of interest. The position was made absolutely clear - so clear as to leave no room for misconception. Much to my surprise, however, I find that no less a person than the ex-Premier and Treasurer of South Australia has publicly stated within the past few days that the money which has been made available to finance the States is not being raised in the Commonwealth, but comes from the Imperial Government, and that the Commonwealth is merely an intermediary in the matter. Had the statement been made by an irresponsible person, I would not have taken any notice of it. But, seeing that it emanates from

                <para>That, however, was not the case. The &#163;18,000,000 were loaned to the States by the Home Government, and the Commonwealth was nothing more than an intermediary. It is British gold, and not Commonwealth paper, which we now use in order to carry on our works policy. </para>
                <para class="block">After reading that statement I took the trouble to write a letter to the press pointing out what was the real position, and buttressing my remarks with quotations from the Budget statement of the Prime Minister. But, notwithstanding my letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake</inline> adheres to his position, and in a long communication published in the press has re-afiirmed that the &#163;18,000,000 which the States are using is being advanced by the Imperial authorities. He even goes so far as to insinuate that there is only one sum of &#163;18,000,000 being advanced altogether, and that the impression to the contrary is the result of a little bit of faking on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> part. In these circumstances I would like the Minister of Defence to make a definite pronouncement on the matter. I ask him to say in his reply whether the Imperial Government are supplying the sum of &#163;18,000,000 which is being used by the States for public works purposes, and whether the Commonwealth is merely an intermediary in the matter, or whether that amount really represents a product of the Commonwealth note issue ? In my letter to the press I distinctly said that the States were being financed with the aid of what have been termed &#34; Fisher&#39;s flimsiest.&#34; During the course of this debate an attempt has been made to show that the commandeering of wheat in New South Wales has had the effect of robbing the farmers. If the position in Australia was that the majority of the farmers were sellers of wheat and fodder, instead of being buyers, there might be some justification for the statement that they were being robbed. But I venture to say that for every one of the few fortunate farmers who are in a position to sell wheat and hay there are three who are compelled to buy those commodities. </para>

                            - Exactly. So that, although as the result of the seizure of wheat in New South Wales, and of its sale at a fair price, a little hardship may be imposed on the few farmers who are in a position to speculate, it is incontestable that a great benefit is conferred upon the large majority who have to buy both wheat and fodder.

                    O&#39;LOGHLIN.Yes. A man is entitled to a fair thing. But I am considering the interests of the great majority of farmers rather than those of a few who desire to make a good thing out of the misfortune of their fellows. In the British Dominions, and throughout the States, it has been recognised by Labour Governments that some action was necessary to prevent the cornering of essential commodities at the present juncture. The United Kingdom is now being run as a great Socialistic institution.

                        <para>.- As we recognise unionism, and as most factory owners affirm that they have nothing against unionism, we should offer facilities for union officials to communicate with those whom they represent. That is the object, and it seems to me to be a very fair one. Very often it would prevent trouble instead of, as our opponents seem to imagine, causing it. The honorable senator referred to the duties on bags and machinery. Although I under stand that the duty on bags is imposed with the view to encourage British manufacture - in other words, to promote trade within the Empire - still I shall want to hear much stronger reasons than I have heard before I shall be prepared to support the duty. With regard to machinery, when the duty was imposed there was an agreement placed in the Act that if the manufacturers of machines, particularly agricultural machines, had a Tariff wall erected by Parliament to secure to them the home market, they would have to fulfil certain conditions. They were to undertake, not only that the prices of machines to the farmers should not be increased, but that they should be reduced on a sliding scale over a period of two or three years. Further, the manufacturers were required to agree that the operatives in the factories should receive a fair wage, and  enjoy   fair conditions. I was a member of the Senate when the policy of new  Protection was introduced. Manufacturers came to this building, and said to members of Parliament, &#34; Give us the home market; give us Protection which will enable us to get the total trade, and then we can afford to fulfil the conditions proposed; we can afford to reduce the prices of machines, and we are quite prepared to give standard wages and conditions.&#34; The manufacturers got the Protection they desired on those conditions, but immediately afterwards the leading manufacturer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> of the Sunshine Harvester Works, annealed to the High Court on the constitutionality of the legislation, and the appeal was upheld. </para>

                    O&#39;LOGHLIN.Yes. The position to-day is that, instead of the prices for machinery being reduced on a scale of &#163;5 or &#163;10 a year over a period, they have gone up on about the same scale until they are about 20 per cent, higher now than then. I put it to

Will the honorable senator help us in that direction ?

                        <para>- If the honorable senator is sincere in his claim to promote the interests of the farmers, he will help us to secure that power from the electors, so that the manufacturers, notwithstanding the duty, shall be content with the increased Protection which will be given to them, and shall not raise the prices of their articles to the farmers, but rather shall reduce them. The policy of the Labour party is not to put fresh burdens on the farmers, but rather to relieve them of burdens which they already have. In Western Australia the Labour Government had to step in and start an implement factory, and I had the pleasure of being present afc the official opening last year. The factory, I may say, was in nae previously, because implements had been produced for the consumers, but it was found necessary to enlarge the works, and put up new buildings. I saw a good many farmers at the official opening, and the result of this enterprise by the State is that, whereas the price of harvesters used to range from &#163;90 to &#163;100, the State factory, so the farmers assured me, has been turning out a better article at a cost of 25 per cent. less. </para>

Not the private manufacturers, but Government enterprise, which, I am happy to say, brought down the price of farming implements to a more reasonable figure, I trust that the Minister, in his reply, will deal with the statement of the late Premier of South Australia. I again congratulate the Government on the very satisfactory position we are in, considering the difficulties with which we have to contend. </para>

                        <para>. - To any one who reads this motion, and looks into the question at issue, it must be quite evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is by no means proposing anything that is new. So far as I am able to understand the motion, the machinery ho proposes to create runs practically on all fours with existing legislation. If we substitute the word &#34; five &#34; for the word &#34; six,&#34; and the word &#34; Convention &#34; for the word &#34; Senate,&#34; we find the same machinery proposed to be created by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> as is employed in the law-making process at the present time. I should like to know wherein lies any improvement on the present machinery for altering the Constitution? Usually, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is well worth listening to here, but I must confess that I never heard him speak to worse advantage than he did when he introduced this constitutional question to the Senate. He left his audience utterly in the dark as to what he was really aiming at. He did not enlighten the Senate as to the kind of questions in respect to which the public are likely to ask for an alteration of the Constitution. He did not try to outline anything which requires to be altered. He baldly proposed the creation of a Convention, and, in my opinion, he left the matter there without enlightening the Senate in the slightest degree. Seeing that the honorable senator has been a member of the Chamber since its inception, and that he is a lawyer who has had a considerable experience of the working of the Constitution, has exercised some responsibility in Governments, and has heard the restrictions in the Constitution debated from time to time, it certainly would have been right and proper if he had gone into the matter much more exhaustively than he did. I hope that in his reply he will attempt to enlighten the Senate as to what the Convention is intended to do if it is called into existence. I trust that we shall be informed as to the nature of the alterations which, in his opinion, are necessary to produce a proper-working machine. Every one in Australia nowadays, I think, admits that the Constitution is quite unfitted for Australian requirements. It is clearly recognised that the great promises which were made on its behalf have not been redeemed, and that, although we have a most democratic franchise, this Parliament is completely leg-ironed, and cannot possibly move in the direction which the people of the Commonwealth undoubtedly desire it to go. Our powers are confined within such narrow limits that if we step in the slightest degree over certain boundaries we find when our legislation is put into operation that it is so much waste paper. The High Court is invoked, and rules out the legislation, and we learn that the Constitution does not give us the power to do that which the people desire to be done. Viewing the matter from that stand-point, I consider that, when an honorable senator brings forward a proposal for altering the Constitution, it is only fair to the Senate that he should outline the powers which he wishes to be given to the Parliament. In other words, it is his duty to indicate clearly the lines on which he would propose to alter the Constitution, and the additional subjects on which he considers the Parliament should be empowered to legislate. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator proposes to deal with the major proportion of the Constitution, and surely we are entitled to be enlightened as to the particular subjects which in his view there is a pressing necessity for the Parliament to be empowered to deal with. That information we  have not received from  the honorable senator, and consequently we are placed at a great disadvantage in discussing his motion. I am obliged, therefore, to view this matter from many stand-points. There is only one opinion as to the referenda questions. These questions were before the country on two separate occasions, and, so far as I am aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said nothing to secure their indorsement in order that the powers of the Constitution could be enlarged. I am now at a loss to know whether he has been converted to the view of the Labour party, or whether he is still in the same old place that he occupied when the proposals were before the Senate on a former occasion. I want to know whether he has seen the folly of his ways and now wishes to turn a belated somersault, in view of the fact that the requirements of the Constitution are such that the people will not tolerate any further delay. </para>

It appears to me that nothing can be gained by the adoption of the motion. Up to the present I have heard nothing in favour of this course, and I cannot see why we should be required to have another election. </para>

I am quite satisfied there is nothing to be gained by the course outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> because there is nothing proposed in the motion which the Senate may not do if it chooses, according to section 128 of the Constitution.

The people of Australia are now divided into two camps. We all remember that our opponents expressed the hope that the day would come when there \rould be a straight-out fight between the Labour party and the party opposed to our side in politics. That day has come, and now we hear nothing about there being three elevens in the field. There are only two elevens in the field at present. </para>

At present the sentiment behind the movement is irresistible. </para>

                            <para>- Three Conventions were held, and my impression of the matter was that the work was very slow indeed. At that time there was one predominant party in politics, and one other party, the Labour party, was in its infancy. Since then, however, the latter party has reached maturity, and its members are able to make their voices heard in the affairs of this country. I do not intend to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to pass this motion. At the last election the Labour party promised the people of Australia that if they were returned to power it would be their duty to re-submit the referenda questions at the earliest opportunity. The war intervened, and the circumstances are now such as to render alterations of the Constitution ever so much more a pressing necessity to-day than they were when the proposals were before the people on former occasions. Every Parliament in Australia has been obliged to pass emergency laws all on the same lines, more or less, as those upon which our referenda questions ran, and that fact, I take it, is the best possible proof of the wisdom of this course. </para>

                            <para>- I do not profess to furnish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> with the power to understand my arguments. I can only put them to him, and let them take their chance when they get into his grey matter. We have been told that the adoption of a proposal of this kind would shelve what was a burning question at the late elections. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> believe that it is likely to do anything of the kind ? &#39; I think I have provided the honorable senator with material sufficient to enable him to make a much more exhaustive address to the Senate in his reply  to this debate than that which he made in submitting his motion. All that I can see in the motion is an attempt to slight the Parliament which was so recently elected by the people of Australia. The honorable senator may pretend to give a more generous franchise for the election of the proposed Convention than that which exists for the election of this Parliament. I do not see how he can do so. This Parliament is elected on probably the broadest franchise adopted in any country in the world. Every adult in Australia, whether rich or poor, has equal voting power in the election of members of this Parliament. Does the honorable senator, on the contrary, propose to restrict the popular will of Australia? I think it is fair to assume that there is something of that kind behind the motion, inasmuch as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has made no mention of the method of voting for members of the Convention which is to be adopted. I am not going to assist the honorable senator to restrict the franchise in any shape or form. It seems to me that he proposes to use practically the existing machinery for the election of the Convention, and that if that be so, his motion has not even the merit of novelty. If honorable senators will look at section 128 of the Constitution, they will find that it provides that - </para>

                        <para>We know how this section was outraged in very recent Australian history, and it is as well that we should call the fact to mind at the present juncture. The section continues - </para>
                        <para>But if either House passes any such proposed law by an absolute majority, and the other House rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the first-mentioned House in the same or the next session again passes the proposed law by an absolute majority with or without any amendment which has been made or agreed to by the other  House,  and such other House rejects or fails to pass it or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree, the Governor-General may submit .the proposed law as last proposed by the first-mentioned House, and either with or without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the electors in each State qualified to vote for the elections of the House of Representatives. </para>
                        <para class="block">When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was introducing his motion, I think he was in duty bound to enlighten us as to what he proposed should follow, assuming that it is subjected to the same treatment as were the last Referenda Bills passed by the Senate. The Senate on that occasion was placed in the position of having to eat humble pie, and to play second fiddle to another place. I hold that this section was included in the Constitution to safeguard the interests of the Senate, and not merely to prevent the Senate bringing about a dead-lock with another place, and- frustrating the popular will as represented in another place. The section clearly provides that if either the House of Representatives or the Senate passes proposed alterations of the Constitution, those proposals shall go to the electors automatically, and that the electors, and the electors only, shall have the power to reject or accept them. But what was the course followed less than twelve months ago, when the Senate exercised its undoubted right to pass the Referenda Bills a second time? The Senate was ignored and its rights trampled upon, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> did not on that occasion, any more than did any of his colleagues on the other side, say a word in defence of the rights of this Chamber. We have still the same Governor-General in Australia as we had then. I held then, as I hold now, that there is no room for any difference of opinion in the interpretation of this section of the Constitution, and it was the duty of the Governor-General to send the&#39; proposals for the amendment of the Constitution to the electors of Australia. No other course was open to him. </para>

                            <para>- On a question of a proposed alteration of the Constitution, the Governor-General is alone responsible. There cannot be two opinions upon the interpretation of this section of the Constitution. The bringing about of a double dissolution is a different thing altogether from the refusal to obey the behests of this Chamber, expressed in a constitutional manner, as they were during the last Federal Parliament. If the House of Representatives rejects <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> motion after it has passed here, what will the honorable senator do? Is he prepared to again put the Senate in a humiliating position? Does he propose to amend section 128 of the Constitution? The honorable senator has not enlightened us on any of these matters, and I am therefore obliged to ask for information. After what I have said, it is unnecessary for me to inform honorable senators that I intend to vote against the motion. I can see no possible good that can be derived from it. I can see that if we agreed to the motion, it is probable that the Senate would receive another snub. What is more important, I can see that a very clever bit of side-stepping might be attempted under the motion to frustrate the popular will as expressed at the late Federal elections. I am not prepared *jO assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> in that direction. The referenda proposals have already been too long delayed. If I could have had my way, the questions involved would have been submitted to the electors before now. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of despair at all. Our motto is &#34; No surrender,&#34; and there is a great difference between the two positions. There is no despair in our fight, but there is the opposite of despair in everything we have taken in hand so far. We began in a very modest way indeed. I remember the time, not so many years ago, when the thin, small voice of the Labour party used to be heard from the Opposition corner. The two forms in that corner were sufficient to hold the lot of us. </para>

                            <para>- We numbered only eight in those days, and when noses were counted that was a very small number to stand up against the other twenty-eight. Our party has grown simply because we were honest in the various questions that we propounded. We put before the country a policy that we felt sure would be acceptable. While the referenda questions have been twice rejected, that does not mean that they are going to be rejected in the future. If I were a betting man, which I am not, I should be prepared to bet that at the next time of asking they will be passed by a great majority. I am sure of that, and feel confident that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and his party will see the discretion of not being quite so hostile to the proposals as they were previously. Whatever their fate may be, I am not going to do anything whatever which would be likely to prevent their being put to the people at the earliest possible opportunity. If I were foolish enough to agree to this time-killing proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> I should be justly and properly open to the charge of having done something to defeat  the will of the electors. There is, therefore, no other course open to me but to vote against the motion, believing that &#39;it is of no use to the people at the present time. </para>

                        <para>. - Ou Friday last I dealt with the question of the promotion of Lieutenant Payne to the position of captain on the Administrative and Instructional Staff, and  his  appointment to take charge of the concentration camp at Claremont, Tasmania. Having to leave for Tasmania at 3 o&#39;clock, I was not able to finish my remarks, and requested the Minister to forego his reply until I had done so. The Minister could not  see  his way clear to do this, and in my absence, as he was perfectly entitled to do, dealt with the arguments I had advanced regarding what I believed to be an injustice to the members of the Administrative and Instructional Staff. He also went out of his way to make a statement which is absolutely contrary to fact. He said I had threatened to make it uncomfortable for him during the present session - a statement that is as untrue as it is unworthy of the Minister. The only proof I can offer in support of my present contention is the history of my relations with the Minister during the past four years. I guarantee that if he cares to do me justice he will say that I have been one of his most loyal supporters and staunchest followers during the time that I have occupied a position in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I did not catch what the honorable senator said, as I was discussing a matter connected with the business of the Senate with the Clerk; but if the honorable -senator made a statement that something which any other honorable senator said was not true, meaning that the honorable senator said it knowing it to be untrue, he was distinctly out of order. It is out of order in any case for an honorable senator to make such a statement. He could say that what another honorable senator said was not in accordance with fact, or that the other honorable senator was making a mistake. If he insinuates that a Minister or other honorable senator has made a statement that is untrue, and implies that he knew it to be untrue, he is distinctly out of order. I therefore ask the honorable senator to take the ordinary parliamentary course of withdrawing the remark. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose I am bound by parliamentary procedure to do so, but I am perfectly justified in characterizing the Minister&#39;s statement by an even stronger term. However, to bring myself into conformity with the rules of the Senate, I shall withdraw the remark, but shall hold my opinion all the same. Although I have been somewhat devoted to the Minister for a number of years, I assure him that I am not a hero worshiDper, and that if he or any other Minister does something which I think is not in accordance with justice, he can rely upon me being up against him. It is because I believe a grave injustice has been done to a number of very capable men in the permanent military service of the Commonwealth, that I have with great reluctance brought this matter before the Senate. The Minister said it was too trivial to bring forward, and that I was ill-advised to make my protest here. How are men to get justice except through their parliamentary representative? Wo are told that a Military Board has been established to hear complaints from men in the Military Forces who are at all dissatisfied. These men receive very little consideration from the Military Board. These matters were placed before the Board, but only one individual, the Adjutant-General, gave them any attention, and the Minister referred this question to the very member of the Board - the Adjutant-General - who had previously expressed a very definite opinion upon the promotion of Captain Payne. The Minister, therefore, took the precaution, so to speak, of referring it from Csesar unto Caesar, thereby giving the courteous representations made by Lieutenant Tackaberry and Lieutenant Davis against supersession by an officer from the Militia Forces very little chance of receiving consideration. The Minister said I was not justified in bringing the matter before the Senate, but I want to hold him entirely responsible for my action. </para>

                            <para>- The  President  has already pointed put the fact, but I thank . the Minister for his extra advice. On the 22nd February, I wrote to the Minister of Defence pointing out that, in my opinion, an injustice had been done to these men by the appointment of Captain Payne to his position on the Administrative and Instructional Staff. I received no reply to that letter until the 8th April, six weeks afterwards, and then only after I had wired to the Minister asking him when I should receive the courtesy of a reply. In the circumstances, who is responsible for my having to trouble the Senate with the matter? In his reply, the Minister made a statement which is not supported by facts. In order to back up the contention of some of his officers that Lieutenant Tackaberry was doing very well, and was not entitled to promotion, the Minister pointed out that he had only four years&#39; service to his credit. According to the official file, Lieutenant Tackaberry had nine years&#39; service as a member of the Citizen Forces, two years&#39; active service in South Africa, five years as a non-commissioned officer, and four years as Lieutenant on the Administrative and Instructional Staff. Yet the Minister, in an official communication, sought to deprive him of the recognition to which his length of service entitled him, to say nothing of his very fine record in his examinations both for his lieutenancy and his captaincy. The other day the Minister went to no end of trouble to assure the Senate that this appointment was only of a temporary character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> by interjection, however, got down to the root of the whole trouble when he inquired - </para>

                        <para>In that case, every one of our permanent officers would have to be moved up temporarily. Then, when the officers whose positions they were filling returned from the war, they would have to be moved down again. </para>
                        <para>Will not that happen in hundreds of instances? Are there not officers in Tasmania who have been moved up temporarily, and who will have to be moved down again when those whose places they are filling return from the war? All. I  rim  contending is that these officers whose qualifications cannot be disputed should have been afforded an opportunity of filling these positions temporarily. The Commandant of Tasmania stated that it would be better to put a little extra work on the staff than to bring another officer of the capacity of Captain Payne on to it. Captain Payne is not now on the Instructional Staff at the Claremont camp. He is not connected with that camp. For some reason, he has been removed to Devonport. What position does he occupy there? Lieutenant Davis has been promoted to the position of acting brigade major of the 91st Infantry, and Captain Payne, who is his senior in salary and rank, is his assistant, at &#163;375 a year. Although he is performing work which any second lieutenant could perform, he is receiving a salary of &#163;375 a year, or &#163;75 per annum more than the officer to whom he is only assistant. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. I know nothing about him, and have never seen or spoken to Captain Payne. My complaint is that he has been put over men who are superior to him in length of service and qualifications. Captain Payne was offered the position at &#163;250 a year, but would not accept it. Now the authorities have said to him, in effect, &#34;All right; come in and take it at &#163;375 a year.&#34; It may be, as the Minister has attempted to prove, that there was urgency in making his appointment to the staff at the Claremont concentration camp, but is there any urgency to keep him at his present salary of &#163;375 a year whilst he is discharging the duties that could be performed by a second lieutenant? Will the Minister attempt to justify that? Yet I am told that I have no right to bring the matter before the Senate; I ought to permit this sort of thing to go on. The Minister&#39;s subordinates have only to submit recommendations to him in order to secure their confirmation. I have performed what I believe to be a duty cast upon me as one of the representatives of the people of Tasmania. I make the same claim as did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> this afternoon. I do not care what class of the community is concerned ; I am here  for the one purpose of seeing that justice is done. If it is not done I shall be up against the man who is responsible, whether he be the Minister of Defence or any other Minister. I do not wish to continue my remarks, because I do not suppose they will have any effect. </para>

                            <para>- For the present, yes. But it will be a lasting grievance till the injustice has been remedied. A somewhat covert attempt in that direction has already been made by the removal of Captain Payne from a position that he was not capable of filling to a subordinate position under a lieutenant in another part of the island. Knowing that I am unable to convince this Labour Minister, whose function we thought it was to see that fair play was meted out to every section of the Military Forces, and realizing how impossible it is for him to take any action which will not harmonize with the wishes of some of his twopenny-halfpenny subordinates, I propose to leave the question where it stands for the present. But whenever any instance of a similar character is brought under my notice, I shall feel it my duty to bring it before the Senate. Whether my action gives the Minister offence or pleasure will not trouble me in the least, so long as I have the consolation of knowing that I have discharged my duty. It is not pleasant - it is not a labour of love - to be obliged to come into conflict with one of my own Ministers; but if one sees injustice done, and makes no effort to remedy it, he is not worthy of a place either in this or any other Parliament. Having done my duty, I will now leave the question, and Wil return the official papers to the Minister and his subordinates, with my blessing. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will calmly look at the whole matter he will see that, putting the position at its very worst, it merely amounts to a difference of opinion between himself and myself. Ho thinks that, in taking certain action, I have done wrong.&#34; It is quite likely that he is right. But, strange to say, I think that I have done right. We differ. Why that circumstance should be a reason for a repetition on every conceivable occasion of suggestions that I am unworthy to be a Labour Minister, Heaven only knows. I cannot appreciate the mind of a man who, because of a difference of opinion on a matter of judgment, continually pursues a subject as he does. The honorable senator brought this question forward to-day without notifying me of his intention to do so, and he has raised another phase of it for which he thinks I am responsible. It appears that Captain Payne has now been transferred from the Claremont camp to some other district in Tasmania. Will he accept my assurance that this is the first time I have heard of it? </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will spend a day with me at the barracks - even now, when things are  somewhat slack - he will understand why. Some questions have taken even longer than that to answer, through no fault of mine. All I can say is that I am working to the limit of my personal capacity. That is my reply to the honorable senator. If I failed to answer his communication in less time than he thinks I ought to have occupied, let me assure him that it was owing to no wish to be discourteous to him or to anybody else. It was due to circumstances beyond my control. I regret that the honorable senator has taken up this attitude towards me merely because of a difference of opinion on a question of judgment. I feel that I have done right. The honorable senator thinks that I have done wrong. Surely we can agree to differ on that point. I can assure him that I have no personal feeling whatever against him. I feel that I. have done the right thing, but it is quite likely that I have done wrong. It would be wonderful, indeed, if a man did not frequently make mistakes in the rush of business. Whenever questions involving alleged mistakes are brought forward, I am quite prepared to look into them. But the honorable senator has taken up the attitude that I acted in the way that I did because of some motive. May I assure him that I do not know any one of the three officers concerned? I would not know them if I met them in the street to-morrow. To me they are officers of the Department - one of them a militia officer, and the other two permanent officers. I could not deal with their cases without having regard to the rights of permanent officers who aro senior to them. </para>

That is to say, a lieutenant passes the examination for captain, and very often years elapse before there is a vacancy or a chance for promotion. Again, majors, pass the examination for lieutenant-colonel, and years pass before there is a chance for them to get promotion. The mere passing of an examination does nob give to an officer a right. If the honorable senator will look into the matter again, he will find that these are not the only lieutenants on the permanent list who have passed the examination for the rank of captain. </para>

I regret the temper and the tone which he has brought into the discussion of this matter. I do not think it is worthy of him, and I trust that, with my assurance that there is no feeling on my part, he will represent the matter in the ordinary way, and that is endeavour to get a rectification of what he believes to be a genuine grievance. </para>
