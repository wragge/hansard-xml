                        <para>- In view of the fact that there are many young women getting instruction in first aid in the Commonwealth, has the Minister of Defence considered the advisableness of placing a number of them under the charge of one or more skilled nurses on the transports? They would probably be able to give the attention necessary in such circumstances, and a policy of that kind would have the effect of liberating a large number of able-bodied  men  who could go to the front? </para>

                        <para>- The question of utilizing partially-trained or untrained women in place of trained nurses has been considered, but the medical authorities have advised me that it would be unsound to employ them so long as a sufficient number of trained nurses is available. The question of supplying sufficient trained nurses is under consideration now, but up to the present we have experienced no difficulty in obtaining them. It is, however, possible that the demands of the Department may in future exceed the supply, and a conference of medical officers has recently been sitting to consider the question of increasing the number available. The honorable senator&#39;s suggestion, that women could be sent to take the place of men on transports, has not been considered, and I am prepared to put it forward for consideration; but at first sight it seems to me that the work which the men are called upon to do is not work that women could be &#39;asked to perform. However, I will put the suggestion before the medical authorities. </para>

                        <para>As the result of representations made by the men, it was decided to revert to the weekly payments, and an instruction to that effect was received at this office on 19th August (Thursday). Arrangements were at once made for the time-sheets to be furnished by the Electrical Engineer, and the pay-sheets were prepared. It was, however, impossible to pay the men before the 23rd idem (Monday), as they cease duty at 12 o&#39;clock on Saturday, and many of the gangs are working in remote localities. No increased cost was involved in this distribution, and there should be no delay in payments being made in future. </para>

                        <para>Lieut.-Colonel Ramsay Smith will not be entitled to demand a court martial or a court of inquiry. Officers of the Australian Imperial Force hold their appointments therein during the pleasure of the Government, and in time of war cannot demand a court martial or court of inquiry before removal therefrom. With regard to this particular case, an inquiry has already been held in Egypt by the Imperial authorities at the request of the Minister, and the decision to return this officer to Australia was arrived at on the recommendation of the Army Council as a result of the inquiry, the papers in connexion with which are not yet to hand. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a very small measure so far as its size is concerned, but I venture to say that in far-reaching importance it is not exceeded by any measure to which this Parliament has given consideration. I listened with great care to the Minister of Defence when he introduced the Bill on Friday last. I realize to the full that the honorable senator feels that it is necessary that the Government should be strengthened in the manner proposed. The object of the Bill is to strengthen the Executive in connexion with securing the public safety and defence of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, although this is not a lengthy measure, the words &#34;securing the public safety and defence of the Commonwealth &#34; appear several times in it. The most important provision of the measure is contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 2, which gives the Governor-General , in Council power - to confer on the Minister power, by warrant under his hand, to detain any person in military custody for such time as he thinks fit, if he is satisfied that such detention is desirable for securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, or against a supporter of the Government. I refer to this in order that honorable senators may see the possible universality of the application of this measure. In effect, it will take away from a person against whom this power is used any redress in the way of the assertion of his liberty. The liberty of the subject is one of the fundamental rights of every person in the community. In connexion with the Wallach case, to which the Minister of Defence referred, the appellant was enabled, temporarily at any rate, to assert his liberty by invoking the Court. In the invocation of the Court, honorable senators will remember that references were made to theHabeas <inline font-style="italic">Corpus</inline> Acts and to <inline font-style="italic">Magna</inline><inline font-style="italic">Charta.</inline> It cannot be too well understood that the Liberty of the British subject does not rest upon either a <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act or <inline font-style="italic">Magna Charta</inline> It goes back beyond any of those instruments. It is coeval with the law itself. <inline font-style="italic">Magna</inline><inline font-style="italic">Charta.</inline> and the various <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Acts that have been passed did not create or originate the right known as the liberty of the subject. They have only enunciated that right. <inline font-style="italic">Magna</inline><inline font-style="italic">Charta</inline> enunciated the right of the liberty of the subject, a right known to exist, and known to have been enforced, before <inline font-style="italic">Magna</inline><inline font-style="italic">Charta</inline><inline font-style="italic">-</inline> a right coeval, as I have said, with the law itself. Subsequently, <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Acts, the Act of 1623, the Act of 1640, the Act of 1679, and again the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act of 1816 have dealt only with the remedies to insure the enjoyment of that right. In effect, these Acts have only affected to determine the procedure of the Courts which have jurisdiction to issue a writ of <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus,</inline> and thus enforce the right of the liberty of the subject. These Acts are solely aimed at regulating the remedies for enforcing a right which is as old as is the law itself. Under these Acts persons who have been imprisoned have at various times succeeded in asserting their liberty, and the Courts have exercised powers under them in maintaining the liberty of the subject. To persons outside the realms of British justice, that power has appeared extraordinary, and as admirable as extraordinary. In thus maintaining the liberty of the subject, the Courts have the power to keep the Executive within the law. They have the power to restrain the Administration from all excess which may impair the liberty of the subject. They have the power to restrain the Executive from developing beyond the strict letter of any Statute the penalties against liberty which that Statute may impose. </para>

                            <para>- This Parliament possesses absolute power to enact the legislation that is embodied in this Bill. It can by this measure deprive any subject in the Commonwealth of his liberty. It possesses as great powers in that respect as does the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The result of the Wallach internment did not arise from any Federal constitutional defect or from any want of power residing in this Parliament. It arose just as it would have arisen in England - just as it would have arisen in the case of a person who was a British-born subject. The Courts have always asserted the power to go behind and review the causes alleged for the arbitrary imprisonment of any person. Even in cases where persons have been imprisoned under cover of naval or military authority, the Courts have asserted their power to investigate the reasons for such imprisonment, and if those reasons did not seem valid, to discharge them. In illustration of my contention, I may mention the celebrated case of Wolfe Tone. When he was detained it was alleged that he was detained on naval or military grounds connected with the defence of the country. But the Court exercised its authority to examine those grounds. In Wallach &#39;s case the Executive did not feel it expedient to put before the Court the grounds upon which he was interned. The defence urged by the Commonwealth was &#34; act of State.&#34; Now, the whole principle underlying the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Acts is that the Executive cannot rely upon an &#34; act of State &#34; to deprive a subject of his liberty. </para>

                    <para>These remedial measures known as the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas</inline><inline font-style="italic">Corpus Acts</inline> have been from time to time suspended. In effect, though not absolutely, if this Bill be passed there will be a partial suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act for certain persons and for certain purposes. I repeat that in the Old Country the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Acts have been suspended on more than one occasion. They were suspended from 1794 to 1801 - the period during which the celebrated Gordon Riots occurred. At that time there was a good deal of commotion in England. They were suspended again in 1817. Once more they were suspended in 1866, but only in respect of Ireland, and for the purpose of dealing with the Fenian rising there. In 1881 an extraordinary Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament, which also suspended <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> so far as Ireland was concerned, and invested the Irish Executive with extraordinary powers. That Act was renewed annually until 1906, when it was finally repealed. Honorable senators know that we are accustomed to refer to these Acts as Coercion Acts. Now, in connexion with the suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Acts, it has always been the practice to make their suspension an annual one. For example, their suspension was renewed year by year from 1794 to 1801. It has also been the practice, before the suspension finally ceased, tc&#187; indemnify Ministers and other persons who have acted under the authority given to them by the suspending Act. </para>
                    <para>I.u dealing with this question, I would like to draw the attention of honorable senators to some passages contained in <inline font-style="italic">The Law of the Constitution,</inline> by Dicey. At page 222 he thus summarizes the position of the Executive - </para>
                    <para>Suppose, for example, that a body of foreign anarchists come to England and are thought by the police on strong grounds of suspicion to be engaged in a plot, say, for blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Suppose, also, that the existence of the conspiracy does not admit of absolute proof. An English Minister, if he is not prepared to put the conspirators on their trial, has no means of arresting them or of expelling them from the country. In ease of arrest or imprisonment, they would at once be brought before the High Court on a writ of <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus,</inline> and unless some specific legal ground for their detention could be shown, they would be forthwith set at liberty. Of thu political, or, to use foreign expressions, of the &#34; administrative,&#34; reasons which might make the arrest or expulsion of a foreign refugee highly expedient, the Judges would hoar nothing; that he was arrested by order of the Secretary of State; that his imprisonment was a simple administrative act; that the Prime Minister or the Home Secretary was prepared to make affidavit that the arrest was demanded by the most urgent considerations of public safety, or to assure the Court that the whole matter was one of high policy, and concerned national interests, would be no answer whatever to the demand for freedom under a writ of <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus.</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">That is precisely so in the instance we have had recent experience of - </para>
                    <para>All that any Judge could inquire into would be whether there was any rule of common or of statute law - and statute law would properly apply, whether it was Federal or State - which would authorize interference with a foreigner&#39;s personal freedom. If none such could be found the applicants would assuredly obtain their liberty. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is precisely the kind of case we have. But, that being the position, Parliament is sovereign, and can pass a measure of an extraordinary nature. Later, <inline font-style="italic">Dicey</inline> says - </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Under the Act applying to Ireland, the mere statement that a person was a suspected person was conclusive proof that he was. Here, the authority is that if the Minister is satisfied; and it is for such a reason that an Indemnity Act always follows a suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">HabeasCorpus</inline> Act. But an Indemnity Act did not have to follow the Act applicable to Ireland, because the warrant was the beginning and the end of the whole transaction, and nobody could examine it or dispute its allegations. </para>

                        <para>An Act suspending the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act which has been continued for any length of time has constantly been followed by an Act of Indemnity. Thus the Act to which reference has already been made, 34 George III., c. 54, was continued in force by successive reenactments for seven years from 1794 to 1801. In the latter year an Act was passed, 41 George HI., c.66, &#34; indemnifying such persons as since the 1st day of February, 1793, have acted in the apprehending, imprisoning, or detaining in custody in Great Britain of persons suspected of high treason or treasonable practices.&#34; It cannot be disputed the so-called suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act, which every one knows will probably be followed by an Act of Indemnity, is in reality a far greater interference with personal freedom than would appear from the very limited effect, in a merely legal point of view, of suspending the right of persons accused of treason to demand a speedy trial. The Suspension Act, coupled with the prospect of an Indemnity Act, does in truth arm the Executive with arbitrary powers. </para>

But, in any case, even if persons acting under this measure were legally free from successful claim on the part of any person who deemed himself aggrieved, it might be desirable or politic to pass an Indemnity Bill to prevent any such actions from being &#34;entered,&#34; so to speak. </para>

                            <para>- It would prevent such actions being launched in any case. The invariable practice has been to pass an Indemnity Bill before the Act suspending <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus</inline> ceased to operate, the one exception being the Act of 1881, which was applicable to Ireland, and in that case it was not necessary, because of the very extraordinary provisions inserted in that Act, and to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>Realizing, as I do, what the Minister has said as to the necessities of the occasion, I think it is desirable that something in the nature of extraordinary powers should be given to the Minister. The question whether this measure takes us too far or not is, of course, another matter. It seems to me we are confronted with certain alternatives to this measure, and possibly the Bill is less innocuous in its offensiveness to the general sentiment than of them. The first alternative that appears to be suggested is to have a measure expressly dealing with persons who are aimed at in this amendment of the law. The persons aimed at are the enemies in our midst. In many instances they are persons of alien birth, but we must remember that there are persons in the community of alien birth, but who are probably not enemies at all. In many instances the persons, aimed at are those of alien birth, others are persons born in Australia but of alien extraction, while others are persons born in Australia and elsewhere but of alien association. It is very difficult in a measure of this kind to frame a phrase or expression which will comprehend all of these different persons. By making every person of alien enemy birth subject to this Act, we would be attacking the innocent as well as the guilty. </para>

                            <para>- No. There is a difficulty of discrimination. Suppose we inserted in the Bill a provision that persons of alien enemy birth would be subject to the measure, as I have shown, there are persons resident in Australia of enemy birth who are no more enemies in sentiment than anybody here. If we include all persons of alien enemy origin the same difficulty will confront us, for included amongst those persons will be found many as loyal to the Empire and as much interested in Australia&#39;s success as any of us. Then again, we might provide that the Bill should apply to those persons who are not of alien enemy extraction or birth, but who, perhaps, have been born here or in neutral countries, and are alien in their association. We want some power vested in the Administration to deal especially with these suspects, because they may do us more harm than those who are more readily recognised as not being in sympathy with us. That alternative, I think, is altogether out of the question. </para>

                    <para>Another alternative that suggests itself is that before a person is interned under this Bill, there should be some authority beyond that of the Minister; that is to say, there should be some judicial authority, perhaps a Justice of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, invested with judicial discretion in these matters. I do not know if this would be conducive to that celerity of action with which a measure of this kind should be administered, if the Minister, before being able to intern a suspected person, had to have recourse to any judicial tribunal or any judicial officer, however summary the procedure might be. </para>

Speed and  energy  are essential in the administration of this Bill if the Minister is to have power to deal effectively with suspects. If a suspected person were interned, and had anything in the nature of a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> reason to show why he should not be under arrest, he should have some means by which he could assert his right to be heard. I would not say that every person interned should be able to demand his liberation, but there should be some means, by regulation, perhaps, by which a person might be given an opportunity of having his case investigated. </para>

Realizing the extent to which the measure goes, &#93; would urge the Minister to act with the utmost discretion in exercising the powers given under it, and also to give consideration to the advisableness of adopting some means by which those interned may have not only a chance, but the right, to be heard, provided always that, in asserting it, they conform to certain conditions. I trust that honorable senators will realize the gravity of the measure, and give it corresponding consideration. </para>

                        <para>. - If, eighteen months ago, any member of this Chamber had been asked if he would ever vote to place in the hands of a Minister the right to arrest anybody in the community, and throw him into custody, and keep him there as long as he thought fit, without granting any trial, or right of trial, until, in the picturesque language suggested to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> he rotted there, not one of us would have entertained the suggestion for a moment&#39;. The idea is so repugnant to the notions of everybody who has had the privilege of living in a British community that it would have been at once scouted. We have now to consider whether the circumstances of the last few months would justify the Senate in going back upon all <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> previous beliefs, and the traditions which it holds so dear. We are asked to strike away the right by virtue of which each of us can live, and have hip being, and move about the streets free from the fear of anybody. We are asked; as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> pointed out, to repeal the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act by placing in the hands of the Minister the power to throw into military custody anybody whom he chooses to suspect - and the difference between military and other custody offers no comfort. The power is simply enormous, and it is idle to say that it will be used only when circumstances justify it. No doubt a similar argument was&#39; used when star chamber practices were first established. Before any Ministry can ask Parliament to confer such immense arbitrary and &#39;autocratic power on any-of its members, it should be able to come forward with the clearest possible proof that the power is necessary. I do not propose to go into the legal aspect of the case which has given rise to this amendment of the Act. I wish to deal rather with the larger view of the question. I regard the Bill as one of the most obnoxious proposals that we have ever been invited to consider. It is repugnant to all our feelings. The very thought of placing in the hands of any one man the  power  to low anybody else up, and deny him the right to go to some tribunal to prove whether he is  properly  in custody or not, is foreign to all the ideas that we have entertained since we arrived at a thinking age. </para>

The Minister has kindly placed in my hand a copy of the regulation under which he says the interned person has the opportunity of presenting his case to some tribunal. If that is so, my objection to the Bill disappears, because I recognise that the Minister must have power to arrest immediately any one he thinks is doing, or about to do, a public injury; but having seized him and secured the public safety I deny the necessity for keeping the man in custody for an indefinite period without an opportunity to prove his innocence. </para>

Whether it is necessary to pass Hie measure or not is one question, but it is quite another thing to shut our eyes to what it really means, and it undoubtedly gives the Minister power to throw into gaol any person he suspects and keep hun there as long as he likes. The Minister is given power to detain any person - not any alien person - in military custody &#34;for such time as he thinks fit,&#34; which may mean for eternity - </para>

In any case, the Minister having secured the public safety by incarcerating the person he suspects, some reasonable time and opportunity should be given to the suspect to prove his innocence. The regulation which the Minister says in some way safeguards the liberties and rights of individuals is as follows - </para>

                    <para>Whenever a person is arrested on the Minister&#39;s warrant, he should be supplied with a statement, in writing, of the evidence against him, and he should be informed that the Minister may, if he so requests, authorize an inquiry to be held under the Suspected Persons Inquiry Order l!)lo. The statement should follow as nearly as possible the language of the statutory declarations on which his internment has been recommended, but the names of the persons giving information should not be given, and, if  neccessary,  the language of the statement should, be varied, so as not to disclose who were the informants. </para>
                    <para class="block">But under this measure a statutory declaration will not be necessary, for all that is required is the Minister&#39;s declaration that he suspects the person. The rest of the regulation as it stands means .that the Minister, having found a suspect and locked him up, may then if he likes order an inquiry, but it all rests with the Minister. The person incarcerated will not be in a position to say, &#34; I am innocent and claim the right to go, before some tribunal to prove my innocence.&#34; That right is absolutely denied to him, and the Minister, his mind having perhaps been prejudiced by the information upon which he acted, may be disinclined to sanction an inquiry. He may say, &#34;I know he is guilty,&#34; and may honestly think he is guilty, but whether he does or not it does not get over the difficulty that we are taking away the right, which we have always regarded as an essential of justice, from a person to have an opportunity to prove his innocence. I should much prefer that provision should be made in the Bill, not leaving it optional with the Minister, that within a certain space of time the opportunity should be given to the incarcerated person to be heard before some tribunal other than the Minister. Unless that is done we shall leave with the Minister, who is the complainant or prosecutor, the right to say whether the suspect shall be heard or not. I am not certain what the &#34;Suspected Persons Inquiry Order 1915 &#34; is, but I cannot see that it offers much comfort to the suspected person. I observe that the authorities authorized under it to inquire are the Minister of Defence, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, the Acting Secretary of the Department of Defence, and the Chief of the General Staff of the Commonwealth Military Forces. </para>

Thus, four officials are indicated to hold the inquiry. One is the Minister, who will have been the chief instrument in causing the suspect to be incarcerated, and at least two of the others will have had the papers before them before they went to the Minister, and probably will be the very gentlemen upon whose advice the Minister acted, and therefore in the same boat as himself. Thus they will, already have had their minds influenced and have formed an opinion, otherwise they would not have caused the incarceration to take place. </para>

                            <para>- The regulation leaves the whole matter optional with the Minister. Great as my objection to the Bill is and must remain, it would have been very much minimised if the measure had contained some provision by which a suspect, having been incarcerated, could claim, being convinced of his own innocence, the right, never denied in a British community, to prove it before a properly constituted tribunal. That safeguard is absent from the Bill, and the responsibility must rest with the Minister, for, knowing the extent to which it asks us to go, I view it with the greatest repugnance. Whilst, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, the power sought may be necessary. I know of &#39; no reasonable excuse for not having safeguarded the exercise of the power by a provision for some such inquiry as I have suggested. I have one word to say with regard to a remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who seems to think that an Indemnity Act will be necessary. I hesitate to express an opinion against that of a lawyer, but, having listened to the honorable senator&#39;s remarks concerning the Irish Coercion Act, to which he referred as being practically on all-fours with this measure, I point out that, under the Irish Act, the declaration of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on a warrant had to be accepted as proof, and could not be called in question. The Lord Lieutenant having acted and signed a warrant, there was nothing more to be said. It is the same under this Bill, but the Minister has to make no declaration setting forth why he acted. He has only to be satisfied of a certain tiling. In his warrant he need only say, &#34; I am satisfied that in th&#171; interests of public safety this person should be arrested.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see the difference which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> suggests. I am quite sure the honorable senator views this measure with as much repugnance as I do. It violates the right&#39; for which all the historic fights in connexion with the British Empire have been waged - the maintenance of a Court as, the one shield to stand between the humblest individual and the arbitrary power of Government. While it may in present circumstances be necessary to remove that shield in the Commonwealth, I say that this measure might be rendered less obnoxious if, within its four corners, there was some provision giving a suspected person an opportunity, within a reasonable period, to appear before some properly constituted tribunal to demonstrate the innocence which he may possess, and which, in any case, he should have the right to have tested by a proper procedure according to law. </para>

                        <para>.  - Whilst it is true that I view this Bill with repugnance, as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I view with greater repugnance the necessity which has given rise to its introduction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that all action under this measure will rest practically in the discretion of the Minister of Defence, who, by it, is constituted a military autocrat, and is given the authority to delegate his autocratic powers to other individuals. I can speak for myself, but I feel sure that other honorable senators, also, in ordinary circumstances, would not dream of accepting any measure giving a Minister such powers. However, we are dealing with a time of war, and, no matter how great our reluctance to give the Minister the autocratic power to lock up a person without stating his reasons for his action, we are bound to recognise that there are dangers in Australia, and we must trust to the discretion and good sense of the Minister not to exercise this tremendous power unless he is absolutely satisfied of the necessity for enforcing it. It is not because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> happens to be in the position of Minister of Defence that I support this measure at this time. In the circumstances I should just as readily support it if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> occupied the position. We must not forget for a moment that behind the Minister stand the people of Australia, and if he does anything wrong under this measure he will have to answer to them for it. </para>

I am in this matter placed in the same position as are other honorable senators. We must say that we will not give these drastic and unusual powers to the Minister of Defence, or we must trust to the common sense and discretion of the Minister. I say that, no matter who the Minister of- Defence may be, while the war lasts, I shall feel myself justified in giving him and the Government of which he is a member powers that I would not dream of giving them in times of peace. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say one or two words in reply to the debate. First of all, I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for his very clear exposition of the difficulties with which any Government must be confronted by the necessity nf dealing with this question, and also for pointing out to- those disposed to cavil at the provisions of this measure the alternative with which they are faced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu&#39;s</inline> criticism amounts to this : He objects to the measure because he says that it is different from our ordinary legal procedure. Admittedly it is, but the conditions under which we are legislating in this way are entirely different from ordinary conditions. </para>

                            <para>- All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> proposes is that the Minister should be given power to arrest a man, and try him afterwards. The police have that power in times of peace. The honorable senator proposes to put the Minister in dealing with war conditions in the same position as he would be in times of peace. If honorable senators shut their eyes to the fact that the war exists, and that the agents of our enemies are in existence, and have been demonstrated to be active in Australia, and prepared to use methods detrimental to the safety of the country, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> argument is good, and must enlist the sympathy of all. Bub we cannot shut our eyes to these facts. They exist, and stare us in the face. Their importance is emphasized by the fact that we are fighting two countries, one of which has organized its spy system and secret service system better, and with more determination and persistence, than any other nation on earth has ever done. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would propose that, in dealing with war conditions, we should adopt the ordinary civil procedure of times of peace. </para>

Is not that a lovely proposition? With what joy it would be welcomed by the German Secret Service if it were adopted in France, England, or Russia? One can understand how the chief of the Secret Service in Germany, upon learning that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> proposal had been adopted by England, would rub his hands with glee, and exclaim, &#34; These English are bigger fools than I thought them to be, and I thought that they were very big fools indeed.&#34; </para>

Their friends may see them, their solicitors mav visit them, and in such circumstances, if injustice be done, is it conceivable that this Parliament will not promptly intervene? So far, the criticism directed against the Minister has been that he has not used his powers widely enough. There has been no complaint that I have not used them wisely. There has been strong criticism because there has not been a wholesale internment of persons of alien origin. That criticism is being continually voiced by the Liberal daily press throughout Australia. I ask honorable senators to believe that no Minister who is imbued with any sense of justice will accept the mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of an officer. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> impugns the honesty of the officers who have been acting in these matters, I wish to tell him that the great majority of them are men who, prior to the outbreak of war, occupied civil positions in Australia, and who have since been called up for duty.

                            <para>- The honorable senator must recollect that our Intelligence Department consists of ordinary citizens of Australia - decent, respectable men who, at the inception of the war, offered their services to the Commonwealth, and were called up for duty. They are discharging their duties, I believe, with a desire to assist their country, and not with a wish to injure anybody. Till I see something which will warrant me in taking a different view, I shall continue &#39;to hold that the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was entirely uncalled for. These officers must be credited with honesty of purpose, and not with vindictiveness. If they should entertain suspicion concerning an individual, they are charged with the duty of ascertaining whether there is any substance upon which to base that suspicion. They must then bring the matter before the Minister. They must convince him that there is sufficient substance underlying their suspicion to justify him in depriving the suspect of his liberty. Up to the present no natural-born British subject has been deprived of his liberty. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot think of any case in which a natural-born British subject has been deprived of his liberty by way of internment. But the Minister, when called upon to deal with a situation like that, would not only be very foolish, but would act very wrongly indeed, if, before taking such a drastic step, he did not have very strong justification for so doing. Equally, when dealing with naturalized aliens, he must satisfy himself that he has good grounds for taking action. If a naturalized alien may be deprived of his liberty where there is good ground for suspicion, it is even more necessary that, in similar circumstances, a British-born subject may be deprived of his liberty, because he is far more dangerous to the community. If he be a traitor, the British-born subject, by virtue of his birth, is much more dangerous to the Commonwealth than would be a person of foreign birth. I am aware that this is a very big power to place in the hands of any man - certainly, it is too large a power to put into the hands of any individual, except in time of war, for the purpose of safeguarding the Commonwealth. In my opinion, although these specific words do not appear in the principal Act, that Act and the regulations thereunder may be construed in such a way as to give the- Minister power to deal with other than unnaturalized aliens. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. The regulations were framed in that belief. I feel sure that Parliament thought that we had that power. In this connexion I would refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to the regulation that has &#34;been drawn up in connexion with the Alien Instructions Regulations, and which vests in the Minister power to grant to any person an inquiry after he has been interned. That is a power which the Minister, in certain cases, might exercise. But it is a power which ought to be used at his discretion, and an interned person ought not to have a right to an inquiry. For instance, there might be a case in which the Minister could grant such an inquiry without in any way assisting the enemy. On the other hand, there might be a case in which the granting of an inquiry would unquestionably assist the enemy. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. I admit that, to me, this is the most distasteful part of Defence administration. If I could see any chance of granting an inquiry without doing real harm to the Commonwealth, I would certainly welcome it. What would such an inquiry mean ? It would relieve the Minister of all responsibility - it would dissipate the feeling that he is personally responsible for having deprived a man of his liberty. If that remark applies to a person who is a naturalized subject, how much more does it apply to a natural British-born subject? It is wise, therefore, that the power should be a discretionary one. I said just now that, so far as I knew, there had been no case in which a British-born subject had been deprived of his liberty. I find that my statement was not quite correct. There has been one case in which a British-born subject, of German parentage, has been deprived of his liberty. </para>

                            <para>- I can give the Senate my assurance that in the future, as in the past, a case will have to be clear and overwhelming before a British-born subject will be deprived of his liberty. The Bill will be applied with justice and, at the same time, with firmness in the case of naturalized aliens. But I ask honorable senators to recognise that we are dealing with a very delicate question - that we are dealing with it in a very difficult time -and that if this measure be placed on the statute-book it does not appear likely that we shall have occasion to use it more widely than we have already used the principal Act. But we never know how the tide of war may swing. We do not know that the time may not arrive when it will be necessary to use the powers conferred by the principal Act and by this Bill to a much wider extent. But Parliament has control of the Government, and the Government is susceptible to public opinion, so that every safeguard exists against the infliction of injustice on any individual. </para>

                        <para>. - Unfortunately, I was unavoidably absent from the chamber during the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill. But I entered in time to hear most of the remarks of the Minister, and also had the pleasure of listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for a while. I regretfully have come to the conclusion that there can hardly be a half-way house in this matter. I am dealing particularly with paragraph 6 of clause 2, which gives the sough t-for power to the Minister, and which, I take it, is the pith of the measure. I had thought of asking the Minister if it was possible to discriminate in any way between natural-born British subjects and those residents of the Commonwealth who are of alien extraction; but I can see a difficulty in the way, and although the issue is not one of domestic disturbance, it has been brought to the front because of our conflict with foreign Powers. It may be, as the Minister says, necessary to apply the provisions of this measure, unfortunately necessary, to British-born subjects. It is exceedingly gratifying to find that, so far, it has not been found necessary to apply the power which the Minister thought that he possessed in the principal Act to any British-born subject, with the single exception of the one individual to whom the Minister has referred, and who has turned out to be of German parentage. I suppose that there is no honorable senator who is not acting very reluctantly, and properly so, in connexion with the sought-for power. It is an instance of how humanity treads in a circle after all, for this thorough-paced Democracy . of ours, elected on the widest possible franchise, has found it necessary to revive that much-declaimed-against  privilege of casting into the Bastille once exercised by the entrenched and privileged classes of Europe in ancient times. There may be only one thing said in defence of the exercise of this power, namely, that it is to be used in the interests of national safety. We for a time suspend the privileges attached to a state of liberty in order to insure the continuance of liberty itself. I suppose we may say that it is necessary at times to drape the statue of liberty to prevent it from being profaned. It may oven be necessary to take it down from its pedestal, and put it in a national citadel, as we do in the provisions of this measure. This legislation can be a worthy instrument in regard to national defence if exercised with wise discretion by the Minister. The <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act is, in effect, to be suspended, for it can be suspended at the will of the Minister.  If  he can arrest the course of justice, or in effect suspend the application of justice in regard to any unit of the community, then the Act must be conceded to be of complete and general application. There is a difference between a suspension of the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act as we, in effect, suspend it, and its suspension in ancient times by despotic  monarchs,  and it is that the power is now being exercised by a Democracy in the interests of a Democracy. Anciently a power such as this was  exercised  by a privileged and despotic monarch on behalf of privilege and despotism. It is now to be exercised in t-f interests of the national safety, and a moral can be drawn which would be of service to people who, in the next few months, probably in the next few years, will ask that the conditions we set up in time of war may be perpetuated in time of peace, and that met-fds of government which are absolutely essential to the national safety in time of war ought to be applied to the general course and conduct of the community in time of peace. When we take into consideration the fact that it is with the greatest reluctance that we permit this process to be availed of in time &#187; of war, we can with benefit to ourselves draw the moral that we want to be particularly careful when we argue in favour of the application of warlike measures to the industrial and ordinary processes of the community in time of peace. I have reluctance in supporting the principle, but nevertheless I must concede&#34; that I did think that the original measure conferred on the Minister the power which he had occasion to exercise. If an occasion did arise a few weeks ago for the exercise of the power, and if the Minister - in whom the people and the Parliament still repose their confidence, because we are all at one in connexion with the prosecution of this war - thinks that the exercise of the power is necessary in the interests of the welfare of the nation, I fail to see how any member of the Legislature who consented to the passing of the original measure can refrain from giving his assent to the passage of this clause, which is the pith of the present Bill, and which will confer beyond all reasonable or judicial doubt the power which the Minister seeks to exercise. I do not suppose that there is any honorable senator who is glad that we have to pass such a measure. I give my assent to it with very great reluctance. As a lover of democracy and liberty, I regret the occasion for the passing of the measure, and I am pleased that it is not an occasion for domestic violence which constrains us to pass it, but that it is imposed upon us by the necessities of the world conflict in which we are engaged, and which we are waging for the benefit of those principles of liberty the temporary suspension of which will assist us in upholding. I had thought that perhaps a middle course could be devised, but I do not think that any satisfactory middle way can be found. The discretion of the Minister must be trusted. He is elected by a Democracy; he is selected by the best democratic principles and according to the latest democratic method. It is incumbent upon him - and I have no doubt that he realizes his responsibility - to wield his power with discretion, and sparingly, and to avail himself of t-f ordinary processes of the Courts unless those processes are to his mind not sufficient, because of the peril in which the nation may find itself, because of the wandering at large of certain people who are inimical to our imperial supremacy, and inimical to the predominance of the principles of liberty. I do hope that if it is found necessary by the Minister to intern persons, and if he feels that the position is so delicate that he cannot come forward and give reasons before a Court of justice for their internment, he will recognise that there is a considerable difference between the &#39; position of those persons and that of those who can be duly charged and convicted of offences against the nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said that it will probably be found necessary to ultimately pass a Bill to indemnify the Minister because of any action he may take under the -measure. I hope that he will add to his reputation by a discreet use of this power, and that those people whom it may be found necessary to intern in the interests of the nation will be treated with that magnanimity, correctness and general tolerance which surely must be exhibited in cases when we feel that we are not competent to avail ourselves of the ordinary processes of the law to justify their imprisonment or internment. Reluctantly, and only because I believe that we cannot qualify this power; because I believe that the exercise of it may be absolutely essential in the interests of the nation; because it is asked for by a Minister in a democratic Parliament, do I give the measure my support. </para>

                        <para>. - This amendment has only been circulated since the Senate assembled to-day. It seems to me that its object is to provide that all regulations now in existence under the War Precautions Act shall be deemed as from their date. - that is, the date when they were promulgated - to be of equal validity as if they had been enacted in. the principal Act; in other words, that they shall have exactly the same force as if they had been in the Act itself from their own date. The amendment is, I think, also retrospective in its effect and operation, and, that being so, what will be its effect on the regulation which the Supreme Court of Victoria held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the principal Act? Will it not have the effect of validating that regulation as from its date ? If the measure is passed this week, and the matter comes before the High Court next week, what will be the position of the High Court in that regard ? It seems to me that the effect of the amendment will be to validate a regulation which the Supreme Court of Victoria has decided was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the original Act, and against which decision an appeal is pending in the High Court. </para>

I think the Minister on Friday last, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> said this Bill would not affect, and was not designed to affect, the decision of the High Court in any way. I indorse that view with regard to the Bill as it then stood; but the position is different if this amendment De inserted. </para>

If that be the case, and the proceedings now pending in the High Court come to the stage of argument, the answer will be that it is no good arguing this matter at all, because it will be of purely academic interest, as Parliament subsequently validated the regulations that were in question. This Bill will thus have the effect of converting the Wallach appeal from a living issue to one of purely academic interest. The main effect that we are seeking to achieve by this Bill will be attained all the same by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 2, because if the High Court uphold the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria, the Minister will still have power to deal with the case. We ought to hesitate, I think, before we proceed to validate, as from the date of the making thereof, a regulation which one Court has already declared to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and which is now before the High Court on appeal. </para>

                        <para>. - The point raised by the honorable senator is of particular&#34; interest; but I would point out that the Supreme Court of Victoria liberated Wallach on two grounds: (1) that, the regulation was bacl, and (2) that the Minister was required to show reasons. The High Court may disagree with the decision of the Supreme Court on both grounds, or it may agree with one or both of them. Bui; Wallach was not released by the Supreme Court merely on the ground that, the regulation was bad. Even if the regulation were good, the Supreme Court, would still have ordered his release. That is clear from the judgment. There are two points to be considered. The regulations made under the principal Act have been challenged, and are still open to challenge. Suppose that after Parliament has adjourned another regulation is challenged, and the Supreme Court, or even the High Court, held that the regulation was bad, very serious consequences would follow, because a large number of naturalized alien persons might be given their liberty when it was extremely desirable that they should not be released. </para>

                            <para>- I would hesitate to give an opinion on that point. We are giving these regulations statutory form by this Bill, and if, subsequently, any are challenged in any Court, the Court will hold that they are good because they will have been validated by this amending legislation. I would point out, in answer to SenatorKeating&#39;s objection, that we should not seek to validate a regulation that has been challenged, that this amendment does not apply only to one but to all of the regulations under the principal Act, and it does not do away with the second point upon which Wallach was released, namely, that the Minister gave no reasons for his internment. Therefore one point, at any rate, of the judgment of the Supreme Court will be unaffected if this amendment is carried. There is the further point that this Bill may not be assented to before judgment is given in the appeal before the High Court, and I would suggest to the Committee that I bring this point under the notice of the Attorney-General. </para>

I want to remind the Committee that another regulation dealing with recruiting has been challenged in. one of the minor Courts. It will be seen, therefore, that if Parliament has adjourned, and if any one of these regulations are successfully challenged, it is possible that persons who have been interned may slip out. The other regulation I referred to was that dealing with persons making use of statements calculated to discourage recruiting. In that case the magistrate held that it was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline></para>

                        <para>. -I realize that individual interest must be subordinate to the public interest in this matter, and I would suggest that some provision be inserted in the Bill limiting the last clause so that it will have no application to any rights at present being litigated. There is a common form of provision to be found in many of our Statutes, which directly obviates the possibility of the Statute applying to cases then pending in the Courts. It is a familiar form, and I think if it were inserted here the Minister&#39;s end would be achieved, because regulations that have been challenged would not be affected. Those cases would be determined apart altogether from this general provision. This provision might be inserted at the report stage, or, at any rate, before the Bill finally passes through Parliament. </para>

It is only right that at this stage I should make a statement to Parliament regarding the training of the Expeditionary Forces being sent to the front. &#34;Dp to 14th August, 124,094 persons had been enlisted, and were in course of training for the front. They were raised in military districts, as follows: - First Military District (Queensland), 14,618;- Second (New South Wales), 37,069; Third (Victoria), 46,504; Fourth (South Australia), 11,492; Fifth (Western Australia), 9,953; Sixth (Tasmania), 4,458. </para>

                        <para>- Not from the States. If twelve months ago anybody had said that Australia would by to-day have had 124,000 men in training, he would have been laughed at, although there are people who tell us that we can do a great deal more even than we have done. Australia had not provided for this war in the way of laying by equipment for its troops, and practically the whole equipment, with the exception of field artillery and some portion of the rifles, has had to be created in the Commonwealth. Owing to the fact that we have not the power to send our organized Military Forces out of the Commonwealth - and I am not saying that we should have it - the organization represented in these troops has had to be created, in addition to the organization for carrying on the ordinary military training. Practically, therefore, this army as a whole has had to be created. For a country that was providing annually for from 20,000 to 30,000 troops, to provide in one year, in addition, for 124,000 troops on a war footing is no mean performance, especially with our conditions and resources, but we have, as always, the critic amongst us. It is said that critics and fools are ready-made. I believe it. Criticism of any system is easy, but what a glorious field for the critic this undertaking offers! This is a matter of war and operations oversea on a big scale, in which we are practically trying our prentice hand. What a splendid opportunity for the critic to come forward afterwards and tell us what ought to have been done, and how much better he .could have done it ! On the kerbstone of many of the streets of Melbourne we can find scores of people who consider themselves better Generals than either Kitchener or Joffre, and who, taking them at their own valuation, could settle the war in about three months. I come now to some of the criticisms of the camps and the conditions in them. These are not the first camps we have had. We have had a long experience of them. Tha Leader of the Opposition had camps during his term of office, and when the war broke out during his administration of the Defence Department, the men for the Expeditionary Forces were put into camps, which were exactly the same as we used to have under the citizen training system. The camps of to-day have ten times the equipment and consideration that the ordinary citizen camp had. Where was the critic when the citizen soldiers&#39; camps were being held, and where was he when my honorable friend put the first division into camp? He was silent. Why did he not wake up then, and tell my honorable friend what he ought to do ? Why did he not point out that the camps would probably be here for Rome time, and that, therefore, the men must be given additional blankets and other comforts? All the wiseacres who know so much now were silent then, but ready-made critics are to be found everywhere to-day, in Parliament and out of it. They can tell us everything that ought to be done, and how much better they could do it than anybody else, but is it not strange that when the campaign was beginning they could not be found ? Some of the criticism that has been put forward I regard as honest, sincere, and prompted by a desire to do the right thing for our soldiers and the country, but other of it is prompted by a desire&#39; to score party political points against the Government that happens to be administering the Department to-day. </para>

                <para class="block">Whenever any point has been put forward in the way of honest, sincere criticism, directed to seeing that our soldiers get the best possible training under decent conditions, the Government have always been found ready to act upon it, and willing to give effect to it. But to show that what I have said about the other kind of criticism is true, it will be found that some criticism and charges emanating from the same people are mutually destructive. For instance, we are charged with a tremendous waste of food from the camps. Let us see where that so-called waste emanates from. First of all, we lay down a dietary  scale  - so much bread, so much meat, and so much of everything else per day per soldier. We have so many thousand soldiers in camp; and the food to supply them is ordered on that dietary scale. We know, from our own experience, that a man does not eat the same amount of food every day. The dietary scale is based, as it must be, upon the maximum that a healthy man would eat during a day,, otherwise the healthy hungry man would have to go short. Obviously, each day there will be a percentage of the men in a camp who will not eat the maximum on that particular day. There will, in such a case, be more bread supplied than will be eaten. Suppose we have 200 or 300 loaves of bread left over from a particular day, and we carry that surplus over to the next day, and issue it to the soldiers, the self-same critic will bob up in Parliament or elsewhere and declaim about giving stale bread to the troops. </para>

In the sense that, as it cannot be issued to the troops, and must be sold as waste bread, there is waste; but in the sense, attempted to be conveyed by critics, that the surplus bread is destroyed, there is no waste, because every article of refuse from the camp is sold, after offers have been invited for the purchase of all the offal and waste of the camp, and the money is paid into the Consolidated Revenue. Yet the critic who makes a charge one day of waste will come up a few days later and declaim about the bad feeding of the troops, the shortage of supplies, stew for breakfast, stew for dinner, and bread and jam for tea, and will depict as awful the state of affairs that is the lot of the men in camp. </para>

                        <para>- I have visited, many of the camps, and have met many thousands of the soldiers, but I have not. heard the soldiers themselves complain. I have heard more complaints from people outside the camps than I have heard from those in the camps. I have visited some of the camps, not as Minister of Defence, but as an ordinary citizen, and have asked questions of men who had not the slightest idea who I was, or why I was there. I have visited camps in districts where I am unknown, and I have heard some complaints made by soldiers; but they are not voiced by the majority of the men in the camps. A visit to any military camp will convince honorable senators of that. What becomes of the testimony of scores of men who came from comfortable homes in Australia, who have been to the front, gone through the rigours of the campaign, and returned wounded to Australia ? We saw in yesterday&#39;s newspapers more than one letter from such men, saying that they had had a good time, and had been treated well throughout. What about these men? Are they liars ? </para>

                        <para>- I have seen that statement made, also. Are the men who give this testimony liars ? They have had only the same diet as other men, the same camps to sleep in, and have been subjected to the same discipline. There are honorable senators here who have had a little experience of life, and have had to mix with their fellow-men, and they know that there are grumblers in every walk of life. I shall not be disclosing any secrets which should be preserved when I say that I have heard men grumble in our parliamentary refreshment room at the food supplied there, and I very much doubt whether they would get a better meal in their own homes. I have heard men grumble when travelling by the magnificent steamers that trade between Western Australia and Victoria. They have been on their annual holiday, and during the rest of their lives have to be satisfied with very moderate circumstances, but I have heard them grumbling and quarrelling about the food, the sleeping accommodation, and everything on board the ships, although they are practically floating palaces. But, coming back to the soldier in this war, let me inform honorable senators that one of my colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> has letters in his possession, which I have seen, from two men in the same company, who went to Egypt in the same ship\ One, of them said that the place was a hell, the food was rotten, She officers were &#34; something &#34; cows, and so on through the whole gamut, and he only wished he was back again in Australia. The other man said that he never had such a time in his life, and &#34;that it was as good as an excursion trip, that he had gained a stone in weight since he went into camp, and that it was the finest game he ever took up. These very different pictures are painted, as I have said, by two men of the same company. What is the explanation ? Each may believe that he is telling the truth, but the fact is that we have to consider the temperament of a man and his point of view. We can go into a training camp anywhere, and, no matter how good the food supplied is, we will find some men grumbling about it. If we go into the dining-room of an hotel anywhere we shall find men who find -fault. We can go into our own refreshment room, and discover men who will find fault with the food supplied there. Surely it is only reasonable to expect that in a camp of from 8,000 to 10,000 men we shall find a percentage of grumblers. There are grumblers in every walk of life, men who grumble about their food, their sleeping accommodation, their work, and are we to say that we should not find such men in military camps? Of course, we shall find them there. The soldiers are human, like the rest of the society from which they are drawn, and so we find grumblers amongst them. I am not saying that the administration of all the camps has been right. I do not claim that, but I do say that when our critics are prepared to take up the tale of every grumbler, publish it in the front page of a newspaper, voice it in Parliament, and give it tongue wherever they can, and, at the same time, shut their ears to the fact that there are many thousands of the men who are not grumbling, and who are satisfied with the conditions, they show a desire to injure the Administration rather than to benefit the men living under camp conditions. We have to bear in mind that the great bulk of Australians live under very comfortable conditions. We are very glad that it is so. We must remember at the same time that war is carried on under very uncomfortable conditions, owing to difficulties of transport and the fact that we cannot keep a very big supply of food and clothing. These things have to be cut down to the minimum. Nothing must be carried but what is absolutely indispensable, and because of these conditions men have to live and be trained under what to citizens living in the ordinary way may seem to be uncomfortable conditions. We have to remember further that these men are taken in the heyday of youth, and what to old age or middle age is a hardship, to youth in full physical vigour is merely an incident of life. There are many honorable senators who have done some little pioneering in their lifetime. I am one, and I have gone through experiences in my goldfields days which to the ordinary city dweller hearing of them would seem to constitute very great hardship to me or to any other man. Did I feel them? I enjoyed them. I look back upon that period now as the summer time of my life, the best time I ever had. Yet the food I lived on was damper and tinned &#34; dog,&#34; the roof I slept under was the blue sky of heaven, with my blanket and my tent over me. It was not hardship; it was a picnic to me and to the other young fellows who were with me. It is not difficult to paint an awful picture in describing conditions of life to persons who are not familiar with them. I have read harrowing letters in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Morning Herald,</inline> written by soldiers for the edification of their friends in Australia, to show the terrible hardships they are undergoing in the awful desert of Egypt. Many of us who have read those letters have laughed at them, and at the idea of there  being any hardships associated with the life described. So it is possible to paint what may perhaps be a not untruthful picture of the conditions of life in a military camp which may seem awful to those who do not understand what the conditions really are. The hard fact remains that these men know that they are being trained for the grimmest game on earth, a game which calls for the highest standard of physical endurance, and to deal with them in such a way as to soften them would be the greatest unkindness we could show them. The camp and field of training must have some relation to the battlefield. We must give the men some training not merely in drill, but in the way in which they will have to march, eat, and sleep when they enter upon the battlefield. My idea may be a mistaken one, but I believe that while we should not have in our military camps in Australia the conditions of the battlefield, they should represent a half-way house between the average citizen&#39;s life and the experiences of the battlefield. We should endeavour in our camps to gradually break in the recruit to the conditions of the life he will have to live as a soldier when he is on active service. </para>

We should feed, house, and clothe them well, but I do say that in our Australian military camps we should begin to accustom the men to the life they will have tq Jive when they are called upon for active service. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty in the way of doing that arises from the fact that we must have a base from which to supply our armies actually in the field. Fortunately, perhaps, I should say, Australia is too far away to be our base for operations in Gallipoli. The base for supplies for the front must be much nearer than is Australia to the actual scene of operations. But if a more suitable site is available we are hopeful that it will be found. We have already made representations to the Army Council that, in our opinion, Egypt is not the most suitable place for a base. Recognising as I do that we may have a military camp in existence for fourteen days - the ordinary citizen soldier&#39;s camp - under one set of conditions, and that those conditions may be absolutely unsuitable for a continuous military camp authority was long ago given in all the military districts to convert our camps into semi-permanent institutions. That is to say, huts have been substituted for tents, and the other conveniences connected with our camps have been ordered to be made of a more permanent character than they would be in the case of ordinary military camps. I have already dealt with the question of food. I ask honorable senators to recollect that the Australian eats more food per day - certainly more meat - than does any other person on earth, and that altogether there have been in training within the past twelve months 124,000 men. When they recall these circumstances they will realize that the fact that there has been so little grumbling about the food supplied is a pretty sure indication that we have struck the happy medium between sparsity and waste, and that is what we should aim at. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say offhand. If the honorable senator will turn up the financial statement of the Prime Minister he will find the figures there. I come now to the question of housing. Obviously in a country like Australia, where we had a military force of only 25,000 men, the number of tents in our possession was extremely limited. Further, the quantity of material out of which those tents were made was only proportionate to the annual consumption of it. Consequently, when, within six months of the outbreak of the war, we were called upon to put more than double the number of men in camp that had been gathered in our citizen camps, well ad to provide tents out of all proportion to the demands formerly made upon  it. Within twelve months 124,000 men - a force six times as numerous as that contained in the whole of our Citizen Forces only a few years ago - had to be provided with tents and other accommodation. In the matter of clothing, we know that Australia is young as a manufacturing country, and that her woollen manufactures are practically in their infancy. Suddenly the tremendous task of providing the woollen cloth, the cord, and the other material required for 124,000 soldiers was thrown upon our factories. The woollen mills worked night and day. Our factories have not been always able to keep up with the demand for uniforms and all the1 other articles of equipment, such as buckets, ropes, pocket-knives, razors, brushes of all kinds, and the other paraphernalia that goes to make an army complete. Let honorable senators realize what that means, in addition to fulfilling the demands of the civil population for their ordinary supplies. At times, I admit, there has been a little delay. A contractor has not been able to supply all the breeches or the overcoats that he undertook to supply. Here and there these garments have not been issued to some of the soldiers. The critic has at once arisen and has exclaimed, &#34;Look at that. There is a condemnation.&#34; Eighty thousand men have been supplied with overcoats, but no credit is given to the Department for that. Any fool could have done it! Two hundred men are without overcoats, and, consequently, the efforts of the Department are characterized as a failure. That is exactly the position. But I ask, &#34; Is that a just verdict, when all the circumstances of the case are taken into consideration?&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I have nothing whatever <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich.  His  report is based upon evidence. But I say that wherever there are 8,000 men gathered together I will undertake to get 200 grumblers, who will come along and say, &#34; The food is rotten,&#34; and who will find fault with everything that is done in the camp. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich had to do was to decide on the evidence which was submitted to him. In other words, he decided on the testimony of men who had cause for complaint, who were without overcoats, and to whom only two, instead of three, blankets, had been issued. I ask our critics to say how they would have met the situation. We did all that we could. We utilized the maximum output of our mills, and when we found their maximum insufficient, we imported. We placed contracts everywhere - contracts based on the known demand. We were enlisting at the rate of 2,000 or 3,000 a month, and then suddenly in one State 20,000 enlisted within two months. At once the critic exclaimed, &#34; Why were von not prepared for that rush ? Any fool could have seen it coming.&#34; But when a similar recruiting campaign was initiated in New South Wales it did not result in the addition of 20,000 men to the ranks. Why could not any fool have told the people of that State that it was useless to institute such a campaign, because they would not be able to secure 20,000 recruits as they had done in Victoria? It is so easy to be wise after the event. Let me deal now with the question of the sick. Already we have gone through one winter and through the summer which preceded it. What is our record of sickness ? I venture to say that it is a record which will bear comparison with that of any army in camp in any part of the world. Here is a feature about which the critic has never said a word. We have had 124,000 men in our military camps. How many cases of typhoid and enteric have there been ? I have not heard of one. Does the critic give us any  credit for that? Oh, no! Does he say &#34; Well done&#34; ? No. He makes no mention of the fact. But suddenly cerebro-meningitis breaks out amongst the civil population. It has been in the State for years, but by inference, because it spreads from the civil population to our military camps, the military authorities are responsible for it, and we are asked, &#34; What are they going to do about it?&#34; We are told that it is a reflection on their medical arrangements, and so on. Because inoculation was made compulsory and general, and because the sanitary conditions of our camps are so good that typhoid and enteric - those scourges of all camps where men gather together, whether they be railway camps or shearers&#39; camps - have been banished from them, are we given any credit? Certainly not. Our critics say : Do not talk about typhoid. What about cerebro-meningitis ? What about pneumonia? Although the medical men of Victoria will admit that there never was a winter like the present in which so many cases of pneumonia supervened on influenza, by some stroke of legerdemain the military authorities ought to have been able to prevent <inline font-style="italic">-it</inline> developing amongst our soldiers. I have heard many criticisms of the Defence Department in regard to cerebromeningitis, but never a word, by way of criticism, of the Health Department of Victoria, which it primarily concerns. The disease has been in existence here for years. On the present occasion it originated amongst the civil population. Yet it is the Military Department which is called to the bar of public opinion. Of course, everybody is determined that on this question of the war we shall present a united front to the enemy. Everybody is agreed that, by every means in their power, the Administration shall be supported. Everybody says that there must be no division of opinion, and our critics evidence their earnestness in this connexion by pin-pricking the Defence administration on every conceivable occasion. They neglect no opportunity of giving their criticism the first place in Parliament, and the front page in the newspapers. That is the way in which they show their determination to make a success of the war. Our doctors have had to face this outbreak of cerebro-meningitis amongst our military camps, and they tell us that those camps are a congenial soil for such a disease, because it is a disease that flourishes on overcrowding. Now a military camp is always overcrowded from a civilian stand-point. In civil life one would not dream of allowing a similar number of men to sleep in the same confined area as are crowded together in a military camp. The medical authorities tell us that if we are to grapple with this disease we must spread our camps, we must distribute our men. But as soon as we do that, the critic arises, and says, &#34; Oh. another camp is to be established in the back-blocks of Victoria. How is it that Victoria can get these camps, but New South Wales cannot? Is this a case of State favoritism again? Why is it that Victoria is treated so generously in the way of country camps, and that such camps are not to bo distributed about New South Wales and Queensland?&#34; It is no defence to say that it is being done on medical ad vine, in order to deal with cerebro-meningitis Our critics retort, The kind of  gitis  which you have been afflicted with is  Melbourne-gitis,  and you are doing this in the interests of Victoria, with some condign influences at work, and to the detriment of New South Wales and other States.&#34; So the critics go on. </para>

                        <para>- He looks very flourishing. We hear horrible stories of cruelty - I use that word advisedly - of neglect, of shameful administration by the medical authorities in dealing with the sick. Who are the doctors who deal with the sick, in any State you like? Take the State of Victoria. Go down to the military hospitals, and read a list of the names of the men who are dealing with the sick, and it will be found that they are men who, for the last <inline font-style="italic">tan</inline> years or more, have dealt with the sick in the principal Melbourne hospitals. In those times there was never a word of criticism; the doctors were perfectly competent, according to public opinion. But during this year, under the blight of a Labour Defence administration, they have suddenly developed a hopeless incompetence, a spirit of cruelty in dealing with patients, a callousness for the relatives, which is most astonishing, and can only be accounted for by the fact that they are working under a Labour Minister. So long as those doctors  were  under a Tory State Minister administering the hospitals they were perfectly competent, and there was nothing to complain about. The men about whom no word of criticism was used, and against whom no finger was pointed when they were under a Tory State Minister, come under a Labour Minister in a military hospital, and suddenly they become callous, indifferent, cruel, hopelessly and helplessly inefficient. Yet we are all determined that we shall face the war united; that there shall be no party division, and that we will take no party advantage. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the whole question. I come now to the matter of the training of the men and the general administration of the Department. Twelve months ago the Defence Department was generally admitted to be by no means perfect, but at that time it had all the men of long training and long experience in administration. It had the pick of the military officers, men who had been trained up in administration, and trained in every walk of military life. From that time onward the services of those men have been needed. The best of them were picked first and sent to the front; then other men with less experience and less training were&#62; brought in to take their place, and gradually the new men were sent away, and others brought up to take their places. The military administration in time of peace twelve months ago was admittedly inefficient, but now, in time of war, with men who have not had the experience of those who administered it twelve months&#62; ago, it must be tested by a fiercer fire of criticism than it was then. Things which, twelve months ago could be overlooked P and for which an excuse could be found,, are not excused to-day. The critics must, judge as if every man in the administration was highly experienced, thoroughly trained, and had been carrying out for years the duties with which he is charged! to-day. What is the position ? Owing to* the fact that we have sent to the war our best, oldest, and most experienced officers, we are carrying out the administrations to-day with a bigger load to stagger under than we had to bear twelve months ago. We are carrying on the administration with the juniors, many of them filling important positions who have only had a training for a year or two, and many of them being called up from private avocations because they were militia officers, and put into positions to enable the other men to go away. But let one slip or mistake be made by a junior. Is there any mercy shown; is there any consideration of the fact that the officer is a young fellow, tackling a job a long way too big for him, and for which he has not had a training? No, no mercy is shown. The cry is, &#34;Down with him; bring his name out in the press and in Parliament; crucify him ; deal with him as if he ought to have all the knowledge and experience which come from a long association with the duties.&#34; That is the way to encourage a young fellow to do his best, and if he makes a success of it the critics say nothing about it. Have we not heard that the military officers are wasting the country&#39;s money, and making a horrible bungle in connexion with the contracts for the Defence Department? If those critics would only take the trouble to inquire they would find that the contracts are now being made by civilians, and not by military men. Nevertheless it is as good a stick as any other to hit a military dog with. If he does not deserve a hit for that he probably deserves it for something else, so shy it at him ! </para>

                        <para>- Yes; as soon as we found out the scandal in connexion with the case the order was repealed. I recognise that in this matter our difficulties are growing, because the numbers of those we have to handle have increased, and our capacity to deal with them has decreased, because of our men of experience having gone away. If there was a genuine and honest desire on the part of everybody to assist the Defence administration, consideration would be given to those facts, and much of the criticism would be tempered by a reference to the existence of the difficulties under which the Department is staggering. But how seldom do we see that consideration shown? How seldom do we find any of the persons who bring these points forward give consideration to the fact that in Victoria alone, to-day, we are clothing, feeding, and equipping more men than my honorable friend opposite was dealing with in the whole of Australia when I took over office from him. More than we were dealing with in the whole Commonwealth three months after the war began, we are dealing with today in Victoria. Yet because mistakes are made, as I admit, because shortages occur at times, no consideration is given to the great mass of good that has been accomplished, but those cases are held up as indicating a breakdown of the whole military system. No Minister has the right to expect to escape criticism, nor do I. Indeed, I welcome criticism. </para>

                        <para>- I have no need to do that, for I &#34;believe that the people of this country know a great deal more than the newspapers and some of the politicians give them credit for knowing. Thousands of men who are going through the camps have relatives and friends scattered throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Do honorable senators believe that if the men are so badly treated as some persons would make us believe, the people of this country would remain silent under it? The mothers and the fathers are meeting the men constantly, and know that the latter are not receiving the scurvy treatment which some of our critics would try to make us believe they are getting. </para>

                        <para>- The critic opens his mouth and swallows the story of the first grumbler, who meets him without digesting it. Persons who hear these stories ought to inquire whether there is anything in them or not, and there is a way by which a story can be tested and tried. I am glad to say that not only members of this Parliament, but many members of the public, have, before taking action on stories they have heard, come to me or to the Department and asked for the facts to be verified. If the facts cannot be rebutted anybody has the right to ventilate a case in the press and criticise Hie administration for the shortcomings which the investigation reveals. I come now to the question of the training of the men and their discipline. It is said that the Australian does not take kindly to discipline. That I think has been disproved. It has been proved that the Australian will take kindly to discipline when he is shown the meaning of that discipline, but it has to be an intelligent discipline. He will not take kindly to the old style of military discipline, which  consisted  of making a man into a sort of mechanical treadmill. But he will take kindly to a discipline which is going to lead him to exercise his intelligence and make him an intelligent soldier ; and more and more are our military officers beginning to grasp that fact. At the same time I recognise that rigid discipline has an important value on the battle-field. If that is recognised generally, the Parliament, the press, and the public owe the men a duty, and that is not to encourage the grumbling spirit of the critic who finds fault with the least excuse, and who voices his complaint where the great mass of the men are contented and satisfied. If it is noted that it is the grumbling minority who get all the limelight, that will be the quickest way to kill any spirit of discipline which I can think of, and to create in the great majority a feeling of disaffection, a feeling that, after all, a man will get along a little better if he is dissatisfied, disloyal, and undisciplined than if he is one of the contented and quiet parties. It is all very well to give voice to the grumbler, and those who are associated with him; but when these men break away from necessary discipline, those who have so encouraged the men that they got into the trouble, are the first to demand that they should be rigidly dealt with. I do not propose to go into the question of the transport services just now, except to say that I believe the transport work has been well and faithfully carried out, and that it constitutes a record of which the Navy ought to be proud. The history of it has not been written, and it cannot be written yet, but when one considers the number of ships that had to be provided, the officers and crews that had to be furnished, the coaling arrangements that had to be made in nearly all parts of the world, and the freight arrangements to be settled ; and when one considers further that all this has been carried out without the loss of a ship, without a serious accident to any ship, and without any serious trouble with officers or crews, hurriedly brought &#91;rom all parts of Australia, 1 think it is a record of which Australia might well he proud. Concerning the arrangements in Egypt, we know that a great many people in Australia do not yet realise that the conduct of this war, so far as the army at the front is concerned, is laid upon the British Government, and under it. the Arm}&#39; Council. We give our soldiers to them. We cannot have the separate Dominions each controlling its own army and fighting the war on an independent basis, because that would be to court disaster. Therefore, when our troops go to Egypt they go automatically under the control of the Army Council, and if we attempted to set aside or interfere with that arrangement we should invite failure. We must be loyal to and support the Army Council. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes who, when a young member of Parliament told him that he intended to support the Government when they were in the right, replied : &#34;I want people to support me when I am in the wrong.&#34; Perhaps that is an exaggeration of what should be expected, but, at all events, we must support the Army Council in this war. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; they are in it, and must see it through. They are responsible, because they are closer to the scene of action than we are. I must say that whenever we have made suggestions they have been treated with courtesy and consideration, and I am hopeful that the adoption of some of our suggestions will make the lot of our troops in Egypt lighter. I have been prompted to make these remarks because I feel that there has been growing up a spirit of fault-finding for fault-finding&#39;s sake, of endeavouring to magnify every little trouble that has occurred. I do not deny that there have been troubles. I admit them; but I say that, instead of bringing them forward for the purpose of rectification, there has been a disposition to bring them forward for the purpose of magnifying them and fault-finding. That is what I object to, and I hope it will cease. It is necessary that there should be give-and-take, and some consideration shown to those who are carrying the burden of this war. </para>

                    <para>. - No one can take exception to the Minister&#39;s remarks concerning the magnitude of the task that is confronting the Defence Department. He is fairly entitled to every sympathy in the performance of that duty, but I resent, and take strong exception to, his remarks concerning criticism of the administration, and especially his statement that this criticism in many cases is intended merely to harass the Department. The Minister has told us that he is always ready to welcome honest criticism, but I want to know when any such criticism has been regarded by the Minister as honest, and when he has not suggested that it has been prompted by party feeling? The charges made regarding the military camps has been entirely borne out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich&#39;s report, which the Minister would now have us believe was based upon the evidence of grumblers. If those complaints merely emanated from the grumblers in the camps, I would like to ask how is it that the Minister is now giving effect to the recommendations contained in that report? I would also like to ask the Minister how is it that  Colonel Stanley  and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> had made his charges, should have advised him regarding the condition of the camps, and told him that everything at the Liverpool Camp was entirely satisfactory? </para>

                        <para>- Although the Minister promised to inquire into the complaints, it has taken him fully three weeks to obtain a report from his officers in New South Wales. I have no desire to harass the Minister over this matter, but the practice is still going on, and I think some steps should be taken to have it thoroughly inquired into. In connexion with these matters the Minister has done me a very grave injustice, because he knows that on more than one occasion I have seen him privately, instead of ventilating grievances in this Chamber. In the face of all this it is a little extraordinary that the Minister should now tell those who are seeking the successful prosecution of the war that when they bring forward any suggestion for an improvement in the administration of the camps or otherwise, they are not doing their simple duty, but that they are harassing the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that we can refer to what has occurred elsewhere as being an . attempt to reopen the Tariff question, and besides that movement had the approval of both sides of the House. If, as the Minister says, the charges with regard to the military camps are based on the evidence of grumblers, how is it that there has been no evidence in rebuttal given by the officers or anybody else? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich&#39;s report shows that the charges were substantiated. If they were found proved, as they were on the evidence submitted, the fact that there was no evidence in rebuttal on many of the points must be taken as an admission by the officers at the camp that it was not possible to rebut them. </para>

                    <para>The evidence clearly establishes that the supplies of clothing, uniforms, overcoats, and bedding were, particularly during the month of Tune, wholly inadequate. Numerous instances were given by  uncontradicted  evidence of recruits sometimes having to wait several weeks before being supplied with articles of issue, such as dungarees, underclothing, cardigan jackets, overcoats, and proper bedding. </para>
                    <para>It appears also that in the Light Horse lino there was a shortage of overcoats to such an extent that even the guard and piquets were in some cases not supplied with them at all, and in other cases only with overcoats which were in a very bad state of repair, often unclean, and sometimes verminous. </para>

                <para>The Minister said he did not believe in wrapping the recruits up in cotton wool. Does he believe in wrapping them up in vermin ? Would he defend such conditions? Apparently he would, when he denounces those who .bring them before Parliament as the only means of getting redress, and as part of their public duty, as seeking merely to &#34; pin-prick &#34; the Ministry. They took the only course open to them when they criticised those responsible for what was going on at the camp. </para>

While vermin are often an accompaniment of camps, they are not a necessary one. When a Judge reports in this way about the camp conditions, the Minister altogether exceeds the limits of decency in denouncing the member of Parliament who brings the facts forward, as doing it not to improve the conditions at the camp, but merely to pin-prick the Administration. With regard to the Minister&#39;s statement that there were only about 200 overcoats short, the following paragraph in the report is interesting : - </para>

The Judge says that numerous instances of recruits without overcoats were given by uncontradicted evidence. Are we to suppose that the camp officials were struck dumb and supplied no evidence in contradiction, if the statements were not true ? The trouble is that they were true. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have referred to the report had not the Minister so strongly denounced those who had come forward and criticised his administration. I agree that no idle criticism of the administration should be tolerated; but, on the other hand, the Minister makes it extremely difficult for those who honestly desire to help forward the work he has in hand by the petulance with which he receives any suggestion that something is not quite as it ought to be. There certainly should be reciprocity in a matter of this kind. If the Minister wants suggestions making for improvement, he must assure those who make them that they will receive at least respectful consideration; but I have never known anybody venture to say that everything was not quite right in the Defence Department without the Minister immediately getting on the lofty pedestal that he attained this afternoon, and ta.king it almost as a crime against the Commonwealth for any one even to suggest that everything in his Department is not all that it should he. </para>

Does the honorable senator think that to prove that they were treated like dogs it was necessary that it should be shown that they carried about them other insects besides vermin ? If the defects were known to the Minister, and steps had been taken to remedy them, all that he need have said was, &#34;We know that, unfortunately, owing to the troubles which have como upon the Department in such increasing numbers, these things exist in the camps, and steps have been taken to remedy them.&#34; As a matter of fact, the charges were denied by the Minister on the strength of the report from the Quartermaster-General and from his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> At the time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was making the statement to which I have referred, his chief in another place made this statement - </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister of Defence told us that the defects were known to exist, and were being remedied, and yet, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> made the statement that they existed, the Prime Minister told the people of Australia that his allegations struck at the very vitals of the Defence system. Of what use is it for the Minister of Defence to turn round now and attempt to make it appear that these matters were then being remedied ? I say again that if they were known and were being remedied, the honorable senator had only to tell the Senate and his leader in another place that he knew that the defects existed, and was doing his level best to remedy them, and had given instructions that steps should be taken for that purpose. The statements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence are, to all intents and purposes, a denial of the allegations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard.</inline> If they are not, let us consider the words in which  Colonel Stanley  communicated with his departmental chief.

                    <para>A series of careful inspections during Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week has made it clearly manifest that the statements concerning the unsatisfactory conditions alleged to obtain at Liverpool Camp are wholly and entirely  unsustained,  with the exception that a number of newly-joined men have not been served out with greatcoats as ordered by Headquarters. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Again, assuming that the defects were known, and steps had been taken to remedy them, why did the Quartermaster-General, who was primarily responsible for seeing that everything necessary in camp was attended to, report that everything was satisfactory? If everything was not satisfactory - and we have been told by the Minister that it was not, and that steps were being taken to remedy what was unsatisfactory - I say that there was at that time, and until Mr. Justice Rich&#39;s report found its way on to the table of the Senate, a very stupid attempt - I can call it nothing more nor less - to make it appear that there was nothing wrong at Liverpool. Even now the Minister of Defence, instead of doing the right thing, as I expected he would do, and saying that, in view of the report, he regrets the disclosures, and will do his level best to see that such an unsatisfactory state of affairs is altered, attempts to belittle the report, suggests that it is founded on the evidence of a few grumblers; and, in addition, attempts to create a prejudice against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> and others who, in the discharge of their public duty, have thought fit to bring these matters before Parliament. I will refer to one or two &#39; more details of the report. I have dealt with the question of clothing. I propose to deal now with the questions of housing and health. These matters have additional importance from the fact that they were specially referred to in the reports of the Quartermaster-General and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I find that at page 11 of this typewritten report, a printed copy of which is not yet available, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich makes certain statements with regard to the huts, and the effect of their condition upon the men. Here I should like, first of all, to direct attention to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had to say about them - </para>

                    <para>Tuc huts arc large and roomy, and, being new, are quite clean. The floors are tongued. and grooved boards. The framing is Oregon; the walls and roof arc of corrugated galvanized iron. The ventilation is an air space between the top plate of the wall and the roof, which, extending over the walls in bungalow fashion, keeps out the rain. </para>

                    <para>I have come to the conclusion that the huts are draughty, and that the draughts, in many cases, were the cause of serious colds. Other contributing causes wore that, after wet weather, water was often allowed to remain under the huts, and in pools about the streets and. passages about the camp; that the blankets used by the men were not sufficiently aired and sunned; that the clothing supplied to the mcn was at times insufficient: that no provision was made for drying clothes, and that the arrangements for washing and bathing were inadequate: tha.t after inoculation the system is lowered, and men become susceptible to sickness. </para>

It was well cooked, of first-class quality, and comprised roast beef, baked onions, boiled potatoes, bread, and tea. </para>
                    <para>Later I visited the kitchen, where the cooks were preparing a warm evening meal for the men, who were having a field day. That meal consisted of beef, vegetables in ample quantity - potatoes, onions, and carrots. As there was an abundant supply of good, wholesome food, I was satisfied there was no room for complaint on that score. </para>

                    <para>The preparation of the food for cooking, the cooking itself, and its distribution as rations, leave much to be desired. In the first place, the cutlery supplied to some of the butchers is wholly unsuitable and inadequate for the purpose of severing the portions of the carcass. In most cases all that is supplied to the butcher is an ordinary dinner knife of inferior steel, and tables unsuited for the purposes for which they were intended. Again, the butchers and cooks ave called upon to work in the evenings after dark and in the mornings before daylight. In some cases the only lighting available is supplied by candles, while at most the supply is from hurricane lamps. </para>
                    <para>The cooks up till now, in the Infantry Camp, have had to perform their work in the open, and in bad weather the disadvantages of this practice are obvious. In justice to the authorities, however, I should point out that ordinary field kitchens were in course of construction before the Commission Bat, and appeared to contain adequate provision for the proper preparation of the food. </para>
                    <para>The distribution of the food is very unsatisfactory. There are no mess-sheds, and the men are not supposed to take the food into the huts. The dixies are brought to the men as they squat about the ground. In some cases there is a scramble for the food, with the result that the Inst to come is the least served. Pannikins to which soil or sand is adhering are dipped into the dixies, with unwholesome and insanitary results. </para>
                    <para>The method of cleaning the dixies and eating utensils in vogue may very easily have constituted one of the chief causes of illness at the camp. It appears that hot water and soda were available for the purpose in quantities which it was impossible for me to ascertain definitely; but it is undoubted that the general practice prevailing in the camp was to clean these articles with cold water and sand. The sand used must in many cases have been impregnated with urine and expectoration. </para>

If I am to understand from the honorable senator&#39;s interjection that he suggests that it was a stupid love of dirt on the part of the men that made them resort to these practices rather than make use of the ample supply of hot water and soda provided, what has he to say about the conduct of the officers who tolerated that kind of thing, and whose duty it was to see, not only that there was a supply of all the things necessary for the preservation of the health of the men, but that they should be utilized ?

Bub I am not now dealing with what would have happened had I been Minister. As a matter of fact, I would not have referred to this question at all but that the Minister has attempted to make it appear that those who criticise the Department are animated by party feeling, and have no desire to consider the interests of Che men, or of the Forces that we are sending abroad . I resent that accusation very strongly, and that is why I am dealing with this question at some length. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich&#39;s report also contains a paragraph in reference to the hospital - a paragraph which points out the quite inadequate character of the utensils supplied  therein, and one which states that jam tins were supplied to the patients both for purposes of expectoration and of urinating in at night. That is the hospital in which, according to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, everything was all right. </para>

Now I wish to deal with other matters. In the first place, I desire to direct the attention of the Minister to a subject upon which I, in common with other honorable senators, have a strong grievance. In spite of the honorable gentleman&#39;s declaration the other day that the War Committee have nothing whatever to do with the arrangements in our camps, his colleague in another Chamber is still giving colour to the idea that those camps are under the control of that body. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; only the other day, in reference to a previous statement by the Minister for the Navy, I asked the Minister of Defence whether it was a fact that the War Committee have the power to inquire into the arrangements at the Liverpool and other camps. The honorable gentleman replied that they had not. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr&#39;. Jensen</inline> has made a further statement to the effect that the War Committee have the power to inquire into the conditions obtaining at those camps. It is just as well that the public should know that that body is only entitled to consider matters which are specially referred to it by the Government. As the arrangements at our camps are not one of those matters, I. take strong exception to the statement of the Minister for the Navy that the Committee are in any way responsible for something which has not been referred to them. As the result of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen&#39;s</inline> statement, I have been asked why the War Committee do not intervene in reference to our military camps. I object to the impression getting abroad that the Committee have a right to roam all over the Defence Department, and ought, therefore, to shoulder the responsibility if anything goes wrong. I strongly protest against the action of the Minister for the Navy in making the statement of which I complain, a second time, after the Minister of Defence had denied its accuracy. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot be utilized until it has been rolled, and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s Rolling Mills are not ready. Consequently that company has made an arrangement for the steel to be rolled in Melbourne. Subsequent tests, however, will be made at the works themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to decry either the competency of the professors of the Melbourne University or the efficiency of their plant. But I would remind the Minister that there is a university in Sydney which possesses equal facilities and equal capacity. While I do not wish to pit one university against the other, I say that, in the light of the newspaper statement that steel was being sent from Newcastle to Melbourne, it did appear as if the Minister had overlooked the Sydney University, and also the offer which it had made to him. A little time ago, the Minister will recollect, I brought forward here the failure to utilize the members of the National Rifle Association for the purpose of training recruits. The Minister then told me what was being done, and I assured him that up to the Saturday prior to the day on which I spoke it was not being done.  He stated that he had given orders that it should be done, and had looked into the matter. He found that the orders had been given, but, for some reason or other, they were not being carried out. He then, I believe, gave fresh orders. At the same time, similar orders were given to the State of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that 1 am correct in saying that the orders were acted on in this State. It is some months since the Minister gave his first orders in New South Wales. They were acted on, I believe, for a few weeks and dropped, and nothing was said to him about it. Some weeks ago, he sent his later instruction to act on the orders, but they are not being acted on yet. In the meanwhile, they are being acted on in Victoria. What are the authorities in New South Wales doing to-day? Seeing that the Minister has now given a very definite instruction that the orders shall be carried out, they have communicated with the National Rifle Association, and stipulated for such conditions as they knew beforehand no rifleman could comply with. I ask the Minister to- see whether this is not another attempt on the part of his officers to carry out their own policy as against the Ministerial decision. If it is possible in Victoria to devise such conditions that the National Rifle Association can help, why should different conditions be imposed in New South Wales? Why, in addition to rifle capacity and skill, should the men be required, before the military authorities will accept them, to have military training and knowledge? What is good enough in Victoria ought to suffice there. But it is of no use to disguise the facts. The history of this case, to my mind, makes it quite clear that the officers at Sydney are resolved that they will not avail themselves of the assistance of the riflemen in order to teach recruits if they can help it. They have already flouted the Minister&#39;s decision by having nominally complied with it for a few weeks, . and then dropping the practice. And when he reminded them of his instructions they set to work to surround the acceptance of the offer with such conditions as would nullify it. Whatever may be thought of the proposal to utilize the services of expert riflemen, I am perfectly  certain that the Minister can have no sympathy with officers who, in that flagrant way, are attempting to set on one side his decision. 1 ask him to look into the matter, not merely because it seems to me a species of insubordination on the part of officers, but because we know, not only from the result of the inquiry, but from other factors, that the amount of rifle training given in the camps is altogether insufficient. Not a single day ought to be lost in trying to make good that deficiency. Weeks have been lost owing to the action of the authorities in New South Wales. I certainly hope that the Minister will look into the matter to enable him to decide whether it is not necessary to take more peremptory action. Another matter which I brought up here was the position of the nurses. The Minister admitted that, as the result of his inquiries, a circular had been found directing the nurses to apply for their uniforms to a particular firm in Sydney. He said that they could not discover by what authority the circular was issued, and he was till prosecuting inquiries. We have not heard any more about the matter. It seems to me a most extraordinary state of- affairs that a circular, having the appearance of being official, is sent out addressed to nurses whose services are accepted, and telling them that they must go to a particular firm to get their uniform, and that no one can discover who sent it out. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister spoke of a newspaper paragraph I brought forward. Those are two of the matters to which I called attention, and concerning which I am sure the Senate is waiting for some information. I do not know whether he calls these pin pricks animated by party feeling. I did not bring them forward in that  spirit.  I challenge any one to say that they were not matters fit and proper to bring forward. To my mind, there is no other course open with regard to the utilization of the services of expert riflemen. I have been at that matter for months, but we are no further forward now. </para>

                        <para>- I quoted one on the practice of turning men adrift after being inoculated. I tell the Minister, although he read the report, that there is behind the paragraph something more than appears on its face. I wish to come to a larger matter connected with the Defence Department. I must admit, that what has transpired to-day leaves me in an almost unsettled condition of mind as to what I ought to do. I can see in the Department to-day what, in my opinion, is a very serious weakness indeed. But if one ventures to make a suggestion, he is always open to the imputation, or the accusation, of trying to bring forward a matter to secure a party advantage. The foolishness of that charge, if the Minister had only stopped to think, would have been shown by the fact that in the last few days two of the most strongly worded speeches delivered in Australia against the administration of his Department have come from members of his own party. I refer to the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson</inline> has a great deal to say  on behalf of the view that he puts forward. The matter I desire to bring forward is what I call the business side of the Defence Department. Since the war broke out we have heard a great deal about organizing the resources of the country. If I understand the term, organizing for war means that every man in the community who can render any service likely to assist in carrying on the war should be put to that service, and in any capacity in which a man can serve he should be invited, if necessary coerced, to serve. In other words, it is- every man for the job he can do best. That is how I interpret the phrase. I should like to know what has been done to organize the resources of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The question of organizing the resources of Australia has not been submitted to that body. I am not saying that it is not doing useful work. It does seem to me that we are not utilizing the resources of this country as we ought to do. I am coming, as I have said, to what appears to me to be not only the big drawback with which the Department is confronted, but, as the result of that, the tremendous handicap imposed on the people of this country. The business side of the Department, I ask honorable senators to recognise, can be, and I think ought to be, clearly dissociated from the military side. The two branches, are so interwoven that it is always difficult to determine exactly where one begins and the other ends, but it is not difficult to understand that the military side - that is, the training of men - is quite distinct from the business side, which should be engaged in securing the supplies needed for the men. We have in the Department to-day the same men at both jobs, and I think that as the result of that we are getting, not only an inadequate service, but a very costly one. I do not want to say a word about the officers on the military side; I think that they have done, not only as well as could be expected of them, but possibly better. We have to remember the enormous expansion which has taken place ; the fact that we have had to make  offiers,  so to speak, almost while you wait, and put them to the responsible work of training others. Whilst we may reasonably recognise that slips have been made here and there, T think, on the whole, that the officers on the military side have done well. But when we come to the business side I wish to draw a big distinction. There is nothing particularly secret or sacred about the business side. A military officer may be able to turn a layman down when one goes to deal with the mysteries of the goose step, but when it comes to a question of buying boots or blankets there is nothing special about the business of the Department which renders it impossible for a layman to consider and deal with it. Let me ask honorable senators to recognise the position with which the Department is confronted. I do not intend to deal with any individuals, because I have no fault to find with the individuals, only with the system. Who are the men dealing with the millions we are spending to-day? Twelve years ago the Department was spending about &#163;750,000 a year. The men who had the handling of that money were drawn from the States where the biggest sum expended probably did not exceed &#163;250,000. After twelve years the expenditure of the Department has grown from &#163;750,000 to &#163;50,000,000. In one year it has grown approximately from &#163;5,000,000 to &#163;50,000,000. Therefore it represents not only a tremendous addition to the work, but a tremendous addition to the responsibility. It is not merely that we are doubling the work of a man, but that we are increasing the difficulties necessarily connected with so big an operation. Who are the gentlemen who are called on to expend this money ? A few years ago they were handling quite modest sums, and we have to recognise that they did not join the Forces professing any business aptitude, or looking for business. They joined because the soldierly instinct was strong in them, and they made that part their special study. </para>

                        <para>- I ask again who are these gentlemen that they are competent to handle &#163;50,000,000? A few years ago, I repeat, the senior men were handling quite small amounts, and to-day they are called upon to handle &#163;50,000,000. Am I doing them an injustice when I ask them to show credentials for handling a business enterprise of that magnitude ? It would be impossible to assume that these gentlemen have had that varied experience or the opportunity to show business capacity to enable them to satisfactorily carry on what to-  day is undoubtedly the biggest business concern in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That statement from the Minister does not count for anything. Suppose that they are the cheapest and the best boots, what does it prove? It means that the Allies are not purchasing under the same conditions as are our officers. The point is whether we are getting the boots at as low a price as we could, or whether there is any leakage in the Department owing to the want of business capacity. </para>

An honorable senator suggests that there have been additions to the staff. On the contrary, there have been depletions, as the Minister admitted to-day when he said that the most experienced officers had gone to the front. </para>

                        <para>- Now, every honorable senator knows that the task I was faced with was to get horses for the Expeditionary Forces with the least possible delay. I asked the officer who was responsible for this duty how long it would take to get the remounts, and he replied, &#34;Six months.&#34; I informed him that I would not stand six months&#39; delay, because we might then just as well put up the shutters and go out of business. He replied, &#34;You cannot do it before then,&#34; and I asked, &#34; What is going to stop us? &#34; He replied, &#34; Do you know how many horses will be required? We shall want 8,000.&#34; My reply to that was that we had to get those 8,000 horses within six weeks. There was only one way to do it, and that was to smash up all- the regulations, and tear up all the red-tape of the Department. I had to utilize every buying agency that I could get hold of anywhere. I knew perfectly well that possibly there would be unsuitable horses among the 8,000 ; but I realized that the most important part of the business was to secure the animals within the time, and I am pleased to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> in his report, stated that the transaction turned out better even than I expected it would. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister may be dealing with some organization which he established quite lately, but I am dealing with the practice of the Department as it was until quite recently, and, so far as I know, as it exists to-day. The Quartermaster-General&#39;s Department is responsible for the finding of all supplies for the Army, and until quite recently it was the custom of the Quartermaster-General to undertake these transactions. It is conceivable that some body, called the Supply and Tender Board, does call for tenders, but does the Minister suggest that that is an alteration of the system? In an ordinary business system the policy is to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest, and if that system were applied to two men under equally favourable circumstances, I will undertake to say that one man, with proper organization, will make a fortune, while the other, who lacks the capacity for organization, will go bankrupt. That is as I see the system in its application to the Defence Department. The Minister himself says it is admitted that most of the experienced officers have gone to the front. </para>

                        <para>- Some of the most experienced men in the office of the Quartermaster-General have also gone. I want to draw attention to the fact that the Defence Department is spending about &#163;50,000,000 a year as far as I can gather from the statements made by the responsible Minister. I do not know how much of that goes in payment to the men and how much in supplies, but I am assuming that at least half of it is being devoted to the purchase of supplies necessary for the Army, while the other half represents pay to the men. Honorable members will agree with me, I think, that the difference between competent and incompetent business management in relation to an expenditure of &#163;25,000,000 could be modestly stated as worth at least 5 per cent. It may be worth 10 or 20 per cent., but I am on perfectly safe ground when I say that the difference between competent and incompetent management is 5 per cent. That is a mere supervising charge, but it represents a saving of one and a quarter millions sterling. I was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> just now what evidence I had of incompetence in the Department. I do not know whether the honorable senator wants me to quote General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton&#39;s report, which was written in times of peace, but I would remind the honorable senator that General Hamilton pointed out several serious defects in the system in Australia, and said that it would not stand a fortnight of war. Perhaps the honorable senator will respect General Hamilton&#39;s opinion if he does not respect mine. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, and I am also aware that I would not like to see a continuance for twelve months of the conditions as they were during the first few months of this conflict, when, like a lightning flash, the intimation of the declaration of war came upon the Department. Since then Ministers have had twelve or thirteen months&#39; experience, and in that time it was reasonable to expect that some system would have been devised to  place the Department on a satisfactory footing. The fact seems to be ignored that in the first month of the war everything had to be done with the greatest possible speed. Let me read what General Hamilton said on the departmental methods - </para>

                <para>As a rule, the horn leader of men, assuming that he has time for administrative detail, has little aptitude for it. Even in a professional army, where men devote their whole lives to military work, specialization in all matters pertaining to the art of war and to troop training has, under modern conditions, proved to be necessary. How much more, then, must it be necessary under a militia system. </para>
                <para class="block">General Hamilton is arguing there for the specially trained man for military work, and the specially trained man for the business side of the Department. We have no such specially trained men on the business side. </para>

                <para>As a business proposition, too, the need is obvious for specialized training for the man who has himself to carry out important commercial transactions in peace and war,, and has to gauge and report, on the capabilities- of his business subordinates. </para>

                <para>I have no hesitation in advising that the institution of a business department in the Army, under a business bead, is essential to efficiency and economy. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of this department should be homogeneous and interchangeable as between the various sections into which the department should be divided. In this way only will it be possible to produce, in time, men fitted to be placed in charge of administration in all its branches. </para>
                <para class="block">I emphasize the words &#34;in time.&#34; A great deal is being said about decentralization, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> refers to some of the evils existing in the Department as being due- to centralization, but the talk about decentralization seems to ignore one very important fact. We all believe in it theoretically, but if the Minister were <inline font-style="italic">te*</inline> attempt to introduce any considerable instalment of it at once the effect would be only to make matters worse than they are. It is clearly laid down in General Hamilton&#39;s report that before you can decentralize you must train the men to handle the responsibility you propose to throw upon them. He practically tells us that we have not got the men. Those we have have been trained for years in the red-tape process. To use my own words, but practically to sum up what General Hamilton means, if we were suddenly to throw on these men the responsibility of acting for themselves in these large business matters, we should bring about a condition worse than that which exists to-day. I am compelled by my experience of the &#39;Department to say I believe that to be- true. Decentralization must be a gradual process. You must train your men by degrees, and &#39; instil into them business methods, before you can expect men in distant parts of the Commonwealth to accept big drafts of very serious responsibility. With the staff as it is to-day, consisting of men who have had no opportunity to acquire the business training that is essential under any system of decentralization, the Minister should consider whether he might not with advantage adopt that recommendation of General Hamilton&#39;s, which was certainly made with regard to peace conditions, but which, if it was desirable when we were expending &#163;5,000,000 per annum, must be increasingly desirable when we are spending &#163;50,000,000. That recommendation was that, as an initial step towards creating as a separate branch of the Department a business side, a civilian business man should be appointed temporarily with the duty of organizing the business part of it, and be withdrawn after having trained the men there to the duties and responsibilities which would fall upon them. I suggest to the Minister that something of the kind might be clone to-day. No one can believe that in the hurry and scurry of war, and with a large number of men of quite limited experience dealing with these matters, we are getting the best results possible from the expenditure of our money. I do not like to call what is going on waste, because the term implies negligence, and it is due, not to negligence, but to hurry and to want of business capacity on the part of the men handling the expenditure, but we are certainly paying more than we need pay under proper business supervision. It is worth while trying to save that amount. The fact that the war is costing us &#163;50,000,000 per annum, and that it must go on whether we like it or not, is no justification for spending 25s. where &#163;1 is sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend seems to have the business craze. I never yet heard it said anywhere that a defence department in any part of the world was a good business concern. Had the Quartermaster-General&#39;s branch of the Defence Department in Great Britain been a good business concern, there would never have been a Coalition Ministry there. There has never been a war in which Great Britain has been involved, or any other war as far as I can ascertain, in which it has not been the business side of the Department that has left much to be desired. </para>

No honorable senator reading his report could possibly pretend that the business side of the Defence Department is perfect. My point is that we have to organize the resources of the nation for war, but we are not doing so when we allow brains competent to handle this money to go unutilized. No private concern would be content to leave &#163;50,000,000  of expenditure under the control of the men who are handling it to-day in what is by a long way the biggest concern in Australia. They would want, as the Department needs, to get the benefit of brains and experience which have been in the habit of dealing with big business concerns, but we have not got those qualities in the Department. </para>

                        <para>- No; I suggest that the Government should, as an initial step, adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton&#39;s suggestion to put the business side of the Department in charge of a business man who, after having got a grip of it, could organize it on business lines, and then give the Minister advice as to what further steps should be taken. There is no one in the Department competent to do this to-day. It must be quite obvious to honorable senators from the way in which I have dealt with this matter that I have not brought it forward as in any way an attack upon the present Administration or upon the Minister of Defence. The system has been there for years. It was there when I was in charge of the Department, and has continued while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has been in charge. I offer the suggestion as one which I think would afford the Minister relief from many business worries. It would save the country a large sum of money if we could have in this Department the superior business capacity which is available in the community, and which the officers of the Defence Department have never had an opportunity of acquiring. They have never had the experience necessary for the conduct of a business concern of the magnitude of the business side of the Defence Department. I strongly urge upon the Government the expediency of adopting the suggestion. I wish I could think that the war was over, and in that case there would be no urgency for its adoption. But, so far as I can form an opinion, the war is likely to last as long as it has already lasted, and many millions will go out of the Commonwealth Treasury before peace is declared. If that be the case every penny that can be saved must be of value to a country that will be heavily pressed by taxation to meet the demands of the war. There is only one thing that I know against the adoption of the suggestion, and that is that there is always found in every Department a strong prejudice against bringing into it any outside assistance. Every officer on the staff of a Department seems to think that, if it is suggested that some one from outside should be brought in to assist, that is a reflection upon his capacity. That feeling is probably stronger in the Defence Department than in any other. I can understand, and to some extent sympathize with that feeling, but the position is too critical, and the amount of money being expended is too great to permit such a feeling to restrain the Minister of Defence for one moment. I leave the suggestion for what it is worth. The Minister of Defence must himself have discovered by this time that the business system of his Department is not all that could be desired. If he looks at General Hamilton&#39;s report in the light of facts which must be within his own knowledge, he must come to the conclusion that it is desirable to still further dissociate the business from the military side of his Department. He should create a distinct business branch, which could work independently of the military side of the Department, be free from its traditions, and bring to the aid of the Government at the present moment some of the business capacity that is available, and without which the Defence Department is bound to make a series of financial mistakes. </para>

                        <para>. - No one could take exception to the closing criticisms of the Leader of the Opposition; they were couched in the language in which we might expect reasonable criticism to be expressed. So far as the business side of the Defence Department is concerned, I venture to say that, huge as the expenditure is, it is not really beyond the capacity of ordinary business men when each particular article supplied is whittled down to the lowest possible cost. I take, for instance, the supply of boots, which involves an enormous sum of money. If by tender we find that a pair of boots of first class quality can be produced at a given price, say 12s. or 12s. 9d., we give an order to many different firms for thousands of pairs at that price. With practical common sense men as inspectors, who are doing this work satisfactorily and well - and this is proved by the wear of the article supplied - I  venture to say .a man of ordinary .business capacity could be trusted to supervise the expenditure thus incurred. If we take .clothing, and find that we can turn out jackets at a given price, discovered by the competitive system of the earlier days, and that certain factories can supply a .good article well toned out at the price, and we spread the orders for these jackets throughout the Commonwealth, although the total expenditure may amount to a very large sum, it will be admitted that there is not much room for waste or for further economy. I could enumerate other articles supplied in the same way. The magnitude of the development of the business of the Department during the last twelve months has, of course, been beyond all expectation. We have had many grave difficulties to contend with, and the gravest, perhaps, has been that supplies have been very difficult to get, and have had to be requisitioned in some cases when, as might be expected, the prices charged have been higher. That was a difficulty which could not be overcome. It is <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> enough to say that because of the high expenditure of the Defence Department the employment of some one from outside possessed of great business capacity is necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that the employment of such a person would result in the saving of 5 per cent. I take a number of separate articles, such as boots, clothing, overcoats, blankets, woollen goods, shaving brushes, and razors, and ask whether a business man from outside could be found who would be able to save 5 per cent, on the purchase of those articles. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator might be able to find such a man, but I may say that these matters have come under my direction to some extent recently, and I should very much like to meet the man who could save the Commonwealth 5 per cent, on the purchases. Neither the eyes nor the ears of the Government are shut to any proposal that will bring about a distinct improvement. I take the magnitude of the expenditure, and the business method of dealing with the purchase of each separate article of supply, and I venture to say that there is not much room for cheaper buying or for securing a better quality in the articles we are buying. I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> criticism in that regard in the spirit in which it was made. There is a little matter on which the honorable senator would like to have some more information, and that is the nurses&#39; uniforms purchased from David Jones and Company, of Sydney. I tried to get information on that subject when I was in Sydney, because the insinuations made in another place against the firm of David Jones and Company came as a shock and a .surprise to me. It must have surprised any man knowing the reputation of that firm to learn that they had been accused of being public robbers. </para>

I got that information at David Jones and Company&#39;s stores from the two young men who are managing this part of the business. They were only too anxious to lay before me the whole of the transactions, and the firm invites the Minister of Defence to have an inquiry into them made, because there is at stake the reputation of a firm that has been conducting business in Sydney for seventy-eight years. It has been stated that this firm has been given a monopoly of the supply of these goods, and are using their advantage to make undue profits out of our nurses who are going to the front. </para>

                        <para>- No ; this was a matter for the Army Medical Corps. I went to the premises of David Jones and Company with the intention of following up the complaints. They produced their books and accounts, looked up the uniform made for a certain nurse, showed me the amount of material and its value, the amount of labour and its cost, the gross profits, and the estimated net profits. It did not require a man of more than average capacity to go through a dozen examples of the supply of individual uniforms to discover whether the firm was making a straightforward statement in the matter or not. In view of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said concerning my report on the Liverpool Camp, my judgment in this matter, after investigation, may have little weight with the honorable senator. But I believe, from the books shown me by the two young men at David Jones and Company&#39;s premises, their statement that there was not a net profit of 5 per cent, in the supply of these uniforms. It is said that the issue of the circular caused nurses to go to David Jones and Company &#39;for their uniform, but it has been withdrawn for some time now. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to deal with the matter fairly and honestly, and since the circular has been withdrawn, I venture to say that a big percentage of the uniforms supplied to nurses are still being manufactured by David Jones and Company. I make these statements in the endeavour to protect the reputation of a firm that has stood bigh amongst business firms in Sydney for many years. Nothing is more desired by that firm than that there should be the closest investigation into the whole of the details of this mat*ter. I do not wish to make any further reference to the subject, but the speeches made in another place, and the insinuations and innuendoes, have misled the public into believing that this firm was overcharging nurses for their uniforms. The young men with whom I discussed the matter made another statement and offered to produce their books to prove it, but I did not put them to the trouble of doing so. They said that nurses who got their uniforms from David Jones and Company were allowed to have any other goods they required at 10 per cent, less than the ordinary prices. If that be so, and I have no reason to doubt the statement, it was a generous thing for the firm to do. I wish now to deal with the Liverpool Camp, and in this matter I am personally interested. </para>

                        <para>- Let us consider the matter of the Liverpool Camp in a fair and straightforward way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has twitted me upon the report I made after a visit to the camp. I propose to tell honorable senators exactly what happened. I read the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard&#39;s</inline> charges, as published in the newspapers. What were those charges? They were that the men were treated like dogs. That was the worst charge the honorable member made. A further charge was that owing to the influence of a man of German parentage with a German name, and who had been guilty of disloyal utterances, several sick men were compelled to wait for a considerable time before they were attended to. This was due to the frightful influence of this man with a German name. It was charged also that the clothing issued was insufficient to protect the men from cold, and that there were no overcoats supplied to men employed on night duty. I summed these charges up in this way : With respect to the hospital, I asked the question whether the men were properly treated there. With respect to the food, I asked  whether it was good, clean food, well cooked. With respect to the housing accommodation, I found it was stated that owing to the draughty condition of the huts, the men suffered from colds, and sickness was prevalent. I observed the conditions which prevailed at the camp with the eye of a man who had been through seven camps. Notwithstanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has placed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich&#39;s finding in opposition to my own report, and has held me up to ridicule because that finding does not coincide with my own opinion- </para>

                        <para>- In the old days I sewed with the militia from the time I entered it as a private till I reached the rank of sergeant, and, in passing, I may remark that the position of sergeant was about as high a position as a man without influence could then attain. The experience of seven military camps which I thus gained enabled me to form a fair judgment as to how the Liverpool Camp compared with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> stated that I went through the Liverpool Camp with  Colonel Stanley,  asking for complaints from the men. There is only one good English word which will fitly answer that allegation. It is a lie. While I was inspecting the camp  Colonel Stanley  was not present.

                        <para>- I wish briefly to recount exactly what prompted my visit to the Liverpool Camp. I read the attack which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> in another place. I caught the 11 o&#39;clock train- from Sydney to Liverpool, and reached the latter place before midday. From the Liverpool post-office I despatched a wire to the Minister of Defence intimating that I had gone to the camp to see the position for myself. I entered the camp, and saw  Colonel Kirkland,  the officer in command. It was then just 12 o&#39;clock. I told him who I was, and said that I would have a look through the camp. He replied, &#34;You had better have lunch first.&#34; I remarked that as the men were then having lunch I would take a stroll round. I walked through the lines, and with the ease of an old campaigner entered into conversation with the men. For the next two or three hours I was thus engaged. I then returned to the Liverpool post-office, and despatched a wire to the Minister, in which I stated that there was very little room for complaint as to the conditions obtaining at the camp. The food supplied to the men was exactly of the character described by me in my report. It consisted of well-cooked roast beef, potatoes, onions, bread, and tea. I again visited the camp while the men were preparing the evening meal. The food on that occasion was good, wholesome food - as good as any man could want. I asked the men if they had any complaints to make. Their chief complaint was that they had to pay their railway fares to and from Sydney. I have no hesitation in saying, in view of all the improvements which are to be made there, that the camp at Liverpool is the best that I ever sf,w.  Colonel Stanley  says the same thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would shut him out, and so would the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> because he is a military man. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable senator would not accept his evidence. I say that  Colonel Stanley  joined the service as a master gunner, and after an honorable career achieved the position which he holds to-day - that of Quartermaster-General. In the light of his statement, before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, that the Liverpool Camp is the best camp that he has ever seen, I am free to admit that I am not ashamed of the report which I made. Of course it may be urged that he is a military man, and wishes to hush up things. But why should he desire to do so ? Personally, I feel that I am on my defence. I say that if the report I made to the Minister and to this Chamber be not true, I am not only unworthy of my position as a Minister, but as a member of this Parliament. When I visited the Liverpool Camp I looked for anything that might be wrong with the food, with the housing conditions, with the hospital arrangements, and with the men themselves, and I found nothing to complain of. </para>

                        <para>- No. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted portions of my report to-night, in which I stated that conditions were satisfactory, what did he urge was wrong ? That the men were cleaning their dixies in a filthy fashion. Now if any man had gone through that camp as I did, would he believe that our Australian soldiers would be so crassly ignorant as to clean their utensils in the dirty way in which we are told they cleaned them ? Two of the things of which I boast are the resource and initiative of our soldiers. The thought that men can be found who will clean their dixies in the way alleged, comes as a shock to me, especially in the light of the Commissioner&#39;s statement that hot water and soda were available. I say, candidly, that I never inquired into conduct of that kind. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made any statement which would lead to an inquiry of that character. We have been told&#34; that all <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard&#39;s</inline> accusations have been borne out. I say that the two allegations which prompted that inquiry were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in this Chamber, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> elsewhere, and that those statements were withdrawn. They were statements as to the wrong management of the hospital by a man possessing a German name. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made that statement here. Why did he not substantiate it? As a matter of fact, it was upon his statement - so <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> declared at the inquiry - that the latter based his speech. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to comment on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich&#39;s report. He viewed the conditions which obtained at the Liverpool Camp from the standpoint of a gentleman who is accustomed to the luxuries of a fine home, or of fine hotels, whereas I viewed them from the stand-point of a man who was accustomed to camps. That statement will reconcile any differences that may exist between us. Now I am going to ask honorable senators to cast their minds back to the origin of this trouble. What was the cause of the inquiry ? It was the allegation that a doctor with a German name was making, the lives of the men at the camp miserable - that he was treating them like dogs. </para>

I do not wish to give the name of the doctor publicly, but I will give it to the Minister privately.

Either they are charges against his loyalty, and the way he treated the patients, or they are not. If they are charges they should have been proved by the men who made them when the opportunity was given. I will be no judge in a matter of this sort; but I say in all earnestness, that when a man holding the position of

What could be more serious than a statement that a German doctor, or a doctor with a German name, was making ineffective the work of the Army Medical Corps? The charge against the doctor is grave and serious, but the evidence given before the Judge not only disproves the charge, but proves <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink</inline> to be one of the most able and effective administrators we have yet had there. It proves that he found the hospital conditions of the camp disorganized, and established a system out of chaos. </para>

                        <para>- It is a wonder if the honorable senator, when he reads the names of Australians with German names who have been killed or wounded at Gallipoli, can stand to a statement of that kind, even though it was made by a Justice of the High Court. Let us take the simple statement that it is an impropriety or an inexpediency to appoint a doctor with a German name to a position in the military service during the time of war. Is there an honorable senator here who will indorse that sentiment? If it is a fair statement, let us withdraw from the front Australian soldiers with German names. We cannot restore to the Australian mothers who, in time of peace, married German husbands, the sons who have shed their blood for Australia. Although men may take the position of officers and soldiers, and die fighting for Australia, yet positions are not to be given to them because they have German names, and are of German parentage. That is repugnant to my sense of British justice, and, what I value more, to my sense of Australian fair play. </para>

                        <para>- That brings homo the injustice of a statement of that kind. We are engaged in war against a foe, many of whose acts have moved every one of us to the deepest feeling and the strongest anger. The use of poisonous gases, the torpedoing of vessels carrying defenceless women and children, and all that kind of thing makes a man&#39;s blood boil when he thinks of what is fair fighting. But that fighting is quite as fair as that which some persons would like to adopt, of hounding down every man in the country with a German name and of German descent. As a Britisher, and as an Australian, my desire is that nothing shall be done which will be regretted after the war is over. Nothing will do us more credit when the war is over than the statement that we treated even our relentless and unscrupulous enemies with an even-handed justice which will reflect honour on us and the nations we are associated with. I am aiming for that. Justice is something more than that which can be bought in a Courthouse. It is a feeling that all our dealings with people here may bear the closest scrutiny even of the enemy. I beg here publicly to differ from the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, notwithstanding the high position he occupies, and to express the opinion that in the interest of Australian fair play we want something broader, wider, and deeper than that before we attempt to condemn the appointment of a man with a German name and of German parentage. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has heard to-day that only one person other than a naturalized or unnaturalized German has been interned. On the Government rests the most serious responsibility of determining not only who shall be interned, but who shall be left at liberty. If things had happened which at times some persons thought were likely to happen, I venture to say that not only the Government, but every one else, would have stood condemned if we had been lax in any way in protecting the public interest. Occasionally, when a mau is interned, an act of injustice will be done, but the public safety demands that such a measure should be taken. Honorable senators are aware that the Hague Convention provides that if a doctor from a German Force is captured by Britain, France or Russia, he has to be found employment or paid the salary attached to the position he holds. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink</inline> was born in Australia of German parents and reared in Australia. He is an enthusiastic Australian. He is not a personal friend of mine. I had not set eyes on him before this complaint was made. I had heard of him, of course, because he holds a very distinguished position in the medical world of Sydney. In order to prove my statement that the Liverpool Camp was a good camp, I propose to quote from a report written on the 4th June, before these charges were made, by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wall,</inline> of Burwood. He, I may mention, has partly given up his practice to the military, and holds the position of captain in the Army Medical Corps.

To realize what the handling of this number of indoor patients means it is only necessary to state that the field hospital is passing through more patients than either of the two big metropolitan hospitals - the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and Sydney - institutions which have permanent structures situated in the heart of the city, and have taken years to perfect their organization and equipment, where, moreover, the staff, which includes in either over sixty of the ablest men in the profession, is permanent and experienced in the treatment of the sick and disabled. </para>

There was a small dispensary tent, and a store tent which acted as orderly room, quartermaster&#39;s store, and pack store for patients&#39; clothing.

When the opportunity was given to those gentlemen to prove their charges, where were they? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> withdrew his. What doesSenator Millen propose to do? The charges were made in Parliament. Have they yet been withdrawn in Parliament?&#34; The insinuations were made in Parliament in the teeth of the evidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink&#39;s</inline> favour. Are they going to be withdrawn in Parliament? Unless there is something more beneath and behind this they should be withdrawn. The men who made them have nothing against him now except that he has a German name.  His  organizing abilities, the skill and capacity he has displayed, go for nothing.  His  German name condemns him in the eyes of certain honorable senators, who are crying &#34; peace,&#34; and saying, that they are not actuated by party feeling, but who, while flying the white flag, are firing from under it at every opportunity. </para>

I hope if ever any one in this Senate, by charge or cowardly insinuation, attacks any worthy private citizen of this country, I shall be supplied with the real facts. If I am, the attacked will find in me a champion, as far as I am able in my humble way, to put his case. This man has no chance of speaking in Parliament for himself. He has given his great abilities to the service of his country, and suddenly finds himself pursued with malignity of personal resentment and malice, let loose upon him as a public enemy. </para>

The covering of the latrines was approved by the Minister in March, and was not carried out because the months of April and May, in particular, were devoted to equipping and getting on board the ships a huge body of recruits. Other things had to wait, as is often the case with reforms. </para>

He made the charge here, and it is up to him to withdraw it here. If it is not withdrawn in an open and manly way, it will stand, and adversely affect a loyal Australian in his private capacity. I see. no reason why, when the chance of proving the charge was given, the honorable senator did not take advantage of it. </para>

                            should be called. The Judged answer was that the charges of disloyalty against the doctor had been withdrawn, and that, therefore, there was no occasion to call the honorable senator. If the honorable senator could have proved them, it was his duty to the country to go and do so.

                        <para>- What is the difference ? I am not surprised, because that is nothing new in camp life, and the man who pretends to be shocked at the fact that men gathered together in large numbers become verminous has no experience  of camp conditions. That is one of the main difficulties that have to be contended with in dealing with large bodies of troops. So far as all these criticisms of the camps, and the new method of having a permanent staff to take charge of the work are concerned, I venture to say that to teach the men how to adapt themselves to camp life is as important to our success in battle as to teach them to use the rifle. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that is because of my old Tory instincts. I hope the men trained under the newer conditions will give an even better account of themselves than did the men trained under the old. If they do, Australia will be doubly proud of them. The men who have been sent oversea went through all this; but it was very much worse in the honorable senator&#39;s day. I do not blame him for it, but when he was at the head of the Defence Department camp life was infinitely worse. </para>

                        <para>-Nobody looking at the improvements made since can doubt it for a moment. Considerable improvements have been made, and when I say that the conditions were infinitely worse in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> day, and that the men trained under them have done all that we expected them to do, I hope the men trained under the new conditions will prove even better soldiers. If the new conditions enable the men to adapt themselves to camp life as soon as they go into camp, to make themselves comfortable under any difficulties, and to adopt clean sanitary methods of keeping the camp wholesome, it must lead to better results ; but if not, we shall get worse results than we had previously. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator wants to speak about something that is in his own mind. I have taken a good deal of latitude this evening, but I do not apologize, because the subject was worthy of lengthy consideration. I have done so chiefly in defence of a man with a German name. Cautious men would say that I should not in any way connect myself at the present time with a man with a German name. I was never cautious, and never pretended to be cautious, and I am glad to have an opportunity of exhibiting in my place in Parliament a wiser, better, and higher spirit in dealing with people <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> German names than is suggested in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich&#39;s report. I can differ from  His  Honour in that matter without belittling his report, and in doing so I am satisfied that I will earn the good opinion of nine-tenths of the people of this country, who will be prepared to admit that, it is the antithesis of justice to say that <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> man shall not be given promotion because he happens to have a German name. </para>
