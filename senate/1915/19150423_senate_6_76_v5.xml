                    <para class="block">The measure does not contain any important principles. It is largely like the one we dealt with yesterday, its object being to fill up gaps which have been discovered. The most important thing it deals with is fixing the application of the Army Act. Under section 55 of the principal Act, when Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are called out for active service, the Army Act applies, but the Act is somewhat vague. It is desired to make the Act more definite, to show that it applies within or without the limits of the Commonweal tli, and an amendment is  submitted for that purpose. At the beginning of this session we passed an amending Defence Bill, which was intended to legalize the raising of Expeditionary Forces. As honorable senators are aware, on the outbreak of war this Government took the necessary action to raise Expeditionary Forces. There was really no complete authority in the Defence Act for that purpose, and the Bill then brought in was to legalize the action, but, unfortunately, it was not dated back to the commencement of the war, and, therefore, it only had effect from the date of its being assented to, which, of course, was subsequent to the raising of the Expeditionary Force sent to New Guinea. It is desirable that we should bring these actions of the previous Government within the scope of the law. I may say that certain action in connexion with the first Expeditionary Force, although it has been disbanded, has become necessary; and in order to make quite <inline font-style="italic">sure</inline> that we can take that action under the Defence Act, it is essential that we should date the amending Bill back to the 1st August. Therefore an amendment is brought forward in this measure. </para>

                            <para>- Certain action was taken as soon as it became known that the position was strained, Snd that war was likely to be declared; it was thought best to make sure. Again, in raising permanent forces, there are restrictions as to the kind of forces which can be raised. It has become necessary that we should have a survey branch associated with the Defence Department. There are certain portions of the Commonwealth, notably near defended ports, where it becomes essential for defence purposes that there should be a vary minute survey of the land, and that survey has been going on for some time. But there had to be an authority in the Defence Act to authorize the appointment of a survey corps, and therefore we now ask for an amendment to be made. In connexion with these surveys, the surveyors have to enter upon private lands and put marks there in order to determine the contour of the country. At present there is nothing to&#34; safeguard the Department if any of the marks are removed or tampered with, and therefore it is necessary that we should have power to protect them. Of course, if any damage is done to land, the owner is entitled to compsnsation, and provision is made by which compensation can be recovered. That provision is made in the principal Act, but it is necessary that the survey parties should have the power to put up marks on private land in order to carry out their work. The Bill contains a clause of a rather important character, dealing with the allocation of money to the dependents of soldiers in the Expeditionary Forces. On this matter the Department has come in for a considerable amount of criticism. But in very many cases the delay in the payment has on investigation been discovered to be due to the fact that some married men gave to their wives an undertaking - in some cases a letter - that they would allocate a certain amount of their money to them, but they signed the attestation form as single men, and did not fill out an allocation order after the troops had left Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that allocation orders would not come into effect until after the troops had left Australia. A soldier is paid directly until he leaves the Commonwealth. The position in regard to these men would not be discovered until some little time after the troops had left. Very frequently the first information the Department received was by means of a letter from a member of Parliament complaining that some woman had not received any payment, or of a letter in the press, complaining that a woman had not received the amount allotted to her. On investigation it was found in very many cases that no allocation order had been left by the soldier, and in some cases that the soldier had signed as a single man. Where the woman was able to establish that she was married to the soldier or to produce a letter - and this applied in some cases to other than married women - and we could compare the signature of the man with the signature on the attestation form, and satisfy ourselves that it was a genuine case - this occurred in the case of illegitimate children where the man had promised the woman that certain payments would be made, and given an undertaking that he would issue an allocation order - the Department, acting upon that information, and without any authority from the man, has allocated money, and I think honorable senators will agree that it is the right thing to do. We want legal authority for that action. There are many cases where, unless that authority is given, it is quite on the cards that if these soldiers come back the Defence Department may be held liable to pay them the full amount of the money so allocated, because we have acted without authority from the soldier concerned in what we have done. It is only right that the persons whom these soldiers have left behind, and who were dependent upon them, should receive a certain amount of their pay. We are, under this Bill, asking that where no allocation order has been made, and the Minister is satisfied upon proof submitted that an allocation order should have been made, we may allocate a certain sum. In order to legalize what has already been done in this way, it is provided that this clause shall operate as from- the 1st August. </para>

                            <para>- When we are dealing with a force of 70,000 men, the honorable senator will understand that, though there may be a considerable number who have done so, they do not represent any large proportion of the Forces. Another matter with which the Bill deals, and which I admit requires some con sideratiou, is the provision sought to be made where a citizen soldier is discharged by an employer because he has absented himself in order to attend to his military duties. Under the principal Act, an employer is liable to a fine if he discharges an employe because he has absented himself from his service for the purpose of carrying out military duties, such as attendance at camp, or at a drill or parade properly called. It is provided further that the onus of proof that the citizen, soldier has. not been discharged for this reason lies upon the employer. The opinion was expressed at the time this section was passed that it would be found to be inoperative, but I can assure honorable senators that I do not know of a single case of a prosecution under the section in which we have not succeeded in having the employer fined. Of course, every case reported is sent on to the Crown Law authorities to say whether a prosecution would be likely to be successful. An important point has arisen for consideration. The citizen soldier discharged for having attended his military duties suffers the loss of his employment, and it is no recompense to him that his employer should be fined. He loses his employment and his wages, and may for some time be out of work. We consider that in such a case the Minister should have power to direct that the whole or any portion of the fine imposed upon an employer under the section should be paid to the soldier to recompense him for the loss of his employment. These cases are Vied before stipendiary magistrates, and when such Courts find that a soldier has been discharged from his employment by reason of the fact that he has absented himself for the purpose of carrying out duties which he is compelled by law to perform, we think it is not unreasonable that the Minister should have power to say, if- a fine is recorded against the employer, &#34; This man lost three weeks&#39; wages, and I award him so much of the fine imposed upon his employer as amounts to three weeks&#39; wages.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The employer in such a case may be fined up to &#163;100 under the section. The highest fine I know to have been recorded was &#163;50, and usually the fine imposed has been &#163;25. The practical operation of the section at present is that both employer and employe are punished. The employer is fined for discharging his employe, and the employe is penalized by the loss of his employment for faithfully carrying out his military duties. We do not think that that should be so. Where it is proved that a man has been discharged from his employment because of his attendance in the performance of his military duties, he certainly should not suffer. It is generally regarded as a vicious&#39; principle that a private person should benefit pecuniarily as the result of the prosecution of another person by the Government. Lawmakers generally set their faces against provisions having that effect, because it is said that they have a tendency to encourage bogus prosecutions and tha getting up of faked cases. But in cases arising under this section, the military authorities first satisfy themselves that there is a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case. The papers are then sent on to the Crown Law officers, who go into them, and recommend whether a prosecution should follow or not. I do not know whether honorable senators will consider an adjournment of the debate on the second reading of this Bill necessary. I spoke to the Leader of the Opposition on the subject; he had a copy of the Bill, and he told me he did not see that there was anything in the Bill that necessitated delay in passing it. If honorable senators are prepared too go on with the consideration of the Bill now, I shall be pleased ; but if they require an adjournment of the debate, I shall raise no objection. </para>

                        (Tasmania) &#163;11.21&#93;. - I have just heard the assurance of the Minister that he had a conversation with the Loader of the Opposition with regard to the passage of the Bill. I had not an opportunity of seeing, the Leader of the Opposition before he was recalled to Sydney, but I can- quite understand his saying that he saw no reason for an adjournment of the debate on the second reading. It rests with the Senate to say whether the measure shall be proceeded with now, or the debate adjourned.

                        <para>- I was going to remark that the Bill would not be passed through all its stages to-day, and if there should appear to be any necessity for the reconsideration of any points in connexion with it, they can be dealt with at the third -reading stage next week. I saw the Bill for the first time this morning, when I received it with my papers. I have listened carefully to what the Minister said in moving the second reading, and so far as I have been able to look through the Bill in conjunction with the Defence Act 1903-14, there appears to be nothing in it demanding a lengthy consideration by the Senate. There is one clause, the purport of which I have not quite grasped. It refers to section 7 of a Defence Act we passed this session, and makes that section operative as from the first day of August last. As the session is still continuing, the Acts passed during the session have not yet been bound, but a loose copy of the Act  referred  to is obtainable. The Defence Act 1903-14 is the Defence Act as originally introduced, and amended up to date, and it requires some little search to ascertain how section 7 of the Act of this session affects that Act. It would seem that the clauses of this Bill are really machinery provisions found to be necessary to perfect, strengthen, and tighten the sections of the existing Defence Act. We are now actually engaged in war, and the provisions affected by these proposed amendments were drafted at a time when war was not immediately contemplated. I direct attention to the last matter to which the Minister referred, namely, the appropriation of penalties which may be imposed upon persons who prevent their employes from rendering military service. There is much to be said for the proposal to allow an employe discharged for attending his military duties to receive a portion of the penalty imposed in such a case upon his employer. I should like to suggest that when we come to deal with the clause referred to it would be well to consider whether the appropriation of the penalty or any portion of it, should rest with the Minister or with the Court which imposes the penalty. At first blush I am inclined to think that the Court is the better authority for determining the matter. If it rested with the Court to appropriate the penalty, or any portion of it, for the benefit of the employe prevented from rendering service, the Court would be able to take that fact and all facts into consideration when imposing the penalty. I make the suggestion in no spirit of hostility to the present or any other Minister of Defence, but I should like honorable senators to seriously consider whether the Court imposing the penalty would not be the better authority to determine the matter. </para>

                            <para>- In some cases it is provided, for instance, that half the penalty imposed shall go to the informant. I think there are cases in which the Courts determine whether the penalty, or a portion of it, shall be allotted to the injured person or the informant, as the case may be. The matter is one of detail, but before the measure is finally dealt with I hope that the Minister and the Attorney-General&#39;s Department will give it consideration. If the course I suggest were followed I point out that it would at least relieve the Minister of what, in some cases, might be considered an invidious duty. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me to be a strange omission in the principal Act that it does not include powers to survey land which we may require to use for military purposes. I suppose that the fact that we are now engaged in war accounts for the discovery of this omission. No one will object to give the fullest powers necessary for the proper carrying out of all defence operations. I am pleased to hear that the Government has taken action to compel members of the Expeditionary Forces who have gone abroad to make some provision for those whom they have left behind and who were dependent upon them. I hope that the appropriation of the wages of members of the Expeditionary Forces will not be confined to the rank and file. I trust that men in higher positions in the service will be compelled to do their duty towards those they have left behind them, especially in the case of wives and children. </para>

The only complaint that I have had has been against the Department for the inconsistent treatment of rankers and officers, notably, in the case of a major who went away with one of the contingents. This case is a perfect scandal in Perth - one of the most scandalous possible. I have applied to the Defence Department to get bare justice for the wife and children, but have absolutely failed. This officer left a wife and three children, who are actually living on the charity of neighbours, and of the clergyman of the denomination to which the wife belongs. She has been sick, and I have had medical certificates to that effect, which I have sent to the Defence Department, with the testimony of men occupying high positions in Perth, and all the satisfaction that I could get from the Department was that, as the major had left no authority behind him- </para>

No matter what allocation order was left, the Department had no right to ignore the claims of the wife and children. It is scandalous that any woman in <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Mills&#39;</inline> position should be actually living on the charity of neighbours and of her clergyman. </para>

                            <para>- I have read the clause and would prefer that the honorable senator should tell me something I do not know. I hope that the major and others of his type will be compelled to do the right thing by their families. The Minister has admitted taking the law into his own hands in other cases, whether he had legal authority to act or not, and I was therefore the more surprised to get a communication from him <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the effect that as this officer had not given any legal authority for payment to be made to his wife, the solicitor of the Department had advised that nothing should be done, for otherwise the Government would be held responsible for any money they might give away. Why should an officer&#39;s money be held sacred in that way, when the money of other men in the contingents has been distributed according to the Minister&#39;s will? </para>

                            <para>- If this man had not been drawing such good pay, I could have understood the excuse being made that he had not enough to distribute amongst so many, hut it is utterly wrong for a man drawing such a good &#34; screw &#34; to refuse to make any provision for his wife simply because he may have had a difference of opinion or quarrel with her. Even if he had, he could have no quarrel with his children, who certainly should not be dependent upon the charity of the public while their father is drawing a good salary from the taxpayers, and he and his sister are allowed to do what they like with it. The case was of sufficient gravity for the Department to take the law into its own hands and distribute the man&#39;s pay in a different way. I am glad the Government now see the necessity for legal authority to deal with such a case. </para>

                            <para>- That provision is sufficiently comprehensive to extend to very distant relatives, to say nothing of the wife and children of any member of the Expeditionary Forces. I certainly hope we shall see justice done. I am surprised indeed that when the Minister has dealt in a different way with other cases, a glaring case of this kind should have been so persistently ignored by him when the matter was brought before him. </para>

                            <para>- I am not alluding to that in any way. The honorable senator was addressing another honorable senator directly,&#39; a practice which is contrary to the Standing Orders. If that were allowed, the debate might tend to become a squabble between honorable senators. The Standing Orders clearly provide that an honorable senator must address his remarks to the Chair, and through the Chair to other honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- If I have transgressed the rules or ruffled your feelings by the manner in which I have spoken, I am very sorry. A gross injustice has been done in the case I have put before the Chamber, and I have a perfect right to let the public know it. I have failed to get the matter righted by correspondence. Responsible people in Western Australia have handed me full particulars and proofs of the statements I have made. . I have statements from the doctor attending the wife, from the clergyman who is looking after the wants of the family, and from the lawyer who is interested in the case; yet I have failed to get justice done. The method I have now adopted is the only one available to me to ventilate a case of this kind, and I am simply doing my duty in bringing it forward publicly. If there is no power in the hands of the Minister to do the barest justice, to insist on members of the Forces who go abroad making provision for their helpless dependants - and in this case all that was asked for was enough to provide the bare necessaries of life for a delicate wife and young family - the sooner we give that power the better. </para>

                        <para>. - I am quite certain thai every honorable senator will sympathize with the case which has been brought under our notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. It is a gross scandal that a member of our Expeditionary Forces should be able to do what is alleged to have been done by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Mills.</inline> But I think we should only be raising false hopes if we imagined for a moment that that case would be covered by clause 6 of this Bill. The Minister, by way of interjection, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was speaking, made his position in this matter abundantly clear. He has exercised his undoubted powers in cases in which men who have gone to the front have left no allocation orders at all. But in cases in which men who have enlisted have expressly directed that their wages shall be paid to certain individuals, I do not think there is any law which can empower the Minister to ignore such direction. It may be true that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Mills</inline> has practically deserted his wife and three children. It may be - as has been affirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie - that he lias ordered his wages to be paid to some relative other than his wife. But the Minister has no authority to nullify that order and direct that the money due to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Mills</inline> shall be paid to the woman who is declared to be his wife for her maintenance and that of her children. To assume that this Bill contains provision under which such an injustice can be remedied would be only to raise false hopes. </para>

                        I am very sorry that the Minister has no power to meet such  cases as that which has been brought forward. I have no personal knowledge of the facts, but from the statements which have been made I am bound to believe that the case is an extremely hard one. I am willing to do anything in my power to tighten up the provisions which govern the action of the Minister in such circumstances. But my interjections were intended to convey that I do not think the Minister, under existing regulations, can allocate to himself the duties of a judge as between a member of our Expeditionary Forces and his wife.

Any man acting in that way may be a very bad citizen, but that does not justify us in imposing on the Minister the duty of acting as an arbiter in such cases. If we accept for service abroad a married man who has a family  dependent upon him, and who leaves definite instructions that all moneys payable to him shall be allocated in a certain way, are we going to authorize the Minister to override his directions? I say no. If an injustice will be inflicted on a wife or family by accepting a mau for service in our Expeditionary Forces, we ought not to enlist him. </para>

In moving the second reading of this Bill, I understood the Minister to say that provision had already been made under which any person serving with the colours could allocate his wages to anybody whom he selected to receive thom. But, in reply to an interjection drawn from him by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I gathered that it also authorized him to deal with cases such as that which is now under review. </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill is, I am sure, more or less a military necessity, and in that respect is unimpeachable. I intend to offer no opposition to it, but it affords me an opportunity of making a few remarks upon clause 6. I suppose that when a man gets a fixed idea in his mind he can scarcely resist ventilating it upon, every conceivable occasion. But, notwithstanding that I may be charged with entertaining a fixed idea in regard to military service, I feel that I would be lacking in my duty if I did not say something upon the question of enlisting married men. When our first Expeditionary Force was being recruited, I took exception to the manner in which married men were being taken from the ranks of our Australian population. Some time ago I asked the Minister of Defence if he could inform me what was the percentage of married men who had enlisted as part of the first Expeditionary Force. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true. At that time I formed the opinion that many men had enlisted as single men when, as a matter of fact, they were married; and the sequel has demonstrated that this was so. The discussion has also proved how injudicious it was to enlist so many married men as members of our overseas Forces. We are bound to have some married men in our Forces, and I do not think that the principle of not using married men at all, especially wb&#171;n they possess sound military knowledge, should be insisted upon. I know that many officers with family responsibilities were in a position to make satisfactory provision for those left behind, irrespective of the fact that they were in receipt of military pay. Notwithstanding that I have no English blood in my veins - I have some British blood - I am as strongly desirous of British supremacy as any other member of this National Legislature. I confess, however, that I have systematically dissuaded married men from enlisting; and, on the other hand, I have done all I possibly could to encourage single men to become members of the Expeditionary Forces in the service of their country. Apart from the fact that an unsatisfactory position is sometimes likely to arise in the allocation of pay for the dependants of married men remaining in Australia, it is impolitic that we should have such a large number of married men in the Forces, because of the probability that this course is likely, sometimes, to bring about an undesirable state of affairs in respect to the greatest of all social relationships. I simply wish to stress the arguments which I used at considerable length two or three days ago, in order that honorable senators will see the undesirability, from a social and economic stand-point, of enlisting married men for overseas service. Of course, if Australia is attacked at any time it will then be the obligation of every man, whether married or single, to do his best in that sphere which might be allocated to him under military law. I pointed out a few days ago that we have 500,000 single men of military age in the Commonwealth, and, in view of that fact, I hope that some step will be taken to check what I regard as a bad policy, the systematic enlistment of married men, more particularly as we are enlisting our Forces rather leisurely, and are preparing them still more leisurely, for the front. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> suggestion to invest the Court with power to allocate money, but 1 can certainly see very great possibilities of the Minister being put into a difficult position. The case brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is entirely different to the position I outlined when moving the second reading of the Bill. I was dealing there with the case of soldiers who had made no allocation of their money ; and in the case quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie it has been shown that the officer had made an allocation. It has to be remembered that the pay of the officer or of a soldier is his own property. It- belongs to him by right of his contract with the Defence authorities. </para>

                            <para>- Probably that is so; but, as I have said, under the contract between the Government and the soldier, the pay belongs to the soldier just, as our salary as members of Parliament is ours. When asked to make his allocation order for dependants in Australia, he has a right to allocate his money in any way he thinks fit. In this particular case, it is not desirable that we should go into that part of it which concerns only the man and his wife. I understand there has been a dispute of longstanding between the two, as the result of which they are not living togetherThe officer, in allocating his pay to his sister, made the further statement that it was to be paid to his sister on behalf of his wife and children, so that they should be provided for. Now, it appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says that we should set aside that order and that I, as Minister of Defence, should be the judge, and take upon myself the responsibility of allocating the money to his wife. If I did that in this case, I would have to do it in other similar cases, and therefore I would constitute myself a judge of matrimonial causes. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and that is the reason for this Bill. The difference between the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and the others to which I refer is very clear. In the latter cases we had authority in the letters written by the men to their wives, which would probably be acknowledged by the men themselves. They could not dispute them. There was another case in which we had an order of the Court. In the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, the woman had the power to sue her husband for maintenance before he joined the Military Forces, and if an order for maintenance were given, we should observe it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, if the allocation order is against the spirit of the regulation. That is to say, in the case of a dispute between the husband and wife, it is undoubtedly the husband&#39;s duty to contribute to the support of the children though the wife may have done something to put herself outside all claims upon her husband. There may be cases in which the husband has not left money to his children, and, if so, the Minister would be justified in seeing that the children are provided for. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the debate on the Ministerial statement has been fairly well threshed out, but I desire to offer a few remarks to the Senate. First, let me congratulate the Prime Minister and his colleagues upon the very capable manner in which they have handled the affairs of Australia in the most unparalleled stress which, so far, we have had to face. According to their own statement, and I think according to the opinion of a majority of the people of Australia, if not of all, the Government have done extremely well in securing the financial stability of the Commonwealth in undoubtedly a most serious situation. Therefore, I think that we may fairly congratulate Ministers upon having spared no pains and performed every duty requisite to the well being of this growing country. The magnitude of the work which has been performed by the Government, and the efforts which have been put forward by Australians generally, have been fully recognised throughout the civilized world. Of course, we must make an exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> I admit that he had a sort of complaint to level against Australia in regard to what might be called the general apathy she had shown towards the position as it now presents itself in the Empire. Were I to say that he actually complained, the probability is that he would deny my statement, and plead that he did not complain of Australia&#39;s failure to do something, but of Australia not having done just enough. That is, I think, the position he would take up. But the distinction between the two positions is so fine that I am inclined to regard his statement as, in a morbid way, a complaint against all concerned. I propose to quote an opinion expressed some time ago by an authority that I am sure </para>

                    will not repudiate. I refer to the London

                    It takes quite a different view of what Australia has done, and is doing, from that which was expressed by my honorable friend. According to the Sydney
                    <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>
                    of 20th April, the London

                <quote>
                    <para>We publish a remarkable list of the liberal gifts showered upon the joint committee of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St. John from all parts of the British Empire, and particularly from Australia. It is a record which must appeal vividly to all who have sufficient imagination to perceive what lies behind an imposing column of figures and a varied list of commodities. The three thousand odd bales and cases of hospital stores and clothing represent between 40 and 50 consignments sent at various times and from many parts of the Australian Commonwealth. Thousands of blankets and pillows, bandages, splints, crutches, and even safety pins show that not only a spirit of unstinting generosity, but an immense amount of careful thought, has gone to the choice of the gifts. </para>
                    <para>But Australia has not stopped there. Her richest industries have contributed each in its kind. A thousand carcases of frozen mutton, 1,079 crates of rabbits, 10 tons of butter, groceries, wines have been shipped to the stores department of the Red Cross, in order that, after the direct needs of the hospitals have been supplied, those goods not required for consumption in the hospitals might be sold to swell the funds of the joint committee. Other countries have contributed similarly according to their means. Egypt sends cigarettes; South Africa offers grapes as well as clothing. The isles also have brought gifts. Guava jelly from Montserrat, honey and walking-sticks from Jamaica, oranges from Dominica, Malta, and Trinidad - they pile up a wonderful miscellany of good and useful things. We may well take pride in the spirit of helpfulness which has produced so remarkable a result, and, while our gratitude goes out to all who have taken part in it, we would pay a special tribute of admiration to the signal effort of Australia. </para>

                    Up to that time &#163;119,136 had been contributed from Australia and .the oversea Dominions, and out of that sum the total received from the Commonwealth was &#163;72,609. The schedule includes, in addition to Australia, no less than thirteen other oversea Dominions in the British Empire.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline>
                    believes that we should have done a great deal more than we have done, but it is evident that other people consider that we have done excellently. .We have, in fact, accomplished a great deal. I have now to refer to the matter which was really underlying
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline>
                    complaint. He has told us that he believes in the principle of conscription. The honorable senator would conscribe every single man in Australia physically fit to perform military duty. I hope that there is no other man in Australia who favours the adoption of such a course. I believe that there is sufficient manhood and patriotism in the British race to make it unnecessary ever to adopt so barbarous a principle. We are in Australia providing by law for the compulsory military training of our youth. We are teaching them how to handle a gun and something of the art of warfare. When we have done that I have no fear that the British race in Australia has so deteriorated that our people will be found unwilling to face any foe in the defence of a righteous and legitimate cause. It is so that the whole of the people of the British Empire regard the cause for which they are fighting to-day, and in the defence of which they are prepared to expend not merely their last shilling, but their last man. We have been informed by the statement read by the Minister of Defence that over 70,000 of the manhood of Australia have been sent to the front, or are being prepared to go to the front. That is no inconsiderable proportion of our small population, and I have no doubt that the number can be brought up to 100,000 if necessary in the near future. I hope that the war will not continue much longer, but if it does, I. am satisfied that our trainees will show that they have the pluck and the patriotism to volunteer their services iD the defence of the Empire. Australia has done well up to the present, and has in fact done all that she could do. I have no doubt that she will continue to do equally well until the war is at an end. I should like to refer to what
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline>
                    had to say as to the wages paid to our soldiers. He has told us that we might do better than we have done if we paid our ment  ls. 2d. per day, which is the price put upon the services of the British soldier. The British soldier is a very cheap man.

                        <para>- It is not a question of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George finding the money at all; the money is there. The industries are there, and they are finding the money out of the toil of the working people. I am glad that the Government, at no very distant date, propose to submit for our consideration a revision of the Tariff. The war should provide Australians with a very salutary lesson. It should show us the absolute necessity of utilizing every resource we have to make Australia a self-dependent country. When the Tariff comes before us for consideration, I shall on every occasion endeavour to have everything which is not produced in Australia placed upon the absolutely free list; but on the other hand I shall do all that lays in my power to impose as nearly as possible prohibitive duties upon everything that can be made in Australia. The war has shown us that we are in about the most dependent position that a country could be in. Where should we have been a few days after the war broke out if we were still paying a subsidy to the Old Country for the naval and military protection of the Commonwealth ? We should have had German rule in Australia, the German flag would probably have been hoisted over Sydney, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> would have been made a prisoner, because it is a certainty that that flag would have been hoisted there. </para>

                        <para>- They watched the Falkland Islands, and did it very well; but I maintain that Australia would have been in a helpless position if she had not made provision for the day that actually came. It certainly would have been better, as we all know now, if we had begun ten or twelve years ago ; but we made a commencement sufficiently early to enable us to prove ourselves of very salutary service to the Empire. Having accomplished that, our next need is to be able to make from our own raw material in our own factories every warlike requirement. We have the raw material and the men, and all that is necessary is to establish the industries, so that if any other disturbance of the kind takes place overseas we shall not have to look round to ascertain what material we are likely . to. be short of, but will be in a position of security. </para>

I am quite satisfied that all that we need is an industrial development that will make Australia what it ought to be - self-contained and independent. Nature has magnificently provided us with resources, and all that we have to do now is to take advantage of them and make Australia what it should and will be - a country fitted for Australians. </para>

I hope they will come up next week. There are two or three Bills dealing with war matters that the Government desire to get through as soon as possible, and I trust, therefore, that honorable senators will pardon us for calling them together for only two days next week. It must be done in case those Bills are ready. </para>

                        <para>. - In speaking to the question that the Ministerial statement be printed, I made certain references to the manner in which the members of the Permanent Forces were denied that promotion in rank and payment in the shape of salary to which their qualifications and long service entitled them. I made special reference to one particular case, and the facts I adduced in support of it were contested by the Minister. I said that an appointment of, not only an absurd and stupid, but of an unjust, character had been made of a certain individual to take charge of the concentration camp at Claremont, in Tasmania. The Minister denied that any such mistake had been made. I further said that the appointment had been made in opposition to the recommendation of the Commandant. The Minister of Defence denied that the appointment had been so made. </para>

                            <para>- Without making any  reflection  upon those who are charged with, the official recording- of honorable sena-. tors&#39; speeches, I may say that on reading one honorable senator&#39;s speech recently I- found myself credited with making an interjection, although I was not in the chamber at the time. My mind is quite clear that at the time I made this statement the Minister contested the view I |&#62;ut forward. </para>

Notwithstanding the Minister&#39;s attempt to haul me off the track, I want to read this letter to the Senate to show what justification there was for giving this gentleman the position of captain over members of the Administrative and Instructional Staff, and what further justification there could have been for placing him in absolute charge of the camp. That is the position which the Minister of Defence wants to justify. Colonel W. J. Clark, Commandant of Tasmania, wrote on 8th January, 1915, as follows: - </para>

I desire to conclude my quotation of that letter, and I am afraid that I shall then have to leave the subject until another day, as I am anxious to catch a steamer to Tasmania at 3 o&#39;clock. But there are several other phases of this question which I desire to put before the Minister, who, I feel certain, has not had a number of the letters which are included in the official file of papers brought under his notice. The Commandant of Tasmania went on to say - </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister is determined to split straws, and to shield his subordinate officers, who are responsible for this gross act of injustice, he is entitled to all the consolation he can get from his attitude. I know that when I resume my seat this discussion will cease, but I am particularly anxious to resume it at the earliest possible moment. In these circumstances, may I ask that the papers from which I wish to quote may be retained in the custody of the Senate until such time as the matter has been disposed of? </para>

But the honorable senator threatened some time ago that he intended to make my position uncomfortable during this session, and I suppose that these are part of the tactics which he chooses to employ. They represent a commencement, I presume, of what I. may expect during the session. But this matter having been brought forward, I must, in justice to myself, reply to the statements that have been made. On page 2379 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the current session <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> original statement appears. It reads - </para>

                    <para>To-day the honorable senator has been dealing with the promotion of Captain Payne from the rank of lieutenant, which he affirms was in opposition to the recommendation of the Commandant of Tasmania. It will thus be seen that his original statement deals with quite another matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> did not inform me of his intention to raise this question to-day, and consequently in the statement which I am about to make I shall have to rely on the memory of those who have been dealing with it. When I sent my secretary to the Library for the papers relating to this matter, I found that they had been taken out of the Library. I was under the impression that nobody was allowed to take papers from the Library unless for the purpose of bringing them into either branch of this Parliament. But the papers to which I refer were not in the Library last night or this morning. I sent my secretary for them, not because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> had told me that he intended to bring this matter before the Senate, but because of his threat to make my Ministerial position uncomfortable. Now the fact is that, owing to some instructional officers having been attached to the Australian Expeditionary Forces, the Department has had to adopt the system of getting quite a number of militia officers to temporarily fill their positions. Lieutenant Payne was in the militia, and consequently was not a permanent officer. The first question which arose was as to the appointment of a temporary officer on the Administrative and Instructional Staff. At that time the question of the command of the camp at Claremont, near Hobart, had not been raised. The authorities wished to strengthen the Administrative and Instructional Staff by filling up the gaps which had been created by the departure for the front of a number of permanent officers. The Commandant was asked whether he would recommend Captain Payne. He said that he would not recommend him as a captain temporarily on the Administrative and Instructional Staff unless Lieutenants Tackaberry and Davis - who. were not temporary, but permanent officers - were promoted to the position of captains. Honorable senators are well aware that the militia officers take rank in their regiments. The permanent officers are on a list by themselves, which is entirely distinct from the militia regiments. The promotion of permanent officers is governed by the vacancies which arise from time to time on the permanent officers&#39; list. </para>

                            <para>- If he held a higher rank he would, but not otherwise. The conditions governing promotions are entirely different. In the militia regiment in which Payne happened to be, the conditions governing his promotion were that a vacancy occurred in the regiment, and that he had passed an examination and was most qualified to fill that vacancy. When he had fulfilled these conditions he was entitled to promotion. His promotion did not hinge on that of anybody else. If he w&#171;re promoted nobody on the permanent list would be injured thereby. His promotion did not give him any prior claim over them, or in any way interfere with their rights. The Commandant took up the position that Payne should not be placed on the Instructional Staff unless these other permanent officers were promoted to the rank of captain. In that the Commandant was absolutely wrong. </para>

                            <para>- He knew it, because he proposed that they should be given only temporary rank. He had only to look at the list to see that there was no vacancy. He knew that the Government had promised the officers who had gone to the front that their positions would be kept open to them. The Adjutant-General, who deals with such questions, refused to do as the Commandant recommended. He refused to promote these two members of the Permanent Forces as a condition precedent to appointing Payne to the Administrative and Instructional Staff. But Payne had passed his examination for the rank of captain. He was eligible for appointment in that capacity, and when he was asked to accept the  appointment with a lieutenant&#39;s pay and rank, he refused to do so. He said in effect, &#34; I have passed my examination. I have been promoted to the rank of captain, and if you require my services I have a right to the pay which is due to ray rank.&#34; Then he was appointed to the Administrative and Instructional Staff - to fill a position until the war has ended, or until the permanent officer returns. He was appointed with the pay of his rank. Lieutenants Tackaberry and Davis, two permanent officers, knowing what the Commandant had stipulated, protested against Payne&#39;s appointment to the Administrative and Instructional Staff with the rank of captain. Their appeal came before the member of the Military Board whose province it is to deal with such appeals. The Adjutant-General promptly ruled out their appeal, as he was perfectly entitled to do. As he pointed out, Payne&#39;s appointment is a temporary one, whereas the other two officers are permanent officers, whose positions are not affected by his appointment in the slightest degree. </para>

                            <para>- In that case every one of our permanent officers would have to be moved up temporarily. Then, when the officers whose positions they were filling returned from the war, they would have to be moved down again. Instead of doing that, we have adopted the principle of filling their places temporarily with militia officers. I would remind honorable senators that our Army is a citizen army, and that a militia officer has just as much right to he considered as has a permanent officer. These militia officers have qualified - they have passed their examinations for these positions - and why should such offices be filled temporarily with permanent officers, thus compelling militia officers, if they come in, to come in at the bottom ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. No permanent appointment is being made at all. Captain Payne is now connected with the Instructional Staff, and when an officer was wanted to take charge of the Claremont Camp in Tasmania, the Commandant himself then recommended - Captain Payne for the position. The file will show this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> said that we put Captain Payne in charge of the camp against the recommendation of the Commandant, but he is confusing two things. The Commandant did recommend the appointment as I have said, but that had reference to his appointment on the Instructional Staff, and when he was there it was on the recommendation of the Commandant himself that Captain Payne was put in charge of the camp. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> statement is wrong. It is not splitting straws to separate these two questions, because they are entirely distinct one from the other. One was Captain Payne&#39;s appointment to the Instructional Staff, in which the Adjutant-General did not accept the condition laid down by the Commandant. The Commandant said that Captain Payne ought to be appointed, subject to certain conditions concerning the two other officers. In Captain Payne&#39;s appointment to the Claremont camp, there was no difference between the Commandant and members of the Military Board. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> seems to be under the impression that something was done to hurry up Captain Payne&#39;s promotion in order to get this position for him, but that was not so. He was due for promotion in the ordinary course of events; it was his right under the regulations, and we should have had to strain the regulations to prevent him getting his promotion. There was a vacancy, he had qualified, he was the senior officer in his regiment, and was due for promotion. Now I only want to say a few more words, in conclusion, concerning this matter. There is room for a genuine difference of opinion as to whether it is wise to do what we are doing, moving militia officers up to fill these vacancies, or whether it is best to move up the permanent officers. There are objections to both courses, but I do say that, because there is room for a difference of opinion, there should be no imputation about favoritism, or anything of that kind. I think the results are showing that the course we adopted is working very well. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> cannot see eye to eye with me on this matter, the Government should not be charged with favoritism, or anything of that character. It is not worthy of the honorable senator to make such a charge. Looking at the facts as I have given them - and I have every reason to believe that they are correct - I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> would have been better advised not to have brought the matter before the Senate. </para>
