                        <para>- Has the Minister of Defence seen a statement in the press this morning that the Prime Minister has asked the State Government whether they are prepared to make concessions in the railway fares charged to members of the Expeditionary Forces, and that the Railway Commissioners have intimated that they are not prepared to move further until they are supplied with information as to what is really wanted? They are now awaiting the receipt of that information. They express a desire to meet the wishes of the Commonwealth when they know definitely what its wishes are, and conclude by saying that they decline to accept any blame for the delay in granting cheap fares. If the Minister has seen the paragraph, does he feel disposed to make a statement on the subject! </para>

                            <para>- I read the paragraph this morning with some surprise, because I gave an instruction that the Prime Minister, was to be asked to approach the State Governments on this matter some time ago, and I naturally concluded that all things necessary, bo far as the Department itself was concerned, had been done. On seeing the paragraph this morning, I cut it out at once, asked why the instruction had not been carried out, and directed that it should be attended to at once. </para>

                                <para>- I remind the honorable senator that it is necessary, not only for myself, but also for the officers of the Department, to 1 go to sleep occasionally. Since I had the pleasure of listening to the honorable senator I have been engaged in that restful occupation, but immediately I reached my office this morning I sent on at once the particulars -which he had supplied to me, and gave an instruction that inquiries were to be made. That, I remind the honorable senator, means that the papers have to be sent to Brisbane, where the camp is, and also that the information has to be sent to  its  Postmaster-General, with a request that .be will have inquiries made. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and the expenditure has been authorized by Parliament. Of course, it is highly undesirable that Appropriation Bills should be brought forward even late in the financial year, and it is still more undesirable that they should &#39;be brought forward after the financial year has closed. But I am sure that honorable senators will not lay any blame for this procedure at the door of the present Government. As a matter of fact, it is due to circumstances over which they had no control whatever. As honorable senators are aware, the general elections took place about the time when Parliament is usually engaged in discussing the Estimates, and the formation of a new Government, with the subsequent happenings, have prevented the possibility of Parliament dealing with the Estimates in the ordinary way. I think, however, that I should seize this opportunity to place on record certain information arising out of the last financial year which will prove of interest to honorable senators, and for that purpose I propose to read a&#39; statement. The total revenue received during the year was &#163;22,364,264. This sum was &#163;623,841 more than was received during the previous year, and &#163;908,736 less than the estimate. The Customs and Excise revenue totalled &#163;14,871,569, which was &#163;610,569 in excess of the estimate. The Post and Telegraph revenue was &#163;4,586,245, or &#163;20,245 above the estimate. The unimproved land tax returned &#163;1,953,388, which was &#163;746,612 less than the estimate. I may say, by way of explanation, that this deficiency is due to the fact that when the estimate was made up it was anticipated that the increased receipts under the progressive land tax would be derived during the last financial year. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say offhand. The figures I have given do not imply that the estimate would have proved wrong in a normal year. But it was wrongly based, because although the estimated amount of liability to taxation was fairly correct, the anticipation that the increased revenue would be received during the remaining months of the financial year was&#39; incorrect. </para>

                        <para>- Not all of last year&#39;s payments, but about &#163;700,000 of them. Probate and succession duties yielded &#163;39,450, and the estimate was &#163;1,000,000. The same explanation applies to this item. There we have an asset which has been carried forward into the present financial year. Of course, the estimate in this case cannot be made with the same degree of certainty as it can be made in the case of the land tax. In addition to the revenue of &#163;22,364,264, we received a war loan from the British Government of &#163;14,100,000, and we issued Australian notes in aid of the revenue to the amount of &#163;658,504. The total funds available, not including the surplus brought forward, amounted to &#163;37,122,768, and the surplus brought forward from 1913-14 was &#163;1,222,401, making a total of &#163;38,345,169. On the expenditure side we expended the following : - Invalid and old-age pensions, &#163;2,703,090, being &#163;123,825 more than was expended during the previous year; maternity allowances, &#163;694,233, being &#163;19,333 in excess of the sum spent last year. On defence - ordinary services - the expenditure amounted to &#163;2,997,802 as compared with &#163;2,951,308 during the previous year. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. When the first 20,000 men were sent from Australia very few people thought that we should be able to put 100,000 men in the field, as we now find we are able to do. The expenditure on new works out of revenue, omitting Fleet construction, amounted to &#163;2,171,852, as compared with an expenditure for the previous year of &#163;2,546,045. To recapitulate : the surplus brought forward from 1913-14 amounted to &#163;1,202,401, and the revenue received during the year was &#163;22,364,264, making a total of &#163;23,586,665. The expenditure amounted to &#163;38,345,169, leaving a deficit on the 30th June, 1915, of &#163;14,758,504. This has been provided for by a loan from the British Government of &#163;14,100,000, and by treasury bills in aid of revenue to the amount&#39; of &#163;658,504, making a total of &#163;14,758,504. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will remember that we took authority to raise treasury bills which were purchased by the notes. Had it not been for the special war expenditure we should have closed the financial year with an accumulated surplus of &#163;347,678. The total loan expenditure, excluding the amount of &#163;658,504, paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, amounted to &#163;2,136,811. The total note issue on the 30th June, 1915, was approximately &#163;32,000,000. I should like to point out that when the Budget was presented it was estimated that we should require from the Australian Notes Fund in aid of revenue practically &#163;2,588,314, but the amount that was actually required, as I have already stated, was only &#163;658,504... </para>

                        <para>- I understand that we have so far received &#163;4,000,000 from the banks. In view of all the circumstances, I think we &#39; can say that this balance-sheet, though not as satisfactory as we should like, is as* good as could have been expected. In view of the unforeseen circumstances, &#39; the disturbing effect of the war upon the revenues of all countries, and the effect here also of a drought, which, in the case of some of the States, was quite unprecedented, we may congratulate ourselves that at the end of the financial year our position was no worse than is indicated by the figures I have given. In due time, and as early as possible, the Prime Minister will make his Budget speech, in which he will outline the position for the current financial year. </para>

                        <para>- What will be done will probably be that when the Government are asking Parliament for Supply the Prime Minister will, so far as he can, give an estimate of the revenue and expenditure for the current year. There .is one matter on which I consider it my duty, at this juncture, to inform the Senate as to the intentions of the Government. We have received from the Imperial Government a request, which I .understand has been made to the Governments of all the overseas Dominions, that we should endeavour during the coming&#39; year, as far as possible, to finance ourselves. That&#39; is easily stated, but I do not think that there are a great many people in Australia who quite realize what it involves. I believe I may say that since the inception of self-government in Australia there never has been a year when the Colonies before, or the States since Federation, have financed themselves. </para>

There are, of course, certain obligations which the Imperial Government has entered into with the Commonwealth Government, and which we have entered into with the States. Those obligations will be carried out, and, sn far as loan expenditure is concerned, they will provide for the States up to the end of November. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; about that. The Government and Parliament will have to face the position indicated by the request of the Imperial Government. It is an uncharted sea to  a certain extent, since we cannot say definitely what Australia can do. We all have unbounded faith in the resources of the Commonwealth, and this will be a test of those resources. We are going to be tested, not merely  as  to our ability to fight for the Empire, but as to our ability to find the sinews of war. That is a great and serious responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that it applies to borrowing by the States, as well as by the Commonwealth; that is to say, that if will not be possible for either the Common wealth or State Government to borrow in Great Britain during the current financial year. The Commonwealth Government intend to submit proposals for a loan. . It will be a war loan for &#163;20,000,000. It is proposed to put the loan on the market iii four instalments. The Government are acting upon the best available advice in Australia. The Prime Minister convened a conference of the leading banking authorities in the Commonwealth. He consulted them and sought the best financial advice he could&#39; get to insure their complete co-operation, and to be informed as to the most effective way to float the loan and the terms on which it should be floated. It is proposed that the loan shall be issued at par, and shall bear interest at 4| percent. ; that the inscribed stock shall be of &#163;100 denomination, and that bonds; shall be made available for an amount as low as &#163;10. </para>

                        <para>- Ten years. It might happen that when the first loan is put on the market more than is required will be subscribed. If so, it will, of course, be accepted, because it will not be a limited loan. Arrangements are being made which, I feel sure, will insure the successful flotation of the first instalment. We axe regarding this as a war loan, and, as such, it should be remembered that three-quarters of the money will be expended in Australia, on Australian material supplied by Australian people. Therefore, by placing the loan in instalments, when the first loan has been received&#39; and expended, that money will still be in Australia for investment. It -will not have left the Commonwealth, but will go back and circulate in the community, with the result that the Commonwealth will be in almost as good a position to place the second issue of the loan as it was to place the first issue. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. Our resources will be weakened to the extent that the money is spent outside the Commonwealth, because as we are not borrowing abroad we sn;11 1 not be able to bring in a great deal of money by that means. It is, I think, a satisfactory feature - if anything can be satisfactory in Connexion with war expenditure - that so much of it will be spent in Australia. Take the question of equipment; practically the whole of it is being made in Australia to-day. Then there is the payment to the troops, almost the whole of which remains in Australia, because, when the soldiers are away they draw only Is. per day, the remainder being; allocated to the relatives, or kept back as deferred pay. In the case of officers also, a great many have allocated a considerable part of their pay to relatives in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am only mentioning the matter to show that the greater part of the war expenditure is being retained in Australia, and as this loan will be devoted to war expenditure, the money will still be in the Commonwealth and available for investment. A great leakage in this respect will be due to transports which go oversea. Many of them are hired overseas, and, of course, are a very heavy source of expenditure, so that a great deal of money will have to go out on that account. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; we must not lose sight of the fact, however, that during the last financial year the transports returned nearly a quarter of a million pounds in revenue, and I think that during the current year the income on this account will probably be over half-a-million 111On. We must recognise, of course, that till that will not be profit; but it will * be profit in the sense that in any case the ships would have been sent away, so in that respect there will be an&#39; income as a set-off on the&#39; expenditure account. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking from memory, the estimate for last year for transports was in the neighbourhood of&#34; &#163;2,000,000, and the revenue would, therefore, be about 12J per cent. I think that revenue will increase as we get better organized for dealing with freights. We have suffered in this matter just as the shipping companies must have suffered at the outset of the war, but as we are now&#39; getting into regular running, we are able to take shipping contracts and freightage in a better way than at the inception of the war.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan.</inline> - Will that income from freights go into the Consolidated Revenue or into a Suspense Account? </para>

                        <para>- It will go into the revenue as a set-off against the expenditure. Coming back to the loan, I may say that we are advised of the legal position of this stock, that it will be free of State income tax, and we propose to make it free also of Commonwealth income tax. There is one important question, the investment of trust funds, which is now the subject of negotiation between the Commonwealth and the States, and we hope to arrive at a satisfactory solution of that at an early date. I thought it advisable that the Senate should be placed in possession of these facts with regard to the loan, because it undoubtedly will be a principal feature of our financial arrangements during the coming year. We all hope and believe that the optimism we entertain with regard to it will be justified by the results, for we must remember that if Australia can finance this war, or its share of the war, it will thereby assist the Mother Country just as truly as by sending men to the front, because, undoubtedly, the financial strain on the Mother Country is a very serious one. Incidentally I may say that there have been comments on the part Australia has been able to play in this war as compared with other Dominions and the Mother Country. A comparison has been made with regard to numbers sent away, but honorable senators should remember that whereas it costs us probably in the neighbourhood of a couple of hundred pounds - taking that as a unit - to deal with an individual soldier and place him in the field so many thousand miles away, it costs the United Kingdom, I should think, not more than &#163;50, because the Mother Country is close to the seat of war. Canada also is in somewhat the same position as the United Kingdom, but New Zealand is in the same position as Australia. It is most unfair, . therefore, merely to make a comparison between Australia and Canada, but even if a comparison were made of numbers, Australia does not suffer with any other Dominion of the Empire. As I said before, we cannot leave this financial question out of consideration if any comparison is to be made concerning the part Australia is playing in connexion with the war. I have much pleasure in. submitting the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - There will be a general assent to the Minister&#39;s financial statement. In view of all the circumstances, some of them of tremendous magnitude, it cannot be regarded as disappointing, but there are certain features of it which make it impossible for me to attempt with any seriousness to analyze the figures. The measure of revenue received is not to be judged by comparison with the figures of the  previous  year, because additional taxation has been imposed, and before any one could undertake anything like an analysis of the figures it would be necessary to divide them in order to ascertain to what extent the revenue has been inflated or maintained by additional taxation. </para>

                        <para>- Additional taxes have been imposed in the Customs Department which may always be accepted as an indication of the commercial activity of the community. That is one of the features rendering it inadvisable for me to attempt to analyze the figures now. I say that because I want to make our inability to enter into a thorough discussion of the financial position on this Appropriation Bill, enlightened as we are by the Minister&#39;s statement, the basis of a special appeal to him to make a little more liberal grant of time to honorable senators to consider it after we receive the new Supply Bill. We can sympathize with the pressure on the Government in bringing forward these measures, because the position and outlook&#39; are not normal, but we have made strong appeals before for a full opportunity to take our active part in the control of the finances, and should be afforded a more ample opportunity than we have had hitherto to consider the financial position when that Supply Bill comes up. The financial position consequent upon the war is undoubtedly serious. I do not say it is alarming, but the difficulties are there, they are grave, and the gravity is not lessened by the fact that the suggestion that Australia should proceed now to finance itself comes from the Imperial authorities. I have been rather surprised that they have not indicated before that one direction in which we can help them will be by helping ourselves financially. The fact that they have made the suggestion now indicates that, even if the immediate strain is not unduly oppressive, they look forward to the time when it will be wise for the financial burden to be distributed, a3 the military burden is now, over the various branches of the Empire. I have two suggestions to make to the Minister regarding the loan proposal. I am not quarrelling with the rate of 4&#163; per cent., but it is intended, from what has appeared in the press, to issue the loan not as a whole, but nominally in &#163;5,000,000 instalments, and if more than &#163;5,000,000 is offered the Government will take advantage of and use it. The Imperial authorities in issuing their recent loan gave those who applied first a guarantee that if later on loans were floated at a higher rate of interest, that higher rate would be made to. apply to the initial loan also. I suggest the same course here. The advantage is this. . If we ask first for &#163;5,000,000, and men with money are under the impression that interest will harden as the war goes on, they may be disposed to hold back their offerings m the belief that it will be necessary for the Government to fix a higher rate of interest on subsequent instalments. It is for the Government and their financial advisers to judge whether it would not improve the prospects of the loan to intimate when fixing the rate of interest that if circumstances compel the payment of a higher rate on later instalments, those who come in first will be placed on the same footing as those who come in last as regards interest. The other suggestion relates to the question of bonds. I was glad to receive the Minister&#39;s assurance that they will be issued, not only at a face value of &#163;10. but in multiples of &#163;10. </para>

                        <para>- I should think not. If I wanted to invest &#163;1,000 in inscribed stock I should expect to get ten certificates of &#163;100 each, and not one of &#163;1,000. On the other hand, there is no reason why bonds should be limited to &#163;10, because they are transferable like a bank note. It is not desirable to confine the bonds to the &#163;10 denomination. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that there would be much advantage in that. The difference between the interest on this loan and the Savings Bank interest is so slight on small amounts that it would probably be to the advantage of a man with &#163;5 to invest to deposit it in the Savings Bank; with the additional advantage of being able to withdraw it at any moment. Considering the circumstances of this country, &#163;.10 is a reasonably low minimum, but I suppose no one would object if the Government decided to make it lower. Five pounds in England corresponds with about &#163;10 here, because both the amount of currency which people handle here and their position generally, measured by financial figures, are superior to those of people at Home. </para>

                <para>The Minister, in reply to my question as to the earnings from shipping, said they went to reduce the expenditure. In a later reply to an honorable senator on his own side, he said the amounts were paid into the Consolidated Revenue. If so, it will be interesting to know whether they form portion of the revenue of &#163;22,364,000 to which he referred. </para>

                        <para>- If that is so, instead of a revenue of &#163;22,364,000, leaving out the war figures, it is -really three-quarters of a million worse than that. Because the amount which is now included, according to the statement, as being consolidated revenue, in my judgment, is quite inaccurately there. It ought not to be there as an addition to the Consolidated Revenue, but as a partial set off against the extraordinary expenditure. It makes these figures therefore three-quarters of a million less comforting than they otherwise would be. </para>

                        <para>- It is a misleading factor. When we have engaged the transports in connexion with the war, borrowed the money to pay for them, and are able in carrying on the transport service to earn something, it ought to be put down as a reduction of the war expenditure, and not as an addition to the Consolidated Revenue. It is quite an- extraordinary receipt. The fact that these  figures  show that the Department recognise that the expenditure on the war is extraordinary because they keep the figures separately, is a further confirmation of my statement that the sum of three-quarters of a million being also connected with the war, and an extraordinary receipt ought to be treated in the same way. </para>

                <para>Leaving those figures for the time being, .is I hope to have an opportunity of dealing with them on the Supply Bill, I desire to invite the attention of the Minister of Defence and the Senate to a few matters connected with the war. First, I deem it my duty to refer to the position of the men in camp as regards the rifle training they are receiving. It is disclosing no information, because it is known to everybody, to say that to-day the reinforcements in the camp and going to the front are quite insufficiently trained in the use of the rifle. It is alleged that some men have gone to the front without ever having put a rifle to their shoulder. </para>

                        <para>- Not now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN.</inline> - Men have not only been sent forward in certain units, but there is a practice which is quite  indefensible, though perhaps excusable as an expedient, and that is that when a unit, is about to embark, and it is found that there are any&#39; deserters, volunteers are called on to take their places. The new men are not drawn from the unit which is next in point of training, but from anywhere, and as the result of the proceeding men have gone away without the possibility of having any training. I wish to deal first with the question of rifle training. So far as my reading goes, limited though it may have been, I do not recollect any war in which it can be said that the individual rifleman has counted for more than he does at present. In spite of all that science and art are doing in the way of multiplying the mechanical instruments of destruction, we still read of the effect of perfect infantry fire, and we hear more of the  sniper in this war than probably we&#34; ever did before. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is more effective. Whatever may be the relative value of the rifle to-day as compared with its use in the last big war, it is at any rate the weapon with which the individual soldier is armed. Therefore, if we put a rifle into the hands of a man it is highly important that he should understand and have confidence in the use of the weapon. To send a man to the front and merely tell him that he need not bother about being able to use his rifle, because a machine gun operating somewhere else may be more effective, is a piece of foolishness which no sensible person would entertain for a moment. </para>

                        <para>- If I have inadvertently used the phrase &#34; to the front&#34; I have already stated that what I desire to draw attention to is the despatch from Australia of reinforcements of men who have not had adequate training, and in some cases no training, in the use of the rifle. It has been said that these men will not go to the front unless they have undergone a thorough course of rifle training. If by that statement is meant, the course which is applied to the Citizen Forces, it is totally insufficient. Men are returned as efficient who have simply marched on to the ground, fired fifty rounds in a certain time, and marched back again. The effect of such training on an average man is just to make him gun shy, and not to give him that confidence in the weapon which I assert is one of the most moral influences that could be brought to bear. </para>

                        <para>- Let me take a very simple illustration. I might explain the theory of driving a horse in a sulky to a man who has never had a pair of reins in his hands before, and ask him to drive down a busy street in Sydney alongside a man in another sulky who does know how to drive. The very element of confidence makes all the difference in the world in driving a vehicle through the streets of a busy city. The same thing applies with added effect when a man&#39;s life may depend upon the use he may make of the weapon with which he is armed. The mere knowledge that he can use his rifle when confronted with another man similarly armed has a considerable moral effect on the soldier. I am not bringing this matter forward in the way of criticism, but because it- seems to me to be a weakness in our present system that it should be easy to remedy. </para>

                        <para>- Some little time ago. when the question of rifle training came up for consideration, the Department adopted a suggestion which I now urge the Government to consider. It was recognised that the Instructional Staff would be heavily pressed with duties, and that their time would be fully occupied in other ways; also that many members of the Instructional Staff were not too well qualified to give instruction in rifle training, which involves a special knowledge. The suggestion was, therefore, put forward that the services of expert riflemen and others competent to give instruction in rifle practice should be utilized. </para>

                        <para>- I think that I am discharging a public duty in bringing under the notice of the Minister the fact that it was not being done even as late as last week in Sydney. Early in the war detachments from Liverpool were handed over for an hour or two a day to expert riflemen approved by the State Commandant, who undertook the duty of explaining the complicated mechanism of the modern military rifle. For some years I was able to hold my own with a sporting rifle against most people, but when a modern military rifle is- placed in my hands I have to ask the purpose of some of its little niceties, and how they are manipulated. The modern military rifle is a very complicated machine. However, that system to which I am referring was adopted for a few weeks, and then, without any explanation having been given to the rifle club authorities, it was dropped. The Minister says now that it is to be restored, but judging by the public utterance* of the officer in charge of the rifle clubs in New South Wales it was not being done on last Saturday week, because on that date this officer said, when the matter came up, that he would accept it as a duty to press the suggestion under the notice of the State Commandant. If any instruction had been issued on the subject he would not have bothered to carry to his superior officer a suggestion to do what was already being done. If the Minister has given the instruction, . showing that he is in sympathy with the suggestion, he has nothing more to do except to see that steps are taken to give effect to it. </para>

                        <para>- We are all pleased to realize that there is a prospect of securing a very fine harvest. Australia, with its large area, possesses this advantage, that even if there is a drought, or if prospects are not so bright in cue portion as they are elsewhere, there is generally some compensation in the shape of a good season in another portion of the continent. A little while ago, partly because of the failure of the last harvest, and partly on account of the war, special efforts were made in most of the States to increase the area under cultivation, so that, apart from the increased production per acre anticipated as the result of a bountiful season, there will be increased production on account of the increased area put under crop, and we may look forward to the task of having to garner and lift a harvest unparalleled in the history of Australia. At the same time, however, we are withdrawing from the ordinary labour market, by the voluntary action of those whose conduct we all admire - that is our recruits - a very large percentage of the most active labour of the community, and as we are confronted with the possibility of difficulty in this regard, it seems to me that we cannot too soon consider the question of our having to organize labour with which to lift the harvest. The rapidity with which the New South Wales wheat crop ripens is a factor which renders the prompt supply of labour all important. In many districts a delay of twenty-four hours may very often mean that a great portion of the grain will fall to the ground. In such districts the machine must be in the paddock to-day and out again to-morrow, otherwise very serious loss is entailed in the shedding of the grain. These circumstances necessitate the massing of considerable bodies of labour in certain districts within a short space of time. This is not the time nor the place to suggest the machinery that will overcome this difficulty, but it is a problem that we shall have to face. There is one way in which I think a considerable amount of help might be given. We know that a number of young farmers, not merely the sons of land-owners, but those who have for many years followed agricultural occupations, are anxious to enlist, but when they see the harvest coming on they are doubtful about doing so. Particularly is this the case with farmers&#39; sons. They realize that their families have lost very heavily  through  the failure of the last harvest, and when they see the prospect of getting a decent harvest this year, knowing that upon the result of the harvest depends the restoration of the fortunes of their families, they are naturally anxious to be available to help to reap it. Would it not be possible to allow these young men to enlist now, and get their training in July and August, and then give them leave until after the harvest, when they will return to the camps, and be in a position to go straight to the front? It has been said that we are doing as much to serve the Empire by providing its food supplies as in sending men to the front. The question of garnering this harvest is a serious problem, and, in my opinion, the Government cannot do wrong if they give kindly consideration to any suggestion that will tend to the satisfactory handling of it. What I am suggesting is not a cut and dried plan, but is one out of which some scheme might be evolved, enabling the farm labourers to enlist now on the understanding that they will be given leave for a certain number  of weeks in order that they may return to  their farms and reap the harvest. It may be said that these men should first get in the harvest and then enlist, but if that were done the two months now available for training would be lost. The only risk in taking men into the ranks now and training them for a period, and then giving them leave, is that some of them might do, as men now in the camps do, hot turn up again. But I do not think that the risk will be very heavy in the case of the class of men to whom I refer. </para>

                        <para>- This difficulty arises out of the war, and while the State Governments are the proper agents for dealing with the harvest, it is a matter that need not be limited to the State. Harvesting operations are earlier in one State than in another, and if something is done in the direction of Government organization of labour, it may be found necessary to transfer men from district to district and State to State. Having mentioned this matter, its seriousness will  probably  be recognised, and some scheme may be evolved. </para>

The suggestion was that they should be allowed to join now, so that they might proceed, with their training and that subsequently  they  should be permitted to return home to reap the harvest. </para>

                        <para>- One can sympathize&#39; with the feelings of these young men. The parental homes in which they are living have had many shadows thrown over them by the failure of the recent harvest, and naturally these men wish to do all that they can to insure the fullest benefits being derived from the coming harvest. I need scarcely remind the Minister that in England skilled men are being withdrawn from the fighting line in order that they may be placed in the factories. That being so, It does not seem a very serious step to allow these particular recruits to return to their homes a couple of months hence to complete an operation which, important as it is to themselves privately, is of considerable value to the community. </para>

                <para>Shortly after this war broke out, the idea was expressed in many quarters, and, amongst others, by members 01 the Government, that as Australia had hitherto obtained many articles from countries with which we are now. at war, an opportunity was afforded us of stimulating the local production of those articles. I recollect the Attorney-General expressing - I presume on behalf of the Government - a desire to stimulate such production by means of Government assistance. I recognise that the Ministry have been busy, but I am not at all sure that this very happy train of thought has been followed out. I have seen no evidence of a systematic examination of the position, or of any activity on the part of the Government, with a view to inducing the people to manufacture those commodities the supply of which previously came from enemy countries. </para>

                        <para>- That is covered by the Enemy Contracts Bill. I have here some figures which will show honorable senators that there have been diversions of trade going on, the consequences of which I cannot pretend to understand, but which certainly indicate the need for an inquiry such as I have suggested. Before giving these figures, I assume that every honorable senator will assent to the proposition that the war, having disorganized many centres of trade, offers Australia an opportunity to make good any deficiency in this connexion, and  that  it is a duty which we owe to our fellow citizens to point out to them avenues to which their energies may be profitably diverted. Let me take the export of sheepskins by way of illustration. They are sent out, some with the wool on, and some without. Prom July to December, 1913, we sent to America 330 skins with the wool on. These were worth only &#163;65. In the last half of last year we exported to America 204,637 skins, which were valued at &#163;47,684. These figures show a tremendous jump. </para>

Apparently the opportunities, which were previously utilized by Germany in connexion with these products, are now being exploited by other people. The export of sheepskins is not a singular instance, and I am suggesting that we should have a thorough examination into trade movements since the war began in. order that we may see whether we cannot stimulate local activity. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am not in a position to read into those figures more than I am entitled to read. They are chiefly instructive as showing how, after a brief lull when the war broke out, a rapid expansion took place: In July, 1914, the export of sheepskins to America was a little over 3,000. In August, it was 2,600; in September, it had jumped to 23,569, and in October, to 157,502. Whilst that was taking place the export to Germany was necessarily falling off. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned with that. I think that I am doing my duty in bringing this matter before the Senate. During the year ended 30th June, 1914, S&#39;7,533 sheep skins with wool on were exported to America. The following twelve months the quantity exported jumped to nearly 400,000. Another curious fact is that whilst the export of skins with the wool on, and without the wool, had increased, a distinct differentiation movement was in progress. In 1914 America took 87,533 with the wool on, and 125,529 without the wool In the following year her imports of skins with wool had increased to 389,549, whilst in the other case there had been only a slight increase, to 169,541 - an increase of 10 or 15 per cent. I am not going to suggest that the destination of these goods should be impugned. I do not know whether &#39; it should be or not. But we have the assertion. of the Attorney-General that, even in regard to zinc products, German influences still control&#34; the purchasing and distributing agencies.. </para>

I know this to be a very serious allegation to make, but it is  absolutely  true. Names have been changed, English names have taken the place of German names; but the German influence remains. It would be folly to assume that this influence has been exercised for the benefit of Great Britain. </para>

When the Enemy Contracts Bill was under consideration I ventured to suggest that there was a serious defect in it, and that defect is now becoming manifest. In the statement from which I have quoted, the Attorney-General said - </para>

The whole object and effect of the change of name is to enable those people to get something  which  they could not otherwise obtain. If, by changing their German names, firms are able to obtain Australian products which they could not secure but for the change of name, I say that they should not be allowed to obtain those products - change of name or no change of name. </para>

They say that this industry is largely a Belgian one. The British authorities naturally hesitate as to whether they are justified by Government action in taking, advantage of the position in Belgium, due to the war, to establish in England an industry which, remaining after the war is over, may rob Belgium of a very important source of national wealth. </para>

                        <para>- Its establishment is a much more important matter for Belgium than it is for France. Let me further remind the honorable senator that France to-day is not entirely in the hands of the conqueror. She might still, if she saw fit, develop her industries. Belgium is not in the same position. There is but . one little corner of Belgium that is not in German hands. I say that we are bound to pay a considerable measure of respect to the influence which has prevailed with the Imperial authorities to make them extremely cautious about taking action in this matter. The question whether we should go to the length of preventing the export of our products, unless we are absolutely certain as to what is done with them, is a matter entirely within our own discretion. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they are reconcilable, but one is complementary of the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> left out the very important statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now supplies, that we have the authority of the Imperial representative in the United States of America for the assurance that zinc products exported from Australia to America are utilized solely in the interests of Great Britain and her Allies. That statement, following upon the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> puts an entirely re-assuring aspect  on the matter. I am glad to have referred to the remarks made by the Attorney-General if only because it has led to the comforting assurance which the Minister of Defence has given. us. </para>

                    <para>. - Referring to the concluding remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I might question the reason given for the&#39; refusal of the Imperial Government to start in England an establishment for the utilization of metal products. There is an abundance of coal there, which is the raw material most required for such an industry, and the conditions- are most favorable for the expansion of a very small industry into a very big one. It is stated that the reason why the Imperial authorities hesitate to encourage the establishment of such an industry in England is that it would be calculated to injure an important industry which Belgium has hitherto had, arid would, in the circumstances, be unfair to Belgium. If we were to view every matter from that stand-point, we should do nothing to increase our industries in the Commonwealth. If we decided that Australian industries must remain stagnant because the expansion might be injurious to an industry which, for the time being, is wiped out in Belgium, we should do nothing. It is suggested that we cannot afford to do anything in this matter because it might divert trade from Belgium. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that we are living in extraordinary times; but, in view of the fact that the mercantile fleet of America is free, while those of other countries are tied up, we cannot wonder that there should be an increase of our  exportations  to the United States of America at the present time. At the present juncture, we can expect these fluctuations, because they are ordinary to the times in which we are living. We are anxious to do as much as we can in connexion with the present war, and while on this phase of the subject I wish to direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that .the permanent Secretary for the Department - the man who knows most about Defence affairs, as we understand them in Australia, the man under whose direction the Military Department is supposed to have grown; I refer to Colonel  Pethebridge  - was, shortly after the war broke out, appointed , to some position in an out-of-the-way place in Papua. To me, that seemed to be a most extraordinary appointment just when the war began, and when one would have thought that we required his- services very urgently indeed, because just then the Defence Department was being loaded with so much additional work arising out of the war. It seems extraordinary that at such a time his. services could have been dispensed with. </para>

                        <para>- That is a mystery, and a matter -I cannot understand. We know that we have in Papua a Lieutenant-Governor, in the person of Judge Murray, who, in my opinion, could very well have undertaken the duties for which Colonel  Pethebridge  was sent to Rabaul, namely, the taking over of the new territory. Instead of that, however, we find that the official head of the Defence Department was taken away from his duties, and sent to this out-of-the-way place in the tropics. It is all so extraordinary that I think we should have some explanation from the Minister. I understand that officer is at present in Melbourne, and I suggest that he be kept in this city, which is the headquarters of the Military Department, so that any officers who can be spared may be sent to the front, where their professional knowledge ought to be of some considerable service to the Empire. Now, referring to the matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> namely, the need for. labour to gather the coming harvest, it seems to me that we could follow the course adopted in the Old </para>

I understand that the same practice is to he followed in the coming harvest all over Europe, and that soldiers home for a spell will be employed in the harvest fields. When they return to the front they will be much improved by the change of occupation and better prepared for their work in the trenches. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true, and I suggest that the men who may be in training at the time could be employed in the harvest fields of Australia during that season. For many of them it will be work to which they are accustomed, and I am quite sure that by this means there will be no trouble in getting sufficient men to cope with the harvest. The  difficulties  surrounding the financial aspect of the war are so great that it is impossible for any man to say what will be the expenditure to be incurred by Australia in the near future. We are talking to-day of borrowing <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20,000,000, or</inline> expending &#163;40,000,000. A year ago, if we had talked of a similar- expenditure in Hundreds of thousands of pounds, we would probably have been &#39;surprised, but we are living in extraordinary times to  which  the ordinary rules of finance do not apply. The English national debt, as we know, was inflated tremendously during the Napoleonic wars, but, according to the figures made public by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the Budget speech the other day, Great Britain proposes to spend more in one year over this war than she spent during the whole of the wars of Napoleon, indicating, as I said, that the expenditure to-day is absolutely without precedent. Therefore, we can look for a tremendous load of taxation in the future. We cannot go on expending unless we collect, and I think the Government should see to it that some means of taxation are evolved to bring in the necessary revenue. </para>

It is foolish to speak of unearned increments in land, when we know many- on the land are steeped in debt owing to droughts. However, it is time we set ourselves the task of finding the means of raising more money, which will be urgently required, and I am glad to know we shall now have an opportunity to discuss the Estimates. </para>

                    <para>. - We are now entering upon a new era so far as the question of finance is concerned in Australia. Hitherto we have been, developing our resources by means of borrowed money, found in the London money market, but now not only has our expenditure been largely increased, but we are told by the Mother Country that for developmental purposes, and, indeed, for other purposes, we must depend on ourselves. For one, I welcome that position. No doubt the present circumstances are unfortunate, not only for Australia, but for other portions of the world; but it is through adversity that nations, as well as individuals, learn wisdom. Here in Australia, ever since this country has been settled, we have been wasting our resources in a most unbusinesslike fashion. We have borrowed money year after year from London for the building of railways and other public works, and we have allowed a certain section&#39; of the people to put into their pockets the added value which the expenditure of that- money placed upon the land. That ia the policy we have been following in this country up to the present, and any one who cares to examine it without prejudice can only come to the conclusion that it is the most  unbusiness-like  and foolish, as well as the most wasteful, policy in which any nation could possibly engage. I hope that stern necessity will compel a revision of that policy, and I trust that, for the future, when the people of Australia spend money on rail. ways or other public works, the value which will be added or created by that expenditure will find its way into the public Treasury rather than into the pockets of private individuals. Last year, even if the war had not broken out, we would have been in the unfortunate position of having a deficit to meet. Our revenue last year was somewhere about &#163;22,000,000 or &#163;23,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- We all feel that the ultimate fate of Australia depends largely on the outcome of the war. If the Allies win, I suppose we shall be all right. The bill will be to pay, but in time probably it will&#39; be met. A large portion of the burden can be passed on to posterity, which is only fair, because if we hold Australia we are holding it, not only for ourselves, but for those who come after us. At the same time, it is evident that the present situation in this country ought to be changed, and that speedily. Here we are in a country many thousands of miles away from Europe, and yet our fate depends almost wholly on the success of Britain and her Allies. It ought to be the ambition of every Australian to see this country independent, self-contained, and self-supporting, able to maintain her position without outside assistance, and to defend herself against foreign aggression. It is not only possible to make a beginning towards realizing that policy, but it is our bounden duty to do so, and the circumstances of the war give us a splendid opportunity of making a departure which ought to have been made many years ago. If we want to be a country able to maintain its independence, no matter what may happen to the Mother Country, the first essential is a larger and larger population. According to the latest figures, our numbers now approach 5,000,000. The increase since Federation has been about 25 per cent. In a young country like this the natural increase, with the increase through immigration, ought to be very much greater than that. In some periods young countries have doubled their population in a much shorter time than we have taken to increase from 3,000.000 odd to 4,000,000 odd. We ought to bend all our energies towards the accomplishment of a policy which will have this result. This large increase of population can be accelerated in one way only - that is by providing profitable opportunities of employment, not only for the people we have here now and for their descendants, but for many millions of. immigrants from other countries. </para>

                        <para>- I would ask honorable senators who think that the last word in brutality has been uttered in connexion with the present war to read history. Any one who does so must know that if you fight with a country to-day you are friendly with it to-morrow, and that your friend of to-day may be your enemy to-morrow. W.e see the same thing in politics and in every-day human life. To say that the people of Germany are to be segregated, marked out as the curse of God and man  for all time, is to me something so unthinkable that I cannot regard with anything but horror people who give utterance to such a sentiment. Nations, like individuals, go mad at times. Probably that is the case with Germany at the present moment, but I am sure that, twenty years from to-day, this great war, which is going to have such tremendous results, will hardly be mentioned. People will have begun to think about other things, and there will he the free movements between the peoples of different countries that there were before the war. The human race is not going to segregate itself in sections because, unfortunately, one nation has at some time or other been at war with another nation. If that kind of spirit were to be carried into the daily life of the nation, the people of&#39; one country would not speak to or visit those of another, or take or sell their goods. But that kind of thing is impossible. The human family is like a great sea, and I have no doubt that within a comparatively short period Australia will welcome German immigrants. Many of the Germans settled on the land of this country are the best farmers we have. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator studied  the  subject, he would know that the employment of women in the fields gives to the people of a country a stamina that nothing else will give. Why is it that in some of the move thickly populated manufacturing districts of Europe the people are becoming degenerate ? Their women have not the opportunities of getting the physique that the women in some other countries have. The healthiest, strongest, finest women I ever saw were what we call in Scotland the &#34; outworkers &#34; - the women who work in the fields. They are better there than sitting on a stool operating a typewriter, or standing behind a counter in a stuffy shop, or taking down shorthand from dictation. </para>

                        <para>- That is a much more healthy occupation than some I have named. I advise honorable senators to read a book recently published by Olive  Schreiner,  who shows that, if the physique of our women is lowered, the physique of the race is lowered. Instead of it being regarded as a reproach to Germany that a large number of her women work in the fields, the fact is really one of Germany&#39;s great sources of strength. I trust Australia will have 20,000,000 people within a comparatively short period. T care not from what corner of the world they come so long as they are of the white race. I want no coloured people here. I want people of the white race to make their homes here, and help to build up a great Democracy below the Southern Cross. Australia may one day be. a city of refuge for the people of Great Britain, for no one knows what is going to happen to the Mother Country in the near future. Every other great Empire has had its day and disappeared, and who will say that Britain will not disappear as a great Power. I believe she will. Every day is bringing that possibility nearer, and one of my principal reasons for urging Australia to adopt a policy of expansion and growth is that, when that day comes, there will be a home here for, perhaps, millions of exiled Britons. The only way in which that expansion can be brought about is by providing abundance of employment at good wages, and the one great essential is that the country shall be available to the people. That is what we lack, because the lands of Australia are not available to the people. </para>

                        <para>- And I hope the honorable senator will not disappoint Australia. The lands of Australia are not now, and never have been, open to its people. They never will be open to them if the party with .which the honorable senator is associated has its way. Australia can never be anything until that is brought about. The farmers of Scotland, some years ago, sent a deputation to spy out the land of Australia. They had heard great tidings of the huge areas of beautiful country available under. the Southern Cross, and thought they would come out and see for themselves. I have no doubt that if their report had been satisfactory, thousands of stalwart Scottish farmers would have come out here, and thrown in their lot with us; but the tale that these Commissioners took back to Scotland was of an astounding character. They said that there was no good land available - that all the good land was monopolized. </para>

                        <para>- I hope so. I hope that wherever a good thing is going Scotchmen will have the good sense to get a. bit of it. Unfortunately, the report of the Scottish Commission was true, and until this land scarcity . is broken down  the  growth of population that is absolutely necessary in Australia cannot take place. We have large estates in every portion of the continent, and it is not- the worst land that is monopolized. In every case it is the best land. Men who came along in the early days - whether they were English, Scottish, or Irish -were not fools. They knew good land when they saw it, and they took .precious good care to get a slice of it. They took the very best country that it was possible to obtain. If honorable senators care to examine the facts in connexion with almost every large estate in Australia, they will find that each estate comprises practically the best of the land in the particular district in which it is situated. It is the duty of this Parliament, and more particularly of the Government, to take this matter in hand and deal with it. We have made an attempt to tackle the question. The Labour party inaugurated a land value tax, which, it was hoped, would break down big estates, cheapen land, and encourage settlement. But it has not broken down big estates, cheapened land, or encouraged settlement. ^ <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> - The tax is not heavy enough. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is not. To achieve its purpose, it must be made very much heavier, and it is the bounden duty of the Labour party, which is in power to-day, to see that the conditions of land monopoly which now prevail in Australia are broken down. We have the power to do it. In both Houses we have the majority, and it can be done if  Ave  only have the courage to tackle the matter; we shall fail in the principal object of our existence as a party if we do not do it. If we leave the land question untouched, no matter what else we do, we shall have done practically nothing. We talk about this combine and that combine, but all the evils done by all the combines combined are not causing one tithe of the injury that land monopoly is doing to the people of Australia. The land monopolist not only does nothing to promote industry; he also prevents any one else from doing anything. Before lunch I heard one Minister interject, in a scornful fashion that while I favoured land values taxation I objected to taxes on stocks and shares, and so forth. Land values taxation is not taxation; it is merely the people getting for themselves the values which they have themselves created. If a man creates a thing, surely to goodness he is entitled to it. If we, by public expenditure and one thing and another, create huge land values in Australia, surely we are entitled to them; yet those gentlemen who appear to be so anxious to promote the interests of the working men do not touch the land monopolists who are preventing working men from getting employment, but propose to attack men who put their money into productive industries, who are doing something to promote the prosperity of the country, who are not burying their talents in the soil, but are putting them to active use in the way in which they should be employed to be of any use to the country. I do not object to an income tax, or to any form of taxation; but until  we  have exhausted land values taxation we have no right to impose other taxes. At any rate it is very bad business to do so. The first line of revenue production should be land values. They belong to the people of the country, and should be obtained &#34;by them for their own benefit. Last year our finances went &#163;12,000,000 to the bad owing to the war, yet every year we are going &#163;30,000,000 to the bad because of the fact that community-created values, instead of going to the public Treasury, are going into the pockets of private individuals. If we could get all the community-created values to which we are entitled - every farthing of them - we would be able to pay the cost of the war without passing on to the people one penny of the cost in the shape of taxation. </para>

As the population grows, so land values will .increase, and the amount of revenue to be produced from that source will also increase. </para>

                        <para>- The object of land values taxation is to force land into use, and that can only be done by cheapening it for the moment, but as settlement increases land values will again go up. I do- not object to that aspect of the question. What I object to -is the fact that at present the increase of land values goes into the pockets of private individuals, whereas it should go into the public Treasury. -With the increase of population increase of values is inevitable ; nothing can stop it, and it is not desirable that it should be stopped; but the increase, instead of going into the pockets of private individuals, as now happens, should be poured into- the public Treasury. In any case, Australia has huge empty areas of land, and we need more and more population - in the country districts and not in the city. Half the population of Australia live in towns. Half the people of New South Wales live in Sydney and its environments; half the people of South Australia live about Adelaide; nearly half the people in Victoria live round about Melbourne, and it is the same right through the whole of the continent. Surely this state of affairs cannot be productive of good. Why are the people nocking into the cities ? Is it because of the attractions of city life? There- may be something in that view, but that is not the sole cause. The principal reason is the difficulty of getting accessible land at a cheap rate. I believe that is the great difficulty in connexion - with land settlement; but if the policy of land values taxation be carried out, I am. certain that within a- comparatively short period there will be a large increase in. our rural population, and consequently in our production. Last year we did not grow enough wheat in Australia to meet our own needs. We even had to import butter. </para>

                        <para>- Because of the drought. But I know areas in Australia, now held by monopolists, upon which wheat and butter could be produced even in the driest season. It is the poor land  which  gives out first. The rich land will produce with a comparatively small rainfall. I have not the slightest doubt that if land monopoly were broken up we never would have a time of scarcity such as, unfortunately, we have had during, the last season. That is another aspect. From whatever point of view one cares to examine the question, one can only be driven to this conclusion : that until we deal with this most important matter, we really will have done nothing to promote the happiness or prosperity of the people with whose government we are charged. Let honorable senators think for a moment what it means to have complete control over the lands of a country. Everything we eat, or drink, or wear, or use comes from the land. There is nothing that we can mention that one uses in any relation of life which does not come out of the soil. That being so, surely the owners of the soil have a tremendous lien over those who use it. That is the reason why I desire that the Government should have complete control over every acre in Australia. Not only do- I think that that is important from the present point of view, but when I look around, and see the advances being made &#39; every year in science, and when I reflect upon the possibilities of the future, when areas which we now regard as being worthless will probably become extremely profitable by reason of some invention, I am more than ever- driven to conclude that the&#39; laud is the supreme question. Until the people of Australia have complete control over the lands of this continent they will have done little or nothing towards their industrial or economic salvation. There is another phase of this industrial question which might well occupy the attention of Parliament - I refer to the creation of new industries within Australia. We have within the confines of this continent everything that is required for the use of man. There&#34; is hardly a necessity or a luxury which cannot be produced in Australia. We have every known mineral - the richest minerals - such as gold, silver, tin, copper, coal, and iron. In short, we have everything which is necessary for the existence of a nation. Let us use these commodities instead of remaining as we are as present - dependent upon foreign countries for a large measure of the commodities that we require. I know that, in Australia, a great many persons who come from the Mother Country are still obsessed with the Free Trade idea. They think that because England became prosperous under Free Trade, the Commonwealth can become prosperous under a similar policy. But I would point out that there is a mighty difference between prosperity and greatness. The two terms do not signify the same thing at all. A community may be prosperous without being great, or great without being prosperous. Many people think that, because England flourished under a policy of Free Trade, that is the policy which should be adopted by the Commonwealth. One might as well argue that the food required by a man in his mature years, or in his old age, is that which was given to him when he was an infant. I firmly believe that what we require for our development is, not a policy of Free Trade with other countries, but a policy of Protection - a policy which will not only encourage the production of everything that we require within our own boundaries, but which will compel that production. </para>

                    <para>- I do not mean a high revenue Tariff, and if the honorable senator knew anything about this subject he would know that I do not mean that. Apparently he does not know the ABC of Protection. I would be extremely glad if he would turn the searchlight of his intellect as strongly upon the question of Protection as apparently he has turned it upon the question of land values taxation. He is all right on land values taxation, simply because he has mastered the subject. But evidently he has not begun to consider the question of Protection. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. But such a Tariff will not create industries. We ought to be honest with ourselves, and with the country. Do we wish to raise revenue, or to create industries ? That is the question which we have to determine. Apparently those responsible for the framing of the Tariff have come to the conclusion that what we want is revenue. I do not believe that the people of Australia agree with them. My opinion ia that the electors desire a Protective Tariff. But they have not got it, and I fear that they are not likely to get it, unless very great pressure is brought to bear upon this Government, and upon the Parliament, from outside. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence has asked me whether I believe in raising revenue from beer, whisky, and stimulants. I certainly do. A very &#39;considerable portion of our revenue is derived from that source. So far as revenue is concerned, stimulants occupy a group by themselves. I do not believe in the taxation of stimulants merely for revenue purposes. What I believe is that, if they were sold at their normal price, the result would, in all probability, be disastrous to the country. Aa some little means of mitigating that result I am quite prepared - although very much against my principles - to see the taxation on stimulants continued. But I would put tobacco in quite another category. I would impose a protective duty upon that article. I do not see any reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott,</inline> who smokes, should be obliged to contribute more to the revenue of this country than I do. I do not believe that our pleasures ought to be taxed. The pleasures of life are so few and far between that they ought not to be taxed . The shadow - of the hard-visaged tax gatherer should never be allowed to come between us and our pleasures. </para>

My Australian . experience has convinced me that tobacco is one of the choicest pleasures of the- working men of this country. It does not matter where we go, we shall find that this is so. If we penetrate the bush to places hundreds of miles from civilization - to the mining and shearing camps - we shall find the men who are doing their best to develop the resources of this country, and without whom those resources cannot be developed, sitting over their pipes in  the  evening enjoying, perhaps, the only luxury they have. I would be pleased if, to-morrow, the revenue tax on&#39; tobacco were abolished. </para>

When I see the working man, who is giving up a great deal to develop the resources of this country, taxed through the medium of the only luxury that he enjoys, whilst the land monopolist, who is holding up the resources of Australia against the people, is allowed to go  comparatively  free, I can only conclude that there is something radically wrong in the arrangements underlying our taxation. We are getting a very large revenue out of .the Tariff. Last year we collected something like &#163;14,000,000. But we collected far too much. The amount of revenue derived from the Tariff proves conclusively that it is not operating in the direction of creating industries, but that it is a mere instrument for extorting revenue. </para>

                        <para>- There are large sums derived from other duties. I desire to see that revenue largely decreased. I come back now to my original proposition, namely, that we require a larger population. To get that population we must free the land, and do as much as we possibly can towards supplying our own needs, and the needs of other people at the far ends of the earth. In the absense of a Protective Tariff it is impossible to build up industries in Australia. Only a few minutes ago we were talking of  Germany.  After the war is over I have not the slightest doubt that the people of that country will tackle work with all the energy, capacity, and scientific knowledge which they can command, and that they will be very strong competitors in the industrial race. Unless we take measures to protect ourselves against an invasion of their goods, those goods will enter Australia at a much cheaper price than they can be manufactured locally. Consequently, unless something is done industries will not be established here. Things will go on in the old way; and some day we shall find ourselves caught in a cyclone, and probably we shall come to grief. But there is a remedy at hand. The Australian people have given this Parliament a mandate to adopt a Protectionist policy. The Opposition are agreed upon that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said here some time ago that, while he believes in a revenue Tariff, seeing that Australia has declared for Protection, he is not going to put himself in opposition to that policy. He has never had the chance to do so, because no Federal Government has yet introduced a Protectionist policy. The present Tariff is very far from being a Protectionist Tariff. It still produces revenue in very large sums. What we want to do is to try to bring the revenue-producing capacity of the Tariff down to something like 30s. per head of the population, instead of &#163;3 10s. as it is at present. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to bringing it lower than that, but I think that a drop from &#163;3 10s. to 30s. per head would be very good to begin with. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> prepared to bring down the revenue-producing capacity of the Tariff to 30s. per head? We should require a much more highly Protective Tariff than we have now to bring it down to that amount. I find that there are a very few honorable members of the Senate who are willing to go that far. They do not seem to be very anxious that we should have a Protective Tariff. No doubt they talk a great deal about it on public platforms, but after they are elected on the strength of their promises and professions, when they come here, they shed both promise and profession, and give the people the same old thing over again. It is high time that we took stock of ourselves. We should break down land monopoly and establish high Protection. If we did so,&#39; we should do that which would bring some benefit to the people of Australia. It  would add largely to our population, and, as a necessary consequence, increase our strength and independence. I do not wish to say very much more on this subject. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, to-day. I fear that it will be necessary for me to say more on some other occasion, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may rest assured that when there is no further necessity for talking in this way, I shall cease to speak, unless I find some new subject to engage my attention. Every one will agree that what Australia most requires is more people. It does not matter how we get  them ; I say let them all come. We want 20,000,000&#34; of people here. We need to place ourselves in such a position that we shall not be dependent on Great Britain or any other country for our existence or defence. We should be able to rely on our own strong right arm. There is no other way that I can see to bring about that result but by breaking up land monopoly on the one hand, and &#91;183&#93; going in for a high Protective Tariff on the other. We want more revenue, and there is great talk about fresh taxation. Undoubtedly fresh taxation will be necessary to meet our requirements. The taxation of the past will be as a bagatelle to what will be necessary in the future. Not only is that true, but a readjustment of our whole system of taxation is necessary.  If we had a Protectionist Tariff, a large proportion of the &#163;14,000,000 of revenue which we now receive through the Customs must disappear.  Say  we get &#163;7,000,000 or &#163;8,000,000 from the taxation of stimulants, and a considerable proportion of the remaining amount is lost by the adoption of a reformed Tariff, there is one way, and, in my opinion, only one honest and just way, open to us to make up the consequent deficiency in revenue. It can be done by imposing additional land value taxation. Not only shall we derive revenue from the adoption of that course, but our land will be cheapened and freed for settlement. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going wrong. I can give the honorable senator an example of what happened recently in Queensland. A large estate, consisting of some 120,000 acres, was broken up in that State. At the time it was valued at about &#163;3 per acre. As many as 400 settlers took up that country, and if&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> wanted a piece of it today he would have to pay, not &#163;3, but &#163;6 per acre. Every  one who knows anything about land value taxation knows that, as population increases, land values increase, and as population dwindles, land values disappear. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and the price paid was too high. If there had been a land value tax in operation the people who settled upon that land, instead of having to pay &#163;3 per acre for it, would probably have been able to get it for &#163;1 per acre. The result of an .effective land value tax is undoubtedly to -depreciate land values. That is the object of such taxation. It is intended to cheapen land and make it more plentiful. But when the land is taken up and settled in small holdings there is an appreciation of its value. </para>

                        <para>- It is, of course, a fact- that in every country, as it becomes more thickly populated, it is inevitably more difficult for people to get .land. Fortunately, in Australia we are far removed from that stage at present. We can contemplate that possibility very calmly, as it will not affect us or our immediate descendants very much. I ask honorable senators to turn their minds seriously to the questions of land monopoly and the revision of the Tariff. If we are to progress as we ought, and if our position is to be strengthened, we must have more people in Australia. Unless land monopoly is broken up, and our lands made available to the people at a cheap rate, we cannot have settlement upon the soil to the extent we ought to have; and, unless we have a Protectionist Tariff, we cannot expect to develop new industries in Australia. I again ask honorable senators to turn their attention to these questions, and see whether something substantial cannot be done towards the realization of a policy which I believe is the only one that can do Australia any good. </para>

                    takes on this matter. It is so indefinite that one would almost require a compass and chart to find it. I am surprised that any member of the Senate should take up such an insane attitude, and such a foolish and untenable position, as to propose to tax land to such an extent as would discourage settlement. The only effect would be to add to our city population by cutting away whatever attractions the country side at present offers to settlers.

                        <para>- I need only remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that I did not have him in my mind when I referred to the matter. To tax land without regard to exemption would, in the end, destroy its attraction to the settler, and it would be altogether a suicidal policy, which T could not for one moment justify. I am well enough acquainted with the attitude of the party of which I am a member to know that there is no prospect of such a foolish action being adopted; but, at the same time, I recognise that there are men connected with our party who would carry that policy to an outrageous extent if they could, and I am pointing out that if we take such a foolish stand it will be the first step in the direction of disaster. However, that is not the subject upon which I rose to speak. I want to direct attention, during the course of this debate, to a certain action in connexion with the Home Affairs Department in calling tenders recently for work in which timber is employed. I do not say that the Minister is responsible for this, because probably it is the act of some subordinate official, and has been carried into effect without the knowledge of the Minister. I have in mind a glaring case in which tenders were called . in Western Australia for work which required native timber, and, strange to say, karri timber - which has been found most useful in the United Kingdom and also in the Commonwealth - was specially excluded in that particular contract. Karri has &#91;183&#93;- 2 been used successfully for years in&#62; Western Australia for work of a superstructural nature, and it has also been used by the Imperial Government with like success. The timber has stood the test of experience, both in Great Britain and Western Australia, but, notwithstanding its suitability, the Commonwealth  Government lately - I refer to the Home; Affairs Department- in calling for tenders specially excluded its use. I am sure, however, that this is a matter which? needs only to be mentioned to be remedied!. The other point to which I desire to direct attention is one which was touched, upon in the Ministerial statement  this  morning. I refer to the use .being made? by the Defence Department of transport: ships for freight purposes. In view of the prospect, happily, of a very good harvest - perhaps the best harvest that we have ever had in this country - the problems of providing labour and transport will have to be considered. Shipping freights have gone up, perhaps, 200 per cent, om account of the scarcity of ships available for cargo purposes. Now the Minister of Defence mentioned to-day that these transport ships have been used with great advantage in carrying cargoes, and I hope the Defence Department will take into consideration the wisdom of utilizing them for the purpose of exporting the surplus wheat to the markets of the world when the time comes. If some such action is not taken, the extra price which wheat will command, and which is looked forward to by those engaged in this industry to pay their debts as well as to provide for some comforts, will be swallowed up by the extra freights to be paid for the carrying of the produce. I wish, therefore, to take this opportunity of impressing on the Government the wisdom of using those- transports, which,  unfortunately,  will be employed for some time in carrying our troops to Europe, for the. carriage of grain to the London markets </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say a few words in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s&#39;</inline> statement regarding the instruction  in rifle training of our Expeditionary Forces. A good deal of capital has been made out of a statement made by me - 1&#34; saw no reason for concealing the fact - that two battalions were sent to Egypt without having undergone their  musketry  training in Australia. But I gave the reason then, and that was that the transports were here; they were costing us about &#163;800 or &#163;1,000 a day, and the men could be put through their musketry course in Egypt, where they were to be sent to complete their training. The General Officer Commanding was informed that these men had not done their field musketry, and the arrangement was that they were to be given this training in Egypt. Ill-advised persons - for what reason Heaven only knows - have, on that statement, been making the assertion that our men have been sent to the front without musketry training. There is absolutely no warrant for that statement, which is incorrect, misleading, and damaging. I cannot understand what actuates people who, when they get certain facts, at once commence to see if they can twist them into harmful statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> himself used the words that these men were sent to the front. When I corrected him be said he meant Egypt; but I would remind honorable  senators that Egypt is not the front. As a matter of fact, all the troops, including even the divisions with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> himself had a good deal to do, were sent to Egypt to complete their training. That there is a difficulty in giving rifle instruction I am prepared to admit, but we are endeavouring to meet it in one way. I have given instructions that members of rifle clubs who are proficient in the use of the rifle shall be utilized to the fullest extent in imparting instruction to the troops. Another thing we have had to do, and which I very much regret, is to recall 12,000 rifles loaned to the rifle clubs, our object being to have them fitted with magazines, because there will be a period when we shall require these rifles to give instruction to the men of the Expeditionary Forces in our camps, and who are going to the front. I have no doubt that that will draw an indignant protest from many rifle club members; but I have already made the statement public, so that they may know why the rifles are being withdrawn. In this matter of rifle, instruction there is something more to be done than merely shooting on a range; and for the information of members I might indicate what the course of musketry really is. Before a visit to the range at all, such instruction as target indication, distance judging, care of arms, &#38;c, is imparted to men in the camp. Target indication means the indication of a target invisible to the naked eye. On such occasions, the instructor, with glasses, picks out, say, a tree which is visible to the naked eye, and from it indicates the invisible target to the men. The above being completed, the men are instructed on a miniature rifle range. Honorable senators who have read about the camps will know that since we shifted the camp to Seymour we &#39;have provided miniature rifle ranges there, so that the men may get their A B C of musketry instruction without delay. Then, following that, instruction is given on an open range, where grouping, application, rapid firing and snap shooting are taught. Grouping means gaining familiarity with a rifle, and application means the direction of bullets to the target; while rapid firing means, as the objective, fifteen hits a minute; and snap shooting means shooting at a disappearing target. That is the course which the men are put through. It is not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> put it, to allow them merely to blaze away so many rounds. It is a progressive course, with . a definite end in view, and in this way the men become familiar with the rudimentary elements at the stage I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- No, those men will then probably be drafted into the Army Medical Corps. With regard to the question of the effect of recruiting on the labour market, and the forthcoming wheat harvest, I do not approve of the idea of recruiting farmers, and then sending them out again from the camp to attend to the harvest. We would not gain anything by that. It would mean bringing them into camp for a month or six weeks, clothing and feeding them, and arranging for their transport, and then sending them home again until the harvest was over, when they would be brought into camp once more. They could not be reckoned, in the meantime, among the troops at our disposal. We have plenty of men coming forward in the camp to give us our necessary reinforcements. </para>

                        <para>- Any man who is really anxious to secure training can get it by joining rifle clubs. That is being done by thousands in Australia to-day. I recognise the immense value of the coming harvest to Australia, but some things must be left to the State Government activities. There is on the Commonwealth Government an obligation to arrange that the surplus wheat and wool is carried over seas, and that the freight is not excessive. If we do that, we shall do something effective for the farmer. It is a big thing to do, and it will tax all our resources and energies to do it. The State Parliaments, with their Labour and Agricultural Departments, are best fitted to cope with the harvesting of the crop. They can organize labour for the purpose, and I believe they will do it.. I understand they are making preparations now for the purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> touched on one of the most important groups of industries when he referred to the metal industry. Australia is one of the greatest producers of the raw material in metals, and one of the smallest of the manufactured article. It is one of the biggest exporters of the raw material, and one of the greatest importers of the manufactured article. The Commonwealth Government, in accordance with the pledges made at the opening of Parliament, set about an investigation of this question, and found themselves handcuffed by the world-wide monopoly governed by German influence and controlled by German men and money. Germany had outwitted every nation on earth in its monopolizing of the metallic trade. We had to do in our Enemy Contracts Bill what neither Great Britain nor any of her Allies have done. By that measure we nullified, so far as Australia is concerned, the contracts which were crippling and making futile our efforts. But the product has been sold hitherto over-seas, and the contracts extend over-seas, where we have no control over them. We have asked the British Government to take the same action as we have taken here. They have not done so. We are not to blame for that. If we are to commence the manufacture of these things here, we must have some guarantee that the producers of the mineral here are in a position to cooperate effectively with us in the manufacture. That is what we are endeavouring to obtain. The Attorney-General has made this his particular work, and is dealing with it very effectively. It cannot be done in a day, a week, or a month; but we are determined that we shall do everything we can to establish the manufacture of these secondary industries, which are dependent on our metallic industries. The Munitions Committee now sitting is also taking evidence, and making certain propositions in this connexion. We find that there are certain manufactures of copper required for shells. Their manufacture has never been undertaken in the Commonwealth, although other kinds of copper have been made here. There s;&#187;sms to be no reason why they should not be made here, and we are endeavouring lo find out whether the people who produce copper manufactures will undertake to put  in the necessary plant to make them also. There are any number of works in the Commonwealth which could be extended to begin the manufacture of these things. We have submitted to the Chamber of Manufactures a list of articles that we have always had to import. Such things as pocket knives seem to have been beyond the capacity of Australians to manufacture. They have always been imported, although there has been a duty on them. After the war began, we found it impossible to supply our troops with the pocket knives required. An Australian manufacturer set to work, and now makes just as good1 a knife as we have been importing, so that we are now able to supply our troops with an Australian pocket knife. There is quite a list of articles, small in themselves, but still amounting to a respectable sum in the aggregate, which, for instance, in the Defence Department had always to be imported. The local article could not be obtained because it did not exist. Many of these are now being made by people in Australia, who find, much to their own surprise, that they can make them -quite as well as they are made elsewhere. We are paying for them, perhaps, more than we &#39;did before, but we are getting a good article, and that principle can be extended. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie referred to the appointment of  Colonel Pethebridge  as Administrator of German New Guinea. In my opinion it was a very fortunate appointment, because, up to the time of his appointment, we had nothing hut trouble there, and we have had no trouble since.  His  administration has been a thorough success. </para>

                        <para>- I know. I do not think German New Guinea, or the whole of the Islands, could be successfully administered at present from one centre. We have not annexed German New Guinea, nor could we do so until the end of the war. It will have to be determined between the Allies at the end of the war to whom that country shall belong. Great Britain has given her word that the disposition of territory shall be left for settlement amongst the Allies afterwards. German New Guinea is only under military occupation. Papua, on the other hand. belongs to us. It is carried on under an Act of the Commonwealth, and is, therefore, under an entirely different system of government. Under military occupation the law is that you maintain existing institutions, and it would net be advisable, while the difference in the systems of Government continues, to have the one Administrator administering the two territories. </para>
