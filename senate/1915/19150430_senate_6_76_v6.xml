                            <para>- Does not the Minister of Defence think that he should immediately make an emphatic protest to the Imperial defence authorities against the system of censoring news relating to the operations of the troops in the Dardanelles, including some of the Australian Forces? In explanation of the question I wish to state that in this morning&#39;s newspaper we have one message with the big head-line, &#34; What the Turks Claim.&#34; They claim that 400 of the Allies troops have been killed, and that some troops, including Australians, have been taken prisoners. That is reported to be a <inline font-style="italic">covimuniqtu&#233;</inline> issued in Constantinople. At the same time there is not the slightest detail given. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but not containing any Australian troops. Honorable senators no doubt will remember reading in the press about a week age that one transport was torpedoed.I should say that it is quite wise on the part of the Home authorities to censor all news of the movement of troops until they have been landed. Therefore, the Government would not feel justified <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> making a protest against that act. But there is another phase of this question. Judging from the press, apparently news was allowed to be published in the English newspapers regarding the landing of the troops, whilst we were not informed that the same news could be released here; and we do intend to bring that matter under the notice of the War Office. When the news is allowed to be released in England, which is very much nearer to the scene of operations, certainly we ought to be informed, so that we can release the same news in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- In a newspaper this morning I read some remarks which did not quite fairly put the position. This Government would not feel justified in making a protest against a rigid censorship until the troops have been actually landed; but once a landing has been accomplished, and the news of the fact has been released in England, certainly we should be informed, so that the same news can be released here. It ison that phase of the subject that representations will be made to the proper authorities in England. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bill was previously under consideration in Committee, the Minister had before him the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Bill, in the form in which it had been submitted to the Imperial Parliament. He pointed out that, in the original draft of that measure, regard was necessarily had to the possibility of an invasion of Great Britain itself, and that it was deemed advisable to afford an opportunity for the trial of cases by court martial, because it might;-, happen that the ordinary civil tribunals would not be available. He emphasized the fact that, though the possibility of an invasion of Australia was very slender, it was nevertheless desirable that we should provide that, throughout the Commonwealth, or any specified portion of it, an accused person might be tried by court martial. Do I understand that the proposed new paragraph does not derogate from that position - that it will still be competent for the Governor- General to declare any area in Australia an area within which offences may be tried by court martial? </para>

                        <para>- I have only had&#39; an opportunity of seeing the amendment since the message was received from the other Chamber, and, consequently, I have not had time to look at the original provisions of. the Bill with a view to appreciating its exact effect. But it seems to me that, in another place, the Government might have stressed more than they did that the emergent conditions under which such a proclamation would issue would be only of the character I have just indicated, namely, the possibility of an invasion of this country or of any portion of it. In such circumstances, everybody would recognise the wisdom of providing that trials for various offences should be by court martial. I do not think for a moment that the Government desire to deprive the ordinary citizen of a civil trial, such as he has under normal conditions. When the measure was last before us, the Minister clearly indicated the scope of this seemingly extraordinary provision. In the few words which he uttered, he brought home to us the necessity for it. But the Government might have stressed that aspect of the case a little more than they did in another place, and the Bill would not then have met with so much opposition. I think this new paragraph is a provision which should appear in the Bill at this juncture. Nobody can foresee what may be the condition of affairs, even in this remote portion of the Empire, at no distant date. It is all very well to flatter ourselves that we are secure from invasion, but there are always possibilities. Anything may happen in the North Sea, and it is quite possible that some German vessels may break through there. As the Minister has moved that the amendment made in another place he agreed to, I think that the Committee will be justified in supporting him. </para>

                    (New South provision has been inserted in the measure. I object to any private individual being tried by court martial, because I contend that in such circumstances he does not get a fair trial. My experience of courts martial teaches me that, under them, there is one law for the private and another law for the officer. Unfortunately that fact has been brought home to us in too many instances. To make civilians liable to trial by a military tribunal under officer-made law would be unfair

                        <para>- It is a case of Buckley&#39;s law, then. I am glad to avail myself of this opportunity of showing how men in the lower grades of the service are treated by courts martial. Recently I had occasion to bring under the notice of the Minister a case in which fi sergeant was charged with being drunk whilst on duty. No doubt he was drunk, but it was late at night. He was an engineer on a small vessel in Sydney Harbour, and he took the vessel from Sydney to the  forth  and back again all right. That man received an awful punishment, I consider. He was disrated - that is, put back to the position of a corporal, or Something of the kind, which was tantamount to imposing upon him a fine of &#163;15 or &#163;20 a year. The autherities even went back to 1884 to discover that when he was in the British Navy he had been guilty of a slight offence. </para>

                        <para>- This man made certain statements to me, and, unfortunately, when the authorities got him before this official tribunal they subjected him to the third degree, and induced him to admit everything. I maintain that he is being severely punished for a very slight offence. As evidencing the differential treatment which is meted out to men as compared with the officers by courts martial, I desire now to direct attention to the case of an officer who was found drunk when coming from the sergeants&#39; mess. He was certified to by the medical officer, by  his  commanding officer, and by other officers, as being drunk and unfit for duty. He was taken before the Commandant, who said that he would reluctantly be obliged to dismiss the case because no court martial would convict him. </para>

                        <para>- I will, undoubtedly. The Commandant distinctly stated that no court ma&#34;rtial would convict this man, and that, therefore, he was reluctantly compelled to dismiss the case. The officer has thus gone back to his duty, whereas the unfortunate sergeant has been mulcted in a penalty of about &#163;15 a year. This is the sort of justice that we  get  from military tribunals. I am glad that I have had an opportunity of bringing this case before the Minister, because I was under the impression all the time that his attention had not been directed to it. To my mind there are quite a number of matters which have not been brought under his notice. I admit the Minister cannot give his valuable time to all the small things that ought to be ventilated. </para>

That man was discharged, and a German was put in his place, and although I have received a reply to my representations to the Minister, Ido not think that he knows anything about it. </para>

                        <para>- I bow to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and might add that I really expected you to intimate that I was transgressing. I will certainly give the Minister an opportunity of investigating these cases, and feel confident that I can prove everything that I have said in the matter. The papers are on my file in Sydney. I enter my protest here against any civilians ever having to be tried by court martial because I am convinced they do not get a fair deal. I did hope that when the Labour party took its place in the National Parliament of this country, militarism would be a tiling of the past, but unfortunately it has developed to a considerable extent. I think, however, that the system will break down, because it has been clearly proved that our trainee soldiers can fall into their places behind the guns in the forts and elsewhere, and can take their place with the best soldiers in the world. </para>

More than that, I think it is: absolutely a blunder, because we are unquestionably in a state of war in Australia, and I ask my honorable friends who are pleading so earnestly for the trial by a civil jury of every offender in war time, what would they suggest should be the fate of, say, a wealthy spy in Australia who had led the enemy to our shores ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, of course ; but a court martial would prove a man. innocent just as a civil Court would, if the evidence against him were not sufficient. I hope that those who are urging that the amendment should &#39;be agreed to will furnish some stronger reason than the honorable senator who has just sat down. We are not passing legislation for times of peace, but for times of war, and we should give the Government of the country the power that was originally asked for, and which I believe is required today. I am confident that no Governmentwould use this power unfairly to any section of the community. The fate of the spy ought to be swift and sudden. There should be no dilly-dallying with law courts, civil or military, when a spy is caught red-handed. A wealthy man in such a position should not be able to take his case from one Court to another, as we find is being done in Australia to-day, and have the opportunity finally of appealing to the Privy Council if he has money enough to go there. I am as anxious to safeguard the interests of this community as any honorable senator, but; in times of necessity such as we are going through to-day we&#62; should not waste time on such paltry reasons as- have been given here for the adoption of the amendment. </para>

On this occasion I am in disagreement with the Government, and I am asking the Committee to agree to the Bill as it was passed a few days ago. By that Bill we give the Government the power which they should have in times like the present. Although the war is progressing as satisfactorily as we can expect at the moment, we do not- know what may happen in a month or six weeks. In that time this country might be invaded, and members of this Parliament scattered all over the Commonwealth of Australia. The Government, therefore, should have full power to deal with any cases that may arise, and in the manner provided in the original Bill. I hope the Committee will reject the amendments sent from another place, and carry the Bill in  its  original form. </para>

                        <para>- The Government are satisfied with the amendment which has come from another place. I do not agree with many of the tilings said in the discussion elsewhere, and I am not disposed to join the army of malcontents who appear to be anxious at this time to hold up everything as a grievance against the Government. I sympathize with the Government in the difficulties that are confronting them, and I sympathize with the authorities of the Defence Department. I will support the amendment because it provides such safeguards for civilians as should be included in a measure of this sort. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the amendment. I agree with the Minister of Defence that many matters arising out of the conditions existing at the present time are surrounded with difficulty. I refer honorable senators to one case to show what might happen if these powers were handed over absolutely to the military or to the naval authorities. A few months ago there was a little. labour dispute here in Melbourne between the captain of a ship and some of his men, and the captain got the worst of it in the law Court. Immediately afterwards the ship was commandeered by the naval authorities to take troops to Rabaul. The captain, cherishing a feeling of bitterness towards the men, who had beaten him in the law Court, thought he would make them sit up when he got them to sea. The result was that, because of some little shortage of steam, he said that the crew had mutinied. He hoisted his signals, and a major in charge of troops put the whole of the firemen on board the ship under arrest in charge of a guard of soldiers with fixed bayonets. Some of the men were taken out of their bunks to be put under arrest. </para>

                        <para>- It is remarkable that the gentleman who was appointed to hold the inquiry, and who was a retired magistrate, should hold back his report for three months. The whole case was thoroughly gone into, and both the Crown and the men were represented at the inquiry. The facts are that because the ship lost a mile or two behind the convoy, as the result of some special circumstances, the firemen were arrested, and if they had not had a strong union behind them, to insist upon an inquiry into the matter, they would probably have been shot. </para>

                        <para>- Why were these men arrested by a guard with fixed bayonets? I presume it was intended that the bayonets should be used. I am satisfied that they would have been used if the men had resisted arrest. The Minister of Defence says that the military arrested these men under orders from a merchant captain; but what military authority would take orders from a merchant captain ? The military officer arrested these men on his own authority. The master of the ship might have made a report to the military officer, but he took upon himself the responsibility of arresting the men, and placing them under a guard with fixed bayonets. I could go into the evidence given at the inquiry at some length, and show why it was not possible for the men to get up the steam required, but I shall not do so, as the official report of the inquiry has not yet been received. I say that if these men had not had a union behind them they would have been absolutely powerless to have secured any inquiry into their case at all. The facts in this case supply strong reasons for the acceptance of the* amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I am going to give the Government my whole-souled support in regard to tin&#39;s amendment. I suppose that all wisdom is not confined to the members of this Chamber, and from the stand-point of the maintenance of civil liberty I consider the amendment an improvement upon the clause as it waa passed by the Senate. As we passed it, the clause gave to ari accused civilian the option of claiming the right to be tried before a civil tribunal. It is possible that a comparatively ignorant civilian would not be aware of his rights in this respect under the clause as we passed it, but as amended by the House of Representatives ib will secure even to such a person the right of a trial before a civilian tribunal. Viewing the matter from the point of view of sticklers for civil liberty, the amendment of the House of Representatives is a distinct improvement on the Bill as passed by the Senate. I was a very interested listener to the  discusion  which took place in another chamber, and thc dispute was not so much between those who desired to uphold martial law in its entirety and those who desired to preserve a reasonable measure of freedom for the civilian population, as it was between those who were prepared to give the Government the powers considered necessary, and those who wished to amplify the freedom of the civil population beyond all reason, and to such- an extent as to make this measure as a War Precautions Act of practically no avail. I am personally satisfied if the pre-eminence of the civil power in a general way is secured, and I am consoled by the fact that this measure, as soon as we reach a state of peace, will become like the baseless fabric of a vision. It might, perhaps, have been better to have limited the operation of the measure to one year, and then, if necessary, to re-enact it as the Imperial Parliament re-enacts the Mutiny Act. T suppose that we shall be meeting  here  every year, and, if the operation of tha measure discloses the necessity for its amendment, wo shall be able to amend <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> as desired. We have to remember that we are in a state of war, and it is necessary to arm the military authorities with sufficient power to take prompt action which may be essential to the success of military movements. I do not think that Australian civilians are likely to suffer any great injustice under the provisions of this Bill. It is difficult to contemplate that any man, Australian born and bred, who will have reserved to him the right of trial by a civilian tribunal, will do anything so injurious to the interests of his country as would justify his trial before a military tribunal. But in regard to the military there is no doubt that the authorities must have the power to act promptly. In my view the only people who are likely to be affected in any way by the passage of this measure will be those who are inimical to British supremacy. </para>

We know that Cromwell actually tore a sergeant out of the ranks and shot him in order to check incipient rebellion.

                    <para>. - Some honorable senators have objected to the amendment simply because it has been made in another place. I cannot understand why a proposition should be opposed because it is made by some one else. That is not a logical or reasonable way in which to deal with amendments made in another place upon Bills introduced in the Senate. We should pay as much attention to  such  amendments as we expect another place to pay to amendments we make in Bills introduced there. </para>

                        <para>- As a rule, legislation is initiated in another place, and the Senate is the chamber of review. If amendments made in the Senate were turned down in another place merely because they were made here, we should consider ourselves very lightly treated. This Bill was passed in the Senate in a very hurried fashion, and I am as much, to blame as other members of the Senate for not having given it the consideration which, perhaps, it deserved. There is no reason at all why we should object, upon the further information which has been disclosed by the discussion in another place, to agree to liberalize this measure. The Government are prepared to support the amendment, and they are in possession of information upon the matters with which the Bill is intended to deal which private members cannot claim to possess. I will support the amendment, because I believe that it will make this a better measure than it was when it left our hands. </para>

                <para class="block">First of all, I do not think some honorable senators have been quite just in referring in such scathing terms to courts martial. I anticipate that a most important court martial will be held shortly, and I invite honorable senators to attend it. I am satisfied that if they do, a good many of their misapprehensions will be removed. There are some respects iu which a court martial is a fairer tribunal than a civil Court. Of course any court is vitiated if the persons comprising it are either corrupt or prejudiced. That applies to civil Courts as well as to military. If the Judge of a Court or the  president  of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> court martial is corrupt, or a person who will not give justice, the mere fact that he does or does not wear a uniform will not make him any different. In the case of a court martial the  president  has thrown upon him an obligation which the magistrate has not. That obligation is clearly stated in the military regulations providing for courts martial. The  president  of the court has to be the friend and representative of the person charged.. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. I have had a talk with legal authorities on the question, and they have assured me that there is a distinct difference between the obligation laid on the  president  of a court martial and that laid on the Judge of any civil tribunal; and that difference is distinctly in favour of the prisoner. The  president  has to watch the case in the interests of the person charged. Again, in courts martial the prisoner can be represented by counsel. When that point was made in another place it was pooh-poohed with the interjection, &#34; Oh, yes, the prisoner was represented by a corporal,&#34; the assumption being that as the judge-advocate, who was the prosecutor, was an officer, the prisoner was at some disadvantage. As a matter of actual fact that corporal was in his private capacity a solicitor, -with much longer experience, and a higher standing in the profession, than the officer who happened&#39; to be conducting the prosecution. Those are some of the things upon which this misapprehension is built up. True, the prisoner was defended by a corporal, but he was ode ended equally as well from the point of view of legal talent as he was prosecuted. Australia has a citizen army, and the power of proclaiming martial law <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> doing away with civil trials will only be exercised when invasion takes place, and the civil tribunals are not available, having probably been swept away. In the event of such an invasion, our Australian forces will not consist of the few permanent gunners at the forts and a few permanent officers, but of over 140,000 citizens - civilians, not militarists. They will not be these tyrannical military people who are held up as such a bogy, but carpenters, sailors, coach-makers, miners, and lawyers. These men will, for the time being, be the terrible militarists. Those who will constitute these tribunals will not be Prussian militarists, but civilians who, for the time being, are military officers, because for that force of 140,000 we shall require probably from 1.2,000 to 15,000 officers, whereas if we took all the permanent officers that we have in Australia to-day we could not muster 1,000, or anything like it. The overwhelming number of them would therefore be civilians who had for the time being donned the uniform. There is no objection to many of these men who follow the profession of the law being made civilian magistrates or Judges, with power to try cases and inflict the death penalty; but, according to my honorable friends, if we put the military uniform on them they suddenly become tyrants, and, therefore, suspect. Suddenly their ability to deal out justice is to be doubted, because for the time being  they are dressed in military uniform. </para>

The honorable senator may not know that the great majority of the men who are qualifying at the military and naval colleges are the sons of working men, and won their positions there by competitive examination. Under the system, as -regards promotion in the Citizen Forces, every step has to be won now by competitive- examination. The man who goes out to Broad meadows can win his way by competitive examination, and obtain a commission before leaving Australia, and many have done so. </para>

                        <para>- If he was at the front he might possibly get a much severer sentence. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> contended that justice was not done in that case. In fact, I am sure he will admit that justice was done, but he mentioned another case - and he has given me the name privately since - of an officer who, he says, came on duty drunk, and was not court niartialled. I cannot recollect the case, and should like an opportunity to look it up. So far as I can I shall endeavour to see that the officers get exactly the same treatment as the men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> brought forward another case, and I do not think he could have chosen a better one to show that even the present Minister of Defence, with all his faults, can be fairly trusted to do justice. It is alleged that the captain of the ship signalled that a mutiny had occurred, as his firemen had refused duty. I am not going to express an opinion as to whether that was true or not, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will not refute my statement that that was the signal that was made. What was the military officer to do? </para>

                        <para>- How could he inquire ? He was not in charge of the ship. He had to act. The honorable senator forgets that when a ship is taken for transport duty the captain, and not the military officer, has command of the crew, and is responsible for what he and those under his command do. If the captain says that the men have refused duty, one of the duties of the military officer is to enforce the authority of the captain. He knows nothing about navigation. The men on the ship are not under him. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator did not wait. The question is whether the captain was justified. The union brought the case before me, and I immediately saw that there was a reasonable ground for difference of opinion, and at once ordered a magisterial inquiry and not a court martial. We were dealing, not with military or naval people, but with civilians, and in such a case I say unhesitatingly that a magisterial inquiry is better than a military tribunal. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> could not have mentioned a case more apt to show that  people can have confidence in a court martial. </para>

                        <para>- These alleged reasons are the subject of a magisterial inquiry. As regards the amendment itself, I &#34;did feel that the clause was one which was nob likely to be abused. However, another branch of the Legislature thought that, instead of leaving the civil trial optional it was better to make it obligatory, and there is in this the advantage <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has pointed out. In the absence of the amendment a person ill-informed in the law might not know what he could do; perhaps his attention might not be drawn to the fact that he could appeal to a civil tribunal, and therefore he might not exercise his right. But under the amendment such a person will have the right preserved to him, and the exercise of the right will not need to rest on his initiative. Therefore, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> that as it does not weaken the power to deal with any situation which may arise we might very well accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - A few minutes ago I spoke in support of the amendment, but after listening to the arguments of the Minister of Defence I must confess that I feel somewhat in a: dilemma. I do not know whether h&#187; wishes this amendment to be carried or not. I wish that I had waited to hear the Minister before I addressed the Committee. Certainly, if I were to follow his arguments I would vote against the amendment. The account we heard of the enlightened and charitable practice of law at the drum-head came as a startler to me. I do not know whether the Minister has had any experience of this sort of thing or not, but if we were to follow his arguments to-day we would certainly abolish at once the civil Courts and adopt martial law in our various walks of life. The abolition of the black-coat gentry and the putting on of the red coat is the sum and substance of the Minister&#39;s statement if there is any logic in it. No matter how much we may admire the Defence administration, I do not think that we are prepared to take such a great step as that. But I do ask the Minister if he has had any practical experience of martial law in a community in which he lived. I have had some experience of martial law, and I dare say that there are honorable senators on the back Ministerial bench who have had a little experience of it. If Ave cast our minds back to various industrial disputes which have occurred in Australia, if we go back as far as the maritime strike, when I had a little experience of the justice of trial at thedrumhead </para>

                        <para>- In the amendment we are providing for those who may be exempt from court martial, and, therefore, I say it is martial law when a court martial is held, and it is of no use for the Minister to argue to the contrary. I am quite satisfied to accept the amendment which has been made by another place, for the simple reason that, in my opinion, the Bill has been liberalized in the interest of civilians whose welfare has been considered and safeguarded. But if we are to have a Minister, when amendments come down to this Chamber, speaking with two different voices, it will put the followers of the Government in- rather an awkward position to know how to go in order to move in the right direction. I think that we cannot do any harm in seeing that the law is made as liberal and generous as possible to civilians, at the same time taking all necessary safeguards to prevent those whom martial law should deal with coming within the scope of the Act. I think that the amendments of the House of Representatives will do both, and consequently we should adopt them. </para>

                    O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;12.20&#93;.- When the Bill was before the Senate previously, I supported it with some reluctance. I am deadly opposed to introducing into the law anything in the nature of what is known as militarism - that is, placing the military power over the civil authorities, or, in other words, giving the right to the military authorities to abrogate the civil law. It was only a consideration of the circumstances in which we are placed, and the assurance of the Minister of Defence that this was part of the British law, and might be necessary if certain events should occur here, that induced me to support the measure. So far as I understand the proposals in the Bill, they only define or place in statutory form certain powers which any Government worth their salt would exercise, whether embodied in an Act or not. There is an unwritten law which, in the case of an emergency, any Government would put in force. When the war broke out the Government in power proceeded to enlist men, and were prepared to take part in the war without any definite authority, and I think they were fully justified in so doing.

                    desire to say a few words in regard to courts martial. Some persons have the idea that a court martial acts in an arbitrary manner, without being subject to any restraints or rules.

I can assure the honorable senator that the rules governing the proceedings of a court, martial, and laid down in the military regulations, are of the most elaborate description. Every qualified officer has to pass an examination on the law with regard to a court martial before he can obtain a senior commission. The rules of evidence, and, in fact, all particulars  as  to the conduct of a court martial, are laid down, and every officer before he can preside or take part in a case is required to pass a very stiff examination. It is a mistake, therefore, for any honorable senator to suggest here that courts martial are inclined to act in an arbitrary way. As the Minister of Defence has stated, these courts are conducted by men who are civilians. I do not think that there is a senior officer in South Australia. - including the officers1 at the front who are in command of the troops - who has not) passed through the ranks. That was also the rule in that State prior to Federation. </para>

                        <para>- 1 only speak of what I know. I  cannot  speak of matters outside my cognisance I take it that the provisions of this Bil) only express in statutory form certain powers which every Government has. an unwritten right to exercise, and which every Government does exercise, whether contained in an Act or not. The. amendments proposed by another place are designed to further define, and to limit any arbitrary exercise of, the powers of a court martial. I do not think that there will ever be the slightest necessity to put any of these powers in force, but I believe it is a wise precaution to have them properly defined in an Act and for that reason I support the Bill and the amendments. </para>

We have just listened to the testimony of an honorable senator who has sat as the  president  of a court martial, and I understand that there is not a drop of blood on his hands to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that neither in South Australia nor in any other part of the Commonwealth can a glaring act of injustice be sheeted home to any court martial. Mistakes, no doubt, have been made in courts martial, as in civil trials, but we are quite confident that nothing of the kind related has ever happened. We have been told to-day about what happens under martial law. We know perfectly well that in the case of industrial disputes - and we regret the fact - the Lord Mayor, or some other person in authority, is called out, the Riot Act is read, and, if necessary, the military or the police can be ordered to fire on the crowd. This amendment has nothing to do with courts martial. The supporters of. the amendment have gone from Dan to Beershebah to find arguments to bolster up a very weak case. They have dragged in some most outrageous things - things which could not possibly occur in connexion with a court martial - to strengthen their contention. I ask honorable senators who have raised this plea what they would have done if they had been at Singapore a few weeks ago, when the mutiny broke out ? Where would civil law have been then ? The services of the military had to. be employed. </para>

                        <para>- No court martial ordered that action. The mutineers were shot whenever they were found. People were shot in the streets of Singapore by the mutineers. Does my honorable friend suggest that a member of a British force who shoots a British subject should be arrested, lodged in a lock-up, and then provided with the best legal authority in the country for his defence ? Of course he does. not. He would he the last to suggest anything of the sort. </para>

I admit that there is a good deal in that argument, but not enough to warrant the Government in accepting the amendment made by another place. I do not scout the proposal merely because it emanates from another branch of the Legislature. On the contrary, I ara prepared to give it all the consideration that it merits. But some amendments which have reached us from another place have received very scant consideration at the hands of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>.- When this Bill was previously before the Chamber I took it to be  very  largely an emergency measure. I regarded it as being intended to provide for a contingency which seemed very remote indeed. Nevertheless it is wise for the Legislature to make provision for every possible emergency. I was prepared at that time to trust the Government. I believed that they would not make any improper use of the power to suspend the trial of persons by a civil Court if the occasion for taking such a course of action arose. There has been a great deal of discussion as to depriving people of the liberty of the subject in some respects. If the amendment which has been inserted in another place will allay any feeling of alarm in that direction I have no objection to it. A good many honorable senators apparently apprehend more danger from the establishment of courts martial than appears to be justified. We must not forget that in Australia we are raising a military force which is comprised of citizen soldiers, and we hope that the men comprising that force will be imbued with the spirit of the citizen soldiery rather than with that of the old military caste. </para>

                        <para>- I have read a good deal about military matters&#39;, and I must confess tha.t I have never had much love for militarism. I hate militarism as I hate sin, but there are times when we have to submit to it because of the conditions with which we are surrounded. To-day we are in a state of war, and, consequently, have to accept military conditions which otherwise we would not tolerate. To my mind the danger to be apprehended is not so much the court martial as the fact that a private or ranker will not often be in a position to defend himself before such a tribunal in the same way as will an officer. I hope that when cases under this provision do arise the ranker or civilian will be provided with leg&#39;al assistance to enable him to have his case presented just as well as the prosecutor will present the other side. In connexion with civil cases, I have time and again heard an attorney put a question to a witness which has been misunderstood, with the result that a wrong answer has been given. Thus the jury has been led to a wrong conclusion because of a misconception in the mind of a simple man. The simpler the individual the more chance there is of injustice being inflicted upon him. I have every confidence in the Minister of Defence, and I trust that when representations are made to him in any case in which a ranker may be charged with an offence he will see that legal assistance is provided the accused, so that his case may be presented in the best possible light. </para>

                    (New South Wales &#91;12.42&#93;. - I desire to say a few words in reply to the remarks of the Minister of Defence. In bringing forward the case which I did I had no intention of conveying the impression that I was dissatisfied with the punishment that had been meted out to the offending sergeant. But I am undoubtedly dissatisfied with the punishment inflicted on the officer whom I mentioned, who was guilty of practically the same offence at very nearly the same time. Whether the sergeant deserved his punishment I am not going to say. But if he did, certainly the officer merited similar punishment. The Minister asked me for the name of the offending officer, but I do not think it would be a fair thing to mention it here. The papers relating to the matter are in the Department - they set out the names of the individuals concerned, so that everything is in order. I do not think it would be fair to drag the officer&#39;s name before the public, seeing that he has practically been acquitted of the offence with which he was charged. I do not object to the punishment which was; meted out to the sergeant, but I do protest against the differential treatment to which he was subjected as compared with the other culprit.

                        <para>.- The effect of this proposal will be that if martial law has been proclaimed in any area, and a civilian is dealt with by a court martial, before the sentence imposed upon him by that tribunal can be confirmed, it must be referred to the Governor-General, which means the Governor-General in Council. Honorable senators will have the double safeguard. In the first place, the court martial will not be allowed to try a civilian except where a district or certain locality has been proclaimed under martial law. And then, the civil Courts having been set aside, and the civilian having been tried by court martial, the sentence, before it is confirmed, must be reviewed by the Executive. I think that will meet the view of the Committee, and I move, therefore - </para>

                <para>This is purely a formal amendment, but will be the means of saving the Commonwealth several hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. There has not been time to print the amendment. After the Bill had left the Senate it was brought to my notice that there was a section in the Defence Act providing that persons who were commissioned in the Senior Cadets, if they transferred from the Senior Cadets to the Citizen Forces, and qualified for a commission, should be eligible to be appointed as second lieutenants. Now, if a person already in the Citizen Forces qualified, he attained the rank of lieutenant. That is to say, there is neither the rank &#34;first&#34; nor &#34;second&#34; lieutenant; they are all lieutenants. The provision with regard to second lieutenants, therefore, was really an oversight on the part of the draftsman, because as regards the Citizen Forces the rank of second lieutenant has been done away with. With the clause in its original form, it would be necessary for any person transferring from the Cadets to the Citizen Forces to undergo two examinations to get the rank of &#34;first&#34; lieutenant. If he qualified at the first examination he would be appointed as &#34; second &#34; lieutenant, and before he became a &#34; first &#34; lieutenant he would have to pass another examination of an exactly similar nature, so that really there is a duplication of examinations which is costing the country a lot of money. Therefore we are asking Parliament to strike out the word . &#34; second &#34; so that all the officers will be in the same position - that is to say, if they qualify they will take the rank of lieutenant. It is the desire of the Government to stop this expenditure at the earliest possible moment, and therefore we are asking the Committee to agree to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - Though I have no desire to enter any opposition to the amendment, I think it is very desirable that we should have all these amendments of principal Acts in print before us. In this case the Government seek to amend the original Act, but as the amendment is not printed we are not able to turn up the principal Act, and therefore, to some extent, we are legislating in the dark. I protest against this state of things. The Minister has assured us that it is being done in order to save the country the expenditure of a few hundred pounds on examinations, but I have always understood - I do not know whether I am risht - that there were two grades of lieutenants in our Forces, and that if a lieutenant in the lower grade wished to attain a higher rank he had to pass an examination. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>This is another of the emergency measures. Its object is to confer upon the High Court original jurisdiction to try indictable offences against the Commonwealth. At present the High Court has not such jurisdiction. Under the conditions obtaining at the present time, it is most desirable that indictable offences should be brought directly before the High Court in contradistinction to the procedure now followed in such cases. At present such cases are brought before the various States Courts, and the procedure is at times unduly prolonged. Cases have already arisen which it was most desirable should be dealt with promptly and without undue expense. Clause 3 of this Bill confers upon the Attorney-General the power to file an indictment in the High Court or a State Criminal Court without examination or commitment for trial. This power is not novel in Australian criminal procedure, as most, if not all, of the State Attorneys-General possess a similar power under the State criminal codes. The power is one which is used only upon rare occasions, and in the majority of cases only when it is desirable that charges for indictable offences should be tried expeditiously, and the delay arising from the preliminary examination in a summary court overcome. It is intended that the Bill shall operate only during the period that the war lasts and for six months after the conclusion of peace. The change that is proposed, therefore, will operate only during that limited time. The reason for the proposed change is that the Commonwealth may be able to take direct action in cases whore the Attorney-General considers that it is necessary and desirable to do so in the interests of justice. As the Bill was first circulated to honorable senators, it did not contain a provision limiting its operation in the way I have stated. </para>

                        <para>.- The only copy of the Bill at present available to honorable senators is that which was circulated yesterday, but I gather from the Vice-President of the Executive Council that in another place an alteration has been made in the measure limiting its operation to the period of the war and six months afterwards. I am not quite clear whether it is intended that that provision shall apply to the whole of the Bill or only to clause 3. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am not quite sure whether it is really intended by the Government that the investing of the High Court with original jurisdiction in these matters shall be limited in its operation to the period of the war and for six months afterwards. I  mention the matter, because it is possible that in the hurried passage of the measure the provision restricting its operation has been made to apply to clause 2 by mistake. When I heard that an amendment had been made in the Bill as originally introduced in another place I understood that its purpose was to limit the operation of clause 3 to the period during which the war lasts, and for six months afterwards, and that it was the operation of that clause only that was to be so restricted. I . advise the Vice-President of the Executive Council to be quite sure on the point before the Bill is finally dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- At first blush it seemed to me that that was originally the intention of the Government, and that he alteration in the measure as originally introduced, which was made in another place, was intended to apply to clause 3 only, and by some mistake had been made to apply to the whole Bill. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out, clause 3 is not altogether novel, in that it is not without precedent. As honorable senators are no doubt aware, the procedure in the case of indictable offences is that a person who is charged with a felony or misdemeanour is brought before a Court, nob of summary jurisdiction, as the Minister said, but before two or more justices. Such a Court exercises summary jurisdiction in other matters, but in these cases what they have jurisdiction to do is to hear the evidence against and for the accused person, and having heard it to commit him for trial, or to dismiss the charge against him. It is like a court of inquiry, and upon committal the trial of the accused takes place before a higher tribunal. In certain cases of minor offences - cases of petty larceny and such offences - the accused is given the option of being dealt with summarily by the justices, or of being tried by a jury. If he elects to be tried by a jury the justices may commit him for trial. It then remains for the grand jury, which in most States is the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General, to file a bill against the accused, or to refuse to file a bill against him. If the Attorney-General files a bill against the accused, a Supreme Court Judge and jury deal with the matter. It is proposed under clause 3 of this Bill to dispense with the original inquiry before justices. I can quite see that it is desirable at the present juncture to give the Attorney-General power to dispense with that preliminary inquiry, and to directly file an indictment or information in the High Court. I can also quite see that it must appeal to a good many honorable senators that it maybe a serious matter to deprive a subject of the right to a preliminary inquiry where he may possibly be discharged or committed, but not convicted. The procedure is only to obtain during the war and six months afterwards. </para>

                    <para>If the Government really wish to invest the High Court with original jurisdiction in the other matters to which I have referred only for that period I have no objection, but I trust that honorable senators will be quite sure that they are not making the limitation upon the operation of this measure more comprehensive than was originally intended. If this is so intended, I cannot understand why the Government introduced this Bill at all in its original form, because it was obvious that the purpose then was for all time to invest the High Court with the added original jurisdiction contained in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and c, clause 2, of this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I resent the imputation against my colleagues more than I would anything directed against myself. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for his criticism, and would point out that, in the Act passed on 29th October, 1914, to amend the Judiciary Act of 1903, subsection <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 2 refers to Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. We are not repealing that provision. It still stands in that Act. Honorable senators may fairly ask why it also appears in this Bill. It was repeated in this Bill merely for convenience in drafting. If it is taken out of this measure, it will not come cut of the 1914 Act. Therefore, any fears the honorable senator may have on that point are groundless. The principles of the Bill have been well discussed by the Government, who recognise that it is urgent and, to some extent, unusual, although it cannot be called novel, but that applies to all measures of an urgent nature. It is one of the measures under which the Commonwealth proposes to take direct action. Honorable senators are asked simply to remember that in these stirring times matters which crop up day by day have to be dealt with as they arise. When we find that, perhaps, the already overcrowded State Courts are not dealing with Commonwealth business as effectively and quickly as we should like, and that we can, without injury or injustice, adopt a very effective or expeditious course to deal with it, I think honorable senators will agree that this measure should be introduced, and recognise that it is a measure calculated to give justice quickly, for justice not quickly given is not justice at all. There are advantages to be derived that justify us in asking that the Bill should be passed as a matter of urgency. At the same time I admit that, perhaps, I did not explain it as fully in my opening remarks as I might have done; but no time has been lost through not having the printed amendments before us, and I trust that no honorable senator has been put to inconvenience. </para>

                        <para>. - The fourth paragraph was not in the Bill as circulated yesterday. I have the assurance of the Honorary Minister that the alteration is intended to apply to the whole Act. That is the Government&#39;s concern. I consider that I have done my duty in drawing attention to the circumstance that the insertion of that amendment by another place in that particular part of the Bill makes it operative, not only as regards the comparatively novel procedure of trial for indictable offences without preliminary inquiry before magistrates, but also on the provision adding to the original jurisdiction of the High Court. The Minister has put into my hands a copy of a Bill that we passed earlier in the session. It provides for an amendment of section 30 of the Judiciary Act to the same effect as clause 2 of this Bill in regard to Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction ; but clause 2 of this Bill goes still further, giving original jurisdiction in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. There is nothing on the face of the Bill that we passed earlier this session, investing the High Court with Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction in its original jurisdiction, to show that it was intended to limit the operation of its provisions, and that convinces me that it was never the intention of the Government or Parliament, when it extended the statutory original jurisdiction of the High Court to embrace matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, to do so for only a limited period. On the contrary, that Bill, and this one, as originally introduced, show emphatically that it was the intention of the Government and Parliament to invest the High Court with Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction in its original jurisdiction for all time. It may be that for the convenience  of  drafting we are really re-enacting in this Bill what we enacted in the present session, but during last year, and we are adding to that by providing in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> that the High Court shall have original jurisdiction in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. I can readily understand the argument of the Minister that it is convenient to have these matters together in this new form. Clause 2 of the Bill, when it is passed, will contain all the matters of original jurisdiction which the High Court will enjoy and exercise, and that will be a convenience. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know why the other is not repealed. If the law enabling Acts as amended, to be printed as amended, is availed of in connexion with the Judiciary Act - and I for one can say that it is absolutely essential that it should be - we shall have the spectacle of the amending Act showing the same amendment in two different places. First it will show the amendment which has already been passed this session, but during last year, and next it will show the same amendment with an addition to it. I take it also that at a certain stage it will be necessary for us to again amend the Judiciary Act. In what direction? To again invest the High Court with original jurisdiction in matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, because what we are doing now is limited to &#34; during the present war and for six months thereafter.&#34; </para>

Clause 3 gives power to the Attorney-General to prosecute a man in the High Court without such a preliminary inquiry before magistrates. It takes away from a man that possibility, and it does it because, as the Minister says, in the comparatively congested procedure of the State Courts, we cannot get on all occasions our matters dealt with as expeditiously as is desirable. </para>

                            <para>- It may; but it will also deprive him, in many instances, of the opportunity of being discharged at the preliminary inquiry. If there is not a <inline font-style="italic">Pr,ma facie</inline> case made out against a man, he is discharged by the magistrates. But now it is proposed to invest the Attorney-General with power to dispense with the preliminary inquiry, and prosecute a man straight away in the High Court. There may be no <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> case against a man, and he may be discharged after he has incurred a considerable amount of expense. I am quite prepared to give the power to the Attorney-General, because it is not altogether novel. In each State the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General now has the power, in certain specified circumstances, of prosecuting directly any accused in a State Supreme Court, without the intervention of a preliminary inquiry. </para>

                            <para>- This measure does not deal with such cases, but with cases of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction in respect to which it will have original jurisdiction by reference to the provisions in the Constitution and the Imperial Statute in that regard. I am prepared, as I said, to give the power to the Attorney-General, realizing that it will only be used where the occasion demands. I am not prepared to give the power to him for all time, but only during the period of the war, and six months afterwards. That is why I think we ought to be very chary with regard to sub-clause 4 of this clause. I believe that if it is passed in its present form, later on - and not very long forward - we shall be invited to amend the Judiciary Act to remedy a mistake which we are about to perpetrate. I submit, and it will then be pointed out, that it was not the intention of the Government or Parliament to limit the whole of the Act, but only section 3. It is not my intention to move an amendment; but I think it is a matter to which the Government should give full consideration, so that we shall not have constant little amendments to our legislation, which make it very difficult at times for one to know the law, which the Courts oblige every person in the community to know. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not realize exactly the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is taking up. This is a Bill to amend the Judiciary Act in order to allow matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction to go to the High Court directly. If it was confined to matters arising out of the war, I would have no objection to make; but it applies absolutely to all cases of maritime jurisdiction. If the owner of a ship fails, and is not able to pay the wages of the crew, it means that the men will have to go right to the High Court to get a lien on the ship. A number of similar instances could be cited. I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> being in favour of such cases going to the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- In a previous debate to-day I mentioned that a retired stipendiary magistrate has taken three months to make up his mind on a case, and the Minister said that he had not yet received his report. Are we going to be humbugged like that under this measure? I can quite understand a professional gentleman wanting cases to be taken to the High Court, but I wish to see the matter dealt with fairly and quickly. </para>

But the necessity for the Bill is urgent, and I can say nothing further, except to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that the extreme cases to which he referred will not be dealt with under its provisions. The Attorney- General is a reasonable man, and will not . go out of his? way to use the machinery provided in this measure in an absurd fashion. The Bill is intended to enable us to deal with special cases in a special way. There is no intention on the part of the Government to use the Bill in any way other than to conserve the best interests of the people. </para>

                        <para>. - If the assurance , of the Vice-President of the Executive Council had not been given so frequently on measures of this character, it would doubtless carry a little more weight. But we are all familiar with the incidents which occurred in another place in connexion with a Bill which honorable senators passed upon a similar invitation. Surely we have a right to debate measures, and to amend them just as much as the other branch of the Legislature. Seeing that this is emergency legislation, there can be no harm in adopting the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gutlirie,</inline> who desires the provisions of this clause to be limited strictly to the duration of the war. I think that his amendment is a proper one, and I cannot see why the Minister should object to it. Tf it will not accomplish any good, certainly it will not achieve any harm. </para>

Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is doubtless well versed in the mysteries of the law, we must recollect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is equally familiar with the subject with which he has dealt this afternoon.

The Vice-President of the Executive Council has assured us that it is not intended that such cases as were referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> shall be taken direct to the High Court. I believe him. But I would point out that extraordinary circumstances may arise which will prevent effect being given to the intention of the Government. In order to allay the apprehension of civilians who ply their calling on the high seas, it is just as well to insert the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> The language used in all measures submitted to Parliament should be clear and specific. If the amendment be inserted there will be no doubt of the intention of the measure, and the requirements of the entire community will be met. </para>

He built up a hypothetical case of seafaring men who may be dragged from place to place, and finally haled before the High Court, without first being afforded an opportunity of appearing before a minor tribunal, with a view to having their cases dealt with promptly. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is of the opinion that if the Bill be carried in its present form, all cases will have to be cited before the High Court. The Government have assured him that there is no such intention, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who is a legal man, has pointed out that the Bill will not deprive civilians of any of their existing rights. I agree with the view which he has presented, that it merely provides for concurrent powers. To imagine that people will be anxious to rush to the High Court instead of to the minor Courts is to imagine the impossible. I admit that , <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is entitled to all credit for the interest which he uniformly manifests in the calling which he himself followed for so many years. But he should credit others with being equally interested in particular callings. The Attorney-General has been associated with the waterside workers for many years. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suggest that those workers live on the water as much as do seamen. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is as familiar with seafaring men and with the life which they follow as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and he is equally anxious about their welfare. I admit that there is only one Sea Lord in Australia, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> but there are a few lieutenants. The Attorney-General occupies a very honoured position in Australia and in the industrial world. He has had charge of this Bill in another place, and it is absurd to imagine for one moment that he would allow any provision to be inserted the object of which would be to take away any powers at present enjoyed by those who desire justice from the minor Courts of the country. </para>

I can imagine how legal men would split straws over the question whether any particular case was attributable to the war or not. With the insertion of the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> it would make it much more difficult for cases to be dealt with on their merits, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> suggests, than it would be if the words were not inserted . In its present form the Bill is understandable, and as it does not take away any existing rights as far as seafaring men are concerned, I cannot understand the opposition from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> because I believe it is due to imaginary causes. </para>

                        (South Australia) to show that I have been basing my argument on an imaginary case. Well, let me give him a concrete case. Last October eighty-one men belonging to one of our ships in Melbourne had a quarrel, arising, not out of the war, but out of the conduct of the cook. They were arrested, and one of the most , prominent solicitors in Melbourne was engaged to prosecute them. Does the honorable senator think that the solicitor mentioned would have brought that case before a magistrate if the High Court had been available? This case came before a magistrate, as I said, last October, and it has taken us from then till Wednesday of this week to get it settled.

There are a hundred and one cases affecting seamen that will probably crop up, such as salvage, wages, and compensation, and so on; and are we to allow all these matters to go to the High Court? I am glad that I have received some support for my amendment, and, though I am a strong supporter of the Government right through, so far as the war is concerned, I do not want this special legislation to apply to our civilian population. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has told us that the Attorney-General will not do this or that; but honorable senators must remember that it does not rest with what the Attorney-General or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> says. It rests with the lawyers and the Court. Naturally a lawyer will see that a case is taken to the Court where he will get the biggest fees. </para>

                            <para>- A lien would be an Admiralty case. I do not know what is the position in some of the other States, but in South Australia one of the local Courts with limited jurisdiction has also Admiralty jurisdiction, and can take a case for wages up to &#163;499, but not over that amount. In a case arising out of the war, I see no danger in allowing the extra powers sought in the Bill ; but I am not prepared to allow that course in cases arising out of a civil contract. What would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> say if this power were granted in respect to the printing trade, and when a man had an action against his employer, he was compelled to go to the High Court? Supposing that a printer had committed a breach of contract; that he was on a weekly engagement, and had broken it, with the result that the employer prosecuted him, and demanded that the case should be tried in the High Court. In such a case I can readily imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> advocating the same position as I am to-day, with respect to the affairs of seamen. The Minister of Defence has just drawn my attention to the fact that the High Court has Admiralty jurisdiction. I admit that. When the Act was passed I agreed with it, and every one will admit that, in the case of interned ships, the High Court is the proper tribunal to approach. I do not know how far our jurisdiction has gone, because in South Australia one interned ship was released by the Supremo Court, and allowed to proceed; but in Western Australia, Judge Burnside, I think it was, took exactly the opposite view, and would not allow a ship to leave. In South Africa, I believe, they can only be released after the matter has gone to the Admiralty Court in England. Honorable senators will see that we are opening up a very complicated question, and, therefore, I ask the Government to agree to the amendment. There can be no harm in it; while, on the other hand, if the amendment is not inserted, grave injustice may be done to masters, engineers, seamen, firemen, and others engaged in a seafaring life. Now, suppose the Bill is passed in its original form, will a lawyer look up the debate in Parliament to see what was the assurance given by the Minister, or what the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report said? No; he would ask, &#34;What does Parliament say?&#34; And he would find that Parliament said, &#34; In all matters.&#34; Then, to find what this meant, he would not consult <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> or find out what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> might have said; but he would take up a standard dictionary, and get at the real meaning. He would then find that, as the Act stated, &#34; All matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction &#34; shall be referred to the High Court, there would be no getting away from that position. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will follow me in the amendment. I am prepared to go as far as any honorable member of this Senate to assist the Government where there is an international breach, and in order to safeguard the interests of this country; but I think it would be ridiculous to allow any opportunity to take to the High Court cases such as I have referred to, and which may arise out of civil contracts. </para>

The Bill does nothing of the kind. Even if the amendment is carried, the words &#34; in all matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,&#34; as contained in the measure assented to on 29th October, 1914, will stand, I recognise that no man in public life has given greater attention to the interests of one section of the community than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and, personally, I listen, at all times with respect to what he ha3 to say ou that subject. The honorable senator should remember that what he objects to has- been the law of the land for the last six months, and I challenge him to point to one case such a3 those he has mentioned which has been brought before the High Court. </para>

The object is to expedite justice, and if we insert in this measure a provision that it is to apply only to questions arising out of the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> must agree, from his own experience in South Australia, that such a provision would enable barristers to carry on a prolonged argument before they came to the trial of a case at all, to decide whether it was one which arose out of the war. The honorable senator has put his case fairly well, and I take no exception to honorable senators putting their views fully before the Committee. But when a matter has been fully discussed, we ought to get to a division upon it. As I do not often have these difficult matters to handle, honorable senators might be disposed to let me down as lightly as they can. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not like it to go out that honorable senators generally take the view of this clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has so repeatedly expressed. The honorable senator has contended that the clause says, in black and white, that all matters of maritime jurisdiction shall be referred to the High Court. The clause says nothing of the kind. It merely provides that the High Court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction. It does not take away any jurisdiction that already exists in any Court of any of the States in regard to this matter. We cannot take away such jurisdiction from the State Courts, because the powers exercised by those Courts are exercised under an Imperial Act. </para>

                    <para>The jurisdiction claimed by the Courts of Admiralty as properly belonging to them extends to all acts and torts done upon the high seas and within the ebb and flow of the sea, and to all maritime contracts, that is, to all contracts touching trade, navigation or business upon the sea or the waters of the sea within the ebb and flow of the tide. Some part of this jurisdiction has been matter of heated controversy between the Courts of common law and the High Court of Admiralty in England, with alternate success and defeat. But much of it has been gradually yielded to the latter, in consideration of its public convenience, if not its paramount necessity.  . . The Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction (and the word&#34; maritime &#34; was doubtless added to guard against the narrow interpretation of the preceding word &#34; Admiralty &#34;) conferred by the Constitution, embraces two great classes of cases - one dependent upon locality, and the other upon the nature of the contract. The first respects acts or injuries done upon the high seas where all nations claim a common right and a common jurisdiction - </para>
                    <para class="block">With regard to these cases, it is clear that the Commonwealth authority is the only authority in Australia which presents a united and unbroken front to the other nations of the world - or acts and injuries done upon the coast of the sea; or, at furthest acts and injuries done within the ebb and flow of the tide. </para>
                    <para class="block">The second class of cases are those dependent upon locality, and for which the Courts in the particular locality concerned would be the appropriate tribunals, and they are referred to in this way - </para>
                    <para>The second respects contracts, claims and services purely maritime, and touching rights and duties appertaining to commerce and navigation. The former is again divisible into two great branches - one embracing captures, and quests of prize arising <inline font-style="italic">jure belli;</inline> the other embracing acts, courts and injuries strictly of civil cognizance independent of belligerent operations. </para>
                    <para class="block">Unless we invest the High Court with this Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, matters arising out of the war cannot be appropriately determined, or with anything like conformity, by the different State tribunals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> himself gave an illustration of this when he explained that in South Australia a Judge arrived at a certain decision, and in Western Australia, in dealing with a similar matter, a Judge arrived at an entirely different decision.

With regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> matters of locality, the State Courts are the appropriate Courts to deal with them. If such cases as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has referred to were brought, not in the local State Court, but before the High Court, the High Court would express its opinion very strongly, and would take appropriate action to vindicate the authority of the proper tribunals to deal with such matters. The High Court would not, without protest, permit itself to be bothered with matters of that kind. The amendment, if accepted, would render the clause confused, and it would have the effect of giving rise to all kind of arguments as to what were matters arising out of the war. The jurisdiction conferred upon the High Court under this measure will be invoked only in regard to appropriate matters. Those who are interested in proceedings of this kind will, I am sure, invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court only when the circumstances of the case render its invocation appropriate. </para>

This Bill is to operate during the war and for six months afterwards, but it will deal with matters other than those arising out of the war.

The Bill was evidently drafted in the atmosphere of the war, and was apparently meant to be applicable only to troubles arising out of it. That is absolutely necessary, but the draftsman was so imbued with the idea that it was a war measure that he took it for granted that every case coming under it would be connected with war conditions. At the same time, he took particular pains to insert a paragraph limiting the duration of the measure. </para>

                        <para>. - Those opposing the amendment either will not, or cannot, see the point of it. The Act passed last year undoubtedly increased the jurisdiction of the Court in many material ways, but this measure is really introduced to restrict it. Its duration is restricted because it is an emergency measure arising out of the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> wants that restriction to apply also to the cases covered by the Bill, but those who oppose the amendment are so imbued with the desire to get the Bill through in its present form that they will not recognise the logic of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> position. If the measure is intended to apply  only to matters arising out of the war, why do the Government oppose the thing when it is&#34; put into black and white? It would have been better for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to try to understand the amendment instead of telling us of the Attorney-General&#39;s great trade union experience. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is probably a great trade unionist, but there are others who have had as great experience in trade unionism as he has. Some of us were prominent trade unionists before he was known in the movement. We do not regard him as the only maj to be followed, and I, for one, shall not go down on my knees in any hero-worship of that sort. When a measure is brought before us, we have a right to see how it can be improved, no matter how great the experience of the man who introduces it. I am quite prepared to give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> his meed of praise for what li9 has done - just as the man who has introduced this amendment is deserving of credit - but that does not alter the fact that the amendment is closely relevant to the measure, and would help to achieve its real object.

                            <para>- No. I am hopeful that the other branch of the Legislature will take up the Estimates on Wednesday next, and pass them at that sitting. Any influence that I can exert in that direction will be so exerted. My object in moving that the Senate adjourn until Thursday next is that when we meet again it is intended that the Vice-President of the Executive Council shall move the second reading; of the Insurance Bill. Then I hope that we shall ; be in a position to adjourn the Senate -after we have dealt with the Estimates - until such time as the other Chamber has passed the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>. - The manner in which we are conducting business in this Chamber has become perfectly ridiculous. Early this afternoon we had one exhibition of it, and this motion affords us another. The Senate should have business to occupy its attention. Last Friday we adjourned till3 yesterday, and when we reassembled certain measures were brought before us, and we were assured that the passing of them was a matter of such urgency that we were prevented from giving them adequate consideration. I suppose that this sort of tiling will be continued until an effective protest is made against it. Whilst we have been rushing through these measures this afternoon, after a most perfunctory debate, the sitting of the other Chamber has been suspended. Yet we know that there is a glut of business in that Chamber. I suppose that when the Estimates reach us we shall be again asked to rush them through. The same reasons will then be urged why honorable senators should not exhaustively criticise them, as has been urged to-day. Is this a proper way in which to conduct our business? We are rushing measures through just as if they were passing through a sausage machine. A change should be made in the treatment to which the Senate has been subjected during the last few weeks. If we do not protest we shall have no improvement. The time is approaching when the Senate should demand to be supplied in good time with a fair share of the business to be dealt with, and not be called upon to rush it through at each week-end or at the end of the session. </para>

It cannot be denied that we are not being properly treated. The Government should bring its business before the Senate in a way that will enable us to give it full and careful consideration. Measures are kept so long before another place that they grow stale, so that when at last they do come before us all interest in them has disappeared. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs whether he can inform me what was the total amount paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith for embankments on contract work on the line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. I desire, also, to refer to the answers which I received yesterday to a question that I put relative to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. I should be much better pleased if the Minister, instead of giving me misleading information, would refrain from supplying any information whatever. I do not say that the honorable senator is responsible for the misleading information of which I complain; but the answers given recently to a question on the same subject by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> were evasive, while the answers given yesterday to the questions which I put - and put in a way that rendered it impossible to evade them - are, I believe, quite incorrect. The answer to one question does not fit in with that given to another. The reply to the first of the series that I put was that the machine to which I referred was not there for the purpose of making turbines. In the next answer the statement was made that the machine was there, but that the process would be slow, as the class of turbines mentioned was of a different character. As a matter of fact, it is not; it is only the gearing that is different. I trust that the Minister will direct his officers to supply proper answers to my questions. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think the Minister of Defence quite understood the purport of a question that I put to him this morning as to whether, in his opinion, it was not advisable to endeavour to impress upon the Imperial defence authorities the necessity of altering the method of censorship applied to war news sent to Australia. My reason for putting the question was that, in this morning&#39;s newspapers, there appeared an official report as to an engagement in the Dardanelles, but in that official report no mention was made of any casualties to Australian troops. There was, however, published an unofficial report stating that in a <inline font-style="italic">communique</inline> issued from Constantinople it was stated that the Allies had suffered a loss of 400 men, whilst some 200, including a number of Australians, had been captured. My contention is that such information should not be allowed to come out here unless side by side with it there can be published an official intimation from the authorities in Great Britain as to its correctness or otherwise. The suspense is worse than a knowledge of the actual facts. In Australia to-day there are no doubt thousands of relatives of Australian soldiers who, because of this unofficial report, are suffering great suspense. They do not know whether it is true or not. Such unofficial reports should not be allowed to leave Great Britain unless there can be published with them either an official confirmation or denial of the information they contain. &#34;Will the Minister make representations to the Imperial defence authorities to that effect? </para>

I know that there is some difficulty in the way of proclaiming the whole of the Navigation Act, owing to the fact that all the regulations necessary under it have not yet been prepared. But will the Minister inquire from his colleague whether there is any insuperable difficulty in the way of proclaiming that part of the Act which deals with the coastal trade? If there is, I should like to be informed whether it cannot be removed by legislation before this evil becomes so pronounced as to make it almost impossible to deal with it. I feel sure that the Senate is anxious to see some part of the Navigation Act brought into force without further delay. Therefore, I again ask the Minister to consult his colleagues, with a view to bringing into operation the part relating to the coastal trade. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McDougall  has not told me in what particular the replies to his questions were contradictory. He is not present now, but during next week I will ask him to supply me with particulars of what he requires. I do not know how  the answers are contradictory. Regarding the question of censorship raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> we must take care that, in trying to avoid one evil, we do not get into a greater evil. One of the severest criticisms launched against the censorship both in England and Australia, in some sections of the press at times, is that the censors are keeping news from the. public. There are two kinds of news, namely, news which comes from official and local sources, and news which is circulated from enemy or neutral sources. Some of the news referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> comes from enemy sources. He suggests that the publication of such news should be stopped until the official account is supplied. That is a very easy suggestion to make; but one can quite conceive a set of circumstances in which great objection would be taken outside. The public might say, &#34;We are not allowed to know; you conceal the facts fromus.&#34; In allowing the publication of enemy communications, the public have the assurance that the worst which can be said is allowed to appear. That is to say, they not only get the British version of what took place, but, side by side with that version, they have a version from Berlin. </para>

                        <para>- No; but the statement is true that the troops have been engaged. The statement that there have been casualties is, so far, only an enemy statement. If we ask the British Government to prevent any of these statements from enemy or neutral sources from coming to Australia until side by side therewith they send their own version, I can imagine some honorable senators rising here in the future and denouncing us for not allowing news from other than official sources to be circulated. However, I will look into the question. There is something to be said for the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion, and I can also see something to be said against it. </para>

                <para class="block">I thought that, perhaps, it might be convenient to honorable senators that any answers to questions which Ministers had available should be given before they separated for the week; but I point out that in our Sessional Orders it is provided that the question, &#34; That the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; shall be put at 4 o&#39;clock on each Friday, and put without debate. The Standing and Sessional Orders were suspended for a specific purpose to-day. That purpose has been accomplished, and it seems to me that it is entirely out of order to have a general discussion going on after 4 o&#39;clock. I wish to announce that, while it is allowed on this occasion, in future it will not be permitted while I have the honour to occupy the chair. </para>

                        <para>-  I have almost completed my reply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has raised a question as to the wages of  assistant  armourers. When he spoke a few days ago I understood him to say that since the matter was reviewed by myself an award has been given by the Federal Arbitration Court in respect of a similar occupation. If that is so, I will see whether the terms of that award justify a review of my decision. </para>
