                        <para>- I have an explanation to make and an apology to offer to honorable senators for my absence when the call of the Senate took place on Thursday last. It will doubtless be recollected that I was in my place in this Chamber, and, as a matter of fact, spoke, during the early portion of Thursday&#39;s sitting. A friend of mine, however, interviewed me here, and. solicited my presence on a matter of some public importance at a place down the city. I therefore accompanied him thither, and upon attempting to return from the bottom end of Collins-street I found myself impeded by the large concourse of people which had gathered to witness the funeral of the late Major-General Bridges. The result was that I reached the parliamentary buildings only to find that the Senate had just risen. I can assure honorable senators that. I was absent in no contumelious spirit, and I hope, therefore, that they will accept my apology. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already informed the Senate., the Department has asked to be supplied with a report in regard to the three officers whom the honorable senator has mentioned. That report has not yet arrived. Wehave, however, informed the Red Cross Society that we have no objection to Lieutenant-Colonel Barrett remaining in Egypt, if he wishes to do so in connexion with &#39;Red &#39;Cross work, but that he must be dissociated entirely from military work. </para>

The Department affords the trustees of those funds every facility in that connexion. At the same time it accepts no responsibility in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that no camp has been the subject of more conflicting reports than has the Liverpool Camp. I have had reports which have condemned it, and others which have upheld it. In view of all the circumstances, I certainly will go carefully into the whole matter as soon as I have sufficient time to do so; and with this end in view I shall probably make a personal inspection of it. Up to the present time, 1 have not arrived at any decision in respect of removing the Camp from its present site, although another camp is being established at another site on the training area, namely, at Holdsworthy. But we have had complaints in regard to Holdsworthy, and one of the complaints made by the men is that it is too far from the railway station, and that if a camp were located there it would be awkward for them whenever they wished to visit Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- So far as the Expeditionary Forces are concerned, in the selection of officers for the higher commands we treat the Commonwealth as a whole. For the command of a brigade we select the officer that in the opinion of the military authorities is best fitted to command, no matter from what State he may come. In regard to subsidiary commands, we endeavour, as far as possible, to select the officers from the State in which the unit is being raised, because of their familiarity with the men of whom they will have the immediate command; but cases sometimes arise in which there is no officer deemed suitable in that particular district. Battalion commanders are sometimes brought from another district, but as a rule they are selected from the district from which the battalion is raised. So far as regards district administration in connexion with the camps, although not necessarily in connexion with the Expeditionary Forces, we treat the military list of the Commonwealth as a whole, calling up any officer we think fit from any district, and sending him to any part of the Commonwealth where we think his services can be made good use of. </para>

                        <para>Is it a fact that intoxicating liquors were dispensed at the launching of the destroyer Torrens last Saturday at Cockatoo Island ? If so, and , in view of the example set by His Majesty the King in abolishing intoxicants from his household during the war period, does the Minister not consider that similar example should be shown at public functions such as the launching of war vessels? Will the Minister take steps to preclude intoxicants being served at future launching ceremonies? </para>

                        <para>. - At this late stage of the debate it is not my intention; to occupy very much time- in the consideration of this measure, because nearly everything that can. be said on the subject has already been said by the different speakers. When we adjourned the discussion on the Bill, I was pointing out that an income tax for war purposes is somewhat similar to a premium for insurance, and, consequently,, the greater amount of property or income enjoyed by a person the greater will be the premium he will be called upon to pay for his insurance. Every one, therefore, will admit that this tax is fair in its incidence, because we know that the greater portion of revenue derived from Customs and Excise duties is paid by the poorer classes of the community.. In no State has this burden been heavier than in Western Australia, where the revenue collected in the first few years of Federation from this source was about &#163;6 per head of the population. I have prepared some figures bearing on this subject, in order that we may know whether, in levying this tax, we shall be going to the extreme, or shall merely get a fair amount of revenue. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> War Budget, if I may be permitted to apply that term to it, the Treasurer estimates that the income tax will bring in something like &#163;4,000,000. In the Commonwealth the total of Customs and Excise revenue is about &#163;1&#39;5,000,000 sterling, collected from about 5,000,000 people, so the income tax will represent rather less than one-third of the Customs duties, whereas in the United Kingdom, instead of the Customs and1 Excise- dutiesbeing&#39; two-thirds  greater than the income tax, the income tax will really produce&#39; the larger amount, thus showing that direct taxation, in the Old Country is. greater than, the indirect taxation through the Customs. </para>

                            <para>- In the total. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George&#39;s War Budget, it is estimated that the income tax will produce- &#163;103,000,000, as against &#163;92,0.00.000 anticipated to be received from- Customs and Excise. It will be seen, therefore, that the wealthy classes in Australia are being let off lightly in connexion with the income tax. </para>

                            <para>- I think I have shown that income taxation here will be lighter than it is in the Old Country. Taxation is not a cheerful subject to contemplate,, but we can accept the principle without any abuse of one political party by the other, because if there- is one subject upon which the two- parties seem to agree, it is the equity of the present war. Both&#39; parties are- pledged to do everything possible to bring it to a successful issue, and, that being so, it is the duty of all sections- of. the community to make an effort to. pay the bill, which is part and parcel- of the horrors of war. We ought to be- able to devise a means of. meeting- that payment without any particular abuse being hurled at either- party or at any individual member of a party.. I am- pleased to- acknowledge that Australia has- some citizens who do pay up in a. very cheerful way. Take, for instance,, the, patriotic attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir- Samuel</inline> McCaughey, of New South Wales. When the- Commonwealth, inflicted upon him; a&#62;  big land tax amounting- to between &#163;17,000 and  &#163;18,000  he is reported to. have written&#171;, when he forwarded his. cheque, that he rejoiced in the fact that: he was in a position to pay such an enormous, tax.. The- cheerful way in which, he paid the tax was undoubtedly an- excellent example to wealthy men, and one which L hope was not singular. Amongst the politicians in Australia there is.  a  man: who has occupied the position of Treasurer of the Commonwealth on more than one occasion, and who ought to. know its revenue requirements. I find that he takes up a very antagonistic attitude to this income tax. He said, of the&#62; Ministry as, a whole, and. of the Treasurer- in particular, that they were taking up a rather discreditable course in imposing an income tax. I happened to be sitting in the gallery of another place very recently while the Income Tax Bill was being discussed, and I heard the Labour party referred to in anything but pleasing terms. I heard words which, if uttered iu the hearing of a stranger who did not know the men constituting the party, would lead him to form the opinion that Labour members were a lot of drones in society, men who have never followed an industrious or thrifty life, men who were more of the loafer and robber type than honest men. Iu fact, to quote the exact words which were used then in reference to the Labour party I find that he said - </para>

                            <para>- I think that the gentleman is very well known. He happens to come from the same State as I do. For the last twenty years I have listened to that kind of criticism from the same source, and therefore it did not come as a surprise to me. If it contained any element of surprise to me ft was that as he grows older he does not seem to grow wiser, and he certainly does not become politer or fairer to his political opponents, because it is statements of that kind which he has been making during the whole of his political life. I say without fear of contradiction that the gentleman I am referring to - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest - has never tried to treat his political opponents with any approach to politeness. As a Labour man who has been in politics for fourteen or fifteen years, I think that I can claim that, until I entered the political arena, I followed quite as industrious a career as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has done. The Labour party here, and .in another place, includes a considerable number of miners, artisans, and men who have worked at manual labour of one kind or another. If there is any ease to be found at such callings I can assure you, sir, that I did not have that experience. I suppose that it has been the experience of every Labour senator that he has had very laborious work to do at his usual avocation. Certainly a gentleman such as the one I have in my mind has followed for about fifty years the arduous calling of a Government servant, performing the Government stroke, and whose jubilee is about to be celebrated in Western Australia. Any one who ever saw the half-starved figure of the gentleman, and the indications of self-denial which are so apparent in his exterior, must admit that he has lived a very hard life indeed, that he has been practising self-denial,  and that his political opponents have had all the ease and the pleasures of life. Those who know the gentleman best are, of course, in a position to know how much self-denial he has practised. I think that the less he talks about industry the better, because ever since he was able to do anything he has avoided the ordinary industries of life, and kept at the Government stroke. It is of no use for us to lecture and talk about being patriotic and ask the country to do great things to help the Mother Land if when, the bill is presented we refuse to meet the responsibility. It is idle to talk about protecting the pockets of the rich and to put the responsibility on to posterity by borrowing the money, remembering the amount which we have already endeavoured to borrow - indeed, the biggest loan ever known in Australian history - has been raised in connexion with this war. </para>

                            <para>- I am not talking about paying the principal. It matters nothing to the taxpayer whether the money raised by the income tax is used to pay the principal or the interest. Undoubtedly we are allowing the rich section of the community to get off much more cheaply and lightly than is permitted in the United Kingdom, and I dare say in other countries. I do not pretend to know what is the rate of taxation adopted by the other parties to this war, or how they are raising revenue, but we do know that the United Kingdom is raising a much larger amount by direct taxation than is Australia. Consequently it ill becomes a man of the type to which I have referred to raise the great objection he has done, and to do so in such an insulting and abusive way. That reminds me that while he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth something like &#163;6 a head was collected in Western Australia by means of Customs duties. I cannot remember a single occasion when he raised the slightest objection to the collection of that money and more if it had been possible to do so. That heavy taxation had to be borne principally by the working people of the State, and never on a single occasion, so far as I am aware, did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest ever express the slightest  word of sympathy for the taxpayers. But now during a war, when the rich are called upon to do their share, nothing but abuse is poured on .the heads of those who are responsible for the introduction of this measure. I hope that the estimate of the yield from the income tax will be more reliable than the estimate of the yield from the probate duty and the- land tax, which, I may say, during the last year has been rather a disappointment. It was estimated that something like &#163;3,700,000 would be collected from those two taxes, but instead less than &#163;2,000,000 was collected. I think that the percentage which we are attempting to raise now by an income tax is not anything too much; but should the estimate exceed the actual collection, then the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest type of politician will have every occasion, I hope, to growl, because it is our duty to raise as much direct taxation as we possibly can. If, after a year&#39;s experience, it is found not to be yielding as much as was estimated. 1 hope  that an addition will be made to the rate. The argument has come from ellis side that much of this kind of taxation may be passed on. I recognise that almost any kind of tax can be passed on more or less. It is difficult indeed to find a tax which may not be passed on to some  extent  but, in my opinion, less of an income tax will be passed on than is possible in the case of Customs and Excise taxation. We know that it will be very difficult for quite a number of persons in the community to pass on the income tax. I refer to men who are receiving a very considerable income, and who, therefore, are quite able to pay their due share of the war expenditure. Senators Grant and Stewart used the argument that this taxation could be passed on. I should like to ask them how they intend to pass on the income tax. If they can show me how it can be done I may be tempted to do it myself. I do not think that Ministers or members of Parliament will be able to pass this income tax on to any one. I do not see how Judges, lawyers, bankers, sharebrokers, mine managers, and mine-owners, or the different officials in our public Departments can pass this tax on. </para>

                            <para>- South Wales is rather far away for me. I find it quite difficult enough to follow what is being done in Australia. I have already shown, however, that the people of the Old Country pay a higher rate of income taxation than the people of Australia are to be asked to pay under this Bill. It would be more to the purpose if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> would tell me how I am to pass on the income tax to some one else.  Another argument that has been used is that this kind of taxation has the effect of keeping capital out of production. That might be said of almost any kind of tax. and I do not think that there is much in that objection. Under an income tax those who are best able to bear taxation are required to contribute the largest amount. It is a just and equitable tax. A business man who may have experienced a bad year is not, under this form of taxation, asked to contribute as much as he would have to contribute in a year of prosperity,, when he would he in a -better position to pay taxation. The incidence of the proposed tax will be fair, and will injure no one. Those who have no income will have nothing to pay, and those who have large incomes will have to .pay taxation in proportion to their incomes. This is about the best form of taxation that could be adopted for the purpose for which it is to be imposed, and I give the proposal my hearty support. </para>

                        Largie that  I .take no exception to the imposition of an income tax for the purpose of providing the money necessary to enable us to -carry on the war. It is unfortunate that .the necessity for the imposition of a .&#39;Commonwealth income tax should arise at a &#39;time when the people of Australia have already to pay heavy .income taxation, to the different State Governments, but we &#39;.have to realize that the war must be effectively financed. I .cannot .forbear pointing out how necessary it is that we should not levy this taxation -to .a greater extent than is .absolutely necessary for war purposes. Attention should also be called .to the duty .imposed upon the Government, in the existing circumstances, to administer the finances in the .most careful manner, and to avoid any unnecessary increase o&#39;f ordinary expenditure. It is &#39;their duty, if possible, to reduce ordinary expenditure where that can be done without injustice to those employed m connexion with Government undertakings. When so many men are going to the &#34;war, and are finding other&#39; avocations, a great opportunity is presented to &#39;the Government to refrain from filling vacancies so created. If they take advantage of that opportunity the people will have some confidence that a real effort is being made at retrenchment. .

                            <para>- I quite agree &#39;with the honorable senator that where men have left public or private employment to give their services to the country by assisting in its defence, when they return from the front, as we hope they will, their positions should be again open to them. It is a very cruel thing indeed that a man who has risked his life in the war should, when he returns to this country, find himself in need of employment. It is true that the Government propose to give such men certain allowances, but they would* not represent anything like the equivalent, of the wages they earned in their previous employment. Statements have appeared in the press to the effect that men* who have returned from the front have applied in vain for re-employment, and in some instances have also vainly sought assistance from the great funds which have been contributed by the people. If these statements be true, they are greatly to the discredit of those who are responsible for such a condition of affairs. I do not believe that the people of this country, who have opened their &#39;heartsand their pockets, and contributed so liberally to these funds, had any idea that the moneys would be invested, and&#39; only the interest upon them used for the assistance of returned soldiers. I believe that these funds were contributed for the purpose of giving the fullest possible assistance to men who -have returned from the war. </para>

I recognise that they are under the control of private individuals,, and not under the control of the &#39;Government. I feel sure that if men who have gone to the front held office under the Commonwealth or &#39;State Governments, they will be liberally treated on their return. Tt is reasonable under present circumstances to look to the Government for the exercise of economy in the ordinary administration o&#39;f the public Departments. It should not be possible, for men to complain that the -Government have increased the &#39;expenditure for this year by something like &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000 in excess of the expenditure for last year. It should not be possible for us to take up a report on the Post and Telegraph Department, and .find that .an enormous number o&#39;f the men are employed in that Department in excess of &#39;the number previously employed. With .increased business we .must -expect an increase in &#34;the number of. employees, but we have it. asserted by the gentleman appointed, to inquire into- the Post and Telegraph Departs ment, that officials, temporary and permanent,, are practically tumbling: over- one another, in that Department in such numbers as to hamper each other in the performance of their duties.  When  our- .public Departments are seen to grow in that way people naturally feel, that an income tax or any other tax proposed should, be examined carefully to see.  Whether  the Government, under the pretence of. raising money to carry on the war,., are not raising money which will be used to further overman an already swollen. Public Service. </para>

                                GOULD. - We have, a Telegraph. Branch and- a Telephone- Branch, and we know that, a man- may get a. telegram! through in decent time if. he pays double rates. I have, known of cases where men sending telegrams from. Sydney to Melbourne have arrived here before their telegrams, unless they have paid double rates.. In spite of the payment, of double rates, the operations of the Department each year still leave us seriously in debt. If we consider the telephone system,, it will be admitted&#39; that it is a continual source of worry to the people. I do not suppose that there is- a business firm or a private individual1 who has to- make much- use of our telephone system who. is not constantly finding some cause of complaint. At the present time people are paying, double or, treble the telephone rates- that they paid under State administration, and yet the Department finds, it- impossible to- make both ends meet. That does not reflect credit upon the Government. I do. hope- that Ministers-will- address, themselves- earnestly to the task of reforming this Department, and that- without, inflicting any- injustice upon its&#62; employees. Personally, I would much prefer to see the- Department con&#62; ducted, by. a. smaller number of.&#39; men in* receipt of. better salaries tha-n by the large number who. are engaged in. conducting its. affairs  to-day. We know that tha&#39; proposed income tax will, prove a very heavy bur

                                It, has- been: stated that, the. rate payable under: it will be . least than is. the-, rate operative in; England).. In this connexion, the case has been: cited; of a, man in the Old Country in receipt o&#163; &#163;10.,.000 per year who: is deriving: an income from Australia, and&#39; it has been&#39; shown that- he will be taxable to the extent of 8s. lOd. in the &#163;L That represents an enormous- impost, but if it be necessary to raise the: money, we have- no* option-but to raise it. Consequently,. I take

                                exception to the rates proposed. I regard an income tax as a very fair impost, because it takes from those who can best afford to pay for the cost of government. The exemption under the Bill has been fixed at &#163;156 a year. That is quite right. But there are a few clauses in the measure which will call for some attention in Committee. The exemptions also extend to the income of a trade union and of an employers union. That is all right. But I wish to direct attention to the many societies which are carried on for purposes other than pecuniary profit. Under the Bill the exemption will extend only to societies which are registered under our Friendly Societies Act, and which are not carried on for pecuniary _ profit. I desire to point out that there are many organizations in the Commonwealth which are not conducted for the purposes of profit. Take the case of a cricket club or a yacht club, or that of a society for the promotion of fine art.

                            <para>- If the honorable senator desires to impose a tax on theatre tickets, he is entering upon a different field altogether. To my mind a football club, a cricket club, or a society for the promotion of fine art ought to be exempt from taxation so long as they are not established for purposes of pecuniary profit. The individual who contributes to the funds of these organizations is not to be allowed to deduct the amount of his contribution from his taxable income. In these circumstances, why should the organizations themselves be taxed? Then it is proposed to exempt contributions to our war funds in excess of &#163;5, and I understand that it is also intended to allow deductions to be made in respect of donations exceeding &#163;20 to charitable institutions in Australia. I wish to know why any arbitrary line should be drawn in this regard. If I can afford to contribute &#163;20 to a charitable institution, why should I be at liberty to deduct that amount . from my taxable income, while the individual who is in a position to give only &#163;5 or &#163;10 is denied a similar right ? </para>

There is still another matter which, to my mind, warrants some consideration. Under the Bill it is provided that where a company borrows money on debentures it shall be deemed to be the agent for each debenture-holder. Now, it is almost impossible for a company to know who holds bearer debentures. If we affirmed that a company must pay certain money on debentures, I would have no objection to urge. But the Bill proposes to make a company the agent for each  debenture-holder  . </para>

                            <para>- I have in my mind a case in which a large capital has been raised by a company, and in which&#39; coupons have been attached to the debentures, which are payable every six months. Anybody may hold these debentures, but how we are going to make the company an agent for each debenture-holder is something that I cannot understand. Then there is the provision relating to partners. I believe it is contemplated that if A and B are in partnership they shall be assessed as one individual. Under the State income tax they are not charged in that way. They have to furnish a return showing the total income derived from the partnership, and how it has been apportioned. Each partner then has to pay upon the amount apportioned to him. The clause in this Bill, however, provides that partners shall be assessed on the income derived by them as partners as if it had been derived by a single person and without regard to their respective interests. Thus we are departing from the principle which has been laid down in our State Income Tax Acts. I come now to the case of trustees. Let me deal with the case of a trustee company, or even of the individual trustees of an estate. Let me assume that an income derivable from an estate is &#163;5,000 annually, and that it has to be distributed amongst twenty beneficiaries. Under this Bill the estate will be assessed at the rate that is payable in respect to the income of &#163;5,000 a year, although no beneficiary will be getting more than &#163;200, &#163;300, or &#163;400 a year out of it. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out this difficulty, and that the Minister intends to rectify it. </para>

                            <para>- In other words, the trustee company, instead of being made liable to pay the tax in the first instance, would pass it on to the beneficiaries, who would be liable to pay it to the Government in the ordinary way. I do not know whether that is the way the honorable senator contemplates, but it occurs to me that it would be a fair way, and would not allow anybody to escape the fair amount of taxation to which he was liable. I have not had an opportunity to study the Bill closely, but I assume that its provisions are generally of the character to be found in Income Tax Bills, protecting the Government and the individual equally from the possibility of unfair or inequitable treatment. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that it is&#39;, when I cite the case of a man who will be called on to pay 8s. lOd. in the &#163;1 on his income. People who have been living up to their incomes will, I think, find it necessary to retrench, and will probably take the line of least resistance by discontinuing a great deal of employment, and refraining from making improvements. That sort of thing will interfere materially with the poorer classes, who must necessarily feel the loss of employment. Builders in Sydney tell me that the amount of new work now going on, or being provided for, has been very materially lessened. I believe not half as much building will be undertaken there during the next year as hitherto, and the same will probably apply throughout the Commonwealth. That point must be  borne in mind. If we can do with a tax of1s in the &#163;1, there is no virtue in charging, 2s. If we tax only to the extent required, and on a proper basis, every man will pay a  fair  and adequate amount towards the cost of financing the war. I quite agree with an interjection made when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was speaking, that the war will practically have to be financed by means of loan money. Our aim in imposing, taxation should be to obtain ample means to pay interest, and whatever sinking fund is thought desirable, although I very much. fear that the sinking fund will be used to meet other expenditure ; but once we have made that, provision, we shall have done our fair share towards meeting the cost of the war, which is being waged, not alone for those now living, but for those yet unborn. Unless we can keep our end up, the war will be a serious matter for the people to-day and tomorrow. If the tide of civilization and freedom is turned back, the cost in blood and treasure  will  be enormous. Those who come after us will be affected for good or ill by the result, and it is only fair that they should find their proper proportion of the cost. To attempt to meet the cost of the war, or any substantial portion of it, out of ordinary income would be to put an undue burden on the people of the present day. It would be going the right way to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. You may easily destroy your people by excessive taxation, and the result would affect the poorer man , although he may not pay the tax directly, quite as much as the wealthier man. </para>

Take the case of a racing club that receives &#163;2,000 in one day, and offers &#163;1,500 in prizes, the gross profit of that day would be only &#163;500. All sporting clubs established for genuine sport usually collect just sufficient funds to carry on. the club from year to year, and, therefore, they will not be affected in the slightest degree by this amendment. The only clubs that will be exempted will be, as I have shown, the Melbourne Cricket Club, the Australian Jockey Club, and the Victorian Racing Club, and similar institutions and I am quite satisfied that those connected with such clubs are sports enough not to ask for exemption at a time like this. </para>

We might just as well ask, why should a society registered under a Friendly Societies Act of the Commonwealth or a State not pay taxation, when the smaller sporting societies to which I have referred are required to pay? If the principle of exemption is good with regard to societies registered under the Friendly Societies Act, why should it not hold good in respect of societies not so registered ? </para>

If any income is not for the benefit of any individual person it does not seem to be a fit subject for taxation. The Minister will probably have read in this morning&#39;s papers a statement to the effect that the Victoria Racing Club have decreased the amount of prize money at the forthcoming spring meeting with the object of not only inflicting hardship upon horse-owners, but of making certain that there will be a substantial profit, which, I am given to understand, will be handed over to one of the patriotic funds for the benefit of our soldiers. </para>

                            <para>- But is the money expended in such a way as to bring pecuniary profit to the members of the organization? It seems to me that in all probability we shall have to tap other sources of revenue before we are finished. I am not insensible of the fact that the various State Governments have thought that the large attendances at sports gatherings are a suitable subject for taxation. Although such a means of taxation has not yet been resorted to, it has been discussed in State legislative circles. But T think it is unwise to tax the prospective profits of organizations, such as those alluded to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> which come forward so loyally and patriotically and intend to do more in the future in connexion with the subsidizing of funds, especially for the benefit of our soldiers. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;5.3&#93;.- While the Assistant Minister says that the organizations will be exempt, it must be borne in mind that their exemption is only to be arrived at in the event of their giving whatever profit they make either to a charitable institution or to a war fund. It must not be forgotten, too, that every man who belongs to an organization of that kind will pay the tax in respect to his subscription. For instance, a man who pays a subscription of &#163;20 a year to a club will be taxable on that amount, but the Bill provides that the people to whom he subscribes the money shall also pay the tax, and so it might go on

                        If the Assistant Minister gives a subscription to the Victoria Racing Club, he gets tickets for the races and obtains certain privileges, but he does not receive a single sixpence from the club, no matter how successful it may be. Why should its funds be taxed in a particular way?

                        <para>. - I think that we are very largely beating the wind. I have asked for a concrete case of any body which ought to be exempt that is not exempted. How will the provision work out?&#39; Take, for instance, a tennis club, which, of course, is not organized. My honorable friend is evidently afraid that it may be taxed. It will be treated as a company. If it makes a profit it will undoubtedly be taxed; but when does a tennis club have a profit? And when, too, does an ordinary cricket club have a profit? It is only when the Victorian Football Association begins to run semifinals and finals that a large profit is made. As much as &#163;1,100 may be taken on the Melbourne Cricket ground next Saturday. If the footballers wish to get out of the payment of this tax, let them follow the worthy example of the racing men and give the whole of the profits of that match to the patriotic funds. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;5.10&#93;.- I am not quite clear as to how far this clause will affect persons who are engaged in business. A certain amount of stock has to be disposed of before a man can have any profits to convert into stock-in-trade. Suppose that he re-invests the money in the purchase of fresh stock, will that be taxable?

                        <para>. - Suppose that a man starts at the beginning of a year for which the assessment is made with &#163;10,000 worth of stock. He may turn that stock&#34; over, but he will have the exemption of the &#163;10,000 in stock. Men do not as a rule sell or buy stock for the fun of the thing. If they buy &#163;10,000 worth of stock they generally endeavour to sell it for at least &#163;12,000 or &#163;14,000. In the event of a man turning over his stock, and re-stocking, he will still be allowed &#39;the .exemption of the &#163;10,000 he had in capital. If he makes a profit of &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000 in turning the stock over, that amount will be taxable, because it will be income as differentiated from capital. </para>

                        GOULD (New South. Wales) &#91;5.13&#93;.- It must &#34;be remembered that in earning a profit of &#163;2,000 6r &#163;3,000 a man will have to meet&#39; the ordinary expenses of living and carrying on the business. A. provision of this character will, I think, have a tendency to deter a .man from increasing the value of his stock-in-trade. If a man starts to trade with &#163;10,000 worth of stock, practically what the clause does is to limit him to that amount, and he will not be able to increase the value of his stock without having in the first instance to pay toll to the Government. In other words, if he wants to put &#163;2,000 of his profits into new stock he will have to pay toll to .the Government in respect to that amount, and then the value of his stock will .run up to something like &#163;10,000. We ought to ,do all in our power to encourage a man to increase and enlarge his business. If a trader has the misfortune to &#39;lose a couple of thousand pounds he will get no consideration, practically, in respect to the loss. Why should he not be dealt with in the same way when he has the good fortune to make a profit to that extent ?

                        <para>. - It is not very often that in considering a taxation measure an honorable senator rises to suggest that the scale of taxation proposed may be somewhat too low. Without committing myself to that view straightway, I should like to ask the Minister why it is deemed that the profit derived from the sale of foreign goods is only &#163;5 per cent, upon the price at which the goods were sold. We have to consider that the agent is an agent for a trade absentee. I understand that the settled fiscal policy of the Commonwealth is one of Protection, and it occurs to me that in this connexion we might do something to encourage Australian trade. I am of opinion that people who export goods to Australia on a very large scale are not satisfied with a .profit of 5 per cent. No doubt the Government have consulted their experts in fixing the profit at this rate, but perhaps the Minister will be able to inform the Committee as to the manner in which the 5 per cent, has been arrived at. Many of these trade absentees are foreigners, and many of them were inhabitants of countries that are now hostile to us. I feel sure that they make a great -deal more &#34;than &#34;5 per cent, profit on -their -exports to Australia. Without committing myself to the &#39;view that &#39;5 per -cent, -is too low to adopt as a standard, I ask the Minister -to explain how it has been arrived at. </para>

I could refer to some who are not making 5, 10, or 15, but up to 25, per cent, profit and more. I think that 5 per cent, is a very low estimate. If the clause passes in its present form I think that our experience will indicate the necessity for increasing the rate. I should be prepared to support an amendment fixing; the rate of profit at 10 per cent. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;5.21&#93;.- Honorable senators have to bear in mind that in considering the profit made on goods sent into this country the absentee traders have to take into account the cost of the administration of their business. Considerable expense is often necessarily involved in canvassing the country, in advertising, and in the upkeep&#39; of agencies. While I am not prepared to say that no more than 5 per cent, profit is. made in many instances, we&#62; must. have, regard to the average profit made.. Many goods sent out do- not catch on with the public. They are found to be unsuitable, and a loss is made upon them. On another class, of goods a. profit of 10 or 15 per cent., may be made after paying all expenses. This has to go* to meet the loss on unsaleable lines, and so the- average profit is reduced. I suggest, that the Government might require the. agents of absentee traders to submit returns of their businesses, showing what expenses hav&#174; been properly incurred&#39; in connexion therewith, and what profit has&#39; really been made,, and let that be the basis of taxation.. By that means, the difficulty which has been suggested could be overcome.

For the information of honorable senators I may give a simple illustration. I take the case of a mining company with an income of &#163;1,000 per year, capital expended on plant, &#163;5,500, less profits distributed or otherwise, &#163;500, leaving a total of &#163;5,000. Years during which mine is estimated to be payable, say, ten years. Dividing the &#163;5,000 by ten we get &#163;500, the amount on which income tax is assessable. </para>

                        <para>. - The only trustworthy means of determining the life of a mine is afforded by the extent of its ore reserves. The life of a mine can only be guessed if we attempt to estimate it beyond the life it may be expected to have judging by its ore reserves actually disclosed and tested. The language of the clause is rather vague. Unless the Department administering the Act is willing to accept the computations of responsible officers of mining companies, the vagueness of the language of this clause may give rise to a good deal of friction between the taxing department and mining companies. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very difficult matter to decide, and I would not lightly attempt to interfere with the language of the clause. Naturally the administration will wish to see the amount of capital which may be deducted within a given year reduced by the extension of the period for which it may be deducted. As one who has had some connexion with mining operations, a word of wisdom to the administration may be of some account. I believe that if the responsible officials of mining companies are confided in, and if their estimates of ore reserves and of the length of time during which their companies are likely to continue operations, be accepted, the clause will operate satisfactorily. But if, on the other hand, the Department raises unnecessary obstacles, a good deal of unpleasantness will be occasioned.  I hope that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will he sensibly administered, and that no unnecessary irritation will be caused to mining companies. </para>

As a matter of fact, I would like to see an even lower amount fixed as the exemption in this connexion, but I recognise the difficulty to which the honorable gentleman has referred.

                            <para>- I recognise the difficulty that may be experienced in getting returns which will satisfy the Commissioner that the deductions are being honestly made. But I would suggest that the amount of &#163;5 should be adhered bo, and that by regulation it should be declared that no such deduction will be allowed in the absence of receipts for the contributions which taxpayers claim to have made. That would overcome the difficulty which the Assistant Minister has stressed. I need scarcely point out that gifts of &#163;5 in the aggregate may be made up of contributions of 10s. each, and that in such circumstances the task of verifying the claims will be just as difficult as it would be in the case of larger amounts. </para>

                        <para>. - We all recognise that our charitable institutions must be supported. It is not the usual practice in connexion with contributions to these organizations to ask a taxpayer for receipts. People recognise that if they do not give up to a certain standard they will inevitably be taxed, because our charitable institutions must be maintained. The Government do not think that a man who is receiving more than &#163;156 a year is particularly generous if he contributes <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> annually to these organizations, but when an individual gives something in excess of &#163;20 - it may be a donation of &#163;20,000, or even of &#163;100,000 - it is only right that he should be allowed to deduct that amount from his taxable income. To my mind, the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is a little too small to bother about. If every taxpayer who claims the right to deduct from his taxable income the amount of his contributions to charitable institutions is obliged to produce receipts for those contributions, we shall require to employ a staff of clerks for the purpose of checking the receipts. In such circumstances we should collect a larger revenue by discarding the receipts and accepting all the statements contained in the schedules of taxpayers. </para>

But there must surely be some check upon the statements of taxpayers.

                            <para>- It is putting it at a low figure to assume that the banks have at least 10 per cent of capital to call up, and at a time like the present they might think it desirable to call it up, not because they are not doing well, but because world conditions generally are not satisfactory. In a case of that kind! the. individual would be putting something into capital, and it would be fair to allow him to deduct only 5 per cent. Calls in a mining company are, generally speaking, a different proposition. </para>

There are in the various States Employers.&#34; Liability Acts under which employees may recover compensation for injuries received in working hours through the carelessness of the employer or of fellow employees, and in order to circumvent the provisions of those Acts the employers have established funds to which they themselves contribute, and to which the employees are also invited to contribute, but the money is only recoverable by the employee conditionally on his agreeing not to proceed against the employer under the terms of the Employers&#39; Liability Act. The effect is to completely destroy the provisions of such Acts, contrary to the intention of Parliament. </para>

In that case would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> not allow that employer to deduct &#39;such an amount from his income :as a legitimate and regular expenditure? </para>

                        <para>. - I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the totally insufficient &#39;sum to be deducted in respect of each child under the age of sixteen years. The settled policy of the Government is to encourage the .growth of population, and I understand that was the object of the &#163;5 maternity bonus. I notice in this morning&#39;s newspaper that a learned professor has stated that the maternity bonus probably has had some effect in the desired direction; but I submit that a deduction of &#163;13 is altogether insufficient. That deduction is made by some of the States, which, until recently, wore very much more in need of revenue than the Commonwealth, and if the Commonwealth has been in the habit of doing; things on a very much larger scale, because of its greater revenue, and because the destinies of the nation have been committed to its care, it would not be out of place to allow a much larger deduction than &#163;13. </para>

                            <para>- But we have to pay money out under the War Pensions Act, and in this case we are merely making a deduction. I might say that only the national financial limitations will constrain me from increasing the payment under the War Pensions Act when an opportunity arises ; but I ask the Minister, if he were a justice of the peace sitting on the Bench in connexion with a maternity case, would he not allow an unfortunate girl mother a larger sum than 5s. a week for a child ? It must not be forgotten that single men with incomes of &#163;3 a week are exempt from taxation. Probably some of them are supporting aged parents; but, generally speaking, a single man with an income of &#163;3 per week, and nobody depending upon him, is by no means in an unenviable position. </para>

                        <para>. - I will not attempt to controvert what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has said in regard to the cost of maintaining a child. I know what it is, and I know that &#163;13 is not sufficient; but I ask the honorable senator not to put the Senate in an illogical position. When we were asked, under the War Pensions Act, to make provision for the maintenance of a child of a deceased soldier who was killed in the service of his country, we were generous enough to allow a widow &#163;13 per year in respect of each child under the age of sixteen years. In common with other members of this Parliament, I deliberately said that, after considering the question in all its aspects, &#163;13 was a fair amount. It would be illogical, therefore, if I now sanctioned a proposal to increase the amount in this Bill. As one who will claim exemption in respect of three children under this Bill, it would be illogical for me to say that it would cost &#163;20 or &#163;25 to keep the child of an ordinary citizen, but that &#163;13 was sufficient to keep the child of a soldier who had lost his life. I ask the honorable senator not to press the amendment. Possibly, on some future date, I shall be prepared to consider the question of increasing the amount, and to permit the ordinary citizen receiving a pension to claim payment at the same rate, whether it be 20s. or 25s. But do not let us treat this proposal differently and so put the Senate in an illogical position. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> not to press his amendment to a division, because that would be unfair to the feelings of most members of the Committee, who, I believe, are willing to accept &#163;13 as a very fair compromise. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that the Assistant Minister has argued logically. In the first place, there is <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> parallel between the pensions to war orphans and the exemptions in this clause. I have already said that if it were possible I should be prepared to vote for an increase in the pensions to widows and children under the War Pensions Act. It is only because of the wrong policy adopted and the problematical number of the widows and the orphans that we are unable at present to make a much more generous provision. But the Assistant Minister must not forget that while we are allowing a pension for a child under the War Pensions Act, we are also allowing something to the mother, and it is not inconceivable that in. a country like Australia she will be capable of earning a little money. I admit that the payment to the war widows and children is, so far as I am concerned, only an interim payment. If after the war is ended we can provide them with more money, I shall be prepared to vote accordingly ; but at present we are considering an Income Tax Assessment Bill, not only as an instrument for raising revenue, but for certain other considerations, which, indirectly obtrude themselves upon us. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the Assistant Minister is too sensible to set up such a contention as that the widow will not have to do that. I submit that in a country like our own, where every instrument of taxation should be availed of, if it has an indirect influence in promoting the  interest  of the country, where it is so necessary that we should have a large population, and where it is admitted a family averages three or four children, we might quite reasonably raise the exemption in this clause so as to place the married man in the position of not being called upon to pay the tax until he has an income of &#163;216 or &#163;217, when we exempt a single man with an income of &#163;156. I have said that I would not pledge myself to exempt any income from taxation, but there should be a certain equity observed when we are discussing the matter of exemptions. We ought to do something in the way of justice and common sense. I am sure that if the Assistant Minister were a justice of the peace adjudicating on a claim for provision for the children of a family he would hold himself in contempt if he did not order the payment of more than 5s. a week for a child. Therefore, not with any desire to embarrass the&#34; Administration or to obstruct the passage of the Bill, I must seek for an increase of the exemption from &#163;13 to &#163;20, and I think that in doing that I am most parsimonious. </para>

                        <para>. - The argument of the Assistant Minister seems to me to be fraught with great possibilities and great danger. He says that, because we fixed on &#163;13 as the pension payable in respect to a child under the War Pensions Act, we ought to adhere to that amount as the exemption under this Bill. In other words, if we made an error in regard to the war pension, we should repeat it here. That is, I think, a very dangerous doctrine. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said, I think, that he voted for a pension of &#163;13, feeling at the time that it was not adequate, and that now he wishes to adhere to that sum. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> pointed out, the cases are entirely different. In one case we made provision for the widow and the children of a deceased soldier - not necessarily for their whole and sole maintenance. We do not expect that the widow and the children are to sit still, do nothing, and live on what the Commonwealth gives them. We did not profess for a moment that that amount was to defray the whole cost of their maintenance. What this amendment seeks to do is to make a reasonable reduction from a taxpayer&#39;s income of the actual cost of maintaining his children. The cases are entirely different. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has suggested that if the Assistant Minister were on a Bench to decide a maternity case, in all probability he would allow more than 5s. a week for the child. I also think that he would. But what would be the position in the case of a person who is bound by an order of the Court to pay a certain sum for the maintenance of an illegitimate child? If an order of 7s. 6d. per week is made against him, will he not be able to show that there is an actual payment out of his income in respect to which he is entitled to the deduction of that sum per week? The parent of a child born in wedlock will be entitled only to a deduction of &#163;13. It seems: to me that the. father of an illegitimate child can put up a very good claim that he is entitled to deduct from his income more than that sum. Is that a desirable state of things to set up ? Is it not penalizing, so to speak legitimacy? I hope that the Minister will see the desirableness of having an exemption more in keeping with the situation, such as the &#163;20 suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - The suggestion to increase the amount of the exemption allowed in respect to children has come from a very strange political quarter., Nowadays I am prepared to hear of almost anything occurring; but; when we find the party which, in the past, did so much to saddle the burden of taxation on the. shoulders of those least able to bear it, striving to outrival the Labour party, we are justified in assuming that there is something more than a genuine desire behind this proposal. It has been suggested from time to time that this form of taxation is of a class character, and, therefore, must necessarily exempt some sections of society. In this measure we endeavoured to hold the scale evenly between those who can pay the tax and those who cannot. But now it is urged that we have not done the fair thing. </para>

                            <para>- It has been implied very clearly in the suggestions which have been made during the last three or four minutes. In the circumstances, we are justified, I think, in believing that there is nothing genuine behind this attempt to force the Government to change their attitude, because we know from an experience extending over a. number of years that whenever an attempt was made to equalize the burden of taxation, it came rather from the Labour party than from its opponents. It is much too late in the day for our friends on the other side to talk as, they are now doing, because the conduct of their party is ample proof that, on the present occasion, they are not squaring the precepts of the present with the actions of the past. Before I am put: in a false light, sir, I repudiate the suggestions from honorable senators on your left, that I am less a sympathiser with those who cannot bear the burden of taxation than they are. </para>

                            <para>- I have been saying that such a proposal as is represented by the amendment, coming from representatives of the Liberal party in. this Chamber, may be regarded as a gift from the Greeks; and we are justified in being suspicious of this unusual solicitude on the part of honorable senators of the type of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> for the poorer taxpayers having families to support. The Bill now before us is the result of careful study extending over a long period. Its object is to impose the burden of taxation as equitably as possible. This is the first taxation measure in which the children of taxpayers have been taken into account. This was to be expected from a Government who may be trusted to hold the scales evenly between the different sections of the community. I cannot understand the strange zeal for the poorer sections of the community which has been exhibited to-night by members of a party that in the past has resisted every attempt made to adjust the burden, of taxation equitably. </para>

                            <para>- The whole career of the party to which the honorable senator belongs bears witness to the truth of my statement. The members of the Liberal&#39; party have always been liberal enough to themselves, but when they have been called upon to impose the burden of taxation upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it, they have never been found equal to the task. In the circumstances I refuse point-blank to be placed in a false position by the amendment submitted by the other side. In this Bill the position of the less well-to-do taxpayers has been taken into account, and it is proposed to permit of a certain exemption in the case of children. A taxpayer with a large family will under this measure escape a share of taxation, one with a moderate family will escape a lesser share of taxation, and taxpayers who have no family will receive no special exemption. Honorable members opposite, who are trying by the amendment to paint the lily, and to add another hue to the rainbow, may rest assured that their device will be seen through clearly by the electors who are watching this matter-. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the  election which is only about two years distant has had much to do with inspiring the .action .of certain .honorable senators in connexion with this Bill. I repeat that I refuse to &#39;be placed in a false position toy this amendment. This is the most , equi table income tax measure in the feature under discussion : ever introduced in &#39;a .British Parliament, and yet  honorable  senators opposite want to go one better, because they desire to placard themselves before &#39;.the electors as the genuine friends of the  poorer  sections of the  community.  That &#171;an be easily contradicted, because we shall &#39;be able, as we have done in the past, to .put our side of the .case before the electors from the public platforms, and to show our honorable .friends opposite in their  true  light. I believe that the clause is a reasonable one, and I refuse, by supporting the amendment, to be  dragged  at the tail end &#60;ot the Liberal  remnant  in this chamber, who .are attempting on the present occasion to place the -party -to which I belong in .a false light. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, the fact remains that I have been responsible to a certain extent for putting upon the statute-book of Tasmania a taxation measure very much more liberal than the Bill now before us, and, in the circumstances, that I should be accused of an attempt to gain kudos in the eyes of the electors by suggesting something more liberal in the way of exemptions for married people with large families than is proposed by this Bill is somewhat singular. I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that there -are special sections in the Tasmanian Income Tax Act which give widows with children more liberal treatment than is given to the ordinary taxpayer. There are many provisions in the Tasmanian Act of a more liberal character, considering the circumstances in which it was passed, than those which are to be found in this Bill. That, in the circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should hold this Bill up to us as a quite symmetrical measure which ought not to be interfered with is a little over the odds. </para>

If the honorable senator will peruse publications a century old he will find that proposals were long ago placed upon the statute-book which he would lead us to believe have been due to the Labour party, and he might evolve a new school of philosophy, and would probably learn something of which at the present time he has very little knowledge. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friends opposite have fallen lamentably short in the efforts they have made on behalf of the poorer class. The real difference between honorable senators on this side and members of the party opposite is that, while we both desire to make the position .U. the poorer class better, honorable senators opposite propose at the same time to reduce the rich to a condition of indigence. We recognise that whilst we have the responsibility of bettering the conditions of certain classes of the community, it is not incumbent upon us to act as the Greek tyrant did who went through a corn-field and whisked off all the heads of the taller ears of corn. We do not believe in making the rich poor, but in making the poor rich. Throughout the whole of the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> ran a thread of vindictiveness against the wealthy merely because they are wealthy. I have submitted the amendment because I believe that a deduction of &#163;13 for every child under sixteen years of age is lamentably insufficient. I am honestly of opinion that &#163;20 would be a fairer thing. When I submitted my proposal, an honorable senator interjected that I should have moved to make the deduction &#163;26. But as the Assistant Minister - if he were a justice of the peace - would -probably adjudge that 7s. 6d. per week fairly represents the cost of supporting a child, I think that we may very well include in this Bill an exemption on that basis. Consequently I have been content to submit a proposal in favour of an exemption of &#163;20 in the case of each child under sixteen years of age. That will afford relief to the best class of the community - that class which takes on family responsibilities, and has to depend upon a weekly stipend to discharge those responsibilities. </para>

                        had proposed an exemption of &#163;26 in the case of each child, and honorable senators upon this side of the chamber had opposed it, no man would have been louder in his denunciation of them than would
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline>
                        The honorable senator gave his position entirely away when he said that he feared the Greeks: when they brought gifts, because that was an admission that he is prepared to judge this proposal, not upon its merits, but upon its source of origin. I would remind him that this is not the first occasion - apart from the example of Tasmania - upon which a similar provision has been inserted in an Income Tax Bill. In New South Wales a deduction of &#163;50 is allowed in the case of each child.

                            <para>- Yes. A smaller deduction is made in Western Australia. Yet the honorable senator has declared that this is the most liberal taxation measure that has ever been submitted to a British Parliament. In Western Australia the exemption allowed for every child is &#163;10, and in New South Wales it is &#163;50. Yet the honorable senator, because we think that a deduction of &#163;13 for every child is utterly inadequate, and suggest that it should be increased to &#163;20, holds up his hands in pious horror. I say that we should deal with this matter on its merits. I am content to stand by the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap.</inline> It is a much fairer proposal than is that of the Government, which will afford very little relief to the more wealthy classes of the community. On the other hand, we have to remember that to men with limited incomes the amount of the exemption is very important. </para>

                        <para>. - Since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> spoke upon this question I have taken the trouble to make myself familiar with the position which obtains in  certain of the States. I have learned that the honorable senator is either quite unacquainted with the facts, or that he has made statements which cannot bear scrutiny. The position in Tasmania is that a certain deduction is allowed for every child, but that deduction is rigidly limited to incomes of less than &#163;150 of taxable value. In other words, any person with a taxable income in excess of that amount receives no allowance whatever for the children which he has to maintain. This clause, which proposes to authorize a deduction of &#163;13 for every child under sixteen years of age, is the most liberal provision - with the exception of that operative in New South Wales - that has ever been brought before any Parliament. Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> does not know the income tax law of his own State, otherwise he would scarcely have affirmed that it is a more liberal form of taxation- </para>

                            <para>- Because we have not the wherewithal. If we had brought forward a heavier income tax, we might have been -accused of extravagance. The fact that New South Wales grants an exemption of &#163;50 :for -every child under sixteen years of -age &#39;ought not -to influence us i-n this matter. Personally, -I -do not think that that amount is a -penny too much. &#39;But we &#39;have to recollect that when New South Wales enacted that legislation we were not called upon to provide hundreds of millions of pounds to take our share in fighting the battles in which the Empire is now engaged. What is the position -as it has been put by honorable senators opposite? They have pleaded the case of the &#34;poor&#34; children. Senator Gould has had the &#34;poor &#34;  mouth  all day. He wanted the &#34;poor &#34; Australian Jockey -Club and the &#34; poor &#34; crocket clubs .exempted. I would like to make an exemption of &#163;50 in the case  lOt-  -every child under sixteen years of age. </para>

The Government are called upon &#39;to obtain revenue, and we cannot obtain it if we are to grant an exemption &#171;very time that we feel sentimental. If the amendment had been bought forward at any other time, I would have been -glad to support it.

It is true &#39;that an increase df a few pounds in the deduction might not make -a -great deal of difference, but honorable senators opposite have wanted nothing but exemptions since they came here to-day. If the Government yielded to all these requests, which, individually, might amount only to small sums, T doubt whether in the aggregate &#34;we should get enough money&#39; to carry on the &#34;war. </para>

The two Bills are not so interrelated as to make that necessary. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> pointed out, the putative father of an illegitimate child would probably be ordered by the Bench to pay, not 5s., but 7s. 6d. per week.

                            <para>- We all agree that that amount is.  not  adequate, but in passing the War Pensions Act Parliament did not purport to give to- the widow and children of a deceased soldier such a* sum as would enable them to do nothing for the rest of their lives. In this case we are purporting to tax the man s income, and in order to ascertain his net income we must ascertain what he has left after discharging certain obligations, one of which is the maintenance of his children. We all agree that &#163;13 is not enough to maintain a child for a year. Why, then, cannot we allow more, seeing that we want to arrive at the income which a man receives, less the deductable expenses ? I should not have, spoken tonight but for Senator&#39;s Lynch &#39;s outburst. He said he would shed light on the situation, but a reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> book goes to show that he was wrong in saying that this was the. first instance- of the introduction of a liberal measure containing a provision of this kind.  His,  own State has had a similar provision, and so have New South Wales and Tasmania, and I still think that Tasmania was the first to. give legislative recognition to the principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap;</inline> was interested in doing this. Then what is more natural than that he should seek to give effect to it in this atmosphere in the best possible way, if he could not induce the Tasmanian Parliament to do better than it did ? Why he in doing it, and I in supporting it, should be animadverted on as we have been by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I am. at a loss- to know, if this Chamber is to retain its character as a deliberative assembly., One, would infer from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said, that if anything is proposed_ from this side,. its merits will be absolutely ignored and only its origin taken into consideration. Apparently, men, and not measures or the merits of those measures, will determine the honorable senator&#39;s attitude towards them. </para>

                        <para>. - Not more than a week ago I said I would take my full share of responsibility for placing this Government measure on the statute-book, because I did not indulge in any lip-service when I&#39; said I. wanted to give the Government a full measure of loyal support. They have had it, but perhaps it has not been greatly valued because the numerical strength on this side is not great. They have had as much support as we have been able to accord them, but surely that support did not involve the abrogation of our right, to improve the details of any taxation measure and make it more equitable and suitable to the hard and hardening conditions of the people, particularly the married people of the community? In order to completely free myself from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> imputation that I, or anybody associated with me, was seeking a superior electoral standing in the eyes of the citizens, I am prepared, if the Government will agree to increase this deduction.,, to vote to reduce the exemption for single persons from &#163;156 to &#163;125 per annum. In Tasmania there is a discrimination between married and unmarried persons. Incomes under &#163;80 are exempt in the case of unmarried persons, or- of &#163;100 in the case of married persons, widows-, and widowers maintaining at least one child&#39; under the age- of sixteen-. If the Government are afraid that this amendment will substantially reduce the amount returned! by the tax- to- the national exchequer, I am prepared, in order to show that I am not seeking votes, to vote- to reduce the- exemption for unmarried persons to- &#163;125. Single persons receiving &#163;126 and over are more fitted to pay some taxation at this juncture than are married people- receiving incomes of &#163;156 and over. If the Minister will not accept that challenge, let us hear no more of this charge of endeavouring to improve our standing with the electors, because we address ourselves, as is our duty, to the consideration, of the details of a measure which has already been adopted without division on its first and second readings. </para>

Suppose a taxpayer is in a partnership with two or three different people in different concerns, what will be the position ? For instance, &#34; A &#34; and &#34; B &#34; might be in one business, &#34; A &#34; and &#34; C &#34; in another, and &#34;A&#34; and &#34;D&#34; in another.

                GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;8.52&#93;.- When speaking on the second reading, I put a case that will be touched by this clause. Suppose a company has issued bearer debentures with coupons attached for the payment of interest - how will that work under a clause of this character? The company will not know who are the holders of these debentures, and will not know how to deduct any money they may have been paid. Again, it might so happen that a debenture-holder will have made a return, and paid his income tax in respect of the interest he had derived from the debentures, and the company that issued the debentures would have no way of ascertaining whether that had been done or not. Is it not possible to make some alteration in the clause to get over the difficulty ?

It is almost impossible to deal with the clause on any equitable basis as it stands at present. There is another difficulty. Suppose the company has issued bearer debentures, and there is
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline>
                    payable on each debenture, how much will be deducted in respect of income tax on them ? At present the clause presents all sorts  of  difficulties.

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;8.57&#93;.- In regard to this clause, which deals with the assessment of partners, some explanation is necessary. Take the case of a firm in which there are four partners, and assume that their earnings total &#163;2,000 a year, so that each partner will be entitled to draw &#163;500. Is it fair that each should be taxed as if he had received an income of &#163;2,000 ? If we are going to say that the partnership firm is to be taxed as if there were just one income, we shall be outraging the ordinary principle of justice. I can conceive that when the clause was put into the Bill, in the first instance, attention had not been drawn to this aspect of the case; and 1 would point out now that it is not fair to place partners in that position. Something ought to be done to relieve them. I am quite sure that a clause could readily be obtained from one of the State Acts to get over the difficulty if it is desired to have a specific provision dealing with partners.

                    <para>.- The honorable senator is quite mistaken as to the power of the clause dealing with partners. Partners will be taxed as individuals, in so far as the profits of the partnership are distributed, but they will be taxed collectively on the undistributed profit. That is to say, if a partnership business made &#163;10,000 profits, and after dividing &#163;5,000 amongst the partners, put the other &#163;5,000 into the firm, they would pay collectively on the latter amount on the higher scale. </para>

                        <para>- I point out to the Minister that it may be considerably afterwards when a man may have his income re-assessed, and that then he may have altered his whole position. On the first occasion he may have been carrying on a business solely, but on the second occasion he may be in partnership. Or on the first occasion he may have been in partnership, and some years after it was determined the Commissioner may require a re-assessment of his income for a particular year, and it may be impracticable, or perhaps impossible, for him to obtain tha books by which the re-assessment can be verified or otherwise. Again, a man may have been carrying on business in one State, and paying the income tax, but three or four years afterwards, when he is in another State and has rid himself entirely of everything belonging to the previous business, his income may be reassessed, and he will have no means of checking the re-assessment. I think that there should be some limitation instead of using the words &#34; at any time.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> sounds all right at first, but,  unfortunately, in some of the States the authorities are going back now ten or twelve years. The statute of limitations has been practically set aside in this matter. I understand that the State legislation goes so far that, in the event of a man avoiding or dodging the income tax during his life, there is power for the Commissioner to deduct the amount from his estate after his decease. We do not desire to leave any loopholes, or to encourage any person to dodge the income tax. There may be, of course, individual difficulties, but there is also the possibility that in a crisis the Commonwealth might lose income tax to which it was legitimately entitled. . If a big firm is involved, a set of well-kept books will be available to refer to, and no difficulty can arise; but if the amount involved is small, it will not be worth bothering about very much. There are not likely to be big cases arising out of this provision, but it is possible that a number of persons in a small way may be continually trying to dodge the tax, and our object is to deal with such persons harshly and severely. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out to the Minister that the very persons who will be dealt with severely will, according to his own statement, be those who will not have the evidence to rebut the charge. For instance, a farmer, as a rule, keeps only his bank book, and it may be exceedingly difficult for him to check a re-assessment covering a period of nine or ten years. There will be dozens of cases in which a gardener will not have a set of books to enable him to prove his case ; but, because of that fact, guilt is to be assumed. </para>

                    <para>. - Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> experience of a taxation department is that it does not send out a notice of re-assessment without giving definite information. It may be true that an odd individual receives an additional assessment note, who is not able to test the facts, but under this provision the Commissioner will not move unless he has definite proof of omission, and he will be able to supply the facts. It may be difficult, of course, for a man to prove a negative unless he knows the facts; but when he receives a notice in regard to the facts, and is allowed a reasonable time in which to send in an answer, surely it can be left to the judgment of the Commissioner to say whether the assessment in his case was correct or not. Honorable senators know that, of all the men who are easy-going as a rule it is a Government tax collector. I understand that the Commissioner, under the Land Tax Assessment Act, is likely to act under this measure, and, I have not known him to go round looking for the scalps of any persons. This provision will insure the collection of the income tax. We look upon a dodger of taxation in this country &#39; as rather <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> despicable individual. Honorable senators need not fear the occurrence of any tyranny under the provision. It should be remembered, too, that the income tax will be the first charge on a man&#39;s income, and not the last. </para>

                    <para>. - Here this Bill goes so far as to deprive the taxpayer of even the protection of the statute of limitations. The Commissioner has full power to declare what the assessment is to be. The tax must he paid within thirty days, and if the taxpayer dies in the meantime it may be collected from those whom he leaves behind, and now, under this provision even the protection of the statute of limitations is taken from the taxpayer or his representative. The Minister does not shelter himself behind the just provisions of this Bill, hut behind its administration. We are told that, although the Bill will invest the Commissioner with the powers of a tyrant, its administration is going to be merciful. </para>

                        <para>. - I would like to ask the &#39;Assistant Minister how it comes about that the first and second schedules have been framed in the form in which they are now presented to us ? Is there any particular reason for departing from the system that has been made applicable to income taxes elsewhere, and for specifying the rate of the tax in connexion with varying incomes? It seems to me that these schedules are very complicated, and that they will not be easily grasped by members of the public. I imagine that, from a revenue stand-point, the same results would have been achieved if the schedules had been framed in a more intelligible fashion. Where is the need for the use of all these decimals ? It is almost necessary to employ the differential or integral calculus. It is much worse than the binomial theorem, while the interesting curves referred to convey no information to the public. The most intelligible portion of the Bill seems to be that printed sideways, giving practical examples of the  tax on various incomes. The Government ought to issue ready-reckoners in connexion with the Bill, so that everybody, on ascertaining the amount of his taxable income, may ascertain at once how much tax he has to pay, and take the rest on trust, just as he does the mechanism of a motor car or locomotive when he starts on a journey. </para>

A hand-book or ready reckoner will be prepared to give the public all the necessary information, and will be issued by the Government. One of the reasons why the system in the Bill has been adopted is that the Government must raise a certain amount of money, and fortunately it was found that most of the wealth and property in Australia is held by those in the middle sections of a straight line, and not at either extreme. We wanted to avoid the jumps, because the man under the ordinary system who pays 4d. up to &#163;500, and 5d. or 6d. over that sum, is always trying to get into the lower assessment, and a great deal of dodging takes place. Our idea was to cover the great bulk of the incomes, and therefore the curve system was adopted, giving the steady increase&#34; that we desire. </para>

                    <para class="block">Our object was to simplify the schedule, making the tax increase proportionately with each pound increase of income. The method is absolutely scientific. The personal exertion rate is simplicity itself. The other is much more complicated, but we have tried to reduce it to understandable language, and have given numerous examples running up to &#163;6,000. Any man without working it out can estimate pretty closely the rate of tax on incomes between the examples given. We shall issue a ready-reckoner for public use, with the amounts worked out for each &#163;1 increase of income. The Government did not make mathematics or create figures, and all we can say is that the tax is scientific, although the method of application may be difficult. If it is not easy to apprehend the method by which it has been worked, once it has been worked and the tax has been calculated everybody can rest assured that each man has paid his just share, and no more. </para>

We have to recognise that it becomes the duty of Parliament, as well as the duty of an organization, to do all that we can reasonably do to maintain industrial peace. As far as the Australian Workers Union is concerned, it is the most powerful, and&#34; I may say, the most peaceful organization in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The union has never asked for favours from any one. Its early days were turbulent, and when this Parliament conferred upon the people of Australia the benefits - of an Arbitration Act, and allowed collective bargaining between employers on the one hand, and employees on the other, the Australian Workers Union took advantage of that peaceful method of settling disputes. By that means it got an award from the Court, and for ten years it kept the peace. I think that should stand to it for righteousness. I venture to say that there have been other decisions of the Court that have not been in accord -wilh the intentions of Parliament. In -such circumstances Parliament has gone nut of its way to alter the law and bring it into conformity with the intention of Parliament. We are even endeavouring to alter the Constitution itself, so we are not giving to the Australian Workers Union any special favour that would not have been conferred upon any smaller body. The decision of the Court came as a surprise to many honorable senators and members of the other House, and there will be continual agitation until effect is given to the intention of Parliament. In this case an order was given by the Court that the rules of the Australian Workers Union had to be altered in certain directions, and the order has been carried out. But if the decision of the Court had been carried out in its entirety it would have meant the dismemberment of the Australian Workers Union. The organization prefers a peaceful settlement of its difficulties, and for many years there have been no grave troubles between this great union and the important industry which its members carry on. Their sole wish now is to maintain this peaceful method of settling their disputes. That peaceful method is provided in this Bill. At this late- hour I do not intend to present a lengthy statement of the case. The amendment of the law is necessary, and we ask honorable senators, in fairness to the union, to consider it in a reasonable spirit. I therefore leave the matter in the hands of honorable senators. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;10.9&#93;.- I can quite understand the honorable gentleman asking the Senate to pass this Bill, but I cannot help asking myself if this is a free Parliament, or if Parliament is merely the tool of some great organization outside. We know perfectly well that it was not intended to submit this Bill before the contemplated adjournment last week, and that when the adjournment was spoken of last Thursday, the representatives of this organization - which always favours a peaceful settlement of troubles so long as they are in its favour - came down, and dealt with the Prime Minister. The position was well described in a caricature in one of the papers, which represented this powerful organization as a strong-bearded man, with a puppet - not unlike the Prime Minister of Australia - by his side, and, as the man pulled the strings, the puppet was represented as saying what the man intended he should say. What I do complain of is that this Parliament is not allowed to deal with this matter in a free and unfettered&#39; manner. Will honorable senators opposite tell us how many awards have been given against this union which the Minister says is such a peaceful organization ?

                    <para class="block">Union was called into question, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers&#39; decision was to the effect that a certain amendment would have to be made. We know quite well that the union embraces men altogether outside the ranks of the workers connected with that particular industry - men who, no doubt, joined because they thought it would be to their advantage to do so - and the Australian Workers Union was prepared to take them because they were in that way adding to the strength of the organization. We cannot complain about that very much, but when the aid of the Court was invoked, the Court clearly indicated that the union had departed from  its  constitution. The Government now desire that this legislation shall be retrospective in its effect in order to overcome the decision of the Court. When we established these Arbitration Courts, and determined to allow people engaged in various occupations to form unions, and to make collective bargains with employers, it was never contemplated that one union should arrogate to itself the entire control of the working population of the community. Of course, the legislation was, to a certain extent, experimental, and necessarily it had to be seen in operation in order that defects might be remedied. Hitherto, we have passed no retrospective legislation concerning matters that were <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> as this matter is. </para>

The Court  has  given this union an opportunity so to amend its regulations as to make them conform to the law. It has been found, however, that the union cannot do this, and, consequently, its chief officers have approached the Government, whom they hold in the hollow of their hands, and have said, &#34; We want you to pass legislation which will enable us to win a law suit which otherwise we  shall  lose.&#34; This is not the first occasion upon which these gentlemen have adopted a similar line of action. They not only prevent men from exercising their unfettered judgment upon legislative matters, but they actually say to the Courts,&#34; Unless you hear our case within a limited time we shall go on strike.&#34; I hold in my hand an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Miner</inline> of 23rd August last, which sets out certain resolutions passed by the miners of Broken Hill.

                            <para>- Of course they can. Under this measure I might be made a member of the Australian Workers Union. I do not object to a body of men calling upon the manager of an association to bring a dispute before the Arbitration Court in order to secure a decision upon it. But) when they hold a threat over the Court it is time that we spoke out distinctly, and said plainly what we think of their action. Quite recently, although the Ministry had promised to deal only with certain legislation before Parliament adjourned, they were unable to live up to their agreement. We understood that Parliament was to rise on Thursday last.. But certain members of the Australian Workers Union interviewed the Prime Minister, and practically said to him, Notwithstanding the promise which you have made to members of the Opposition you must pass this Bill.&#34; The result was that Ministers had to give way. They are merely puppets in the hands of outside organizations. Indeed, one of my chief complaints is that we are not getting government by the people, but by a section  of the people, whose only desire is to conserve its own interests to the very fullest extent. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is not far wrong. Many back-block publicans are very good shearers. As a rule, however, they are farmers or selectors. If this Bill had been introduced of the Government&#39;s own volition, it would be in quite a different category, provided that it did not interfere with any case which was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> I quite recognise the truth of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy&#39;s</inline> interjection that my voice is like that of one &#34; crying in the wilderness.&#34; As a matter of fact, I can count upon the fingers of my hand those honorable senators who will adopt a similar attitude to my own towards this Bill. I have spoken strongly upon it because I feel strongly. I have some consideration for honorable senators, and recognise that it is the general desire to secure an early adjournment. In the circumstances, I will content myself with the protest I have made against this legislation ; and if some honorable senators opposite would cross the chamber and vote with me <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> I should be prepared to call for a division on the second reading of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I have had the greatest difficulty in convincing myself that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> was in earnest in the remarks he has made, because the arguments he attempted to put forward were the most fallacious I have ever heard from him. He has argued that the law should not be amended in the way now proposed at this particular juncture. I ask him to consider how many times we have, even in this session, considered amending Bills dealing with matters that were, to all intents and purposes, <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> In connexion, for instance, with the War Precautions Bill, we were sailing an uncharted sea, and found that there were difficulties which we did not anticipate. We immediately amended the law to meet those difficulties. Because in this case we seek to meet a difficulty, although the suggested amendment of the law is in harmony with the intention with which Parliament passed the original Act, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> objects. The interpretation put upon the existing Act by the Arbitration Court may be a legal interpretation, but it was certainly the intention of Parliament, in passing the Act, to give facilities to men to form themselves into industrial unions in order that the Arbitration Court might deal with them collectively. </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable senator argued &#39;that because the Australian Workers Union is a powerful organization it should not be listened to. According to that argument, if it was a weak organization the honorable senator would be prepared to listen to it. For. ten years this organization obeyed the law as it was interpreted. But a new interpretation has been placed upon the law, which was not in the mind of Parliament when passing the Act; and because it is now proposed to alter the law to carry out the original intention of Parliament, we are informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that this legislation is dictated by the Australian Workers Union. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is reasoning from his cartoon that the Government are influenced by this organization. The Australian Workers Union is objected to because it is a powerful organization, and includes persons working at different trades. I am proud to know members of the Australian Workers Union, who follow more than one calling during the year. Men may take short contracts on the roads at one time. They may be cutting telegraph poles a little later. They may be carting for a station-owner at another period of the year, and later they may be engaged in shearing. These men cannot belong to half-a-dozen different unions, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> desires they should. The workmen in the Australian Workers Union are workers in cognate callings. The organization comprises a group of workers in one big union. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> objects to the methods of the Australian Workers Union; but he forgets that we are living in an age when old methods are every day giving place to new ones. During the last ten years of its existence the Australian Workers Union has been law-abiding. It has established indus trial peace, and has, perhaps, done more for the working men of Australia than has any of the other unions. Because it has achieved its purpose, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> objects to its methods. Why should not the working man be allowed to do as he pleases, so long as he remains a law-abiding citizen? If the honorable senator had been able to prove that, by its operations, the Australian Workers Union had made men less law-abiding, he would have been on strong ground in objecting to it. He has not attempted to do anything of the kind, hut, instead of doing that, has introduced a story about a cartoon. I expected greater things from the honorable senator. I am sure that he would not dream, if he were in a Court of justice, of advancing a cartoon as a legal argument. Why should not the Australian Workers Union include all those who select it as the union to which they &#171; desire to belong? </para>

                            <para>- As there are more blacksmiths than there are lawyers, it would probably be an advantage to the lawyers&#39; union to admit them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has not pointed to any disadvantage that arises from the association of groups of cognate workers in the Australian Workers Union. I must strongly protest against the honorable senator&#39;s assertion that this is not a free Parliament. I question -whether &#39;there is any Parliament so free in any other part of the world. </para>

This Bill appeals to my sense of justice, and I am never afraid to raise my voice in support of an appeal to justice. This measure proposes to do justice to a big organization; but if it proposed to do justice to a small organization, I should still support it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> assertion is unworthy of him, and is not applicable to me. This Parliament has a right to mould its legislation according to what it believes to be right. If this legislation is interpreted by the Courts to mean something different from what Parliament intended, it has the right to amend that legislation to give effect to its intention. By doing so in this case, it will advance, not only the interests of the unions, but the best interests of the Commonwealth at the same time. </para>

                        <para>. - I am opposed to this Bill, and to each of the two clauses of which it is principally composed. I am opposed to clause 2 because it defeats what I might call the common-sense view of arbitration and conciliation legislation. If honorable senators opposite are in favour of the indiscriminate inclusion of every one in one big union, all that I can say is that they commit themselves to oppose the principle of differentiation in regard to crafts and trades, and they must presently commit themselves to the indorsement of the principle that all persons embodied iu one big union shall be remunerated alike, irrespective of the services which they render to the community by virtue of their being industrials. That opens up a vista which I think not one of them would care to look down for a great length of time. It opens up at present quite undisclosed possibilities, and the whole of our system of society would need to be recast. I have no particular objection to any person exercising his or her right to join a union any more than I have to a person joining any church because my attitude towards political, industrial, and religious opinions is the same. I do not want to impede anybody in regard to the evidencing of their particular opinions or convictions. But we have to consider what the effect will, be upon the system of conciliation and arbitration in regard to industrial disputes which we have established. The very genius of the system on the statute-book is that persons connected with an organization shall be specialists in regard to the industry carried on by its1 members, and shall be competent to lay their case before the adjudicating authority in such a way that it can pronounce a decision. I am well aware of the fact,, as I have lived for a long time in country districts, that many persons desire to associate themselves with, organizations, although they have no personal knowledge of the work carried on by their members-. Hotelkeepers desire to join a miners, union, and so on. </para>

                            <para>- It is common sense which runs right through the whole framework of our legislation. If my honorable friends wish to merge everything into one big union they will produce results which they at present do- not surmise as likely to evidence themselves, because I believe that they will be striking at the root of the very principle of conciliation and arbitration. I believe that they will take away from the Courts, if not designedly, at least actually, that power of  discrimination  and that knowledge of special industries which must exist before a tribunal can satisfactorily put its powers of decision in motion. That is not my particular objection to- this Bill. My chief objection is to the dispensing power contained in clause 3. It was very reluctantly that we consented only a few days ago to make retrospective a provision in the War Precautions Act, which practically took away from the Court the power of doing something in relief of a litigant. We were constrained to do that only because of the peculiar war conditions in which the Commonwealth, as a unit of the Empire, finds itself at present. I venture to say that honorable senators on both sides acted as they did only because they thought that it was imperatively necessary in the interests of the very existence of the Empire. The Minister who introduced the amending Bill was careful to state, in reply to a question from me, that it would not interfere with the actual progress of the case then before the Court, and when he admitted that the Bill was introduced for the purpose of setting up a condition of things which would completely impair a verdict adverse to the Commonwealth, honorable senators were very reluctant in their support of it, and were careful to urge that whatever might be necessary in connexion with the safety of the Commonwealth it would be very unwise to so legislate as to prevent the High Court from handing down a decision on the appeal, a decision not modified by the passing of the Bill, but one based on the very merits of the appeal. I said that the community would want to hold itself on guard in regard to the situation set up, for there would presently be a lot of persons who would argue that what we did in connexion with a condition of war would be perfectly legitimate in regard to the ordinary operations of the law in time of peace. So soon is my prediction verified, and we have here a majority of the members of the Legislature asserting that it is right and proper to exercise a dispensing power in regard to a decision of the highest tribunal in the land. The decision was given in regard to a plaint lodged under conditions of peace. It is admitted that one of the intentions of the Bill is to set aside a verdict. </para>

We are gradually getting a system of conciliation and arbitration legislation which at least has this merit: That it has&#39; passed through the fire of criticism and of litigation, and is proceeding along a well-ordered path of evolution. But will any industrial litigant who feels himself aggrieved because of the action of an organization take his case to a Court in the future when he knows that this Parliament may be invoked in the event of his getting a favorable decision to immediately cancel the position which he by his action has disclosed ? </para>

                            <para>- No, for the simple reason that no man can be a just judge in his own cause. By passing this measure we shall set up a condition of things by which we make on each occasion a litigant the judge in his own cause, and if it is an organization which is sure of legislative support, it can ask this Legislature to abrogate the decision of the judicial tribunal. Such a condition of things will in the long run operate most inimically to our conciliation and arbitration law. It will excite the disgust of the community, and will certainly not show those flaws in our legislation which, disclosed from time to time, make for a well-ordered evolution of that scheme which we believe will assist us in settling industrial disputes. Why is this measure made retrospective?To annul a judicial decision is a most dangerous thing to do. We acknowledged that it was dangerous when we were dealing with the War Precautions Bill, and it is doubly dangerous when we allow an insidious innovation in regard to legislation dealing with an ordinary situation arising under peace conditions. I protest against the measure. Our forefathers protested against the dispensing power when it was exercised by invading and despotic kings, and I protest against it particularly when it is exercised in the sinister direction of annulling a judicial decision. I, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> have no desire to protract this sitting to too late an hour, and as the measure is only a short one, I content myself with making this protest, feeling that at this juncture other protest would be in vain.

The present step is to get the Parliament to set aside a judicial decision, and if that is not absolutely satisfactory the next step will be to see that before a Judge is appointed he is the kind of man who will give the decision which is wanted.

                        <para>. - I only desire to occupy the time of the Senate for about five minutes. I admired the simulated indignation of members of the Opposition in opposing this measure. The duty of this Parliament, I understand, is to legislate in a wise way in the interests of the people of this country. We have had the lawyers telling us, some on one side and some on the other, that this legislation is flouting the Courts of the country. If Parliament is satisfied that it is doing a good thing in the interests of the country, what is wrong with it? We are here to look after the interests of the people, irrespective of what Courts may do. Courts make mistakes at times, and I have read of a Judge saying that he was doing a certain thing because the law directed him to do it, clearly indicating that common sense was against that course. This organization has done something towards making Australian history. Even the opponents of this Bill admit that the Australian Workers Union has done a great deal of good, not only for its members, but for the country generally, because it was behind the agitation for a sensible means of settling industrial troubles. It advocated arbitration in substitution for the strike. Why, then, should they not get some benefit out of the arbitration law? From 1886 to 1904, when the Arbitration Act became law, there was continual turmoil in the pastoral industry, not because the men were looking for fight, but because they were forced into it. I remember when droves of police were sent out by a Liberal Government all over the back country to try to dragoon men into accepting conditions&#39; that were absolutely hateful to them. </para>

When there, they followed the instructions of a Liberal Government, and tried to bludgeon the men into accepting hateful conditions. That is why the men have spent their money in trying to send into Parliament somebody else to make laws for them, and one of the results of their efforts has been the arbitration laws. </para>

                            <para>- A lot of people burnt steamers which they had pretty well insured beforehand. This was very convenient when they could put the blame on the other fellow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> said that the Government were acting under the lash of the Australian &#34;Workers Union, but that organization obeyed the orders of the Court although its organized strength was so great that it could have won more by industrial strife since it has worked under awards in Australia than it has got from the Courts. There is a great deal more behind the opposition to this Bill than some honorable senators see. So far, the organization has fought successfully in the Courts only for a part of its membership. A great number of its members have not yet had any benefits from the Arbitration Act. It has had a plaint before the Court for two or three years, but has never been able to secure a hearing. If this Bill does not pass, the Australian &#34;Workers Union will not be able to go on with that plaint, as is well known to the squatters, who are members of the Employers Federation, under whose direction the gentlemen opposite mostly act. The squatters have been trying to prevent a large number of people employed in the pastoral areas from getting a rise in wages by means of that plaint. If the Australian Workers Union is deregistered, it will take them another year to register again under the new conditions, and, in the meantime, the pastoralists will save many thousands of pounds. In the circumstances, they do not mind spending a few hundreds in feeing lawyers to occupy the time of the Court, and postpone the inevitable day when the Court will compel them to do what they have never done yet - pay a fair wage to the people who do the great bulk of the work in our pastoral areas. Even if it were true that the members of this Parliament act at the bidding of this organization, it is a powerful body, and embraces quite a number of the best manhood of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator would make a good scarecrow, and if I had a garden I should not mind having him in it. The Australian Workers Union began many years ago as a craft organization. Subsequently it was seen that the amalgamation of a number of organizations could be worked much more cheaply and do more good for their members. Consequently, in 1894, the year when the Australian Workers Union took its present name, the organization was extended to embrace every kind of labour done in this country. The wisdom of getting together instead of being in little cliques, enabling the employers to set one lot fighting against the other, was recognised, and the result has more than justified expectations. It does not matter to the people if every class of labour is under the banner of one union, so long as the laws provide that its members must abide by the awards made by the Courts. All this Parliament has to do is to provide the organizations with the legal machinery for settling disputes. If that is done, and the awards are obeyed, it does not matter twopence to the Parliament or the people whether there is one union or five hundred. That is the object aimed at now. The Australian Workers Union is working to-day under five awards of various Courts, and it has been truly said that every award has been loyally obeyed by the members of the organization. We have never yet been hauled over the coals for a breach of any of our awards, which is sufficient evidence of the peacefulness of our members, although they are certainly not prepared to submit calmly to injustice. All this measure does is to give the Australian </para>

                    <para class="block">Workers Union, or any other organization, the opportunity to embrace as many industries as they like under one banner, get awards from the Courts, and bear the penalties for any breach of them. I am satisfied that a majority of the people, with the experience of the past to guide them, will be in favour of this legislation. Only a few years ago the wool clip of this country was carted to almost every port in the world and back again because there was no sale for it. It was so badly treated that the experts would not touch it. Our people do not want that kind of thing to happen. Our wool clip is an important asset and should be handled by the most expert workmen, so that it may command the best possible price in the world&#39;s markets, and this legislation will have a tendency to bring about that Result, in spite of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> gibes. In reply to his statement that the Government are responding to the crack of the whip of the Australian Workers Union, it is fair to say that he has always jumped very well at the crack of the whip of the Employers Federation. No labour organization that I know of has ever grumbled about the employers getting together into one federation, because they recognise the sensibleness of organization, and the greater facilities which it gives to those concerned to conduct their work. They have never grumbled about the existence of the Chamber of Commerce, which caters for the wants of people following commercial pursuits. We are endeavouring to do likewise in this instance. I want now to say, as my last word, that the pastoral employers are behind the opposition to this measure, because they expect that by fighting the men through the law Courts, and, perhaps, by de-registering the Australian Workers Union, they will be able to put off the day when station hands working in this country will get before the Court and be given an award which will mean decent wages and conditions of working. That will mean of course, many thousands of pounds to the pastoral industry; and it will likewise mean that many thousands of pounds will go into the homes of the workers. The pastoral employers, therefore, think, . no doubt, that it will be much easier and cheaper to fee the lawyers of this country and try to gerrymander the union through the Courts, than to allow the workers by any means to get to the Arbitration Court for an award. That is the whole secret of the opposition behind this Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> is to be congratulated for placing before the Senate clearly the real object of the measure. I think he did so much more frankly, and certainly more clearly, than did the Minister. I think, however, the principle underlying the Bill is reprehensible in the strongest degree. I wish now to review the position with regard to a case that is pending in the Courts, and the undesirable effect that this Bill will have upon that matter. It is most unusual to interfere with a pending case by legislation. </para>

                            <para>- No, we did not. The Minister himself disavowed any intention of introducing the measure with that intention; but, to make assurance doubly sure, I indicated that an amendment might be added to the last clause, and the Minister promised that he would bring the matter before the Attorney-General for consideration. In any event, that case has been argued before the High Court, and the Bill has not yet become law. </para>

                    <para class="block">There was a case actually pending in the Court, and this Parliament made that provision which established this discretion of the Court. An application for deregistration had been made, founded upon a defect in the rules; but Parliament said that if the rules were amended within a given time the application for deregistration might be defeated. Now what is the position ? Acting under that provision, application was made to the Court, and the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, granted to the Australian Workers Union a time within which it might amend its rules so as to escape de-registration. Be: fore that period elapsed, application was made to extend the time. This application was granted, and the time was extended&#39; to 1st September. Now the 1st September has come and gone, and the necessary amendments ordered by the Court have not been made. So that on the law of the Commonwealth, as expressed by this Parliament in this session, the registration of the Australian Workers Union is cancellable. We are now, however, intervening with legislation to say that its original registration shall be valid. Is this in conformity with the practice of Parliament? Let us look back through the history of the British House of Commons - I am not referring to the Standing Orders, but to the established practice of that Parliament. With regard to O&#39;Connell&#39;s case, in which Lord John Russell and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel took an active . interest, we find the principle followed that a case pending in the Courts cannot be dealt with by Parliament: If we search the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports and the <inline font-style="italic">House Documents</inline> of the British House of Commons, we find that not even a question may be asked if it affects a decision on a case pending in the Courts, even though that case concerns a member of the House of Commons itself. </para>

                    <para>Only last year, and during the current session, we gave the Arbitration Court discretionary power to grant this union a period of time within which to amend its rules. That* amendment was not made, though the time was extended, and the registration is now cancellable. By this measure we are taking away the whole effect of our pre-existing legislation, and the principle is entirely wrong. Upon the law as it stands, there can be no certainty for anybody in the community if a person invokes the aid of the Court. Is there to be no certainty that the Court will be guided by the law ? Is the law to be altered, and the Court&#39;s decision likewise- affected, just at the very moment when a decision is to be given ? I know, however, that we on this side are helpless in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- This is not a matter which has escaped attention. Why &#34;was an amendment of the principal Act introduced here only a few months ago ? On that occasion criticism was levelled at Parliament for interfering in a case which was pending. But at that time Parliament interfered only to the extent of authorizing the granting of time to one of the parties to a suit. The  President  of the Arbitration Court has granted that time. Indeed, he has extended it. Yet the party in question is still in default. Now the Government conic forward and say, in effect, &#34; Notwithstanding that you are the party in default we are going to hold you free of all consequences.&#34; Surely there is already enough alleged uncertainty in the law. Do not let us actively assist in making it more uncertain. If we once generate in the minds of the people the idea that although the law may be so-and-so to-day, if the power of the Court be invoked it may be altered to-morrow, we shall create a distrust which will react upon our parliamentary institutions. Seeing that a case is pending in the Arbitration Court, this legislation ought not to have been introduced. </para>

                    <para>To enter, into <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> discussion of the  general  question would occupy too much time at this juncture. I understand that the Australian Workers Union has departed from the spirit of our Arbitration Acts, which recognise that both employers and employees engaged in a particular industry are at liberty to band themselves together into organizations. But under this Bill, even employers in some callings, as well as clerks, accountants, hairdressers, barmen, jockeys, &#38;c, will all be at liberty to join - as they have joined - the Australian Workers Union. This was one of the provisions of the constitution of that organization which the Court ordered it to amend. Yet without amending the law in that connexion we are proposing to validate its registration. </para>

                            <para>- I know nothing about the merits of the case. I have not had time to interest myself in it. But on the general principle of amending the law in the manner that is proposed I think that we are pursuing a wrong course. I feel confident that if we persist in this action it will lead to still greater encroachments upon well-established principles of legislation, the results of which, though possibly they may not be appreciated immediately, will most assuredly be realized to a distressingly considerable extent in the not distant future. I think that the provisions of the constitution of the Australian Workers Union to which exception has been taken as a matter of law, give effect to principles which should not commend themselves to us. Having heard what the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said - and also what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has said - and recognising that the object underlying this legislation is a desire to drag into that body as many persons as possible- </para>

                            <para>- But it is based upon the extent of its organization and upon its capacity for something in the nature of the national strike. The Bill is a material step in that direction. But my main objection to it is that it will interfere with proceedings that are pending in the Arbitration Court. I would condemn such a proposal, no matter from what source it emanated. It is highly reprehensible that legislation should be enacted which is designed to affect proceedings . that are pending in the constituted Courts of the country. - </para>

                        <para>. - I rise merely for the purpose of recalling to honorable senators who are opposed to this measure their statements to the effect that the action of the Government, in respect of this Bill, has been prompted by pressure from an outside organization. Whether that is so I do not know. But I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that previous Governments, controlled by the party to which he belongs, have not only had their actions dictated by outside organizations, but have actually had to conform to the advice which was tendered by them from time to time. You, sir, will recollect the occasion when banking legislation was enacted with such indecent haste in Queensland, at the behest of the moneyed section of the community, that the incident was remembered in that State for many years afterwards. I recollect action on somewhat similar lines having been taken in other States. I mention this matter for the purpose of showing that previous Governments have introduced legislation at the direct dictation of the private interests concerned in it. Yet not a word has been said about it. On this occasion I do not say that the action of the Government has been prompted by outside influence. But it is clear that unless the law be altered in the direction that has been indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> something very unpleasant may happen in the industrial life of the Commonwealth. To avoid that possibility this Bill has been introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> must recognise that its provisions will not apply to the Australian Workers Union alone. There are other organizations to which they will apply in the fullest sense. In the Bill we are endeavouring to put into plain language the intention which Parliament failed to clearly express in previous legislation. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1912 was passed the words &#34;groups of industry&#34; were used for the purpose of covering the case of a body constituted like that of the Australian Workers Union and kindred organizations. The Court, however, has interpreted the intention of the Legislature in a way that was quite foreign to it. In such circumstances it is manifestly our duty to amend the law, and to make our intention so plain that it shall be unmistakable. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> suggest that we should tolerate the intention of this Parliament being thwarted? The Arbitration Court is now about to interpret the law in a way that will not give effect to our intention. In order to assert the supremacy of Parliament, and to give to the bodies concerned the protection which they should enjoy under the law, it is necessary to pass this legislation. This is not by any means the first time that honorable senators opposite have known Acts of Parliament to be amended as the result of flaws detected in them by Courts of justice. There is nothing more common in our experience than the frequent efforts of Parliament to amend the law to remedy some defect discovered by a Court of justice. In this case a defect of the law has been detected, and this legislation is introduced to prevent a miscarriage of justice which would otherwise follow an interpretation of the existing Act -not in accordance with the intention of Parliament. If this Parliament intends, as it does, that a body constituted as the Australian Workers Union is constituted shall continue to be registered, and a Justice of the High Court says that it should not be registered, it is the clear duty of this Parliament, no matter what the interpretation of the Court may be, to give effect to its intention, and see that this and similar organizations shall be registered, irrespective of what any Court may say. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> desires to assert the supremacy of this Parliament, he should support this Bill. If Parliament is to justify its existence, it must see that its intention in passing legislation shall be given effect to, irrespective of the interpretation of any Court. </para>

The proof which the honorable senator submitted in support of his statement was a telegram sent by him to a city firm of solicitors, and the reply of that firm to the telegram. In moving the second reading of the Bill, I stated in good faith the purpose for which it has been introduced. No one could have any knowledge of a case being prepared in a solicitor&#39;s office, and I certainly had no such knowledge. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> sent his telegram is a proof that he had no knowledge that a case was pending. How could I be expected to have any such knowledge when it was not possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> whose daily business is connected with the administration of the laws of the country?. </para>

                            <para>- I say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was not deliberately trying to misrepresent the position, that would certainly be the effect of his statement if it was allowed to go uncontradicted. We have to remember that there was a case before the Arbitration Court, and in that case a decision was given with which the union concerned complied, as far as it was possible for it to* do ; and it has been found necessary to introduce further legislation to prevent the dismemberment of that union. I rose to say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> did not deliberately intend to mislead the public, the effect of the telegram he has produced from a private firm of solicitors would be to mislead them on the question whether a case is pending. </para>

                        <para>Dear Senator Gardiner,</para>
                <para>I have received your memorandum of the 3rd instant, drawing my attention to a debate in the Senate on the 1st instant respecting the Panama-Pacific Exposition Commission. </para>
                <para>During this debate a statement was made to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> the late Secretary to the Commission, had withheld from the Commission certain letters written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Niel</inline> Nielsen to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> This statement is not correct. Apart from other evidence, the minute-book of the Commission shows that all letters and cables from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> to the Commission were duly produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> and considered by the Commission.. This applies specially to the cables and letters from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> despatched immediately after the outbreak of the war, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> urged withdrawal of Australia from the Exposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> being an officer of this Department and unable to engage in any public controversy, I am bound to ask you to be good enough to make it clear to your honorable House that no blame is properly attachable to him in this connexion. </para>
                <para>As you are aware, the Panama-Pacific Exposition Commission was the creation of the late Government. When we assumed office in September last, I found that the contract for the erection of the pavilion in San Francisco, as well as nearly all other operations for our representation there, had been suspended. At that time the press was almost unanimously urging that Australia should withdraw from the Exposition, a view largely supported by public opinion. In the circumstances, as we had only just been sworn in, I looked to the Commission and depended entirely on it for guidance and advice. The Commission&#39;s response was a memorandum, dated 21st September, in which, after &#34;reciting the outlay already incurred and that to which we were committed, the advantages of proceeding with our representation were set out with great force and conviction. The Government was moved by the arguments thus advanced, and at once determined to complete the pavilion as well as other arrangements for the effective representation of Australia at the Exposition. </para>
                <para>This memorandum, which was, I understood, the joint production oF <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> made no mention of the cables and letters from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> urging withdrawal on the ground that the war was likely to reduce the Exposition from the status of a gre.it international affair down to the dimensions of &#34; an ordinary American show.&#34; I was left in ignorance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen&#39;s</inline> strong views until the 24th December, when they came under my notice by the merest accident. By this time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> had reached San Francisco, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was preparing to follow him thither. </para>
                <para>This is doubtless the case of &#34; suppression &#34; which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had in mind during his speech in the debate before referred to. But there was no suppression of documents from tb e Commission itself. There may be some difference of opinion as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> when submitting the memorandum of 21. st September, should not have directed my attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen&#39;s</inline> warning.  In ordinary circumstances, i&#187;s an officer of the Department, bo would have been bound to do so. But at this time his connexion with the Department hnd* practically ceased, and lie had become almost wholly the servant of the Commission. The functions of this body had not been defined in any way bv the Government which created it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> may have thought that the Commission really had the right to ignore <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen&#39;s</inline> warning,  and to proceed with or withdraw from the Exposition as it thought fit. I admit that this view conflicts with the submission of the memorandum of the 21st September, which, in itself, was a recognition that the Government and not the Commission was the authority to say the final word in the matter. But unless one holds an officer responsible for what is dictated to him by a superior, I am unable to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> is censurable for the omission to disclose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen&#39;s</inline> representations to me. He might fairly claim that ns an officer of the Commission, his duty ended in giving effect to the Commission&#39;s instructions to him. Moreover, responsibility for the memorandum in question - for what it omitted as well ns for what it contained - was accepted by the  President  of the Commission, whose signature is attached to it. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to make a few remarks on this rather contradictory letter, which starts by saying that my statement here was incorrect, and admits later on that there was a suppression. It says that the clerk, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward,</inline> did not suppress or conceal anything from the Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> but later it states that there was a suppression, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon,</inline> the Minister, was kept from knowing certain things. It goes on to say that the clerk did not seem to understand that the Minister should have been informed. Contradictory statements of that kind need a great deal more explaining than is offered in the letter. Another thing to which I desire to draw attention is that, at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> found this out for himself by mere accident, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> was no longer an official of the Department, but was employed by the Commission in San Francisco. There, again, there is a contradiction, because the Minister recalled the clerk from San Francisco to the office here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> started in the office again, and is there still. I contend that he was never out of the employ of the Department. For &#39;the Minister to say that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> was in San Francisco on Government business he was no longer an official in the Department is a side-stepping of the whole question. I wish to point out something else. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> says that there was no suppression of documents from the Commissioner. That is to say that, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is concerned, nothing was suppressed from him. How does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> know that? In the letter he admits that certain information was withheld from himself, that is to say, the cablegrams and the letters sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen,</inline> advising the Government not to send a Commissioner to the Exposition, as it was only going to be an ordinary American show. If that information was withheld from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon,</inline> how does he know that it was not also withheld from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> ? That is a question which I put to the Government, and one which has to be answered. The Minister admits that he only found this thing out by accident. How does he know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> knew everything ? If the clerk was clever enough to keep information from the Minister of the Department of which he was1 an official, is it not quite possible that he also kept certain information from the Commissioner because the latter was no more to him than the former was ? The thing is far from being cleared up by the letter which has been read. All that it does is to state that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was not kept in ignorance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen&#39;s</inline> advice, but that the Minister was not advised of the warning which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nielsen</inline> conveyed to Australia that the Exposition, instead of being a big international affair, was likely to be an ordinary show, and that it was not worth while for Australia to take part in it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> admits that he was misled in that regard, but says that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> knew all about it. I should like to know a little more than the letter reveals, for it is obvious that there is a great deal left to be explained. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;12.19 a.m.&#93;. - Further investigation of this matter is undoubtedly required. When we committed ourselves to representation at the Exposition the thing should have been carried through without bickering or quarrel: The general public impression is that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline>
                        went there with certain authority, and while there lost an officer, and that another officer, not an official of the Department, was put in the place without
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline>
                        being consulted. This raises the whole question of how far the Government are going to back up and look after their representatives on foreign missions. If

                        should have been communicated with, and consulted as to the appointment of a successor. We have spent some thousands of pounds, and yet do not know what the report contains. Where is it?

If there had been no friction between him and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> would he have taken that action ? The public have a right to know the effect of our representation there on our great primary industries, and no friction between the Minister and the Commissioner should be allowed to stand in the way. </para>
