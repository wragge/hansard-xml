<PARA>SOCIAL WELFARE LEGISLATION PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate amends the National Health Act 1953, the Social Security Act 1947 and the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 to implement a number of substantial reforms to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the Government's major welfare programs and it continues to protect all Australians against the high and increasing cost of drugs and medicinal preparations. The scheme has a proud record. It has secured safe, low cost medications for all Australians. The pharmaceutical industry has estimated that Australian prescription medications are around 55 per cent of average prices in OECD countries. The scheme is an equitable and universal one, financed by all taxpayers under progressive taxation arrangements. The scheme is nonetheless targeted, with lower patient contributions made by those in sections of the community with greater need, and relatively higher contributions from those who can afford to make them. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 1,100 drug products are listed on the scheme, ranging from basic medications for common illnesses to the latest advances in drug therapy for cancer, high blood cholesterol levels and heart disease. Under this scheme children with short stature can obtain treatment, without charge, with human growth hormone. People requiring stoma appliances and medication can obtain them under the scheme and diabetics can obtain their supplies as well as their insulin at subsidised prices. The scheme has fulfilled a very important social and health role for over forty years. The government wishes to ensure that it continues to offer this protection in the l990's and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> However, no government could responsibly continue the PBS in its current form in the face of the fact that the cost of the scheme has doubled in the last four years and was to have doubled again over the next three years. The survival of the scheme depended upon action to rein in these escalating costs.</PARA>
<PARA> Underlying these cost increases there are several factors. While patient payments are targeted to those most in need, they are not related to drug costs and there is little awareness of or incentive to use lower cost alternative treatments amongst consumers or providers. </PARA>
<PARA> No direct contribution at all is made by the significant number of users who are pensioners and therefore there is no incentive to avoid waste or to be more thoughtful about the use of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an ever increasing array of new, high-cost drugs on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> And, of course, as the population ages there is an increasing demand for health services of all kinds, including medication. </PARA>
<PARA> But pressures on costs are not the only imperative to which the Government has responded with these reform measures. </PARA>
<PARA> There is increasing concern amongst health care professionals about the amount of ill-health which, ironically, can and does occur through the inappropriate use of medication. There is evidence that a significant number of hospital admissions of elderly people are for drug-related illness. Ministers for Health have over recent years received correspondence from the relatives of elderly people pointing out cases of hoarding in which sometimes several years' supply of medications have been accumulated in bathroom cupboards. Professional pharmacists can attest to the `success', if this word can appropriately be used in reference to such a sad phenomenon, of medi-dump campaigns which produce large hauls of unused drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are financial penalties attached to this waste. Australian taxpayers paid for the unused drugs as well as for those which enabled people to get or stay well. In a scheme which costs us as taxpayers more than one billion dollars we should all be interested in minimising waste. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond the waste, and a key objective of these Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme reforms, is the commitment to improvements in health which can result from more appropriate and thoughtful use of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has responded to both the cost pressures and to the improved health objectives identified by making some fundamental reforms. This Bill is one of two Bills which give effect to these changes. It contains provision for new patient contribution arrangements and offsetting pension supplementation. A second Bill will be introduced into the Senate later in this session. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to introduce from 1 November 1990 a charge of $2.50 for all prescriptions previously provided free to pensioners. However the Government proposes to make a compensating adjustment, through an increase to the pension for applicable recipients of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs benefits, of $2.50 per week for those on the single rate and $1.25 per week to the married rate. These additional payments will commence on the first pay period in November. This will mean that in a full calendar year a single pensioner would receive $130 in additional pension and a married couple will also receive $130. In the period from 1 November 1990 to 31 December 1991 single pensioners and pensioner couples will receive $150 in increased pension payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Those persons receiving maximum rate Social Security pension, widowed person's, sheltered employment or rehabilitation allowances, service and war widow's pensions will be paid an advance pharmaceutical supplement of $50 or $25 each in the case of pensioner couples. Further advances will be payable up to the safety net limit to a maximum rate pensioner where the pensioner provides a patient record form demonstrating that they have bought a prescribed number of pharmaceutical benefit items in less than specified periods for themselves, their spouse or dependants and they have liquid assets below $1,000 and non-pension income of less than $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Advance payments will also be available to those who qualify for maximum rate pension or allowances after 8 November 1990 on similar conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> To further protect those pensioners and their families who are large users of drugs, there will be a safety net such that a pensioner or a pensioner family will have an upper limit placed on the amount they need to spend on prescription pharmaceuticals. Free pharmaceutical benefits will be provided to pensioners after the aggregate of their $2.50 Co-payments reaches $150 in the period 1 November 1990 to 31 December 1991. In following years the safety net aggregate co-payment threshold will reduce to $130 in a calendar year. The safety net will be the same for single pensioners and for pensioner families or couples. </PARA>
<PARA> All full year pensioners, and social security beneficiaries who currently receive free pharmaceuticals, will be fully protected under the new arrangements, and most will gain. Pensioners use, on average, 27 prescriptions per year. With the safety net in a calendar year set at $130 (equivalent to 52 prescriptions) most will have additional disposable income as a result of the reallocation of Commonwealth subsidies provided for in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This same co-payment threshold for safety net purposes of $130 (individual and family) in a calendar year is to be introduced for all persons currently receiving benefits at the concessional rate of $2.50. That co-payment rate remains unchanged. The Bill thus provides for all those who receive Commonwealth income support and those who are on low incomes to make the one contribution to their prescriptions and to be protected by the scheme's safety net. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill to be introduced later will, from March 1991, provide for the pension supplement to be absorbed within a $2.50 per week pension increase for all pensioners, sickness beneficiaries and other long term beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Veterans receiving benefits under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will continue to receive drugs free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The general patient co-payment is to increase from the present maximum of $11.00 to a maximum of $15.00. The present general safety net scheme will be revamped into two levels: an aggregate monetary limit of up to $300 will apply at the first level after which the patient will pay only $2.50 per prescription until the second safety net limit of $50 is reached. After that PBS prescriptions will be free for the remainder of that calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the new maximum general patient contribution is just that; a maximum designed to promote awareness of the relative prices of medications. Around two-thirds of the products listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme can be expected to cost consumers less than this $15 maximum. The new cash-based safety net will encourage consumers to be more aware of the costs of their medications as they monitor their progress towards the $300 ceiling and then towards the $50 limit on additional expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to ensure that no individual or family needs to make aggregate contributions at the general rate which exceed $300. It has therefore been provided in the Bill that where the cost of a prescription at the general rate would take the aggregate of an individual or family's contributions over $300, the individual or family will have to pay only $2.50 for that prescription. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons moving from one category of safety net to another will be credited for the expenditure made on a concessional record card or the number of prescriptions already purchased on a general record card so that they are not disadvantaged. Thus, for example, people who begin receiving unemployment benefit during a year will be able to count their general patient contributions towards eligibility for a concessional safety net by having the number of scripts involved multiplied by $2.50 and the resultant amount entered on their concessional record card. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for all co-payments and safety net amounts to be indexed annually in line with the CPI. Safety net limits will of course be indexed from 1 January each year. Patient contributions will be indexed from 1 October each year. </PARA>
<PARA> In pursuit of the objective of ensuring an efficient distribution network for pharmaceuticals, the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia have reached agreement about pharmacy industry restructuring. Part of that agreement relates to a new level of pharmacy remuneration for the dispensing of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the legislation related to the operations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to enable it to give effect to the remuneration aspects of the current agreement and any future agreements which might be made between the Government and a pharmacy organisation representing a majority of approved pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> In the part year 1990/1991 it is expected that savings of $31.4m will result from the introduction of a higher maximum general patient charge and the new safety nets. This will increase to $245m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> While no savings are expected in this year as a result of the new arrangements for pensioners and concessionals, including the additional pension payments for pensioners, savings in later years will reach $185m. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms underscore the Government's commitment to responsible financial management, to social justice, to improved health outcomes and to the provision of financial support for those least able to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would amend social security and veterans' affairs legislation to implement some of the measures announced in the Budget and in the February Statement earlier this year. The Bill would also provide for increased effectiveness and efficiency in social security and veterans' affairs administration. </PARA>
<PARA>Since November 1989 recipients of unemployment benefit, sickness benefit and job search allowance have been required to supply a tax file number as a precondition to payment of benefit. This initiative has proved to be successful, both in terms of increased efficiency in determining claims and in savings to the Social Security budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistent with that initiative are several others announced in the February Statement and the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these will be the progressive extension of the requirement to provide a tax file number to most recipients of Commonwealth income support payments. This Bill would commence that process by requiring provision of tax file numbers by sole parent pensioners, recipients of family allowance and family allowance supplement and their spouses as a prerequisite to further payments of these benefits on or after 1 October 1990. The requirement to provide the tax file numbers of the spouse may be waived where the Secretary is satisfied that the person does not know the spouse's tax file number or cannot obtain that number or a declaration or statement relating to that number. Recipients of some veterans' affairs pensions and allowances may also be required to produce his or her tax file number and that of his or her spouse as a prerequisite to payment. </PARA>
<PARA>I will shortly be in a position to introduce another Bill which will require the progressive supply of tax file numbers for most social security payments from 1 January 1991. There will be similar legislation in respect of many payments made by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Community Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, I will introduce legislation to permit, from 1 January 1991, the matching of client information held by each of these departments and by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs using equipment in the Department of Social Security. This will help in the detection of incorrect payments by highlighting situations where, for example, a person has provided inconsistent family profiles or income information to different Commonwealth agencies and is consequently receiving mutually inconsistent benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that these developments will contribute greatly to enhancing the integrity of the social security system. To enhance it further the Government has decided to offer a limited amnesty to ensure that, as far as possible, the rates of payment made to social security and veterans' affairs recipients on 1 January 1991 are correct. This Bill, therefore, provides for an amnesty which will encourage people who may at present be in receipt of incorrect payments because they have not informed the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs of changes in their circumstances to come forward and correct the situation. Although no overpayments will be raised against these people or prosecutions launched the savings from the correction of ongoing payments will be very substantial in net terms. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to limit avoidance of the social security and veterans' affairs assets tests by the disposal of property for either nominal or no consideration, the Bill would provide that income will be deemed to have been received from deprived assets at a minimum rate of 10% a year. However, to mitigate the impact of this measure where the disposition is relatively minor, the annual gifting limit will be significantly increased to $10000 for both single persons and married couples. This compares with the existing annual gifting limits of $2000 for single persons and $4000 for married couples. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also provides for the assessment of income on loans made by pensioners and beneficiaries assuming a minimum rate of interest. This rate will initially be set at 10% or the actual rate of return, whichever is the higher. The Minister for Social Security will be able from time to time to set a lower minimum interest rate when this is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>For some time, a person living in a retirement village whose entry contribution exceeded a prescribed limit has been considered to be a ``home owner'' for the purposes of the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. However, if a person's entry contribution is less than the prescribed amount, the person is considered a``non home owner'' and the person's property is taken to include the value of his or her entry contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would provide for a person who has retained or acquired a life interest in his or her home, for example a person living in a granny flat, to be treated in the same way as a person who has paid to live in a retirement village. As a consequence the deprivation rules in the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act will no longer apply to them. </PARA>
<PARA>I will shortly introduce a further initiative in another Bill with the effect that, from 1 March 1991, cash and money in accounts of pensioners and beneficiaries will be assessed as returning yields as follows: for the first $2000 the actual rate of return, even if it is 0; for amounts of over $2000, the first $2000 at the actual rate of return and the remainder at 10% or the actual rate of return, whichever is the higher. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioners and beneficiaries will have about six months to rearrange their cash or accounts. Another 40 FISP (Financial Information Service for Pensioners) officers will be operating from early in October this year to help pensioners arrange their investments. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions will apply both to cash and to money in accounts held by pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA>The free areas (the amounts people can earn before their Social Security payment is affected) provide substantial protection to pensioners with only small amounts to invest. For example, an age pensioner with no income apart from the pension and interest on investments would be able to invest up to $20000 (single pensioner) or up to $36000 (couples) at 10% interest and still receive maximum rate pensions because the interest income is within the pension free areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioners and beneficiaries who re-organise their financial affairs will have higher overall disposable incomes than before. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a short statement about the Notice Paper and the business for today. It seems that it would facilitate the Government's difficulty in that it is short of business. Last night the Senate had to adjourn early because it simply ran out of business. Today we are suffering the continuing embarrassment of a Government that, although it has a long and complex program before it, has had to haul Bills out of committees to try to fill the program for today. In addition, the Government seeks that we now debate the Prime Minister's recent travelogue, which was adequately and thoroughly dealt with in the House of Representatives yesterday. This would not be on the Notice Paper for today in the Senate but for the fact that the Government simply has not got its program in order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday when I complained about the state of business, I mentioned that we were told that for this week the broadcasting Bills would be on the Notice Paper. We were then told the broadcasting Bills would be withdrawn. Last night we were told that the Government wishes the broadcasting Bills to be dealt with today, at least in the second reading stage. We wish, of course, to be reasonable in these matters, but clearly this is not the way the Government should be conducting its program. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of what I said yesterday, that the Senate has sat for very few days this year. There is an enormous backlog of work to be done. The Christmas bulge that we traditionally suffer and which results in poor quality legislation is clearly going to be worse this year than it has ever been before. Now that the Acting Manager of Government Business is in the chamber when I wish to address these matters to him-yesterday he had left-perhaps he will take this opportunity to explain to the Senate exactly what the Government is planning to do in relation to the program in the Senate, so that we all might be better informed and better prepared for the business and our responsibilities in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to respond to Senator Hill's statement. I have the real pleasure of being the Acting Manager of Government Business this week at a time when, I would have to concede, we are clearly having problems with the listing of Government Business on the Notice Paper. In order to ensure that the Senate had something productive to do during the next few days, the broadcasting Bills-which did not come into this place only yesterday; they have been around for a long time-have been listed. I would have thought the Opposition would have welcomed the opportunity to have them brought forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill, you say, `Make up your mind'. I returned to Australia yesterday morning and took up this job. I have not had a chance to unmake my mind, but when confronted with what we ought to do in the next few days that seemed to me to be a reasonable thing to do. So far as the rest of the program today is concerned, there are in fact three lots of legislation-maritime safety and Customs as well as broadcasting amendments. The parliamentary zone is a matter that has been around for a long time and one in which Senator Reid in particular has shown an interest. I would be surprised if Opposition senators felt that it was inappropriate to deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In looking at the program for the next few days beyond today, however, there are a number of things which I can draw to the Senate's attention. We will, I hope, have the tax package out of the House of Representatives by tonight. If that is the case, then Opposition senators will have an opportunity to look at that tomorrow. That is major legislation which I am sure will take up some time, and Senator Watson would be pleased, I am sure, that it will be brought on. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as all of us feel our way through our new system of referring legislation to committees, we have to understand that that in itself is creating some difficulties for the Government in bringing business before the Senate. The reality is that the two pieces of legislation dealing with social security-that is, the legislation on pharmaceutical benefits and the legislation covering tax file numbers-which we hoped to have debated in the Senate next week, probably will not be brought on next week. We will find it almost impossible to bring them on next week, given that both will be referred to committees to be dealt with on Friday. I am led to believe from both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats that they wish to have outside witnesses called before these committees, as well as having departmental officers there to explain through the Minister what is in the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Now if, as I suspect, that means the committees cannot finish with those Bills on Friday, then we will certainly be in the situation in which that social security legislation will not come in next week and we will have to wait another few weeks. I believe that it is in the interests of every senator to have a careful look at the way in which these committees are going to develop. Obviously, given that the committee system is new, we will all have to feel our way through the system. </PARA>

I will endeavour tomorrow, because I do not wish to keep the Senate in the dark on what might happen next week, to outline a program for next week as well, at least informally, so that every senator will know where we are going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has got to be understood that in trying to get legislation before the Senate, it will have to get through the committees first, and it is not going to be easy to get all the pieces of legislation through the committees. If the experience that we had in the last sitting week with the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill was any indication, the time of the Senate is going to be taken up unnecessarily too often with repetitive debate, and that is not in the interests of anyone here. Nonetheless, I think that on the program for today there is more than enough to get through today. With the tax package there will be more than enough to get through tomorrow. Before the end of tomorrow I hope to indicate to the Opposition the kind of program we will have available for next week. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-There are two aspects to this matter. One relates to the broadcasting Bills, and there are two of them. As I understand it, the reason they were taken off the program in the first instance was that the Government had amendments to those Bills. I notice that Senator Richardson has studiously avoided indicating whether there are to be amendments, given that these Bills have miraculously reappeared at such short notice. It simply would not be a proper manner of handling business to expect the Senate to debate amendments virtually unseen. I invite him to indicate whether there are to be amendments and, if so, what period we will have in which to consider those amendments, which presumably have been on the drawing board for some weeks now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that particularly concerns me is the Minister's suggestion that somehow he has been taken by surprise in relation to the social security legislation. It has been perfectly clear to him, even though he might have been swanning around the world, that the Opposition has indicated publicly on several occasions that it intended to have this legislation, particularly the legislation on the question of the tax file number, thoroughly investigated by way of a public inquiry. We have adhered to that position and, of course, the Australian Democrats have also agreed with that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the most that the Minister has contributed to the discussions to date is an attempt to play off the Democrats and the Opposition parties against one another by suggesting that somehow they were both prepared to proceed with the second reading debate. That is not the situation and we have made that clear to the Minister. I cannot for the life of me understand why he is somehow pretending that the program has been interrupted by the course of action that we are intending to pursue. It has been made plain at all times that these are very serious matters which deserve fundamental examination. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson would know as well as anyone that there are a whole range of groups concerned about the privacy implications, because he chose not to allow the Privacy Commissioner even to address these matters in public or to attend a summit council organised by the Privacy Foundation, or to contribute in any way. He chose simply to have departmental officers there to take notes, to vet what was going on, but otherwise he chose to be particularly unhelpful.</PARA>
<PARA> I regard it as a very specious explanation for the Government to be suggesting that somehow we are at fault at the present time. The Government is well aware of the great concerns about privacy in the community. Despite the grossly misleading statements by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and others at the time of the introduction of the tax file number and the solemn assurances that it would never be extended to the social security system, now we have a situation where that blatantly will be the case, and we have heard nothing at all from the Privacy Commissioner. We know that he will promulgate guidelines. Senator Richardson has been so generous as to indicate that whatever the Privacy Commissioner comes up with will be all right with him. That is a pretty generous statement but, unless and until we get that material, it is simply thoroughly premature to be attempting to have a second reading debate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Until Senator Richardson is prepared to play the privacy game and allow the Privacy Commissioner to make some sensible statements on the issue so that we can understand the real concerns and then explore them in the committee, we will continue to decline to proceed further with the second reading debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-At no stage last night did I attempt to suggest that both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats were happy to have a second reading debate on the social security legislation today. The Opposition made it clear at all times that it did not want that. I never attempted to misrepresent that position. I attempted to have some people speak to the Opposition about the fact that I did not think that that was very clever. I also spoke to Senator Powell and to Senator Lees about the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the view expressed by the Democrats and the Opposition was that they did not want a second reading debate to go ahead at this time. The Government had no objection to that. We would prefer to have had it debated today. The fact that it is not on is not the end of the world. By the same token, Senator Alston cannot then complain about the placing of business today if he is the one who does not want the second reading debate today when the Government had fully expected a couple of weeks ago that the second reading debate would have been held this week. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what will happen in the committee on Friday, I particularly want to see a thorough examination of all the privacy issues involved. Obviously it is a crucial question, not just for people in the Senate but for the people of Australia generally. I am more than happy to have a very thorough examination because I am thoroughly convinced that, once that examination has taken place, we will be able to approve the legislation and those hundreds of millions of dollars to which I have referred will be able to be saved. </PARA>

I actually toted up the figures yesterday and the figure involved was $371m, I think, in 1993. I said that we would save $400m a year. I do not believe that the poetic licence involved in a difference between $371m and $400m is very great. So I would not have thought that I could be accused of any foul calumny for having said that. If Senator Alston cannot read the Budget Papers that is not my problem; it is his.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that there is no suggestion that I am attempting to stop some examination in the committee. I am only pointing out that we have not had this committee system before and that the way in which we will be calling outside witnesses will be taking longer than the Government had thought. I do not believe that it is improper for us to refer to that fact, nor is it improper to draw to the attention of all honourable senators-not just those opposite but also Government senators-that there will have to be some special scrutiny by all of us of the way in which these committees are performing to ensure that the Government business can get through the Senate in any reasonable program. </PARA>

I understand that the committee system is creating the need for us all to be, shall I say, sympathetic with each other. But I would not want the entire problem to be laid at the feet of that system. I also want to add that the Democrats will do, and are doing, everything they can to see that that system works.

Japan is, of course, one of the world's great economic powers and our relationship with is one of Australia's most vital. </PARA>
<PARA>While each visit raised important issues of its own, a number of recurring and complementary themes emerged from this intensive period of regional contact. </PARA>
<PARA>For instance, in Tokyo the Prime Minister pursued with Prime Minister Kaifu and his Ministers Australia's concern to see decisive movement in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which are about to enter their final stage. The Prime Minister urged Japan to show true leadership, and thus exert pressure on the other majors-the EC and the United States-by further liberalising import controls on agricultural products, especially rice-not because Australia itself is a significant rice producer on a world scale, but because such a step would have far-reaching symbolic importance at this vital stage of the Uruguay Round negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>These negotiations are of real importance to all countries around the world, especially to those of our South Pacific and South East Asian neighbours belonging to the Cairns Group. </PARA>
<PARA>Japan acknowledges the fact that the Uruguay Round negotiations will fail unless vital matters relating to agriculture are sensibly addressed. Similarly, leaders at the South Pacific Forum expressed satisfaction with the progress made over the past twelve months in mobilising support against the obnoxious practice of drift-net fishing and urged other countries to become party to the Wellington Convention. The Prime Minister was able to take that message personally to Japan, which has suspended drift-net fishing operations in the South Pacific. He told Japan's leaders that the suspension was welcome in the region but that our goal remained-and rightly so-a world-wide ban. </PARA>
<PARA>Also against the background of the Prime Minister's attendance at the South Pacific Forum and of his visit to Papua New Guinea, the Prime Minister was able to urge Japan to expand its constructive investment and development assistance in the region; the Island economies are in need of it, and it is important that major donors such as Australia and Japan maintain close and continuing dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me now report in turn on each of the Prime Minister's visits. </PARA>
<PARA>New Caledonia</PARA>
<PARA>The visit to New Caledonia at the invitation of Prime Minister Rocard was the first to the territory by an Australian Prime Minister since Mr Robert Menzies in 1941. </PARA>
<PARA>The program included meetings with Mr Louis Le Pensec, the French Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories, and with New Caledonian political leaders, including the President of the Territorial Congress, and leaders of the Southern, Northern and Loyalty Islands provinces. The Prime Minister also had discussions with the Mayor of Noumea, with the President of the FLNKS, Mr Neaoutyine, and the widow of the assassinated former President of the FLNKS, Madam Tjibaou. He was thus able to have discussions with a very wide range of New Caledonian leaders, representative of the political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was greatly impressed by the positive and constructive change in New Caledonia that has followed the signing of the Matignon Accords. All those involved in the Matignon process-President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Rocard, the independentist groups, and those who want a continuing constitutional link with France-deserve great credit for the way in which they have set aside old animosities and are working together to broaden New Caledonia's economic and political base. This will allow a genuine act of self determination to be made in 1998, leading to a viable long-term political status for the territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister offered Australia's continuing help in this process, including assistance in training young New Caledonians, broadening our economic links and encouraging, where we can, New Caledonia's links with the wider Pacific community. </PARA>
<PARA>He made it clear that, notwithstanding differences of policy over French nuclear testing and over the EC's agricultural policies-differences which the Prime Minister restated-and whatever the outcome in New Caledonia, Australia believes that France has a constructive and welcome political, cultural and economic role to play in this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>At the South Pacific Forum he was able to brief other leaders about his visit to New Caledonia. This was very much welcomed because, as Honourable Members will know, it remains an issue of great interest throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA>As is the Prime Minister's practice at Forum meetings, he was able to have valuable bilateral discussions with a range of South Pacific leaders, including with Prime Minister Lini of Vanuatu and Ratu Mara of Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA>The Forum demonstrated again its practical relevance to the needs and concerns of the Pacific states. A wide range of regional issues was discussed in the usual frank and informal way, including matters relating to the environment, fisheries and regional multilateral organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the United States Government's plans to dispose of chemical weapons stocks at the facility it has constructed on Johnston Atoll was the subject of understandably lively debate. Some Island leaders expressed concern for the safety aspects of the project. Others were concerned that the Pacific was coming to be seen as a dumping ground for the industrial waste of developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister put to his colleagues Australia's view that the Johnston facility would help to resolve a serious existing environmental problem-the deterioration of the stock of chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll-and would also help rid the world of these devastating weapons by making more possible the comprehensive global ban on their construction and use, for which Australia has worked so hard. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that the Prime Minister rejected totally the absurd notion being peddled by some that the destruction of chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll is somehow akin to the testing of nuclear devices at Mururoa. </PARA>
<PARA>He agreed fully with all Forum leaders that the Pacific should not become a waste dump, and that once the weapons at present on the island, those that may be found elsewhere in the region, and those being transhipped from Europe were destroyed, the facility should be closed down. Forum leaders welcomed, therefore, the United States Government assurance that it had no plans to extend the life of the facility beyond its current program. They also welcomed the United States' offer to discuss the facility in detail with Forum leaders and a delegation has since held useful talks in Washington. </PARA>
<PARA>Papua New Guinea</PARA>
<PARA>The visit, which included discussions with Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers, Opposition Leader Wingti and with a range of Provincial and business leaders, was the most extensive undertaken to Papua New Guinea by an Australian Prime Minister since 1976. As well as Port Moresby, the Prime Minister visited Mount Hagen, Madang and Rabaul. The welcome at each of those provincial centres was nothing short of overwhelming, and symbolised in the most dramatic and colourful of ways the great depth of the relationship between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The relationship with Papua New Guinea remains one of our most important. Papua New Guinea is the largest recipient of Australia's bilateral aid; it is the fourth largest export market for Australia's manufactured products; it is our sixth largest overseas investment destination, with total net investments of about $1.8 billion, a figure which could exceed well in excess of $4 billion if major resource projects in Papua New Guinea proceed as planned. Over 11,000 Australians reside in Papua New Guinea and, over the past decade, some 2,000 Papua New Guineans have studied here under Australian Government scholarships and training awards. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1983 the Government has worked hard to develop constructively and positively the relationship with our nearest neighbour. In December 1987 the Prime Minister signed with then Prime Minister Wingti the landmark Joint Declaration of Principles. In May last year he signed with Prime Minister Namaliu a Five Year Development Assistance Agreement. During his visit to Port Moresby an Agreement for the Protection and Promotion of Investment was signed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Declaration of Principles spelled out that the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea is one between two independent nations each responsible for its own destiny. A fundamental purpose of the visit to Papua New Guinea at this time was to underline this simple but vital fact, the significance of which is still sometimes not fully grasped and understood in parts of Papua New Guinea, Australia and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>Throughout the visit, the Prime Minister stressed that Australia had no wish to intervene in solving Papua New Guinea's problems. If effective solutions are to be found, they must be solutions which emerge from within Papua New Guinea and are implemented by Papua New Guineans. It is neither possible nor desirable to turn the clock back. The Prime Minister also said it was important that the relationship between the two countries be taken forward very much within the context of the economic dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region and that Australia looked forward to the time when Papua New Guinea could itself become a member of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA>The totality of the Prime Minister's message was well understood and, indeed, welcomed by Papua New Guinea's leadership. For his part, Prime Minister Namaliu said that his Government wanted to speed up the shift in the balance of our aid program away from budget support and towards the more usual project support, with a view to the former being phased out by the end of this decade. The Prime Minister welcomed that goal and officials from the two countries will be taking the matter forward in the lead-up to the scheduled 1992 review of the current Development Assistance Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>None of this means that Australia is walking away from Papua New Guinea. Both countries are too important to each other for that to be allowed to happen, and it is clear from the Government's actions over the past seven years that is not our policy. Australia and Papua New Guinea remain enduring friends and committed partners. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators will be aware of the enormous problems faced by Papua New Guinea over the past 18 months, the most significant of which have, of course, been those on Bougainville and the subsequent closure of the BCL Mine at Panguna. </PARA>
<PARA>That closure led, in one blow, to Papua New Guinea losing 37% of its export income and 17% of its budget revenue. The requirement for fundamental adjustment on the part of the Papua New Guinean Government and its people was obvious. Throughout the visit the Prime Minister was struck by the realistic appreciation and acceptance of the challenge. There was no attempt to turn away from it or to pretend that it was not there. And, to date, this attitude has been reflected in the implementation by the Papua New Guinean Government of the Structural Adjustment Program agreed with the World Bank and the IMF, and in which Australia has played a significant role. Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers and the people of Papua New Guinea are to be congratulated for this realistic commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem of Bougainville does, of course, remain. In discussions in Port Moresby, the Prime Minister reiterated the Australian Government's position that Bougainville should remain an integral part of Papua New Guinea and that we fully support the Papua New Guinean Government's commitment to a political solution. He also reiterated our willingness to assist in the rehabilitation of Bougainville once an agreement has been worked out. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister raised again the Australian Government's concern about reported human rights abuses, both by the Papua New Guinean authorities and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. In this context, he was disappointed that Bougainville leaders have, to date, declined the offer by the Papua New Guinean Government to invite an outside body to investigate allegations involving both sides. </PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers outlined frankly the problem confronting Papua New Guinea in law and order, a problem impinging on Australians themselves living in Papua New Guinea and a problem which, if left unchecked, would complicate the task of attracting much needed foreign investment. It was agreed to examine the challenges confronting Papua New Guinea in the l990s, with a view to determining how best the authorities there might meet the challenges and how Australia might best assist. It is planned that both sides will be in a position to pursue discussions further once the initial studies have been completed by the end of October. </PARA>
<PARA>Lastly, the Prime Minister discussed with Prime Minister Namaliu the heartening progress which has been made on the vital work of reforming Papua New Guinea's Constitution to allow the maintenance of more stable parliamentary majorities between elections. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, we should not forget that, while Papua New Guinea faces a complicated mix of problems, it is also a country rich in resources, both material and human. The Prime Minister's visit to the Porgera gold mine and his talks with many Papua New Guineans from all walks of life around the provinces, gave him ample evidence of that. With determined leadership and with continued assistance, from Australia and its other friends, there is no reason to believe that Papua New Guinea cannot realise its significant potential. </PARA>
<PARA>Melbourne's bid for the 1996 Olympics occupied the first two days of the Prime Minister's visit to Japan. Honourable Senators are, of course, aware of the outcome of that bid. Atlanta is to be congratulated and the Government is sure its people will stage a most successful Games to mark the centenary of the modern Olympics. At the same time, all Australians should feel immensely proud with the effort made on their behalf by the Melbourne Olympic Committee and by the many people, including the Leader of the Opposition, who put in so much effort to secure the Games. That the bid was not successful was not, in any way, a reflection on their effort and dedication or on the excellence of the bid itself. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's two days of discussions in Tokyo encompassed talks with Prime Minister Kaifu and, separately, his Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance, International Trade and Industry, and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. He also met with former Prime Minister Takeshita and with the Chairperson of the Japan Socialist Party, Ms Doi. He addressed a meeting of the Australia-Japan Dietmembers' League, and 600 senior Japanese businessmen who were attending the annual All Japan Chambers of Commerce. He met separately with a dozen or so of Japan's foremost business leaders. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the relationship with Japan is of the highest priority for Australia. Not only is Japan's economy of global importance but, during the course of this decade we will see Japan assume an increasingly important political role in world affairs, something which the Government welcomes and to which I shall return to later.But over and above our many shared global and regional interests, the bilateral relationship with Japan stands in its own right</PARA>
<PARA>- Two-way trade with Japan is now worth over $23 billion a year, with Japan being Australia's largest trading partner and Australia being Japan's sixth largest trading partner</PARA>
<PARA>- Japanese investment in Australia is worth over $36 billion or about 15% of total foreign investment in Australia and has increased by over 70% since 1986/87</PARA>
<PARA>- Japan is an important source of tourism for Australia,with visitors numbering about 350,000 in 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Impressive as these figures are, we aspire to an even more diversified and rich relationship with Japan. For instance, as the Prime Minister pointed out in Japan, of the $9 billion invested by Japan in Australia in 1988-89, some 92% is invested in tourism and real estate. Tourism is a major growth industry for us. But we do not see ourselves solely as a purveyor of leisure services; nor do we see particular economic advantage in selling real estate as an end in itself. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time, in short, for Japan to be more creative in its approach to investment in Australia and to joint ventures with us. </PARA>
<PARA>The bilateral relationship is well managed within the framework of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee and the Prime Minister's visit provided an opportunity to promote a further broadening and deepening. Mr Kaifu shared this objective, and it has been agreed that the existing Science and Technology Agreement will be revised so that cooperation under it can encompass not only pure research but also important areas of applied science. It was also agreed that officials would explore areas of further cooperation in clean coal technologies-the Brown Coal Liquefaction Project at Morwell in Victoria being a good example of what is possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Against the background of the fundamental changes made to the Australian economy since 1983, the Prime Minister discussed with Mr Kaifu, his economic Ministers and with Japanese business leaders, the mutual benefits to be gained through increased investment in the Australian manufacturing sector. In this context, he was pleased to be able to report that the Japanese Government and business leaders continue to take a very positive approach to the further development of the multifunction polis or MFP, as made clear through their:</PARA>
<PARA>- Welcoming of Adelaide as the location for the MFP;</PARA>
<PARA>- Agreement to nominate, as Co-Chairman of the International Advisory Group to report to me, its foremost business leader, Mr Eishiro Saito, Chairman of Japan's private sector umbrella group, Keidanren; and</PARA>
<PARA>- Agreement to send an investment mission to Australia in connection with the MFP</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister assured both the Japanese Government and business leaders that the prejudices within Australia which, at one point, put the MFP at needless risk, represented very much minority views. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, as suggested earlier, the Prime Minister told Mr Kaifu-and he stated clearly in public speeches-that Australia wanted to give positive encouragement to Japan to play a wider role in global affairs, more commensurate with its economic standing. The Prime Minister wants to state clearly that he believes such a trend is inevitable and that it is in our interests. </PARA>
<PARA>It is self-evident that the world today, as it embarks upon its post-Cold War era, is very different to the world of the 1940s, when post-war global institutions were put in place. The time has clearly come for thought to be given about how those institutions, including the United Nations, might accommodate Japan's new role. Within the United Nations, for instance, there is obviously a range of possibilities, up to and including permanent membership of the Security Council. The question is a delicate one and involves a range of complex issues in which many countries have a legitimate interest. For that reason, the Prime Minister did not in any way seek to be prescriptive, but sought to highlight an important question which needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kaifu was appreciative of the Prime Minister's comments and said he felt honoured that the Prime Minister had chosen to raise the issue. It was emphasised to the Prime Minister that while Japan wished to play a greater political role in world affairs, the terms of Japan's Constitution do not permit the deployment of Japan's armed forces abroad for combat operations. Japan is not contemplating any change to its Constitution, but this is, of course, a different matter from the foreshadowed change to Japanese legislation which will enable Japan to play a fuller and more active role within the framework of United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Government would welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA>Amongst the global issues discussed with Mr Kaifu and his Ministers, the most significant was the situation in the Gulf and its implications, both politically and economically. The Prime Ministers confirmed their respective support for the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. Mr Kaifu outlined Japan's contribution to the multi-national effort in the Gulf and said that, within the framework of its Constitution, Japan was examining what else it might be able to do. He applauded Australia's resolute and quick action in meeting the crisis by dispatching naval vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister expressed appreciation for Japan's contribution and said that, while it was clearly a matter for Japan itself to determine, any decision to do more would be understood by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In exchanging views about developments in the Soviet Union, both Mr Kaifu and Foreign Minister Nakayama outlined the current state of Japan-Soviet relations, including the outstanding question of the Northern Territories. The Prime Minister expressed the Government's hope that the issue would be resolved in a way acceptable to Japan, as Japan-Soviet relations were a matter of importance to all countries in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>Other issues covered in the Prime Minister's discussions included Antarctica, APEC, China, the Korean Peninsula and Cambodia:</PARA>
<PARA>- He outlined to Mr Kaifu the Australian-French initiative to preserve the unique Antarctic environment and the importance of the forthcoming Santiago Conference. Mr Kaifu expressed his hope for a satisfactory outcome at Santiago and agreed that our officials should continue to consult the lead-up to the Conference</PARA>
<PARA>- Mr Kaifu and his Ministers were especially supportive of the APEC initiative which the Prime Minister launched early last year. It was agreed that the two countries would continue to work together closely on this and other regional issues such as Cambodia</PARA>
<PARA>- On the Korean Peninsula, both Prime Ministers expressed concern about the failure, to date, of the DPRK to enter into its Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a matter of great importance in the context of proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA>As is obvious from this report, the Prime Minister's visits have, in each case, advanced concrete Australian interests and have, once again, demonstrated Australia's continued high standing in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore a matter for regret that while the Prime Minister was in Japan, the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, delivered an address on foreign policy in which he made clear his belief that Australian influence in the region had become, in his word,``marginalised'', and that Australia's foreign policy was, again in his words,``in disarray''. </PARA>
<PARA>``Let me put this point quite bluntly,'' Dr Hewson said.``We are no longer the diplomatic and economic force we were in the Asia-Pacific region, because our relative economic situation has declined considerably . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, everything that emerged from the regional visits that are the subject of this report reveals this statement for what it is: the uninformed and opportunistic posturing of this apprentice. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite simply, Australia now stands at a high point of its constructive regional influence, and you need look no further than Cambodia on the political side and APEC on the economic, for proof of that. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson implies there was a lost golden era when Australia enjoyed greater positive influence in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>Is this successor to the Liberal Leaders who sent Australian troops into Vietnam referring to that sort of regional influence?</PARA>
<PARA>Is he talking about the wasted years of hypocrisy on trade under Malcolm Fraser, when this country preached reform but practiced inflexible selfcentred protectionism?</PARA>
<PARA>Does he suggest that Australia's influence was greater before this Government took the internationally recognised and applauded lead in the establishment of</PARA>
<PARA>- the Cairns Group?</PARA>
<PARA>- the new forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation?</PARA>
<PARA>- the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone?</PARA>
<PARA>- the framework embraced by the UN Security Council for advancing the restoration of peace in Cambodia?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, Australia is a nation that has spoken for a long time about being part of the Asia-Pacific region. But it is only under this Government that real effect has been given to those words; it is only this Government which has defined economic enmeshment with the region as a key objective for this country for the coming decade; it is only this Government, and this party, that has never wavered in its unequivocal commitment to non-racial principles of immigration; and it is only under this Government that Australia's potential as an active, respected and positive partner in the region has started to be fulfilled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said a little while ago, this statement was put down by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the House of Representatives yesterday and was debated there. It was not the Government's intention to put it down in the Senate at all, or else we would have had it on the Notice Paper for yesterday. But now that it is here-in an effort to fill the program-there are a few comments that I wish to make. In particular, I would like to take up the gratuitous criticisms that we found within the document by the Prime Minister of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). There is no doubt that Dr Hewson has got under the skin of the Prime Minister on foreign policy issues. There are a few matters that I believe, therefore, could be pursued in a little more detail in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I refer to the trip that the Prime Minister did not make, and that was the trip to the World Summit for Children, which has just recently been held in New York. This was a unique summit. It was an occasion that brought together some 71 world leaders-heads of state, heads of government-and it was so structured that to get a place at the table a country had to send either its head of state or its head of government. It could not send someone of lesser authority to take the chair. The summit had been purposely structured in that way as a test to see which of the world's leaders were prepared to put other priorities aside for one day and put the issue of children as the number one priority. Our Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, decided that he would not attend. He clearly put other priorities ahead of the issue of the welfare of the world's children. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an important issue because it is not well appreciated that 40,000 children in the world still die every single day of preventable causes-either diseases that are preventable through simple medicinal treatment or, alternatively, through malnutrition. I do not need to add those numbers up on a monthly or yearly basis but it comes to a staggering number of children of the world's community who are unnecessarily suffering. One must also remember that the world now contains, it is estimated, some 150 million children under the age of five who are malnourished. Some 250 million children of the world's community are still out of primary or secondary schools. Even the figure for primary schools alone is over 100 million. Therefore, it was considered, particularly by such bodies as the United Nations Children's Fund and by a number of world leaders, that there was a need to bring together the international community to address this issue and to look for ways in which as an international community we could make efforts to improve the lot of these suffering children. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I have referred to the costs to children in the Third World, it is important to remember that this is not simply a Third World problem. Many children are unnecessarily suffering within the First World, within the developed world. We are only too well aware, even in our own country, of children who are living in poverty. We continually remember the shallow promise of the Prime Minister in relation to poverty-that no child in Australia will live in poverty-when in fact more children are living in poverty than perhaps ever before. We have got to be made aware of and to remember the circumstances of child homelessness, of child abuse, of the consequences of family breakdown, the trauma suffered by children and, sadly, the increasing levels of youth suicide in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The international community wanted to make it clear that when we address the lot of children, although we tend to concentrate on those who are dying and those who are malnourished in the Third World, we should not forget the issue of children in the developed world. The conference was held in New York. It was said by some that despite the enormous wealth of the United States, there are still one million children in the United States who are hungry. Anyone who was privileged enough to attend the conference in New York and therefore to walk the streets of New York could see the horrifying sights of children suffering in the most wealthy country in the world. So it was a responsibility, we believe, that went well beyond the Third World and one that was worthy of international debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It was staggering that 71 of the world leaders were prepared to join on this occasion. It was my privilege to be at least an observer member of the Australian delegation, and it has enabled me to come back and put to the Parliament and to other fora in this country some observations that I think we should take into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I could do that by referring to the views that were put by some of the world leaders which, no doubt, would have been edifying to our Prime Minister if he had put this conference ahead of attending the football grand final or whatever was his higher priority. For example, we were reminded by President Chisano of Mozambique that in his country 45 per cent of primary schools were closed as a result of the civil war. Over half a million children in his country lost their lives as a result of that civil war. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that is the most primary application of an abuse of children that we could think of, where adults engage in conflict within a nation to serve their political objectives at the cost of suffering and death to so many children and at the cost of education to so many children, which will never be recovered. He wanted to stress to other world leaders the consequences that his nation had suffered from that sort of issue. The leader of Colombia, who was present, not surprisingly spoke of the issue of drug trafficking within his country and how the children of his country have suffered as a result of that both directly and, of course, indirectly. The abuse of children through drug trafficking is in many ways destroying the society of Colombia. </PARA>
<PARA> The presentation of the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Kaifu, was interesting. It is interesting in itself that Mr Kaifu found time to travel to New York for this purpose. He stressed that the experience of Japan is that the education of children has been the key to the development and success of Japan since the Meiji restoration at the start of this century and urged other world leaders, therefore, to lift the priority of education within their own domestic programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The new President of Brazil, not surprisingly, addressed the environmental destruction that was occurring in his country and how that was causing suffering and detrimental consequences to children. President Havel of Czechoslovakia, in perhaps the most moving contribution to this summit, told how for generations the truth had been kept from the children of Czechoslovakia and how the subtle means of deprivation of information to children can so affect them in their adult lives. He said that parents felt that they had no alternative under the totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia than not to tell their children the truth. But by parents not telling their children the truth, not only did the totalitarian regime and the suffering that resulted from it continue longer than was necessary, but also the whole development of the children was inhibited by that lack of information. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it was President Havel's argument that totalitarianism was overthrown when the children, the younger generation, revolted against this lack of information, demanded the truth, got the truth, and took action. For 71 of the world leaders, listening to this address was no doubt enlightening to them and it was uplifting to everyone else who was in the United Nations (UN) chamber listening to it. Similarly, the new Democratic President of Bulgaria drew the linkage of democracy to the rights of children and how children had suffered under the previous communist regime in Bulgaria. </PARA>
<PARA> Prime Minister Thatcher took a different point of view and again, interestingly, brought the debate back to the First World. She lay emphasis upon the responsibility of parents towards their children. Not surprisingly, a lot of the time of this conference was concerned with how States can help the lot of children by reallocating funding, reallocating priorities and so forth. Mrs Thatcher made the point that, even with those reallocations of moneys, we must not forget that the well-being of children largely is the responsibility of parents and, too often, parents do not meet that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Thatcher spoke of children being deserted by their families, particularly by their fathers. It was interesting that she received a round of applause from the audience, and largely from the African women in the audience. It was interesting to see the African audience present applauding Margaret Thatcher for bringing to the attention of world leaders that, when they consider these priorities, they should not forget the responsibilities of parents towards their children that are too often forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tunisian leader spoke, not surprisingly, about the children who have been suffering in the occupied territories and told world leaders not to forget the suffering of Palestinian children through the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We had a very interesting contribution from the leader of the Maldives, who spoke of the rising sea levels of the Maldives and how the children of his country had actually made presentations to him to take to New York and wanted him to communicate to other world leaders that unless we solve some of our environmental problems and, in his instance, the climatic problems that are resulting in rising sea levels, his coral atolls will be submerged and his children will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have tried to do, therefore, in a brief time is to bring to this place some of the diversity of ideas that came out of a conference of world leaders communicating with each other on the issue of children who are suffering and how the world community might address that issue. Certainly what came through the conference, to my mind, was the linkage between international development and child suffering and environmental development and child suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> In re-establishing that linkage it reminded us all that as we address the economic inequities and the suffering that follows from environmental abuse we are addressing to some extent the issue of children. What also came through was the cost of unprecedented population growth in the world and the need for that to be addressed if we are to give children the good health and opportunities which they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I made the point some time ago that what was stressed was the importance of education, in not just looking to a child's physical and material well-being during childhood but in understanding our responsibility to give that child the best possible education within the resources that are available. </PARA>
<PARA> It was disappointing that the Prime Minister was not prepared to make the trip to New York. I know that it is a long trip but Prime Minister Namaliu from Papua New Guinea was there and he was prepared to make the long trip for this purpose. The Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Father Lini, was there. He chose it as a high priority, despite the long distance. As an Australian, therefore, I very much regret that Mr Hawke was not there, not only to listen to what other leaders had to say but also, hopefully, to put a point of view on behalf of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to have been able to bring that matter to the attention of the Senate. In concluding, although it was a little disappointing that not too many world leaders made concrete pledges that we could see would be clearly implemented in ways that would benefit children, there were some positive signs. For example, the conference was advised that the World Bank had stated its intention to increase primary health care lending from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. We might say that is still a very low percentage; nevertheless it is a step in the right direction and it has been clearly stimulated by conferences such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I make before I move on to the next subject matter is that we should be reminded that, incredibly, in the last decade that part of international ODA, official development aid, that has been earmarked for education and health within the world community has in fact dropped from 17 per cent to 10 per cent. I think this further demonstrates why we should be facing up to these issues, addressing them and making the right decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make a few comments on two other matters. I want to mention the issue of Cambodia, which is referred to in the Prime Minister's statement. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Schacht had the courtesy to listen, he might be better educated on this important issue. I bring to the Senate's attention the fact that, despite the efforts of the world community to find a solution, a comprehensive settlement, to the Cambodian conflict-and they are efforts which we of course applaud and encourage-violence in Cambodia is increasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Schacht was interested in this debate he would have no doubt noted that in the last few days the Khmer Rouge, which the Australian Government now appears to be indirectly supporting, has been bolstered by its first shipment of Chinese tanks-we are told that this is in an environment of a settlement-and is preparing a major attack to seize the north-western province of Svay Rieng, which is considered to be one of Cambodia's most important cultural and historic regions. The violence and death is continuing on the ground in Cambodia. Therefore, before we start congratulating ourselves on the achievements towards a settlement, perhaps we should recognise that Cambodians are suffering and dying every day as the civil war continues. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also recognise that many steps remain, even if a settlement can be ultimately achieved between the Khmer factions as endorsed by the international community, particularly through the Permanent Five and the Paris process. At the moment the United Nations has no idea of the sort of administrative or military role it will have to meet and the sort of military force and administrative grouping it will have to apply. Under the Permanent Five agreement, the UN force would have to contain and disarm the Khmer factions, but as yet none of the four Khmer factions has been prepared to give information to the UN as to the size of their forces, what armaments they have-and we now see that the Khmer Rouge is bringing tanks into the conflict for the first time-and where their troops are dispersed. Therefore, at the moment the United Nations-and this information comes from the Under Secretary-General responsible in this area, Mr Ahmed-has no idea of the size or composition of the force it will have to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, if a settlement can be concluded through the Paris conference, when that is eventually held, the United Nations will then have to send a military mission to Cambodia and again ask the Khmer factions whether they are prepared to give that required information. Only then can it start assessing the size of the force that will be necessary to meet that first phase of its responsibility, and only then can we in this country start assessing what sort of force will be expected of Australia as a contribution to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Major developments of infrastructure, which seem to have been completely overlooked by this Government, will then have to occur. The United Nations advises me that before it can take the next step, before the military function starts, major work will have to be done on ports, roads, airfields and communications. Of course, the question then is who will pay for this, how much time will it take, and how will these infrastructure works be completed. </PARA>
<PARA> After that, which is a massive task in itself, comes the responsibility of returning all the 300,000-odd refugees and displaced persons. Before they return an atmosphere of confidence has to be created. Apart from that, the logistics and administration of their return to Cambodia, you would appreciate, Madam Deputy President, is an enormous task. Also, before they can be returned, the country must be cleared of mines and other security mechanisms put in place to ensure their safety. Anyone who has studied this subject at all will recognise the extent to which Cambodia has been mined in the most horrific way and the enormity of the task of de-mining the Cambodian countryside. </PARA>
<PARA> After all that has been achieved, the UN Administration will be required to take over the functions of the government, including internal security, which will require a large international police force. No real thought has yet been given as to the size of that force, who will constitute that force and what responsibility will fall to Australia in that regard. It will also be required to take over the administrative responsibility for communications, finance, foreign affairs and defence. Never before has the UN been given such a mandate. Never before has the UN attempted to take over such widespread responsibilities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht should debate what is really ahead rather than try to camouflage it in a shallow, simplistic way, as has been continually promoted in this chamber by the Minister. Let us address the real issues that lie ahead. We can then have a real debate about what needs to be done to meet those issues and what contribution Australia should be making in that regard. Just consider for a moment what is needed in the United Nations taking over the responsibility of finance and all its functions, a central bank and so forth for Cambodia, which it has never done before. The administrative arm of the United Nations will also have to devise an electoral system; supervise the registration of parties and voters; provide an electoral commission; and conduct, supervise and ensure free and fair elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether the UN can succeed in these objectives will depend not only on the goodwill and material support of countries such as ours but also on the good faith and cooperation of the four Khmer factions, very little positive evidence of which we have seen so far. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have said recently-and I take this opportunity to reiterate it-is that if the factions were genuine in being prepared to move to this next phase of a settlement, they could demonstrate that goodwill and good faith by now agreeing to a cease-fire. Until they have agreed to a ceasefire, the UN cannot properly start the massive task that lies before it, which I have sought to outline briefly today. </PARA>
<PARA> When an attempt at a cease-fire was last made at the Tokyo talks some months ago, the Khmer Rouge, as honourable senators will recall, boycotted those talks: it was not even prepared to discuss the issue of a cease-fire. I have to concede that those of us who remain-unlike Senator Schacht-sceptical about the goodwill of the Khmer Rouge in this settlement process still wonder whether we will actually see it being prepared to enter into a cease-fire, put down its arms, cooperate with the United Nations in the enormous and complex task that lies ahead and enter into a democratic election process, which the optimists believe that it will. Nevertheless, for the sake of Cambodia, one must retain not only hope but also a willingness to get in there and make our modest contribution as a country that has recognised the suffering endured by the innocent Cambodian people for so long and recognised that they deserve so much better. </PARA>
<PARA> If I had time, I would have liked to talk also about the issue of China and the gratuitous comments of the Prime Minister in relation to the very successful trip of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to China, a trip that the leaders of the Labor Party--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very tempted to take it, but I think it would incur the wrath of Senator Schacht, who wants an opportunity to contribute. The honourable senator has invited me to seek an extension of time because of the disastrous state of the Notice Paper and the Government's longing on this occasion for those who are prepared to fill the day's business. It is regrettable that the Australian Government has not been prepared to take to China's leaders the concerns that we all feel about the ongoing human rights abuses that are occurring in China, and to make it clear to China's leaders that a normal relationship is desirable, which includes participation in celebrations such as the Asian games, looking to the Australian taxpayers to help through aid in the development of China, and contributing in our modest way in defence cooperation, which I think we do principally through goodwill visits such as ship visits. It is simply not possible to have that type of normal relationship with China when it is not prepared to accept the universally accepted minimum standards of human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the message that we took to China's leaders. Although they might refer to these matters of human rights as internal matters, they are not internal matters any longer, they have been accepted as a norm by the international community. If China is to take its place as a leader of the international community, and we have given it leadership responsibilities as a member of the Permanent Five in Security Council, then it should be playing a leadership role in meeting reasonable human rights standards rather than abusing the internationally accepted minimum standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson took these concerns to the Chinese leaders direct, and at first hand. We remind the Australian Government that that is the correct approach and that isolation is not going to change China. The Government is not going to change attitudes unless it is prepared to communicate. I certainly commend Dr Hewson for his courage. I regret that the Prime Minister has had to degrade the debate by personal attacks upon him rather than be prepared to debate the issues at the level which they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the head of this travelogue of the Prime Minister, I am at least pleased that I have been able to bring to attention three important matters: the International Summit on Children and our disappointment that Prime Minister Hawke let Australia down in the way that he did; the issue of Cambodia, which is so important but which requires so much more work and effort; and the ongoing issue of human rights in China, which requires the attention of all of us, and ongoing pressure from all of us, until that situation is improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill said in his opening remarks that no indication was given yesterday that there would be a debate today. I just wanted to clear that matter up. The Government Whips did indicate yesterday at the Whips meeting that there would be a debate today on the Prime Minister's statement, and warning was given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After hearing Senator Hill's remarks, I am not surprised that he spent most of his time talking about everything else other than what was in the statement, because the Opposition's record on foreign affairs matters over the last few years has been abysmal, to say the least. It has lacked consistency, and it has been episodic. As most commentators have said, the Government has turned foreign affairs into a real plus in its achievements during its period in office. I will come back to that matter later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, the Prime Minister's statement deals with a number of countries which he visited as part of Australia's relations: a visit to New Caledonia, a visit to Papua New Guinea (PNG), attendance at the South Pacific Forum meeting and a visit to Japan. I would like to comment on a number of the remarks that the Prime Minister has made which I believe add to the Australian Government's policy of having a constructive relationship with the countries of our immediate region, as well as with Japan, our most important economic trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal, first of all, with New Caledonia. I know that Senator Hill did not mention New Caledonia in his remarks. I am disappointed that he did not, since long before he was a shadow spokesman on foreign affairs he has been a consistent advocate of a peaceful settlement and supporter of the rights of the Kanak people to self-determination in New Caledonia. I congratulate him on his role in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the developments in New Caledonia over the last couple of years since the Rocard Government came to power in France have been very encouraging. Though I have been a great critic of French foreign policy in the South Pacific over many years, I give credit to the French Government, particularly to Prime Minister Rocard, for what he has achieved in discussion with the Kanak people and the Caldoches, or the French settlers in New Caledonia, and in reaching an accord, called the Matigon Accord, which is a way forward for a peaceful resolution to an act of self-determination in 1998. All this has been affected by the tragic assassination of Jean-Marie Tijbaou and Yeweine Yeweine in May of last year. Senator Hill and I attended the funeral of those two outstanding leaders with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. It was an emotional moment for anybody in attendance at that funeral service. The attendance of the Prime Minister of France, Mr Rocard, and the way he conducted himself through those funeral ceremonies, meant that the potential for an outbreak of violence was greatly reduced. I think that Prime Minister Rocard--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was a great credit to his country.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was a great credit to himself and his country. The fact that there was no outbreak of violence was due to the way Prime Minister Rocard conducted himself. Since then, the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) has elected new leaders. Francois Burk was elected to be leader of the Union Caledonienne, the largest party in the FLNKS, and Mr Niotene was elected as the leader of the FLNKS. The constructive discussion that has gone on with the French Government and the RPCR, the main French settler party, still gives one considerable hope that a peaceful settlement will be reached leading up to the referendum to be held in 1998.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has played a constructive role. I think we have been correct through the 1980s in insisting that there be a process in which the Kanak people have the right to self-determination rather than the sterile policies of the Chirac Government, which in many ways contributed to the violence that occurred, including the massacre at Ouvea. I excuse neither side from violence. No-one should support violence in any form. </PARA>
<PARA> The provocative policies of the previous Chirac Government, as they were implemented in New Caledonia, contributed to the violence and, ultimately, to the deaths of a number of people. Without going into the details of it, I believe that the assassination of Tjibaou by Djubelly Wea can be traced back to the incidents at Ouvea in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Australian Government and the Australian people can take credit for following a consistent line on New Caledonia which will, I hope, lead to a peaceful settlement in which the people of New Caledonia determine whether they will have independence or a different association with the French Government. It is a matter for them to determine, not for us or for other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit of the Prime Minister to New Caledonia was the first of a Prime Minister from Australia since 1941, when the then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, visited. I think that visit took place as a result of wartime measures, when the Australian Government intervened to overthrow the Vichy French Administration that had control of New Caledonia, for Australia's security purposes during the Second World War. Also, I had the great honour to lead the first parliamentary delegation to New Caledonia in April 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In his report to the Parliament the Prime Minister mentioned his visit to PNG. No doubt, at the moment, the most important relationship that we have to deal with in Australia is our relationship with PNG. There has been plenty of publicity about the very difficult situation in Bougainville. There has been criticism of the Australian Government's response in providing assistance to the PNG Government-helicopters, et cetera. I should point out to those critics that this was a response of the Australian Government to a democratically elected sovereign government of PNG asking for assistance. I do not believe there is anything wrong with an Australian government providing assistance to a democratically elected government. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be forgotten that since 1975, no matter what the problems of PNG have been-economic or social-there have been a number of peaceful changes of government in PNG. Whether we agree or disagree with the structure of the PNG Constitution that creates some instability in the arrangements for government, the thing is that the Constitution has survived, that governments have been defeated on the floor of the PNG Parliament, and that the losers have accepted the decision of the Parliament that they go out of office and another party comes into office. There have been several changes of government since 1975. When one looks at the rest of the developing world, one sees that that is not a record that many other countries can match. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people in Australia and elsewhere who may be pessimistic about the future opportunities in PNG for peaceful settlement should also weigh up the fact that, despite all of those difficulties, PNG has a vibrant democracy that is working: it is accepted that the Parliament is the supreme body in the government of the country. And that is something which we should give credit for and which should not be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Australia, as the major aid donor to PNG, is called upon to play a critical role. At the moment we are giving approximately $250m in untied aid to the Budget of PNG. As a percentage of the Budget expenditures it is declining, and I think we would all welcome that because any country that has to rely on one other country for a large percentage of its Budget obviously is going to have some problems. The big debate that has been conducted in some areas of Australia is whether that untied aid should become tied aid. I know-as a member of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which is presently conducting an inquiry into Australia's relations with PNG-that it is a debate as to whether this untied aid should become more tied. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very difficult question to resolve. We can say that with tied aid we can make sure that the money we give is directly tied to specific projects and spent in accordance with the wishes of the donor country to ensure, from our perspective, that the money is wisely spent; conversely, if we do that we can then be accused of being neo-colonialist and paternalistic and interfering with the rights of a sovereign country. I have to say I do not think there is a conclusive way to resolve that argument on either side. It is a matter of discrete judgment, from time to time, as to how we judge those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a special relationship with PNG as the ex-colonial power and, therefore, we have to accept some responsibility for providing Budget assistance. But I believe that in the longer run it probably is in our interests as well as, above all else, in PNG's interest that more of that aid money be given as tied aid for specific development programs. I think that will be a major issue that the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee will deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing which should be mentioned about PNG-again returning to the need for constitutional change-is that many people in Australia have been recommending to PNG that its Constitution be changed so that the six-monthly motion of no confidence can be removed and there is more stability. I think it is a bit paternalistic for Australia to suggest to other countries how to go about constitutional change when, for nearly 100 years, we have been almost singularly unsuccessful in Australia in being able to change our own Constitution through referendum and when, on any rational judgment, it should have been updated on a number of occasions from what was written in the 1890s. We should be a little careful in moralising to the people of PNG about their Constitution, which, in fact, we helped impose on them as part of independence in 1975. Obviously, there has to be some adjustment and there is some indication that more of the politicians of PNG recognise the need for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister attended the South Pacific Forum. The thing that ought to be noted about the South Pacific Forum is that it is one of the few forums in the world that has present a majority of developing countries which have democratically elected governments. The countries that are represented in the South Pacific Forum include-and I hope I have got the full list here-PNG, Australia, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, who were recently added, Western Samoa, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Niue, Nauru and Vanuatu. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also Fiji, but I would exclude that from this list because the countries I have just read out have democratic forms of government. It should be a matter of considerable pride that in this region of the world there is an overwhelming acceptance of the democratic system of government-of election of governments into parliaments with the rights of dissent and argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it has been a great tragedy of the 1980s that Fiji, one of the major countries in the region, has had a military coup and has now adopted a new Constitution that by no stretch of the imagination can be called democratic. It has a number of features about it which are well known in Australia and which we object to. It is racist and the electoral system is gerrymandered to ensure that one group of people-not just one race, but one group of people within that race-can dominate the government for the foreseeable future. That is unfortunate, and the Australian Government has made it clear that, although we do not want to interfere with the internal affairs of countries, we do not accept the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are other countries in the South Pacific which, hopefully, one day will be represented as independent-that is, New Caledonia and Tahiti. I think that, in any consideration of our region, our role in the South Pacific Forum is to encourage further development and, as we now enter the second decade of independence for most of those countries, to ensure that that continues. It is a matter of considerable pride that I do not think there is any other area in the world with as many developing countries that have accepted a democratic form of government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that there will not be strains. For example, only recently in Tonga, which has a peculiar Constitution, to say the least-a mixture of monarchy, autocracy and democracy-there have been pressures for a more democratic form of government. It is interesting to note that the people have been voting to support the election of members of parliament who want a more open and representative form of government. I believe the Australian Government should make it clear to the Government of Tonga that we support those developments because it means a more democratic form of government will emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's visit to Japan dealt with a number of issues which I think are important to Australia. One of them does not seem to be very important, but anybody who has been to Japan would find it most important as it affects Japan's attitudes in foreign affairs, and that is the question of the so-called northern territories. A number of very small islands off the immediate north coast of Hokkaido used to be Japanese but, as a result of the Second World War, they were taken by the Soviet Union and have not been handed back. If one visits Japan, it is one foreign affairs issue that is raised consistently by the Japanese. Unless it is resolved I suspect the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union will always be cool. There are indications now that the Soviet Union may be at least willing to hand back a couple of those islands. I welcome that move because I believe it will mean that the Soviet Union and the Japanese Government will be able to adopt a much more mature relationship that will lead to economic advantages for the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister pointed out in his statement that he had discussions with the Japanese Government and business people about the establishment of the MFP-the multifunction polis-in South Australia. As a South Australian senator, I welcome that. I note with considerable interest that the Japanese have appointed a Mr Saito, one of Japan's leading businessmen, to chair the Japanese committee to work for the establishment of the MFP and that an investment mission from Japan will shortly visit Australia looking at investment opportunities in the MFP. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that recently the Premier of South Australia was in western Europe talking to the French, the British Government and other European governments about European investment in the MFP and he was encouraged by the response. As Japan is our major trading partner, it is quite clear that Japan will be central to Australia's economic interests in the foreseeable future. We are, I think, the sixth largest trading partner for Japan. With those statistics, whether people like it or not, Australia has to have a very detailed, mature and sensible relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been very unfortunate that in the last few years some elements in Australian politics have been willing to play what I would call the racist card and, in an underlying way, to create some xenophobia in Australia about the role of Japanese investment in Australia and Japanese tourists visiting Australia. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot have our economy and our standard of living overwhelmingly reliant on Japanese trade and sell large amounts of raw materials to Japan and import cars, et cetera, from Japan, which everybody has no difficulty in purchasing, and then go round saying something nasty about the Japanese involvement in this country. That sort of underlying racist issue has to be put down without equivocation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in his speech to the Parliament yesterday drew attention to what I would not say was a policy on foreign affairs, because I do not think it stands up as a coherent policy, but a number of difficulties the Opposition has with foreign affairs. The first thing I want to draw attention to is Cambodia. Senator Hill referred at length to Cambodia. I do not think that Senator Hill can talk with any credibility about Cambodia as he has been consistently wrong on Cambodia. The Opposition, when in government, was consistently wrong and it has been consistently wrong in opposition. One of the classic statements of all time was that by Senator Hill in an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio program the World Today on 18 July 1990 from Phnom Penh. In response to a question Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the prospect of any comprehensive settlement, any settlement that involves a role for the Khmer Rouge, is really not going to succeed. The sooner we recognise that a political settlement that involves one party that simply won't participate in a political resolution of the problem, the better off we're going to be because we can then move to alternative possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>That was at 12 o'clock on 18 July on radio. At 3 o'clock, just three hours later, it was announced that the P5-the permanent five members of the Security Council-had reached agreement on two of the critical matters to get a comprehensive settlement. </PARA>

Two days after the P5 reached that agreement, the Americans announced that they would have dialogue with the Vietnamese for the first time in 15 years. That dialogue has now started. The P5 has now reached agreement on all areas in dispute, including China. China has made it quite clear to the Khmer Rouge that it either agrees to a comprehensive settlement or it is on its own. The Supreme National Council, despite all the arguments, backtracking and disputes between the Cambodian factions, has started to meet. There will be a meeting before the end of this year of all the parties, which will lead to a settlement. That is a much more optimistic attitude than the Opposition ever expressed. Above all else, the ultimate hypocrisy of the Opposition is that when it was in government from 1979 to 1982, it supported the Khmer Rouge being represented in the United Nations (UN) as part of the government of Cambodia. Andrew Peacock resigned because he could not stomach the hypocrisy of the Malcolm Fraser position. So, for the Opposition to accuse us of getting into bed with the Khmer Rouge is rank hypocrisy when for three years, when it was fully known about the genocide of the Khmer Rouge, Senator Hill and his Party supported in the UN its right to be recognised as the legitimate government of Cambodia. Now they say that the Khmer Rouge is not going to take part in this process.</PARA></TALK.START>

It has not done one thing to support the Phnom Penh Government in its fight against the Khmer Rouge. The Opposition has washed its hands of it all the time and now it says that we cannot trust the Khmer Rouge. The Opposition has done nothing to support the Phnom Penh Government in its 10-year fight against the Khmer Rouge.

We have put forward a policy that will mean that the 50-year war for Indo-China will probably come to an end in the next 12 months. What have those opposite done, expect recognise the Khmer Rouge to be the official government in the UN? The Opposition has no credibility at all on the issue of Cambodia. It is almost painful to hear it try to explain and be pessimistic and do everything possible to talk down the Australian Government's comprehensive peace settlement. It has been doing that for 12 months and has been wrong every time. It will be consistently wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer to another area of foreign policy. Last year Senator Hill was downplaying the Prime Minister's initiative for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group. Senator Hill went so far in this chamber as to have an inquiry referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade based on the view that once an inquiry was under way the evidence would come forward to show that APEC was a myth, that it was not going to happen, that it would not work. Well, he has been disproved on that. </PARA>

Greg Sheridan is by no means a left wing supporter of the Australian Labor Party. I think he would not object to being described as a radical right winger in the emphasis he puts on issues dealing with politics, foreign affairs, economics and so on. In an article which appeared in the Australian today under the headline `How Labor stole the foreign policy show' he said that the coalition has been left with virtually nothing to say. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly lame for the Opposition to argue that the Government is not pursuing Australia's interests with sufficient vigour given the creation of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA>He criticises the Opposition over its `tawdry' performance on Cambodia. He does say something about Senator Hill, which I want to put on record. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill is universally regarded as intelligent, well informed and well motivated. But he is no match for a workaholic foreign minister constantly briefed by hundreds of foreign policy specialists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose those who are listening to this debate could be forgiven for wondering what it is we are debating. I should remind the Senate that we are debating the parliamentary statement dated Tuesday, 9 October 1990, by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to visits to New Caledonia, the South Pacific Forum, Papua New Guinea and Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the two previous speakers in this debate have used the opportunity to range far and wide on matters of foreign policy, I would like to draw from what the Prime Minister has said a conclusion about where this Government stands in relation both to internal policy and external policy. The manner in which the Prime Minister has approached other countries, the attitudes that he has carried to those other countries, the requests that he has made of those other countries and the way in which he has reported back to this Senate indicate a great deal about the attitudes of the Government and the way in which it places emphases and priorities in certain areas and not in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pick up on particular things which the Prime Minister has said in this statement. I want to indicate where I believe the emphases are wrong and where I believe the Government has taken us in a wrong direction with respect to this statement in our relationship with other countries and, by implication, also with respect to its policies within this country. I also want to indicate how the Australian Democrats would approach many of these situations in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me begin by saying that I believe that in a very fundamental way the Prime Minister, this Government and, indeed, the Opposition, are totally misreading the portents of current history. We have in place a number of developments and trends which are being pointed out to governments, which need to be addressed urgently in relation to where we need to go in 10, 15 or 20 years time and which are being ignored by this Government and this Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> I raised with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) just in the last sitting week the Government's attitude, for example, to the intergovernment panel on climate change (IPCC). I would remind the Senate that the IPCC, composed of some 300 leading scientists on climate change from over 20 countries, has recently recommended that as a matter of urgency the world needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 60 and 80 per cent. Although the Senate chamber is not particularly full at the moment, I am sure that those senators who were present on that occasion will recall that the chamber almost broke up in loud guffaws. The Minister concerned dealt with the question as though it was trivial and somewhat of a joke. Quite clearly, the Government has not even begun to address that question which impacts not only on this country but on every country. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, by extension, let me say that I am a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which has before it at the moment a reference on greenhouse. That Committee has had a number of government departments before it. It has had Treasury, Land Transport, and Primary Industries and Energy. Specifically, it has had before it the people from those departments who are charged with the responsibility of formulating and advising government on policy in relation to greenhouse. Not one of those departments would indicate that the Government has any policy whatsoever in relation to what the Government itself in its own paper on sustainable development has recognised as the most important matter which will determine both internal and external policy well into the future-into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> When those witnesses who appeared before the Industry, Science and Technology Committee were asked when they would have a policy in place in relation to the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions, not one of them could state a time. And yet, my understanding is that by as soon as February next year this Government will have to have in place its position which it will take to the international forum, which throughout 1991 will formulate the international agreement on the reduction and limitation of greenhouse gas emissions in the future in a similar way to the international agreement on ozone depleting emissions under the Montreal Protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the context of the decision announced just in the past couple of days in relation to the south-east forests that the Government has attempted yet again to compromise very important environmental considerations for perceived short term economic gain. In that context Mr Hawke has gone forth to the South Pacific Forum and to these other nations with certain attitudes and priorities which we believe to be totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht in his address a moment ago mentioned a number of nations in the South Pacific Forum and indicated that, fortunately, many of them have some form of democratic government. I share with him the view that that is to be highly commended, and to the extent that we have played some part historically in that process we should be quite proud. However, he mentioned that Fiji was not one of those nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, as the consequence of an act which occurred over 100 years ago, Fiji today does not have a democratic government. The attempt by Britain to solve the short term economic problem of labour supplies in the sugar industry by bringing Indian indentured labour into Fiji can be pointed to fairly and squarely as the cause of the present strife in Fiji, with the enormous racial conflict between indigenous Fijians and the descendants of the Indian people who were brought in over 100 years ago. It should be an object lesson to us that, in attempting to address economic problems, we need to take a much longer term view than that which this Government is taking. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first page of the Prime Minister's speech, he mentions that he went to Tokyo and spoke with the Prime Minister and various other Ministers in relation to trade relations in an attempt to gain greater access for Australia's agricultural products on the Japanese market. He says specifically on page 11:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is only this Government which has defined economic enmeshment with the region as a key objective for this country for the coming decade . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats are committed to developing a sustainable economy. One of the characteristics of a sustainable economy will be that each person, each group of people and each nation will be as self-sufficient as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> One need only look at the situation which has developed over the conflict in the Middle East to see one of the immediate consequences of pursuing a policy of enmeshment. Iraq had become one of the principal importers of Australian grain, and we were in the position of importing considerable amounts of petroleum from Middle Eastern countries. As a consequence of what has happened we have lost significant sales to Iraq and our petroleum imports from that country have been jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA> Had we pursued the sorts of policies that I have been urging on Senator Button for the past three years in relation to the much-vaunted Button car plan-in other words, if we had developed much greater self-sufficiency in petroleum in this country by using the technologies which were already available to have a much more efficient transport industry, much more fuel efficient vehicles-we would now be in a much less vulnerable position with respect to what is happening in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that when the Prime Minister was in Japan he was made aware of the fact that the Japanese were self-sufficient in rice, but that they grew their rice at a much higher cost than the cost at which Australia could export rice to Japan. He was urging the Japanese to give away their self-sufficiency and become dependent on Australian rice. Provided that the Japanese are growing their rice under sustainable conditions, that was a most stupid suggestion by the Prime Minister. It is far wiser for the Japanese to maintain self-sufficiency in rice production and not become dependent on another country. To seek deliberately to lock one country's economy into dependence on the economy, the environmental conditions and the politics of another country and on long and tenuous trade routes, with little control over the methods of manufacture, production and so on in those other countries, is not a sensible way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 2 of the Prime Minister's speech he talks about various other aspects of Japanese practices with respect to the environment, and he refers to driftnet fishing. It is certainly to be noted with a great deal of joy that the Japanese have agreed to give up driftnet fishing in the South Pacific. However, the very fact that the Japanese have chosen such an environmentally destructive method of fishing at all should give us some concern about attempting to lock our economy inextricably in with that of the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese have an atrocious record in regard to the exploitation of tropical rainforests. Some 90 per cent of the rainforest logging going on around the world is being conducted by Japanese companies-and not for high quality products but largely to produce plywood for concrete on Japanese building sites, to be used once and then thrown away. Prime forest timbers that have taken hundreds of years to grow are being used for a trivial purpose, leading to massive destruction, massive displacement of indigenous people, and very significant additions to greenhouse gas emissions because of the forest destruction. We need to look very carefully at a policy which, for short term economic reasons, specifically stated in the Prime Ministerial statement, seeks to lock us into an enmeshment-the word used by the Prime Minister-with an economy which is predicated on such environmental destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is also raised in the Prime Minister's statement of the high temperature incinerator on Johnston Atoll. This is relevant to the matter now being debated in Australia relating to the placement of a high temperature incinerator at Corowa. I have been strongly promoting for many years through various conservation bodies the idea that Australia should build a high temperature incinerator. We have tens of thousands of tonnes of toxic and environmentally very destructive waste in this country-the majority of it being generated and stored at the ICI plant at Botany Bay in New South Wales. Unfortunately, the former New South Wales Government totally mishandled the placement of a high temperature incinerator when it proposed to build such a facility right in the middle of the ICI plant in Botany Bay in Sydney, and mishandled the public relations side of that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then we have been casting about all over the country for a position in which to place a high temperature incinerator. The decision to go to Broken Hill in New South Wales some years ago was met by the people of Broken Hill with the obvious logic. If one wants to place this facility so far out in the countryside then it cannot possibly be safe, and therefore we do not need it. If it is safe, why do we not place it exactly where the waste is being generated? Of course, as we know from this morning's paper, the people of Corowa have reacted in precisely the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the matter before us here, the burning of nerve gas and other residues on Johnston Atoll, the same logical conclusion is being drawn by the people of the South Pacific. The far greater danger associated with this practice is in the movement and the transport of these highly toxic and dangerous substances; a factor which was well and truly canvassed in a Four Corners program a couple of weeks ago. Quite clearly, the United States Government should be forced to destroy stocks of these materials as close as possible to the point at which they now lie. I am one who believes that properly conducted-I stress that-a high temperature incinerator is the best technology we have at the present time to get rid of these sorts of materials. But we should certainly not be countenancing, as the Prime Minister has, the transport of these things halfway around the world to be disposed of on a Pacific atoll with all the attendant problems of not only transport but also transference from one mode of transport to the other, and the loading of these things eventually into the high temperature incinerator. The Prime Minister says in relation to Papua New Guinea:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that Australia had no wish to intervene in solving Papua New Guinea's problems. </PARA>
<PARA>However, this Government is countenancing, in the form of a number of Australian companies, practices in Papua New Guinea which are adding to Papua New Guinea's environmental problems. It is distressing that this Government has not been more forthright in condemning the very environmentally destructive practices of some Australian companies in relation to Papua New Guinea. Many of those practices will leave behind very long term, intractable and insoluble problems in the form of environmental destruction. I cite the massive problems of contamination of the Fly River as a consequence of the Ok Tedi operation-the silting, the loss of dam structure and material into that river, and the massive loss of cyanide which destroyed much of the wildlife some years ago. While I do not think Australia should be intervening to tell the Papua New Guineans what to do, we should certainly be helping them by not imposing on them practices which make their problems even more insoluble. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill mentioned in his speech that in attending the conference in New York, the delegates from the Maldives islands-not in this particular area of the world but relevant to what I am about to say-expressed concern about greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that many of those low-lying islands will disappear under water should the sea level rise as a consequence of present practices. Of course, this will lead to massive environmental problems and massive problems of displacement of vast numbers of people. The Maldives islands are relatively unpopulated, but Bangladesh is a country with large parts which may well become uninhabitable. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet this Government, as I indicated in my opening remarks, has done nothing and apparently intends to do very little, if anything, in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even though the advice is that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent, that the technology for doing this is available, and that it will not have the economically disastrous consequences which the limited policy advisers with which this Government has surrounded itself might have predicted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of obvious fact that many of the less developed countries in the Pacific region are not the ones that are creating this massive greenhouse problem; rather it is the developed countries like Australia. Indeed, on various assessments, Australia is somewhere between third and fifth in terms of the per capita contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. We are one of the worst offenders on this fundamental question, which within the next 20 to 30 years will very significantly impact on a number of these nations and indeed, in the case of some of the low-lying ones, may totally obliterate them. We do not find anything at all about this in the Prime Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister then goes on and develops at some length his discussions in Japan. He talks about the desirability of increased Japanese investment. Senator Schacht talked about xenophobia and racism. In answer to Senator Schacht and in relation to the Japanese, I would simply observe that it is my understanding that there are Koreans living in Japan who have been living there for several generations and who are not granted Japanese citizenship, but it would not be possible for Australians to go to Japan and buy real estate. I just wonder why, if the Japanese behave in this way, we should lay ourselves open to foreign ownership of real estate in this country by a nation which has demonstrated-and I am not making a racist remark here-a very damaging attitude to the global environment. Why should we import those attitudes? It is not so much the Japanese people as the attitudes. Why should we import those attitudes, give them a prominence and give them a respected place in our society for economic reasons? It seems to me that we would be well advised--</PARA>

He has not talked about West Germany. I am making the point that the Japanese have an abysmal record with respect to environmental vandalism in countries other than Japan. This Prime Minister's statement says that we should lock-or, to use his word, `enmesh'-our economy more inextricably with that of Japan. I believe that is not the correct course to follow and that a sustainable economy will be one which will exhibit large levels of independence and self-sufficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in dealing with this linking with Japan specifically mentions, for example, the brown coal liquefaction project in Morwell. If this is an example of the sorts of projects which are we are likely to see under the multifunction polis (MFP) and other close and enmeshed Japanese relationships, let me say that that brown coal liquefaction research and development project was an Australian disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been an Australian disaster in terms of its environmental impact and its impact on the occupational health of the Australians who work there. The Japanese, to the extent that they have discovered new technology-we do not know whether they have-have taken that technology back to Japan. There has been no sharing whatsoever of the technology discovered in relation to the liquefaction of our brown coal. More than that, the turning of brown coal into petroleum for use in vehicles which must rapidly disappear from our streets anyway is not the way we need to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out that the Prime Minister in his statement also takes a sideswipe at those of us who have been critical of the multifunction polis. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>I assured both the Japanese Government and business leaders that the prejudices within Australia which, at one point, put the MFP at needless risk, represented very much minority views. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me put it on record that it is not a prejudice to point out that this area in South Australia, which has the unwelcomed MFP being placed at Gillman, is very heavily polluted and that advice has been given by a number of expert advisers to government that that area should not be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also put on record that in the past week it has come to my notice that there are eight reports to government on the Gillman site which the Government has said cannot be released to the public. I remind the Senate that this is the time when there is supposed to be public discussion and public consultation on the MFP site. There are eight reports to government which the South Australian Government has said contain intellectual property and, therefore, cannot be released to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> It just so happens that I have in my possession by various means six of those eight reports. Let me tell the Senate that not one of those contains any intellectual property whatsoever, but all of them say things which are detrimental to the MFP site at Gillman in relation to environmental problems of pollution and the siting of an MFP in that very heavily polluted area. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Prime Minister to go to Japan and advise, as he tells us, the Japanese Government and business leaders that my attitude and presumably the attitude of others like me-that attitude being that in a period of public review the information on which the public needs to make a judgment should be available but is not available and that the South Australian Government has lied to the public in relation to holding that information back-is a prejudice, I find personally very offensive; and I am sure that many other people would also find it extremely offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me summarise: I find the statement of the Prime Minister interesting, but interesting from the point of view that it describes the Government's attitudes and priorities as those with which the Democrats totally disagree. Mostly, they are attitudes and priorities with which the Opposition, I am sure, would agree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the parliamentary statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with regard to his visits to New Caledonia, the South Pacific Forum, Papua New Guinea and Japan. The report, when examined in detail, is really but part of a picture of what was a very important visit, a visit which placed us securely in our own region in terms of, first of all, letting Australia's principal attitudes be known on a number of important issues in a number of countries and, secondly, in ensuring that Australians are aware of the importance that this region to our near north plays in the life of every Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A comment appearing in the Canberra Times by its correspondent Tony Wright with regard to my second point-the question of how much coverage there usually is of Australia's relationship with the region nearest to us-indicated that as far as he was concerned this extremely important visit by the Prime Minister hardly raised a ripple in the Australian media. To a large extent I must agree with him. It is beyond my understanding as to why the Australian press, in particular, did not discuss in any real detail some of the major issues raised by the Prime Minister, especially with regard to his visit to Japan. It is that question of our relationship with Japan which I want to discuss primarily today. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan has a special relationship with Australia. It is a political relationship. It is a relationship based upon mutual economical benefits. It is a relationship which has changed significantly over the past 50 years. It is a relationship which in some ways has been partially sustained by the events of 1941-45: a significant number of people in our older population have retained memories of the war atrocities that were committed, which from time to time has injected a degree of emotionalism into any discussion or debate about our relationship with Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in a debate on a Bill which came before this Senate last year-the War Crimes Amendment Bill-I do not think we should ever forget the cruelty and the viciousness and the lessons of history we can learn from uncontrolled abuse of power. Those lessons should never be forgotten. They should be taught to generation after generation. But there is a second step in the art of diplomacy, the positive side of diplomacy. That second step is to ensure that the outbreak of conflict never happens again. That takes a degree of objectivity, a degree of resoluteness, on the part of all participants to make sure that outright conflict does not recur. History has a habit on the whole of repeating itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing that stands out most clearly in the period 1930-41 is Japan's effective isolation from the rest of the world politically, economically and, in many ways, culturally. That isolation allowed extreme right wing elements in Japanese society to seize control of the political and parliamentary machine through violence and ultimately through popular sanction, which in the end led to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. There are many economic reasons behind the decisions made by the Japanese to go to war but, above all else, it was that sense of isolation which enabled them to lose their perspective and to initiate and engage in that disastrous conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister talks about not only enmeshing Australia in the South East Asian region but also enmeshing ourselves with the Japanese economy and those areas of South East Asia which are most influenced by the Japanese, he is looking to the future, learning from the past, and giving us a message and South East Asia a message that our future cannot any longer be as a predominantly white country in the middle of the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be that any longer. The world is too small. The best thing we can hand on to future generations is precisely a fulfilment of that enmeshment, culturally, socially and economically, that the Prime Minister talks about, so that the Japanese interests are, in effect, our interests; our interests are the Japanese interests-as much as is compatible with the different cultures that we have. That does not mean that we become more Japanese than the Japanese and they become more Australian than us; we retain our national identities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extremely important that that isolation which occurred in the 1930s does not occur again, and economic involvement is but the first step to ensure it does not occur again. Involvement in terms of foreign policy-mutually agreed goals-is one other approach. Cultural exchanges, tourism, all those ways that we have of serving our own needs and of connecting with other countries, we have to use in the case of our relationship with Japan. Japan is on the same time line as Australia. It is, in a sense, a straight sevenhour or eight-hour journey. It is just a hop, step and a jump away from us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese have a constrained and slightly unusual approach to foreign policy, born of their defeat in World War II and, to some extent, affected by their constitution, which was imposed on them by General MacArthur and the allied occupation forces. Yet despite that constitution, which prohibits the development of a military capacity of an offensive nature, despite the articles specifically referring to the need for Japan to have defence forces that are just that-defence, rather than offensive arrangements-the reality is that Japan is now one of the military powers not only of this region but of the world. For example, it has an extremely impressive air force. I will not go into the technical details as Senator MacGibbon is not in the chamber and he is the only one who would appreciate them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate, you are not a warmonger, so you would not appreciate an examination of the Japanese air force. Japan has the fourth largest navy in the world. It has a very efficient and effectively trained army. Above all else, Japanese industry has the capacity, particularly in the electronics area, which is so vital to the development of new weaponry and support of existing weaponry, and its technology is extremely advanced; and it is that possible military capacity which must make us aware that Japan will have, and in fact is already approaching, superpower status in terms of its defence capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, in his comments in Tokyo, made it quite plain that the hypocrisy which has surrounded the question of Japan's defence capacity has to end. We have to accept that it is a major force and that what Japan's constitution says is no longer reflected in reality in terms of its armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, with regard to Japan's economic power: for many years Australians refused to accept, in much the same way as we now seem not to accept Japan's military strength, Japan's economic strength. I remember, when I was a teenager, the image of Japanese goods: they were cheap; they were considered to be shoddy; they lacked design; they were imitations; they were borrowed designs. Very few people could say that today. In fact if one picks up a pair of scissors, any household utensil or something of a similar nature, the item that is most likely to break in one's hands because of its bad design or poor workmanship is likely to have come from Sheffield, England, than from Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> So we ignored the lesson that was staring us in the face 20 years ago. Secondly, we ignored our own weakness in terms of our constitutional framework. We are a large nation, geographically, with a small population, and we are divided into six States. We have a Noddyland parliamentary arrangement for the Australian Capital Territory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Diligently maybe, but not competently. The question of our constitutional structure 20 years ago was absolutely vital. We ignored it. Generally speaking, we missed out on any opportunity to change the Constitution to improve cooperation between the States to turn us into a nation. In fact we tended to praise the activities of Premiers like Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Sir Charles Court of Western Australia who seemed to specialise in undercutting when competing with other Australian States in order to secure contracts with, for example, Japanese buyers. The problem is: we are now suffering as a result of some of those contractual obligations that were set and signed by various State Premiers 20 years ago. It is only now that Australia is starting to see the sale and the development of its resources in a much more logical light and in terms of national perspectives-not as Queenslanders, South Australians, Tasmanians and so on, but as Australians. Were we not a pushover, not just for the Japanese but for most businessmen who had the backing of a national government in any dealings they had with Australia and particularly with the Australian States!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well for Senator Coulter to come into this chamber and to talk-from what I think is a slightly prejudiced viewpoint-about the domination of Australian culture, and in particular the Australian economy, by the Japanese. If the Japanese have an influence here which he finds unsatisfactory we have ourselves to blame, because at the basic level business is about bargaining: there is a buyer and there is a seller. There is a long term interest and there is a short term interest of the buyer and the seller. We were never able to put those interests together, firstly because of our constitutional framework and, secondly, because of our attitudes. We did not see ourselves as an integral part of Asia. My home State of Tasmania was once called the Apple Isle. That is now a joke. Why? Because we were still, in 1960 to 1962, looking to Europe for markets, when those markets were already going, when the question was really when Britain would join the Common Market, not if. </PARA>
<PARA> So one Tasmanian industry, a very important industry, went down the chute because we did not look to the future. We did not say to ourselves, `We are in South East Asia'. Our marketing and transport arrangements were appalling. I remember being in the State House in Tasmania, and sitting behind the Minister for Primary Industry-the poor bloke, because anyone who got that job I think deserved a medal-thinking, `When am I going to get a question on a couple of other things?'. </PARA>
<PARA>As a Minister I did not get a question because all Question Time-which in those days in the Tasmanian Parliament was unlimited; there was not an hour, it could go on for three hours if necessary-was devoted to where a particular ship carrying Tasmanian apples was. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The apples got left on the ship and the ship turned around and came back again. Our capacity to see ourselves as citizens of the world, as marketers in the world, as people who needed to get their act together to be exporters, just was not there. We said, as we did with so many industries, `Let us put up the tariff barriers. Let us put in the quotas to make sure that there is no genuine competition from outside. Let our industry become slack and uncompetitive. Let us consider that the domestic market is good enough. Let us allow multinationals to come into Australia and build up an industry but build up an industry behind tariff walls so that General Motors-Holden's Ltd could come in and buy an Australian company out'. Then General Motors could say to the Australian Government of the day, the Liberal Government of the day, `Now we want to be protected against foreigners'. Australians still cannot see the irony in that: that General Motors-an American company-could come in and then demand protection against other foreigners and that Ford could come into Australia and do the same thing. That is just one other area where Australians have no-one but themselves to blame, because the resolution of these problems is inevitably at the ballot box. They kept putting back in conservative governments who sold us out.</PARA></TALK.START>

Those colleagues used to go on television and say, `But what about States rights?'. I used to think, `Hang on a second, what about apple pie? That has probably got more relevance to Tasmania. What about motherhood? What about the right to drive a car on the left hand side of the road?'. States rights was just as relevant or irrelevant.

Very importantly, this Prime Minister more than any other Prime Minister since Prime Minister Chifley has ensured that we take a national perspective. He has ensured that first of all our resources belong to all Australians. He was the first to ensure that our infrastructure, under the stewardship of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), is about to be improved: a national perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter comes in here on behalf of the Australian Democrats and says, `Isn't it terrible that the Japanese have got market advantages in Australia; that the Japanese dominate the economic relationship between them and us?'. Senator Coulter has not looked at history. Senator Coulter is making sure that history repeats itself. It is precisely his attitude towards the Japanese, in particular, which will cause Japan to become isolated again. Prime Minister Hawke on his visit was absolutely right to have the courage and the tenacity to stand up and tell the world that Japan has to be treated as an equal-not as a superior, not as an inferior, but as an equal-with an equal right to its economic destiny, to its destiny with regard to its defence, and to its cultural destiny as part of a South East Asian area. It is right to have a relationship with us from which we both learn. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a point, for example, about the MFP, the multifunction polis, which the Prime Minister raised in Japan. Initially I had reservations about the multifunction polis, for the very good reason that when it first began it was promoted by businessmen who do not understand the meaning of the words `debate' and `inform', and who did not know how to bring the rest of Australian society with them. They were not prepared to put their cards on the table, to talk about who benefited, to bargain in fact with the Japanese as to what they wanted from a multifunction polis in Australia. In fact, they were selling us short. There were a couple of occasions when I was approached by people to give my support to the multifunction polis, and I told those lobbyists to go home, to do their homework, that I am an Australian, and that when Australians bargain with the Japanese or anyone else, then they ought to be bargaining as hard as they can. The facts should be put before the Australian people-clearly, concisely and honestly. I believe there was a lot hidden in those early proposals; they could rightly have been described as a potential land grab disguised as technology sharing. Why else would someone want to build a technology farm, or a technology city, on the most valuable land in Australia-Queensland's Gold Coast? The answer: if the technology development fails, one still has the valuable real estate. I said to those people who were talking about that sort of proposal, `Get off my patch, I am not interested in that'. Most Australians said the same thing. Australia is not for sale, and certainly not that cheaply. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or a VFT, or a bifocal. Either way the problem was the debate. The debate had to be public. The Prime Minister has raised that discussion about our relationship with Japan to a new level. He said things which the rest of the world wants to hear. In other words, he said, `Let's us be honest about Japan's defence capacity'. He said to Japanese businesses, `We don't want you here just for tourism. We are not just a tourist destination'. He said, `We are not real estate for you to buy up any time you like. We are, and we want to be, equal partners in technology sharing. We want to be part of the sophisticated economic development'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That has to be said over and over again to the Japanese business world and Japanese business leaders, because they need to get that message. I thought that the Prime Minister gave that message courageously, with the exception of one phrase which they had some problem with; about playing football, or silly people. That problem aside, they got the message. Australians are starting to get the message, particularly Australian businessmen, and particularly those who are associated with the early development of the multifunction polis. Those businessmen who were selling cheap I think are being pushed to one side, and it is up to us to ensure that Australian businesses involved in this multifunction polis, and our bureaucrats, know exactly what they are doing. So at the end of the day the Prime Minister's visit was extremely important, if badly and inadequately reported in Australia in terms of its significance. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in a decade or so people will look back to this particular period and they will say that that was the first Prime Minister of Australia who actually started to put the debate in perspective, to put it honestly and to demand that our relationship with Japan and other major countries in South East Asia is an equal and a productive one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to speak for long on this matter of the visit overseas of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I just want to mention one part of the Prime Minister's statement, and that is in regard to Papua New Guinea, and in particular to Bougainville. I was very pleased to read that the Prime Minister had raised concerns over human rights abuses by both the Papua New Guinea military forces and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. I was also very pleased to see that the Government has acknowledged the need for an outside body to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by both sides. I am sure that everyone here is aware that Amnesty International has documented many cases of human rights violations on Bougainville and these include really quite appalling things such as torture by both sides, police threats, assaults by both sides, extra-judicial executions by both sides and deaths in custody. I could go on and describe some of these things but they are the sorts of things that nightmares are made of and I, for one, do not get enough sleep around this place, so I will not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that Australia has a very clear responsibility to ensure that the supply of aid, and especially all our military aid, cannot be used to violate human rights. Australia's defence assistance to Papua New Guinea has been doubled since the 1988-89 allocation. In addition to that, Australia has agreed to spend an extra $12m this year on training and equipping 450 members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and another $3m in civil aid, which will be partly used to improve the professionalism of the police riot squads which have been linked with excessive force on Bougainville. About one-fifth of our defence cooperation allocation to Papua New Guinea last year was used on the four famous Iroquois helicopters which were used in Bougainville by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> While here we may be able to understand the arguments for and against Australia's role in providing these helicopters and the fine distinction between having guns bolted to helicopters versus having them tied on with rope, I would imagine that these distinctions are not quite as clear to the Bougainvillians, who see helicopters with guns attached flying overhead, but who do not have the benefit of the debate in our plethora of news and current affairs media. Actually we should note at this point that the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Government itself has a very good record on human rights. It has safeguards written into its Constitution and it also has judicial safeguards. There is obviously a very large disparity between the intent of the PNG Government and the actions of both the PNG military force on Bougainville and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. As I said, the Prime Minister has raised Australia's concerns over these actions. I would be very interested to hear whether the Foreign Minister intends to press these concerns when he gets back in order to try to achieve an inquiry by the Papua New Guinea Government into human rights abuses on Bougainville. It is something that we must all hope for. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the distinction between Australia's role in Bougainville and in Cambodia is really quite large. Enormous steps still need to be made to stop human rights abuses on both sides. Australia's role has been one of negotiation in Cambodia while we must be seen, on Bougainville, in a very different light. We have to ask whether that difference is due to the different attitudes of our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Department of Defence. Our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) who does deserve credit here, were in charge of our response on Cambodia while the Department of Defence was in charge of our response on Bougainville. We must agree with Amnesty International that the Australian Government cannot abrogate its responsibility for the uses to which Australian provided equipment or training is put. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, Australia's recent record on human rights has been very good under both Labor and Liberal governments. A little earlier during this debate Senator Schacht mentioned that the Australian Government has brought up human rights abuses with several countries-I think he said 87 countries around the world. I do not think that is something which can purely be said of the Australian Labor Party here. I think the Liberal Party, the National Party of Australian and the Australian Democrats have all said that they would do the same in government and I think a lot of that is due especially to the very good work of the parliamentary group of Amnesty International; in particular to Mr Robert Tickner of the other place and to former Senator Chris Puplick. </PARA>
<PARA> We must, though, accept that we do have a responsibility to act to stop human rights abuses being committed as a result of Australia providing any military aid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I understand that and I can hear from Senator Watson's interjections that he can understand that also. But, unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, Dr Hewson has chosen the area of Foreign Affairs to try to display some new found expertise. Of course, I think it is fair to say that Dr Hewson really has only demonstrated ignorance and callowness in his performance so far. Unfortunately for the Opposition but fortunately for the Government, Dr Hewson is only an economist and not a very good one at that. I think his performance over the last couple of weeks and his response to the parliamentary statement by the Prime Minister is absolute proof of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Acting Government Whip asked me this morning to speak in this debate-and I was very delighted that he gave me the opportunity to do so-I was thumbing through today's Australian newspaper as I received his phone call and what should I find in the Australian but this article from Foreign Affairs writer, Greg Sheridan, under the headline `How Labor stole the foreign policy show'. Greg Sheridan said this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . foreign affairs is an area of signal success for the Labor Party and it is the conservative Opposition which finds it almost impossible to make any inroads into the Government's standing in foreign affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1983, there has been a succession of coalition foreign affairs spokesmen, including Michael MacKellar-very forgettable, I interpolate-Neil Brown, Andrew Peacock, John Spender and now Senator Robert Hill. It is fair to say that none of them has really laid a glove on the Hawke Government. While I do not always agree with what Mr Sheridan says and while I do not necessarily agree with everything in his article today, I do find myself in agreement with those statements. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth addressing the question of why the Liberal-National Party coalition has failed so dismally in the area of foreign policy and in an attempt to develop an alternative policy to that which has been pursued by the Government since 1983. I think the coalition really does have a few problems and we need to focus on them. The first is, of course, the manifest differences between the Liberal Party and our friends in the National Party. One can start with the question of the structure of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The National Party made it very clear through its former leader, Mr Charles Blunt-defeated, of course, at the last election-that if a coalition government were elected to office one of the first actions of that government would be to ensure that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would be separated. I think that most Australians, certainly those interested in public policy making and in better administration in this country, would accept that the amalgamation of the former departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade has really been of great benefit to public policy making in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that this is a very difficult question for Senator Watson because the Liberal Party takes a different view to the National Party on this issue. He is quite right to identify it. The first problem that the Liberals face is the difficulties they have with their coalition partners, the Nationals. Of course, the other real fundamental problem that the coalition has is the adherence to the conservative dogmas of the past which, of course, led to the sorts of policies that involved Australia in Vietnam and so on. It just stands in very stark contrast to the sort of role that the Labor Government has played over the last seven years because the Labor Government has developed a self-reliant policy, a foreign policy which gives Australia a capacity to make its own decisions in its own national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, there are many differences between the policy that has been proposed by the Labor Government and the position that the Opposition has consistently taken. For example, it is this Government that took the lead in negotiating the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty; it is the Opposition that is committed to throwing it out. It is the Government that has not endorsed the strategic defence initiative, star wars; it is the Opposition which endorses the SDI. It is the Government that opposes any possibility of stationing nuclear weapons on Australian soil; it is the Opposition that wants to keep that option open. It is the Government that appointed an ambassador for disarmament and established the Peace Research Centre at the Australian National University; it is the coalition which is committed to abolishing both. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even from some remarks made this morning by Senator Alston it is still obvious that the Liberal Party not only in New South Wales but nationally fails to recognise what sole parents pensions are about and still believes that governments should not fund those sole parents who seek to maintain parenting as their primary role in life. It is a matter of great sadness that the New South Wales Liberal Party should adopt such a position officially and seek to have that view promoted nationally through its party apparatus. Given that people such as Senator Alston are in charge of that apparatus at a parliamentary level, they do not need to worry, the position of the Liberal Party on sole parents pensions has been well said by him. Basically the Liberal Party just is not in favour of them, and that is, of course, a stark and fundamental difference.

It is not a matter of there being an authority for it, because I have never referred to Senator Alston as being an authority on anything. He is, nonetheless, the source of the comment that I have made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sole parent pensions recognise that there is a limit on the time for which they are received; in fact, at present it is an average of three years. There is an obvious problem after marriage break-up for sole parents in that some children need care for a particular time after a marriage breakdown occurs. The sole parent pension recognises the fact that that must continue and at times that will mean that parenting must continue without a return to the work force. Nonetheless, the Government has been at pains in the last 12 months to make sure that some opportunity is given to those sole parents who do seek to re-enter the work force, but the sole parent pension has never been regarded by the Government as a permanent payment. I think once we recognise that there are particular needs after a marriage breakdown, then we will understand that that payment does not need to be permanent; in fact, sole parents have shown that they do not actually expect it to be so.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also endeavoured to have training opportunities available for sole parents through the jobs, education and training program, which was discussed in the Parliament yesterday. We are making sure that we are targeting those sole parents who are seeking to have some training before they re-enter the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing that the kind of transitional payment that sole parents pensions represent should be put under threat by the New South Wales Liberal Party, Senator Alston, or anyone else. But such is the world in which we live. Fortunately, the Government remains committed not just to the payment of the pension but, more importantly, to those families who rely on it for their support.</PARA>

<PARA> In this situation, Ministers for consumer affairs in their meeting in Perth in July made it clear that they required the vertical keypads to be changed, in those institutions which had them, to a more horizontal position to assure the privacy of those using those particular facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, only last week the Westpac Banking Corporation wrote to me indicating that it was, in fact, engaging in such a change of its keypads from the vertical to the horizontal position in order to enable that privacy to be assured to its clients. I think the National Australia Bank Ltd is also one of those institutions which was not offering that same degree of privacy which the consumer affairs Ministers thought was essential, and I hope that it follows Westpac in this regard in changing the keypads over a period of time.

I preface my question by concurring with the view of the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Dr Blewett, that the situation was a difficult one but that the response of the Israeli authorities was disproportionate. I ask the Minister: Firstly, why is it consistent to suspend ministerial contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) over its position on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, while maintaining ministerial contact with the Israeli Government, in view of these killings and the systematic denial of basic rights to Palestinians in the occupied territories; secondly, does the Government accept that a failure by the United Nations (UN) Security Council to act decisively on the situation in the occupied territories will greatly undermine the credibility built up by the Council in its concerted response to Iraq's invasion; thirdly, will the Government convey to the Bush Administration the need for such action, including the sending of a UN mission to the occupied territories; and, finally, will the Government resume ministerial contact with the PLO to allow differences to be addressed directly and to maintain at least a semblance of even-handedness in its Middle East policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator Powell, having had lengthy experience in the Senate, will understand that some parts of her question will have to be taken on notice. Whether the Government will send a United Nations mission, resume contacts with the PLO and so on are policy questions which will have to be considered. I will take those parts of the question on notice. It might be helpful, however, to make one or two observations. Senator Evans, in a press release yesterday I understand, deplored the deaths of Palestinian demonstrators in the incident to which Senator Powell has referred. The Australian Government has previously condemned the use of live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators and, in the incident in question, Israeli authorities fired on a large crowd of demonstrators causing at least 20 deaths and scores of injuries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to reports, the demonstrators had been throwing stones at Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall and subsequently attacked an Israeli police station at the end of the Temple Mount area. The demonstration was associated with rumours of an attempt by a Jewish group to lay a foundation stone for a third temple on the Mount, but Israeli authorities denied this group entry to the Temple Mount area and have said that they believe the demonstration was premeditated. Clearly there was a very difficult situation, but the use of force on such a scale by the Israeli authorities appears, on the evidence now available, to have been a disproportionate response.</PARA>
<PARA> The current situation in the Middle East-in Israel and on the Bank and elsewhere-is very tense and these sorts of situations can exacerbate such tension. It is the Government view that the Israeli authorities must recognise the need for maximum restraint as incidents such as that which took place yesterday can only increase the frustrations and antagonism of the Palestinian population. The United Nations Security Council is currently examining what action it should take in reaction to these incidents. Australia would support an appropriate response, such as a United Nations mission, to report on the situation but in the context of a United Nations consideration of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said before that there is and can be no linkage between the resolution of the Gulf crisis and the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The requirements for a resolution of the Gulf crisis are clearly stated in the United Nations Security Council resolution and are quite distinct. The Government deplores attempts by Iraq to make political capital out of the tragic deaths on the Temple Mount and to divert international attention from the issue of its aggression against Kuwait.</PARA>

The main assistance measures available to farmers are the rural adjustment scheme, known colloquially as RAS, and the rural counselling scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the August Budget, total funding for RAS was increased from $53.3m in 1989-90 to $60.7m in 1990-91. New funding for interest subsidies on loans to farmers and other measures to encourage structural adjustment was doubled to $6m, which should support more than $60m of farm debt. Funding for household support equivalent to the unemployment benefit and re-establishment grants of around $32,000 is available for farmers leaving the industry. Funding for these purposes was increased to $6m. However, the Commonwealth's commitment to this rural assistance is open-ended and claims will be met as they are incurred.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, stated earlier in the year that the Government is prepared to review the supply of funds under RAS to assist woolgrowers in financial difficulty. This commitment was reaffirmed in a recent meeting-I think it was last week-with the National Farmers Federation.</PARA>
<PARA> Later this year Mr Kerin will be meeting with State and Northern Territory rural adjustment scheme Ministers. The emerging problems in the wool and wheat industries will be a major factor in the Ministers' consideration of future priorities for RAS.</PARA>
<PARA> This financial year $960,000 is being provided to support 24 rural counsellors to provide independent financial counselling to farmers. Counsellors are located in every State except Queensland, which has it own State financial counselling service. It is understood that rural community groups in these areas not presently serviced by rural counsellors will be applying for Commonwealth support. In addition, individuals in rural communities could be eligible for a range of Commonwealth support and welfare assistance through the social security system. The CountryLink free telephone access service can provide information on eligibility requirements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. On 20 September this year, the Department of Social Security in answer to questions in Estimates C answered that the Privacy Commissioner was not consulted concerning the preparation of that draft request for tender (RFT). I asked the Minister why not and he declined to answer that part of the question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I can just add to what I said earlier-the Privacy Commissioner's role here is not to set policy but to ensure that when Government is implementing that policy, it does not infringe on privacy requirements. What we are doing is making sure that the Privacy Commissioner has an input on each and every aspect of that to which he is entitled. That is something that will not be varied. Therefore, the Privacy Commissioner was briefed on what the Government wanted to do and the kind of programs that we wanted, and asked to draw up some guidelines for their operation. He was also told at the same time that we would be providing staff for him not only to prepare those guidelines but also to monitor the effectiveness of the Government's compliance with them. That undertaking remains and nothing that Senator Bishop has just said changes it. I do not believe that in any way it could even be suggested that we have not acted properly with the Privacy Commissioner in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the provision to Senator Bishop of advice that I may get in the next two weeks from the Privacy Commissioner, obviously the guidelines will have to be made public. I will certainly do that. The Privacy Commissioner may provide advice that is for the Government and the Cabinet. If that is the case, it will not necessarily be made public. But we have a duty to make public as much of the information as we can. I will certainly be advocating within the Government that we release all this information because we cannot possibly attempt to hide behind any cloak of secrecy, and we will not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might say, in acknowledging that interjection from a Liberal senator, that it is the Liberal Government in New South Wales which has conducted the most recent study on ethanol. Neil Pickard, the New South Wales Minister for Minerals and Energy, engaged in a study which involved expensive visits to Brazil and to the east and west coasts of the United States. Despite the investigation which was conducted, the Government has not yet reported. I guess that is a bit typical of New South Wales Government efficiency these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The former Queensland Government, then in the person of the Queensland Minister for Mines, Mr Bob Katter, was a vigorous supporter of ethanol. He wanted a 10 per cent ethanol-petrol blend to be used in Queensland. This, of course, has been discontinued by the Goss Government since it took office.</PARA>
<PARA> Ethanol has been tried as a fuel in only two countries in the world-the United States and Brazil. In both cases it was a financial disaster. The Brazilian Government provided subsidies worth more than $2.7 billion a year, but the new Government of Brazil is abandoning that program. It is dismantling the subsidies and introducing free market policies so that whatever fuel sources are produced have to compete with others on the international market. We will see that program in Brazil disappear.</PARA>
<PARA> A 10 per cent ethanol-petrol blend in Australia, as advocated by Bob Katter, for example, has two drawbacks: the economic ones and the environmental ones. If the 10 per cent blend were to be an excise free blend, it would cost Australians $435m a year in revenue forgone. Subsidies for industry to keep the price below current bowser petroleum prices would amount to another $400m a year.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Roy Deicke, the Managing Director of the Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd, told the annual general meeting of his company last year that sugar based ethanol could cost about a dollar a litre. Bearing that in mind in relation to the other area of concern I mentioned before-the environmental costs, which are prohibitive -disposal of liquid wastes from ethanol distillation would be a major problem. Mr Deicke, in his speech to the annual general meeting of the Bundaberg Sugar Co., said that in Brazil the waste disposal problem had turned rivers black, caused by the effluent coming from ethanol plants. A 10 per cent blend equals a doubling of land for cane farming in Australia to produce an efficient product. This would also increase pressure on marginal lands and on the environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the Minister aware of comments by the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Howard, in one of his numerous statements in support of the now discredited Bjelke-Petersen regime, in which he is supportive of the voluntary employment agreements (VEAs) which operated under the former Queensland National Party Government? Does the Minister have any information to show whether Mr Howard's statement is correct and that the voluntary employment contracts introduced by the National Party Government played an important role in the success of Power Brewing Co. Ltd?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2800" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that the first problem I have with so-called voluntary employment agreements is their title. It is Joh-speak or indeed Orwellian logic to say that what is proposed is in fact voluntary because what the word `voluntary' conjures up is an image of two equal and equally strong parties negotiating from an equal point of view and consenting freely to the outcome. That can hardly be characteristic of a situation in which management sits there with the full panoply of managerial prerogative, all of the resources of the company behind it, access to industry association information, and with the power to hire and fire, talking to ordinary workers in a one-on-one situation. In that situation in the worker's mind there must always be a question: `What happens if I dissent, and is my job in question if I do?', without an ordinary worker's access to the same information base in order to answer propositions being put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that the term `voluntary' is a fair characterisation of the sort of bargaining that is envisaged by this type of agreement. I think the first point is to beware of the language, which tries to encourage us to see something that is inherently exploitative as being voluntary in nature.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Power Brewing example, I must say that Mr Howard is one of a number of conservative commentators who frequently say that Power Brewing had a voluntary employment agreement, Power Brewing got 15 per cent of the beer market in Queensland, ergo, voluntary employment agreements are the basis of that success. Given Power Brewing's penetration of the Queensland beer market, there may be some advantage in the exploitative type of relationship which it had through a voluntary employment agreement. But that type of mindless and illogical approach ignores the fact that of course the product was promoted by Wally Lewis in a very slick advertising campaign; it ignores the marketing fact; it ignores the taste of the product compared to others; it ignores the fact that Queenslanders objected to Alan Bond having his name on the bottom of a XXXX can and tended to move to another locally produced product; and it ignores the fact that in a new company, with new plant and equipment and better and newer technology, better production results are likely to be achieved; and it ignores the fact that in setting up the Power Brewing plant the Queensland National Party Government supplied cheap land at the Yatala industrial estate south of Brisbane for the purposes of setting it up. It ignores all those factors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Industrial Relations Commission on 25 September approved an interim enterprise award covering the operation of Power Brewing to replace the former VEA. The interim enterprise award will operate for about four weeks, until 2 November. The Commission is arbitrating on what will be the conditions to apply in the workplace between then.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Queensland Industrial Relations Act, as it has now been amended, voluntary employment agreements expired on 30 September, and the secretive voluntary employment agreements that were introduced by the Queensland National Party Government in 1987, which provided that agreements between employers and employees were not open to the Commission's inspection or scrutiny, or they were not open to a public interest test and were not publicly accessible will now be replaced by a situation in Queensland paralleling section 115 of the Federal Act, where agreements can be reached between workers in an enterprise and the enterprise management but those agreements must be registered in the Commission and thus be open to inspection by other parties and scrutiny by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> My understanding, in conclusion, is that, given the new industrial freedom that workers at the Power Brewing company have, there has already been, by negotiation on their behalf by the union, a reduction in the number of hours worked, an increase in sick leave entitlements and improvements in shift penalty arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> That being the case, given that these standards are open to scrutiny, I expect that we can look forward to an improvement in productivity knowing that the workers in that enterprise at least have a fair deal industrially.</PARA>

We will do exactly what we said we would do: we will get a matching of our own information with tax file numbers which will be supplied to us by the Taxation Office. By this method, we will detect quite a degree of fraud that previously we were unable to detect. At the end of the day, that will return some hundreds of millions of dollars to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of this will be done by a process directed by a steering committee on which the Privacy Commissioner sits, so he will be involved in every step of the process. This means, of course, that if he sought to modify his guidelines at any point during that process because he felt that something new and different was occurring he would be able to do so, and we would abide by the guidelines that he had set. It is important to stress those guidelines because, without the Privacy Commissioner overseeing this operation, obviously there would be the potential, certainly not for this government but for future governments, to do the wrong thing. That simply will not happen.</PARA>

<PARA> In fact, in a letter which recently arrived in my office from Mr Max Bray, the Chief General Manager, Development Ventures, National Australia Bank, he indicates that the National Australia Bank will modify its keypads and recline them at a 45 degree angle, which, as I indicated to the Senate, will help ensure the greater privacy of those persons using this particular facility.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Australia Bank proposes to modify the ATMs in the eastern States first-given the larger concentrations of consumers, no doubt-and hopes to complete this by March 1991. The remaining 200 machines will be modified over the following 12 months. That is very good news, indeed, and I believe that customers of the National Australia Bank, as of the Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd, will be well pleased with these modifications.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I claim to have been misrepresented by Senator Richardson on two occasions. The first occasion was when he said, in the course of a diatribe about the notice of motion which I gave this morning, that I, in particular, and the Opposition, in general, were just simply not in favour of sole parents. That is a preposterous and grotesque fabrication and I want to take the opportunity to clarify what Senator Richardson is clearly unwilling or unable to understand. He well knows that the number of sole parents has increased quite significantly in recent years-there are now something like 250,000 of them-and the cost to the taxpayer is in excess of $2 1/2 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We, as an Opposition, and I, personally, have the greatest degree of sympathy for those sole parents and we well understand the problems they are confronted with, particularly in the present economic climate. But we also take the view-quite contrary to what Senator Richardson has tried to suggest-that it is often in their best interests, after they have been at home with their children in the formative years, for them to be more directly exposed to the labour market than they are at the present time. That is why we have advocated that the jobs, education and training (JET) scheme ought to be extended. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson again attempted to pour scorn on my suggestion this morning that somehow the JET scheme should be compulsory, and suggested that we were opposed to the operation of the JET scheme. The fact is that less than 5 per cent of sole parents are currently within the JET scheme and, of those, less than half are classified as labour market disadvantaged. To pretend, as he did, that the Government is interested in targeting those sole parents who need special assistance is quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to clarify is that he referred to a television so-called debate several months ago, and repeated the absurd suggestion that when it comes to taking money off low income earners and sole parents the Opposition, in general, and I, in particular, are real tough but when it comes to tax avoidance, as he said, we would crawl across the Simpson Desert. Once again, he shows a profound misunderstanding of the distinction between tax avoiders and tax evaders. </PARA>
<PARA> But, putting that to one side, there is nothing that I have said in this capacity or in any other that could be possibly construed as giving solace to those who might seek to bend the corporate or tax rules. Most importantly, for present purposes, I have never in any shape or form suggested that we are in favour of taking money from low income earners or sole parents. The facts of the matter are that we are very interested in helping sole parents and low income earners in general by introducing them to not only a range of financial support mechanisms but also real labour market activity wherever possible.

In answer to a question without notice on 19 September, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) claimed, in the same way as he did today to Senator Boswell, that I would not want to go and see the operation of the Department of Social Security computer centre at Deakin. I must say that the Minister made it possible for us to go and visit the Deakin centre by setting a date. It happened to be a time which would have coincided with the sitting of Estimates Committee C next Friday and I felt it was more important that I attend that meeting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The future of Australian farming has never looked worse in my lifetime than it does now. The economy of Australia is shot to pieces as a result of badly flawed economic dogma and the years ahead will place enormous strains on rural and regional Australia. With an anti-rural bias, Australia has seen huge rises in costs, great losses in rural population and falling rural exports. The future is so bleak that Australia needs to be told exactly what the real state of affairs is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For nearly all of the last 200 years the country has been renowned for its prowess in the production of both food and fibre. In a country where conditions of soils and climates have been very hard, the achievements in research and production have made Australian primary producers stand out as amongst the greatest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and many of the universities have been world leaders in breeding, management, pest and disease control and many other things. Agriculturally, Australia has a tremendous record. As a result of these and their own efforts and despite falling numbers, Australia's farmers more than doubled the gross value of farm production between 1982-83 and 1989-90, albeit at considerable cost. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same period farm indebtedness also doubled, so that by the end of 1989-90 the debt owed to financial institutions was almost $11 billion, some two to 2 1/2 times the level of the farm income in that year. In 1982 Australia last faced the horrors of extensive drought and, to make matters even worse, it was coupled with a major international economic downturn. Between those two, farm incomes in 1982-83 fell by a massive 80 per cent and many thousands of farmers went to the wall. The numbers are still diminishing-the number of rural establishments has fallen from 175,000 in 1982-83 to an estimated 150,000 today-and right now they are facing the sharpest reduction in my lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA> The one derisively referred to at that time as the world's greatest Treasurer (WGT), having done nothing to change either the drought or the recession, then proceeded with his long term plan of introducing his own brand of national economics. As his prime ministerial prospects continue to follow his popularity poll ratings, so unfortunately does this great country's reputation, stability and economic reliability. </PARA>
<PARA> This monetary policy paranoia is more than that. It is an obsession which has resulted in Australia having hit skid row on virtually every reasonably accepted economic scale of comparison available to us. We just did not become one of the world's top 10 in the overseas debt category; we had to work on it. It took Australia 80 years to accumulate overseas debt of $15 billion and just 10 more years to increase that tenfold to over $150 billion, on which the annual interest bill alone is of the order of $13 billion. This is the equivalent of almost 90 per cent of the value of the rural export trade of Australia last year. It was not the banks, it was not the farmers, it was not the Opposition: it was the direct result of the policies of the WGT himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Who pumped up the interest rates to 18, 19 and 20 per cent and kept on guaranteeing and assuring a continuation of high interest rates? Again, it was not the banks, it was not the farmers, it was not the Opposition, but the policies of the WGT himself. Who then accepted, aided and abetted a 16 per cent increase in the United States dollar value of the Australian dollar between 1986-87 and 1989-90, the dual effect of which was to depress the returns on our rural exports while increasing the interest bill on our overseas debt? It was the same man and the same Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural exports as a proportion of total exports of merchandise have declined from 36 per cent in 1982-83 to 32 per cent in 1989-90, largely because of the policy which has kept the value of the Australian dollar so artificially high. What did the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or the Government then do to unravel the situation that they had built? Did they say, 'These conditions will be disastrous for Australia's entire productive sector and we must do something about it.'? No, not a bit of it. Did they say, 'These conditions will bankrupt thousands of people and thousands of businesses because they will make them uncompetitive in the real world of international economics.'? Did the Treasurer or the Government say, 'Our producers will be less able to compete.'? Did they say that foreign interests will have a field day every day if we go on with these policies? Not at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, we have come to live with all the new platitudes, such as, 'We are right on course'; 'We've got a lovely set of numbers'; 'We're right in the middle of the expectations'; 'The economy is slowing at about the right rate'; 'We are still heading for a soft landing'; and various other nonsense, while all the time Australians generally, but the productive sector particularly, were going down and down and down. The obsession then went to transferring a Federal deficit to become State cuts. These changes did not reduce taxes and costs; instead, they just made them the province of States and local government, resulting in the loss of services and increased costs all round. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State, for instance, as a result of the last round the productive rural, forestry and mining sectors have had huge rises in land tax, municipal rates and payroll tax; the primary producers diesel fuel concession was cut; there were cuts in rural and regional health and education; cuts in technical and further education college courses; cuts in rural research and advisory services; removal of rural education living away from home allowance; increase in electricity charges; and cuts in road maintenance and so on. The result may well be a warm inner glow to the Treasurer, but certainly and positively it creates a severe reduction in the competitive capacity of all the industries involved and their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In farming our productivity is magnificent. Our costs of production are the equal of any in the world for efficiency, and it is not those costs that affect our profitability. Again, it is the social costs. Consider the benefits that apply within Australia and the particular effects they have on the major commodities that Australia expects to sell profitably on world markets. With our productivity and our costs-such as four weeks annual holidays, 14 or 15 public holidays a year, paternity leave, et cetera-how do we really expect to compete with trading partners such as East Asia, North America, Europe and so on?</PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not I agree with all those comforts is of no consequence. What does matter is that this country simply cannot afford the standard of living that we have set ourselves. What I stress therefore is that the Government must take into account the capacity to pay when it is considering more of these cost increases and cost shifts that it has in mind. There is no benefit for employees who are awarded increased wages and conditions if those increases mean that they then have no job and we lose an industry as a result.</PARA>
<PARA> How would the Government members opposite like to be farm workers right now? I am told that, in spite of disastrous prices for wool and wheat, farm workers over the last 12 months have been granted wage increases of $60 a week-an amount that now obviously cannot be met, at the cost of thousands of jobs. We only need to follow that through with the wool and wheat industries nationwide and various other industries on a regional basis-such as rice growing in the Riverina and potato growing in Tasmania-to see what the situation is like. Surely farming has its ups and downs, and just as surely farmers must be encouraged to save for bad weather and bad economic times; but bad government is very hard to plan for. So, in the opinion of the Government, the best way to level out those vagaries is to start off by destroying the income equalisation deposit scheme, the scheme put together especially to encourage self-help. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is tax. The complexity of the tax system is still getting worse. The Bill before us this week gave us another 236 pages of legislation, which took 416 pages of explanation to tell even skilled practitioners how to interpret it. Is it any wonder that Australian taxpayers are now spending $3.8 billion or 11 per cent of their personal tax just to submit their taxation returns? In other words, preparing returns is just as much a tax as the tax itself. The farmers are the prime victims of this gross incompetence, when clearly the efforts should be going into producing a new, simplified and equitable taxation scheme that can as far as possible be operated by any reasonably intelligent taxpayer himself without huge supplementary fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come back to interest rates. We are not just playing some gigantic game of monopoly; it is all very much for real. Interest rates are still hovering in the region of 17 to 20 per cent and they are absolutely horrendous and a disaster for the productive sector. Has the Government any idea of the chaos created by its high interest rates policy on business and farming interests? Has it ever asked or properly inquired? Just how out of touch can it be? Does it know or care about the uncertainty that this and other costs create for those in the productive sector, which we all depend on?</PARA>
<PARA> The foreign interests love us. They flood us with imports. They defend themselves against our exports and they skim off the highest interest that they could ever have hoped for. Has this Government ever considered the effects of high interest, even in areas such as property rentals and the way in which that flows on to add cost to our rural communities? In turn, high interest rates have also produced enormous changes in investment patterns, out of equities and into high marginal operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Farming, however, is a long term operation. It takes years and years to get a livestock breeding operation off the ground. It takes years and years to get fruit trees or vines to come into bearing. It takes years and years of trials to establish new crops and new varieties of vegetables or pastures. But has the Government recognised that? What steps have been taken to offer some security for those looking to get away from the pursuits that could be seen to be getting risky with oversupply or world market changes or other matters?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at forestry. I wonder what is the Australian Labor Party's policy on forestry. What security can be demonstrated to people looking to the next 50 years or so? Who can tell me whether we are discussing now sustainable development for various forest classes or whether we may be talking about ecologically sustainable development-and, in fact, the difference between the two? What I can tell honourable senators is that the extra word makes all the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania, as a result of the Labor Party's policies and deals, we are still burning millions of tonnes of first class chip wood in what amounts to criminal waste when every stick of that should be going into pulp and paper. We go on fighting so that in the main the land we are talking about can be replanted with trees, hopefully for ultimate conversion to sawlogs. But in the meantime we are burning it. What sort of economics is that? Policies such as this have an absolutely devastating effect on rural Australia and on the economy generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to other policies and actions where the Labor Government is so slack that no decisions are being made in so many areas. I have been asking questions for months on certain aspects of quarantine decisions, and I pick them up again here. I refer to the importation of pork from Canada. What will the Government do if there is an outbreak of disease? What is the policy? All I am told is, `Wait and see when it happens'. Then there is the problem of fireblight in apples. What will the Government do if there is an outbreak in Australia as a result of injudicious import? We will wait to see what happens. What about honey infection from chalkbrood, and what about the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of ballast water discharged in Australian waters, and what about the serious effects of the dinoflagelettes on our inshore shellfish operators? What is the Government's policy, and is that policy designed to protect the Australian producer, or is the main consideration going to the various overseas interests?</PARA>
<PARA> I also raise the issue of imported foodstuffs labelling. While I have no objection to people buying foreign produce, if that is their wish, I believe there should be a policy that imported goods should be much more clearly marked to let those who prefer to buy Australian be sure they do so. Let us have a policy on that, too. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the farmers' problems. We have tens of thousands of farmers who are at least as efficient as any in the world. Year after year farmers have been extending their holdings, running more stock and growing more crops, just to survive. Their returns per person employed or per hectare, or whatever, continue to astound agriculturalists around the world. But it has inevitably been done to survive and this survival has been bought on borrowed funds. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the family farmer. We believe it is a more preferable system to huge corporate farms. But the family that has borrowed is now the family in dire trouble. Many of those have had generations of association with the industry, many on the same properties for in excess of 100 years. Most regrettably, that will not save them now. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether amongst the weekend reading of the Treasurer and in amongst the antique dealers guides, et cetera, he gets around to reading Land, the Weekly Times or Stock and Land and reads the pages and pages of heartbreak and disaster that go with all those thousands of rural properties now on the market Australia-wide. As a result of this Government's policies, Australia has simply priced itself out of world markets. Other countries just cannot be expected to pay for the extravagances and economic mismanagement that we have taken on. </PARA>
<PARA> How does this Government support our farmers, and how do other countries support their farmers? How does it compare with how the Government looks after, say, our car industry? Why is it that the Government believes that our farmers, unlike those anywhere else in the world, can survive as price takers in a totally corrupted international market? I am not asking for subsidies nor suggesting that subsidies would solve Australia's rural problems, but I do ask why it is that our Treasurer believes that he can continue to take actions and stubbornly stick with failed policies that are clearly so damaging to Australia's biggest and most traditional international earner?</PARA>
<PARA> I give honourable senators one example. In my area there is the question of imported frozen potatoes from Canada. We all know that a high volume, low price product can only be moved long distances around the world if there is a price fiddle. So right in the middle of this, the Government is now talking about a further cut of another 10 per cent off the tariff that comes with those at the expense of what is Tasmania's best and biggest industry. Surely the Government is not anxious to have farmer demonstrations, but can you wonder that we have reached that stage. What may be lovely numbers to Mr Keating are the sound of disaster in rural Australia. We have had talk of the Argentinean Road and of a banana republic, but what all Australians want to know is: how close are we?</PARA>
<PARA> We must ask the Minister to make a statement in the Parliament of the absolute truth of Australia's financial position and, in particular, of the real state of the rural economy. What we have had has not been good enough. The people deserve to know and must know. We are all sick of these flowery, sugar-coated misrepresentations. For years we have been soft-soaped with a terrible failed accord. Never since day one has it done anything for the man on the land to control costs or increase productivity. It may well have softened problems between the Government and some of its more difficult masters, but it has done nothing for the farmers except for them to cop the flow-on, cost them more, put them further at odds with their international competitors and, as it stands now, hasten their entry into financial destruction. So much for the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, for instance, takes all the information and gives a variety of forecasts. The Australian Bureau of Statistics gets the figures and provides trends and records. How is it that so suddenly and so drastically we fell into a heap with these two largest rural industries without any warning bells by the Government or others before the event?</PARA>
<PARA> In this debate Senator Boswell and Senator Panizza, both with wide experience of non-metropolitan Australia, will develop special issues. There are so many questions I must place at the feet of the Government. Rural Australia wants the answers. It wants them from the Government, and it wants them now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When notice of this matter of public importance first came around I read it and thought, `What a silly statement'-`The devastating impact of the Government's economic policy on rural Australia'. There are two major problems in Australian agriculture now. The first is the price of wheat. That is caused by a very large harvest in the Northern Hemisphere and by the propensity of the European Community and the United States to subsidise exports. That has absolutely nothing to do with the economic policies of the Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second major problem is wool. It is not a question of price per se, but the fact that at the minimum price which has been set, only about one-third is being sold and 25 per cent of the gross proceeds are currently being taken or about to be taken in the levy to finance the stockpile or to partially finance it. Who is responsible for that? Effectively, the price of wool has fallen a great deal. It is being propped up by withholding from the market somewhat more than 50 per cent of Australia's current production. In other words, the market price is not being met. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has that happened? There are two reasons. The principal one is that on the demand side the major communist economies in the world-Russia and China-have gone broke and are not buying any more wool. Is that going to be attributed to the economic policies of the Australian Government?</PARA>
<PARA> The second reason that the wool industry is in real trouble is the ill-advised decisions made by the industry elders-there is no pun intended there-in 1987 and 1988 when there was a sharp upward movement in the market price of wool, way above the long term trend, and these clowns thought it would be a good idea to follow it up with the reserve price. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators want to hand out blame for the problems of the wool industry, they should start handing it out to people like Hugh Beggs, Chip Sawers, and that near-unique bunch of neanderthals in the New South Wales Farmers Federation, because they are the people who made the decision to jack that up and the people who steadfastly resisted the attempts by the Government-and, I acknowledge, with the full support of the Liberal Party component of the Opposition-to bring the wool market back to something approaching reality and lower the reserve price. They are the people who have done more than anybody in Australia to create the present problems in the wool industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. I mentioned the near-unique bunch of neanderthals in the New South Wales Farmers Federation. Why I say they are near-unique is because they have something nearly as bad as themselves or nearly as antediluvian as themselves in Queensland. I suspect it is no coincidence that Queensland and New South Wales are the only two States where the Country Party-cum-National Alliance-cum National Party remains a significant political force. Farmer organisations in the main throughout the rest of the country are much more attuned to reality than they are in New South Wales and Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If anybody wants to level some partially justified criticism at the Government, or John Kerin in particular, they might criticise him with some justification for allowing the floor price for wool to be jacked up to 870c in 1988, at the staunch recommendation, of course, of the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation-Beggs, Sawers, the New South Wales Farmers Federation and Co. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly with the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear that that should have been stopped, but it would have been extremely difficult at that time when the market price was well above the 870c floor price level and the Corporation was sitting on cash reserves of more than $1.5 billion. It would have been extremely difficult for any Minister or any government to say at that stage, `The Government knows better than the people who are supposed to be representing the industry, and we will not let you jack it up to 870c'. As I said, with the wisdom of hindsight it clearly would have been a better option, but I doubt whether there would have been much support from the Opposition had Mr Kerin or the Government so intervened at that time. Given that the conventional wisdom, particularly of the New South Wales Farmers Federation, is that people in the industry are the people who really know what is going on, they are certainly in no position to criticise John Kerin for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerning Senator Archer's comments, I would have had a little more sympathy in regard to interest rate levels and the exchange rate-and I will return to that later-had he not sat silent and inert like a stuffed bullfrog throughout the nearly 7 1/2 years of the Fraser Government, when that Government deliberately maintained in a regulated financial system an overvalued Australian dollar in an attempt to control inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> We then heard him complain about wrecking income equalisation deposits (IEDs). Income equalisation deposits are a complex question. They are a taxation measure and I will not try to explain them fully. But I will tell the Senate, and anybody else who wants to listen, that income equalisation deposits were supposed to be a device which, when utilised, would equalise the taxable income of Australian farmers by paying deposits in in years of high income and withdrawing money in years of low income. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of rorts introduced by the Fraser Government in 1977-at the instigation, needless to say, of the Countrycum-National Party-the way to minimise tax liability over the long term was to pay money into income equalisation deposits in years of low income and take it out in years of high income. I am not going to try to explain all the arithmetic reasons why that was so, but it was because of a rort introduced at that time which turned IEDs into a device not to stabilise after-tax income but actually to provide an incentive to destabilise after-tax income. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of sordid little rort which the Government of which Senator Archer was a back bench member for 7 1/2 years perpetrated and about which he said nothing. I was waiting, of course, for Senator Archer to revert to type, that is, to display yet again his troglodytic protectionism, and I was not disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA> History never exactly repeats itself, but there is a precedent for the current wool and wheat industry problems and for problems to be hitting both of those major agricultural industries at the same time, and that happened in 1970. The problem in 1970 was different in this respect: because there was a free market at that stage it was the price of wool which was the problem. Eventually, because of that, a floor was put under at a level of 30c. Thirty cents a pound, even after allowing for a fair bit of inflation, is a great deal less, obviously, than 870c a kilo, even though the latter is clean. </PARA>
<PARA> With the wheat industry it was not a question of the price of wheat per se, because at that time a coalition government-again at the instigation of the Country-cum National Party-had a guaranteed price for a limited amount of wheat based on some nonsensical concept which used to be called the cost of production. The Government was liable to make up the difference between the market realisation and the guaranteed price based on this nonsensical thing which used to be called the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to demonstrate how nonsensical that was, let me say that the wheat industry had complained throughout the 1960s that wheat growers were producing wheat for less than the cost of production. Then when the Tory Government introduced wheat quotas in 1969, growers fought tooth and nail for the right to produce wheat-that is, to get a quota-to sell at what they had been asserting for a decade was below the cost of production. It might be hard for the Country Party to work out why that does not make sense, but I can assure it that it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> At that stage, of course, it was not the price of wheat per se which was the problem, it was the existence of wheat quotas. There has been a precedent. It is most unfortunate in 1990, as it was most unfortunate in 1970, that the two major agricultural industries have a world market induced slump in prices or in demand at the same time. It was unfortunate then; it is unfortunate now. </PARA>
<PARA> The grain of truth-microscopic though it is-in the argument that has been put up by Senator Archer is that, yes, it is true that as a demand management tool the Government has relied for about two years on tight monetary policy and, consequentially, high interest rates. However, that is not an unambiguous negative for agriculture. Not all farmers owe money. Some farmers have quite substantial cash balances. They have been the beneficiaries of high interest rates, not the victims, but my expectation is that there will be more farmers owing money than holding cash balances. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the secondary consideration that high interest rates are believed-and, other things being equal, I believe it-to have maintained an Australian dollar exchange rate higher than it would otherwise have been. That is conceded. It is hard to quantify but in principle I do not think anybody could argue against it. But it is not that simple, as we have seen recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Official interest rates have fallen by nearly 4 per cent over the last six months or so. The Australian dollar has actually gone up. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and I think Senator Button yesterday, all had a go at talking it down. Even that did not work. Interest rates came down. We had the three most senior people in the Government publicly saying that the dollar was overvalued and, after a little bit of a blip, even that did not bring it down. Why is this?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that markets in the long term make rational judgments. But, in the short term, the cowboys of the forex market are no more guided by reason and are just as likely to be guided by what Cain has called `animal spirits' and what others might call `speculative feedback' than the cowboys of the stock exchange who thought that a licence for a television station in Sydney and Melbourne was worth $1 billion, though some pedants point out that it was not actually $1 billion; it was $800m for the two Channel 9s plus a promissory note for $200m that was worth nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time markets have been irrational in the short term. That is what is now going on in the foreign exchange market, just as the market was irrational in 1986 when the Australian dollar fell to US57.2c, and would undoubtedly have fallen further had the Reserve Bank of Australia not intervened pretty heavily. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a microscopic kernel of truth in the complaints that the Opposition has made and the degree to which Government economic policy has contributed, very much at the margin, to the problems that plague a couple of agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Some farmers are facing insolvency. I will set the background to that. As a normal part of the operation of a capitalist-I do not use that term in a pejorative sense-or a market economy, some firms will be facing insolvency, becoming bankrupt and being wound up. In a healthy market economy businesses are always being wound up, frequently because the proprietors have become insolvent, if not bankrupt. In agriculture, because the prices for agricultural products are cyclical, as are seasons variable, this tends to be bunched. At particular times there is a larger shake-out than there is likely to be in other Australian industries, be they retail, trade, manufacturing or whatever. But always some farmers will get out of agriculture because they have not succeeded financially in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases individual farmers are insolvent because they have bought overpriced land, aggravated, it is true, at the margin, by an increase in interest rates. But the fundamental mistake was to purchase overpriced land. Anybody who continues borrowing money to buy overpriced assets, be it land or television licences, and be that person John Elliott, Alan Bond or an ordinary Australian wheat farmer, will become insolvent. That is an arithmetic truism. Some of the farmers who have in the past been insolvent, have gone out of the industry and are currently insolvent fall into that category. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the most recent evidence presented to me, there is still an alarming propensity for wheat and sheep farmers in particular to overinvest in plant and equipment, to have per unit of production or unit of land cropped a plant investment two and three times higher than those of other farmers operating the same areas who still manage to achieve the same sorts of results. That is bad management. There are quite a few of those. Their financial position, as with everybody else, of course, is aggravated by bad management. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another group-a very much smaller one, but it is worth mentioning because of the innate absurdity of what was done. Just over two years ago-two years and four months ago-there were farmers in Western Australia who were paying more than $100 for merino wethers. Even if wool prices had been maintained at the then extraordinarily high levels, there is no way that those farmers would have got their money back. I would not mind taking a punt that they had borrowed the money to do it from Elders Pastoral or some other stock firm, and were encouraged by Elders Pastoral or some other stock firm to borrow the money to pay those ridiculously high prices. It is very sad for the individuals concerned. To some extent, they are victims of circumstance; to some extent, they must face the consequences of previous unsound management decisions which they themselves have made. </PARA>
<PARA> What would the Opposition have the Government do-lower interest rates? I think that was implicit in what Senator Archer said. Interest rates have come down by 4 per cent; the exchange rate has gone up. The wheat industry could turn around in a very short period. One bad harvest in the northern hemisphere and the outlook for wheat will be changed entirely, something which financial institutions ought to bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> It is much more difficult to see the wool industry getting out of its fundamental problems for a very long time- problems, I emphasise again, due to a substantial degree to the appalling leadership that the wool industry received from the people who were supposed to represent it. If one wants to criticise the Government, one could add a bit on to that and say that the Government should not have let these people do it in 1987 and 1988. But I bet there would not have been too much support on the Opposition side of the Senate or on the comparable side of the House of Representatives if John Kerin had done that in 1987 or, more particularly, in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Businesses go broke. What does the Opposition want-a guarantee against bankruptcy, such as that which the United States Congress or the United States Federal Government gave to savings and loans societies?</PARA>
<PARA> In a way, I am sad that I am speaking first. It would have been much more fun to speak after Senator Boswell and Senator Spindler, but I have already made a few comments about the National Party. I have little doubt that another bottle of snake oil will be produced by the Australian Democrats. It is worth reminding farmers and other politicians that the Democrats' policy for agriculture includes a proposal to impose a tax on agricultural chemicals and then use the proceeds to subsidise organic farming. If one wants a one-shot formula to destroy the economic viability of Australian agriculture, one could not devise anything more certain than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating the devastating impact of the Government's economic policy on rural Australia. It may be as well to start with the extent of that devastating impact. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predicts that net farm cash income is expected to fall by 32 per cent in 1990-91 to $4.6 billion after remaining largely unchanged in the previous year. I have a figure from Victoria. In May we had an unemployment rate in western Victoria almost 50 per cent higher than that of Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to Western Australia. I quote from the West Australian of 9 October 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>The rural crisis will cost WA's economy $1.6 billion. Preliminary estimates show the gross value of rural production could fall as much as $640m in 1991 in WA. With the flow-on in losses in rural goods and services the cost is approximately $1.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that in a couple of days the Western Australian State Government plans to announce a special task force to combat the rural crisis. There is an estimate that, even so, some 5,000 people could leave Western Australian country towns by Christmas unless virtually a miracle happens. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government obviously will point to the worldwide drop in commodity prices, as Senator Walsh has done. We should perhaps get that out of the way first. The Bureau again, which is a professionally independent research organisation that is attached to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, in its latest edition of its excellent agricultural and resources quarterly, says that the rural commodities price index is forecast to fall by 19 per cent during 1991. Last year it fell by only 3 per cent. Falls are expected in the international prices for wool, wheat by some 40 per cent, dairy products and sugar. Rice and sheep meat are also predicted to have tough times ahead, and even the beef industry is expecting an easing in export volumes mainly because of the uncertainty surrounding the Japanese market. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to some of the other reasons, apart from the drop in commodity prices. I, and the Australian Democrats, believe that a large part of the crisis now facing the rural sector can be put at the feet of the Government and its high interest rate policy. The policy is intended to bring down our foreign debt but, as such, it is a blunt instrument. It is inequitable in that it falls only on those people who have borrowed money for whatever reason. It is a silly policy economically because it falls on people who borrow funds for productive purposes, and farmers belong to that category. They have taken loans for new machinery, land and improvements, very often encouraged by banks which, in the last two or three years following deregulation, had funds awash and wanted to get rid of them. Farmers in other countries, against which we are competing, are paying half or at the most two-thirds of the interest rates that our farmers are paying. </PARA>
<PARA> Very often inflation has been touted as the main reason for the problems of our primary products on overseas markets. No less a person than Dr Gus Hooke of the National Farmers Federation has stated that this is not the prime reason, that interest rates and exchange rates must come down. In the latest summary which has been provided to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) only a week or so ago, he suggests that we need a drop of 3 per cent in the interest rate and a decline of 9 per cent in the exchange rate if we manage to increase domestic expenditure by $408 billion, and that can be achieved only by increasing economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not only created this problem of high interest rates in its single-minded attempt to bring down our foreign debt, it has also deregulated primary industries. Since July 1987 the subsidies for dairy products have been substantially reduced. By January 1992 all these levies will have been eliminated, thereby significantly reducing farmers' income in that particular sector. I might say in passing that perhaps Senator Walsh should note that, while wool and wheat are certainly our main primary exports, farmers are engaged in the dairy industry, in orchards and in other primary production. Potatoes were mentioned by Senator Archer. We need to look at the primary sector as a whole. The butter levy has been eliminated and the sugar embargo has been lifted and replaced with a 35 per cent tariff, but this tariff will be down to 15 per cent by 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariffs on dried fruits and citrus products have also been reduced greatly. The abolition of the income equalisation deposit scheme has been mentioned before. So the Government is not taking any steps to assist farmers, people living in country areas. We have taken deregulation to the country. Our exchange rate has obviously been propped up by our interest rate. It is now well above US80c when it should be around 65c to 70c to enable us to be competitive on overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to the Democrat member, Mike Elliott, in the South Australian Parliament, who provided me with some information on the comparison of hourly labour costs converted into Australian dollar values and produced by the South Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association. I think this will give us some indication of the competitive pressures that Australian primary producers are facing overseas. In Australia, one hour of a worker in, say, a cannery costs $11.18; in South Africa it is $1.34; in Greece it is $4.73; in Spain it is $6.29; in Chile it is $0.94 and in Argentina it is $1.24. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a figure for the Philippines, but I am sure that it would be close to the figure for Chile. These are the sorts of wage rates that we are competing against. It is no wonder that canneries in Victoria have advised growers that they will not be able to take a large proportion of their fruit this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other governments are taking some action to maintain viability of their primary industries. In the European Community the measuring stick being used is the stable use of agricultural resources and a reasonable return to growers. Even processors are subsidised so that their wages can be maintained at reasonable rates, yet in trying to get some value added component into our exports we are prepared to let our growers and producers compete against the sorts of wage rates that I have just quoted. Where we do try to make some adjustment-I mentioned the canners and fruit growers and the problems that they have in areas in South Australia and Victoria-we are doing it, believe it or not, at the expense of other producers-in this case, potato producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a proposal which is now being negotiated with Canada. We are apparently prepared to reduce our protective tariffs on frozen potatoes, asparagus, cherries and strawberries in return for Canada's reducing the tariffs on pears, apricots, peaches and mixed fruits. Obviously our canneries need help, but who makes the decision that potato growers do not need help? Who actually decides that we can make that sort of trade-off? Is the decision simply based on the fact that the Government does not have a safe seat in a particular area, a seat that is at risk on the Government side?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we need measures which will assist not only primary industry but also the economy as a whole. If we are looking at the sorts of wage rates that are being paid overseas and compare the conditions that the workers work under, the workers compensation that they have not got, the conditions regarding their health that apply to them and to their families, are we really prepared as a community to allow our workers and our industries to compete against people who have been forced to work under conditions which are below acceptable standards?</PARA>
<PARA> I think that particular question goes further. The Australian Government, to its credit, is now pushing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to remove polluters' advantages. In other words, where environmental conditions are not as stringently enforced as they are in Australia, people should be exposed to tariff protection against their products in Australia. As a community, we need to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to make primary producers carry the burden for the living standards that we enjoy, or whether the community as a whole should. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not asking for general tariff protection. However, I am asking for selective tariff protection, and I am asking for effective anti-dumping provisions. It is quite clear that these are not working satisfactorily at the moment. It is quite clear that, when we have to prove not only that the product that is being imported is priced below the production costs in the country of origin but also that our industry is effectively destroyed, we are putting barriers into the paths of our own industries, which are feeling the destructive brunt of dumping before they have a chance to take any action. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other matters to be investigated in this area apart from the actual procedures-for instance, the margin to middlemen. Many products-such as citrus fruit concentrate-are imported from overseas. The profits here are being made by the middlemen who are handling them, placing them on the market at a little below the price of the local product but sufficient to knock the local product out of the market. I know that my friend Senator Boswell has been trying for some time to get an inquiry into dumping procedures off the ground. I wish him well and assure him of our support. If Senator Boswell has some difficulty with his Party-and I do not expect he will-or perhaps with the coalition, we can move and put the pressure on both the Opposition and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance today is in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The devastating impact of the Government's economic policy on rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been associated with the National Party for some 20 years and I have made many trips into rural Australia and rural Queensland. I can honestly say that this is the worst time that I have ever seen for people in rural Australia. They seem to be hit from so many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Normally, as Senator Walsh said, agriculture is cyclical-it has its ups and downs, as every other industry does-but it seems that the whole spectrum of problems has descended on agriculture in one year. We have been caught in the crossfire between the agricultural economies of the European Economic Community and the United States of America. It has dropped the price of our wheat by some $40 a tonne. Our wool industry is in a very precarious position.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to talk these industries down, and I am always frightened of these debates for that reason, but I do want to tell Senator Walsh that I believe he trivialised the debate somewhat. He picked on two industries-wheat and wool-and he said that the fall in the price of wheat was caused by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the loss of markets in Iraq and Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> He then talked about wool. There are two distinct opinions on whether the floor price of wool should have been dropped. I do not think it really helps us to go into the argument, but Mr Kerin made a unilateral decision to drop the wool price from 870c to 700c. Whether the price should have been at 870c is a different matter-it is another matter to argue with or about. When that floor price went down-when it was destabilised and talked down by Mr Kerin-as soon as the Parliament reassembled, there were questions by Senator Cook, there were questions in the House, there were doorstops and all sorts of things that promoted the loss of sales; and the Australian Wool Corporation was buying more and more until it became inevitable, according to Mr Kerin, that the price was too high. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I believe, that stampeded the market. It has caused a loss of confidence on the part of buyers. People overseas are not prepared to buy in case their competitor is able to buy cheaper than they can and make their wares uneconomical. We had a stable market destabilised. I know there are sensitivities in the House about that and I do not particularly want to open up those wounds again. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh also said that there are some beneficiaries of high interest rates. Sure, there are some wealthy farmers and there is the squattocracy, but for every wealthy person that I know in rural Queensland-the area that I know best-I know of hundreds and hundreds of battlers. These are people who have been kangaroo shooters, bought a little paddock, then bought a bigger paddock and put a fair sized property together: people who have started small and tried to build up. These are the people who are being really hurt by the Government's policies. High inflation, high interest rates-these are the sorts of people who are really copping it. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the two areas of wheat and wool, there are many other policies that this Government has inflicted on rural Australia over the last eight years that have shown absolutely no sympathy whatsoever. I do not think the Government even shows any understanding of the whole problem. For eight years we have seen a policy direction of this Government that could be described only as hostile to rural Australia. There have been some major changes; there has been a lot of nitpicking; there has been the drop in the wool price, which was a major problem; but over the years we have seen policies that have been implemented that have really hurt rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, rural Australia has devastating problems. Mr Kerin has to accept that responsibility-it is his responsibility. He should be in there fighting for rural Australia. Today, Mr Peter Taylor of the New South Wales Farmers Association, said:</PARA>
<PARA>No-one has done more to damage Australian agriculture than the present Primary Industries Minister, John Mr Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday in Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) called Mr Kerin the farmers' friend. Mr Kerin is not a bad public relations person, but it is dawning on Australian farmers that he has not delivered for them. He goes out and talks to them, making the right noises, but he has never delivered one thing for them. There is a rural committee, made up of Mr Brian Courtice, the member for Hinkler--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was a cane farmer. Mr Courtice let his farm. I do not know whether he was able to make ends meet. Maybe he wanted to get into politics. Mr Courtice is not a cane farmer. I think he was a vegetable farmer and had cane at one stage. He says that there is no crisis. The Government back bench committee claims that the farming community is over-reacting and that no crisis exists. Mr Courtice said that he does not believe or agree that rural Australia is in a crisis or about to collapse. Mr Rob Hulls has said that the Government's economic policies are working, albeit slower than a lot of people would like. If that is the sort of sympathy that rural Australia can expect from a Labor back bench rural committee, God help rural Australia. If Mr Courtice and Mr Hulls, whose electorate is largely a sheep growing one, do not realise that there is a crisis in their electorates, the most generous position I can put on it is that they know not what they do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since taking office in 1983, Labor has embarked on a high tax, high inflation, high interest rates regime that has damaged our export industries. These macro-economic policies have increased costs to producers, particularly in capital and labour. As Senator Archer mentioned in his speech, there has also been the accord. That accord was designed to produce productivity, which has not come about. Senator Walsh would agree with that. He has made statements on it. What the accord has done and all the agreements that the Government has made with the unions have done has been to effectively increase the cost of labour by 25 per cent. Including the 6 per cent for superannuation, the 1 1/2 per cent for training, the 38-hour week and a number of other things that have taken place, it has cost Australia 25 per cent more to employ a person than it did last year. The Australian rural producer cannot pass on that cost. Rural producers are price takers, not price makers. They compete against overseas countries whose input costs are much lower. However, that has never been recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced the capital gains tax which has made it almost impossible for a farmer to buy out his farm and turn it over into a larger farm. It is also a death duty because when a farm is passed down to a family no duty applies, but when a farm is sold-when it passes from that family-a capital gains tax is introduced. If a farmer has four sons who all want their share from the inheritance, the farm must be sold. Therefore, we have a de facto death duty with a capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> An assets test has been applied to people receiving pensions, Austudy and family allowance. There are thousands of properties that at the moment are worth a considerable amount of money mortgaged up to the hilt and not producing income-in fact, they have negative income. Yet those country people are not able to educate their children as well as city people are. They are not able to obtain family allowances or pensions. Funds for isolated children's education have been cut and patients' contributions to the isolated patients travel and accommodation assistance scheme have been increased. Labor has abolished agricultural machinery bounties, the liquefied petroleum gas subsidy, the superphosphate subsidy and practically all the petroleum products freight subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> The nitpicking in these areas is hurting rural Australia. It is not so much the wheat and wool industries, although they have major problems, but for over eight years we have had this running attack on primary industry. The Government has systematically increased revenue from primary industry levies up to $850m this year. Meat export industry charges increased 200 per cent in the first Labor Budget and were increased again in the latest Budget. Mr Kerin and all members of Cabinet-I include Senator Tate-knew that Australia was in a rural crisis, yet their answer in the latest Budget was to increase export subsidies. That shows no sympathy for the plight of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced full cost recovery for customs inspection, imposing a further burden on rural Australia. This does not just affect one industry; it affects all sectors of the rural community. Woolgrowers have suffered a 30 per cent decline in their income. Wheatgrowers are in terrible trouble. I will leave that to Senator Panizza as he understands the industry a lot better than I do. However, the industry has reached a 40-year low. </PARA>
<PARA> In the eight years of this Labor Government we have not seen any understanding of the needs of rural Australia. Yesterday I raised the matter of imports flooding into this nation at a rate of $2 billion a year-food that can be grown by Australian farmers. Because it is subsidised, with one stroke of a pen--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an interest in primary production because I come from a family which is still involved in that occupation. In fact, today my brother is attending the sale of his wool. Hopefully all his 17-micron wool will reach a reasonable price. I listened with great interest to the comments and arguments from both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats and not one solution did I find, except that interest rates are too high and we should drop the value of the dollar. However, Senator Walsh has very carefully pointed out that there is not an apparent nexus between the two because interest rates have fallen and the dollar has risen. So I do not know what the Opposition would expect us to do if that is its solution. It has given us no solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to deal with several issues today. One is commodity policy and one is the welfare net and the care we provide as a government to people in rural areas. Let me say that when I talk about rural areas I am not just talking about farmers. There is more to areas outside the central business districts of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong-or in other States, Brisbane and Ipswich-than sheep and cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> A bit over a third of Australia's population live outside of the metropolitan areas. We are providing policies and caring for those people who, as a group of individuals, require assistance in the same way as do people living in the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> In making some general comments about why the rural downturn is emerging and the proper way to deal with it, let me reiterate that we are subject to international forces. We do not live in a country with a brick wall around it and which can dictate what is going to happen elsewhere. That is important to remember. </PARA>
<PARA> Many things are beyond our control and are brought about by events overseas. Surely honourable senators are not unaware of the fact that last year the Chinese army invaded Tiananmen Square. Surely they are not unaware that there is conflict in the Middle East-in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. This has an important and major effect on us. We cannot live without being aware of what our neighbours are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> These fluctuations, crises and problems do cause frustration and anger in the rural community. I am sure that this frustration helps to breed resilience in country people. But it also encourages them to be active and to take action. I have no objection to that. But people should make sure that it is constructive comment and criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> In highlighting the fact that we are part of a global community, I would draw the attention of honourable senators to an article appearing on page 10 of today's Australian Financial Review and especially the comments of Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the German farm Minister, who is opposed to any cuts to the current European Community subsidies on farm produce. I think that article is well worth reading because those people are just looking after themselves and do not want 70 per cent cuts. It is important to be aware of what they are doing.</PARA>
<PARA> At present and for several years the Northern Hemisphere has had excellent grain harvests. As a result, the countries of the Northern Hemisphere do not require imports from us. A trade war is going on between the European Community and the United States of America. There are economic events in China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and eastern Europe over which we have no control. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite erroneous for the Opposition to suggest that the current difficulties of farm industries in rural areas are caused by decisions of this Government. If we were to take the easy way out and make short term responses which are politically attractive, we would simply be sowing the seeds for worse problems down the track. If people want to look at taking the easy way out by the provision of a subsidy, I draw their attention to the assistance that was given by the conservative government in 1970-71. Of course, that assistance went to those who had larger incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1970 it was suggested also that we must not upset the consumers of wool, that we must not upset the markets and that we must not demand a floor price. People would not want to abolish the floor price now. We certainly have come to accept the floor price and appreciate that it is of great value to us in terms of allowing people to plan. So, any easy solutions have very long term ramifications. We are not about having easy solutions that are going to cause harm and problems to people later on down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> The two major areas of primary produce that are having problems are wheat and wool. The outlook for wool is obviously very difficult. Like so many others, it is an industry that is very exposed to the fluctuations of international demand and overseas events. In 1989-90 sales fell to 543 million kilograms-down from 860 million kilograms in the previous year. In 1988-89 the USSR bought 18 per cent of our total sales. Last year it bought only 9 per cent and this year the amount is likely to be lower still. </PARA>
<PARA> China and eastern Europe have also largely withdrawn from the market because of their internal economic problems and the lack of foreign exchange. In effect, the USSR, China and eastern Europe, which between them make up over half of the volume of sales, have effectively withdrawn from the market. Supply, meanwhile, is still at record levels. The estimated wool stockpile at the end of 1990-91 will be around 3.1 million bales. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one today from the Opposition has addressed that problem-the problem of what are we going to do with those issues. If the Opposition is going to be an alternative government, it has to have policies and ideas as to what it would do that is different. Today we have heard nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know, the Government has been working closely with the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia. The latest measures, which were announced earlier this week, will maintain growers equity in the stockpile and will, hopefully, make growers think harder about alternatives to wool production. The plea for growers to think harder about alternatives to production and where their industry is going is not new. It is a plea that has been going on, as I say, since the 1969-70 crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that all producers have input. I have had criticism from farmers who feel that some of the leaders of their industry do not fully represent them. The average farmer does not have the time to spend in a lot of these farming political organisations. As a result, they feel somewhat under-represented. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of woolgrowers, I have to say, supported the move to reduce the floor price of wool from 870c to 700c. They had opposed the rise to 870c prior to that because they felt that that was going to encourage farmers who had not traditionally been woolgrowers to hop in and get a quick quid. They were critical of that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the Senate of an incident involving a farmer who was fairly aggressive about the dropping of the wool price. When he was asked what size holding he had, it was revealed that he had less than 200 sheep. This man, who was critical of the reduction in the floor price of wool, was also a producer of dorsets, which are not noted for fine wool production. They are certainly part of the fat lamb industry, not wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Measures will continue to be taken to raise the demand, particularly in the USSR and Chinese markets. As part of this, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will be leading a delegation to these countries in November. That is a very constructive way in which to approach this problem-it is not a critical and carping approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is being subjected to something of a campaign by disgruntled woolgrowers, some of whom are still hung up on the political opportunity offered by the situation. As the industry leaders and the Minister have done on so many occasions, I call on all woolgrowers to work and think constructively about the future of their industry and to give up their pursuit of senseless and bitter political recrimination. Recrimination does not help anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> The second commodity that we are worried about is wheat. The problems here are, again, largely outside Australia, although I would have to say that a fair section of New South Wales was under water for a significant time during the sowing season and many wheat growers were not even able to get their crops in. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a run of good seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. The trade war between the European Community and the Americans has hotted up. We know that the Americans use the export enhancement program in order to maintain their market share as they see it. Let me tell honourable senators that from discussions with agricultural leaders and bureaucrats that we had in 1986 in Kansas, we know that they see their market share as almost their God given right, that they will do anything to protect that market share and that it does not matter who gets trampled in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Australian growers next year may not find their second payment very good. That payment may not cover all of their costs and that is a problem. Again, we have the ironic and frustrating situation where we have good yields in Australia but we are still talking about an industry downturn because of external factors. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard today use of the term `rural crisis'. A couple of weeks ago I was in Moree, which is noted for its cotton industry. No-one there whom I spoke to-and these people were actively involved in the cotton industry-was prepared to say that there was a crisis in that industry. In fact, they were most keen to make sure that I did not use the word `crisis' in relation to that industry. They were looking at future options for their industry; they were wanting to progress. It is important that we do not just use the term `rural crisis' to mean the whole of the rural industries. We know that the wool and wheat industries face major problems, and I have outlined why. But let us not fall into the trap of labelling the whole of the industry as being in crisis. That is a very important point. </PARA>
<PARA> I would refer to the meeting of the Caucus committee yesterday about which Senator Boswell made some rude comments. We had some very constructive discussions with the National Farmers Federation. It stressed that in its view, as in the Government's view, the long term and medium outlook for Australian farmers remains bright. I thought that its attitude was responsible and profitable in the current situation and it was very welcome to those of us on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time left to me in this debate I wish to move on to the things that we are doing to protect rural communities, and that is very important. What would the Opposition do? We know that it would cut our budgetary spending. Opposition senators would cut spending, but they will not tell us where from. Maybe they would like to tell me how much they would cut from the rehabilitation services. Maybe they would like to do away with the 10 new locations for rehabilitation services. Maybe they would like to abolish the rural and remote respite care scheme. Maybe they would cut funding to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Maybe they would cut all the initiatives in rural women's health. Maybe they would do away with family planning services and the geriatric assessment program. </PARA>

<PARA> The economic policy of this Government has finally and drastically come to fruition in regard to rural Australia. The result, whether intended or not, is almost the total collapse of those areas-and the wider community is not far behind. The situation cannot be compared with the downturn of 1982-83 because the problem then was caused by a massive drought and nothing else. That drought encompassed all of eastern Australia. Unfortunately, it also came to Western Australia the following year. But with a drought there is always hope of recovery; one does not often experience two in a row. But there is not much hope of getting out of the present situation under this Government. Here we have the worst disaster in rural areas, if not for Australia as a whole. However, I am addressing only the rural crisis today. It is early days yet, because this is only the tip of the iceberg, but I am sure that it will rival or surpass the situation in the Depression of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out to honourable senators how drastic things were in the 1930s. I will pick up the history of my own district, the Yilgarn, from a book edited by Lyall Hunt. Let me quote from the book regarding a scene in the 1930s:</PARA>
<PARA>The reality of the Great Depression hit the Yilgarn early in 1931 when farmers saw that, despite the bumper crop, they faced ruin because of the collapse in wheat prices. The farmer who had planted the local average of 113 hectares . . . grossed only $1,026 for his crop. He owed $250 of that to the bank as interest. For many this was the last straw. They had been in deep recession since the crop failures of 1929 and could not expect further bank loans. Some despaired. Charles Greenall of South Moorine Rock, had expressed anger at the financial crisis, telling his 12 year old son, `The best thing we can do Peter, is to shoot ourselves'. Their bodies were found on their farm on 28 December 1930. </PARA>
<PARA>We have not gone very far down the track, as one can see if one picks up the Perth Sunday Times of last week. An article under the heading `Tragic Sign of the Times' reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>A roughly-fashioned sign on a gate outside a Riverina farmhouse helps to explain why a struggling young farmer shot his wife and two children and then himself this week. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a message with a cry for help on his front gate. If any honourable senator wishes to see the article, I will show it to him or her later. The message read, `Will Bob Hawke shed a tear for primary producers?'. Then he went on to mention a Mr `Paul Cheating', representing someone else, I suppose. His final message was, `God help Australia'. </PARA>

Farmers are efficient and work hard and long hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh earlier said in an exchange with Senator Patterson that he was a farm owner and not a wage slave. Well, I would like to ask Senator Walsh where he has been in the last 10 years or so. Farmers work twice or three times as long as any employee. </PARA>
<PARA> When I am on the farm I work three times longer than anyone I employ, and at the end of the year he probably finishes up with just as much. What is more, farmers cannot afford to employ any more workers. This Government's economic policy of high interest rates and unwillingness to reform, at a rate acceptable to keep Australia up with our trading partners, has been the main cause of the plight of rural Australia today. Rural production is down by at least 67 per cent over the last two years. The record interest rates charged to primary industry are nothing short of irresponsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Many farmers are still paying between 20 and 25 per cent for borrowings when banks seem to be paying a limit of 13.5 per cent. I know that. But where has that great instrument of Australian banking been in this fiasco? Senator Button put things right yesterday in respect of the manufacturing industry when he broke ranks with the rest of Cabinet and told us in no uncertain terms that interest rates are causing most of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in trying to convince us that he is on track is blaming the banks for not passing on lower interest rates. I blame the banks also, but it is not the banks totally, even though they are at fault in places. I will give a couple of quotes from an article in the Australian Financial Review as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>While Westpac, the State Bank of New South Wales, and the ANZ-all with crippling bad corporate debt portfolios-are regarded as being the most harsh by the farm sector, even the National Australia Bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Development Bank are in the same category. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that one bank manager is charging $70 for each appointment with his clients. I thought that clients could regard bank managers as public servants rather than having to pay to go and see them. Another example:</PARA>
<PARA>There are claims that NAB is now charging up to 10.5 per cent on penalty margins which start as soon as payments have been missed. </PARA>
<PARA>Banks are at fault, but they are not totally at fault, because the Government has put them in the position of acting as they are. If Mr Keating is right that it is the banks' fault, why has he not used the instrument of the Commonwealth Bank to lead the way? But the Commonwealth Bank is doing nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The high interest rates used by this Government to dampen imports and keep down inflation have totally backfired. All they have done is create a demand for Australian currency and lift the Australian dollar far beyond its value; far beyond the value that it deserves based on the productivity that Australia has-and we have already been told by others what sort of productivity Australia has. That is the single biggest killer of our competitiveness with our overseas trading partners. We cannot compete in wheat, we cannot compete in wool, and we see no improvement. Never before has there been an occasion when, unfortunately, all these industries have been down together. This situation does prove that it is caused by the Government's monetary policy, otherwise some industries would be up and some industries would be down, as all industries have had turns over their time. Wheat prices are at their lowest since 1947 with the inception of the Australian Wheat Board (AWB). The chart that I have here shows that the present price of $160 to $140 a tonne is certainly the lowest since 1947. In real terms we would have had a price of $1,000 a tonne in 1947. I know that the world demand is down, but there are ways in which this Government could help. The agricultural industries have put up with these things, but the Government does nothing about it. Because of the exchange rate, the Gulf crisis and escalation of the United States-European Community trade war, the first payment for wheat has been downgraded by 40 per cent this year. The wool situation is just as bad and falling, and we accept that the Australian Wool Corporation has a lot to answer for. I am the biggest critic in this place of the Wool Corporation for certain things that it has done, but the Government has been party to a lot of things that have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, I know that there are problems with those industries, but if the Government situation was not what it is now, they would have a chance. A reduction in interest rates of 3 per cent and a corresponding fall of the dollar to US75c would reduce payments by $4,500 on an average wheat farm with a debt of $150,000. It would increase the value of Australia's 16 million tonne wheat crop by $260m and increase the value of coarse grains by $106m. This equates to $10,000 per grain farmer. The cost imposed on grain growers of providing assistance to inefficient industries stands at $8,000 per farmer. With the Government being more determined on this reform, we would wipe that figure out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf crisis has added 5c to the dollar, and the Government has been very happy, amongst all things with the Gulf crisis, to keep receiving the windfall gains that it is getting out of the increased prices for oil. Senator Cook, in answer to a question yesterday, failed to mention the increased levies that the Government has been picking up on the increased oil prices. He dodged round and round, but he never mentioned that the Government is making a windfall profit from oil because it set its Budget on $23 a barrel and the price is now at $35 to $37 a barrel. If he is dinkum, just as in 1986 when the Government put the levies up to make up for the downfall in the oil, it could have done the same and kept the oil levies coming in so that they would reflect the forecast Budget. </PARA>

There are all these country people who are going to be affected, and worst of all, there are the children who will be affected as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of rural students, only a third ever get to university. We are going to have a problem now. I know that there is a limit on assets that one can possess before the tertiary allowance is taken off, and Senator Walsh believes that one should sell the farm; but a farmer cannot do that in the next 12 months if he is not in a viable position. If children lose one year's study, it affects the rest of their lives. Therefore, measures have to be taken by the Government so that those children will not be affected. As Senator Walsh told us, 30 per cent of farmers are in a pretty good position and making money from high interest rates-but 70 per cent are in debt. Of course, with those high interest rates, the income is wiped up by the inflation that they cause. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, the Government-as shown by the comments I have got from the other side of the chamber today-knows, but does not want to admit, that its policies have caused the rural industries and allied wider communities in those areas to decline in no uncertain terms. It is time that it realised its position and put some actions in place that will turn this rural crisis around-and it is nothing but a rural crisis-so that that sector of Australia can take its rightful place in the community, as it has always done, for the welfare and betterment of all Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We welcome this debate today. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the matter of public importance. The health and well-being of rural Australia contributes not only to the general economic health of Australia but also to achieving a buoyant regional economy. We heard precious little from honourable senators opposite on how they would help to overcome the problems we face in the rural sector today. Before I go on, I want to make some brief reference to some comments-a stretch of the facts-made by some Opposition senators in their speeches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, in the usual Opposition manner of continuing to attack, and advocate the reduction of, the wages and conditions of workers in this country, Senator Archer referred to a list of alleged benefits. In that list he referred to workers receiving 14 or 15 public holidays. That is simply not correct. The national standard for public holidays in this country is 10 days.  He then went on to refer to the cost of paternity and maternity leave. Again, in the private sector paternity and maternity leave is not a cost charged against the employer. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer wandered into the forests at one stage when he referred to the alleged lack of attention that the Labor Government has been giving to forest industry strategy. He only needs to look at what is occurring in our home State of Tasmania, where a very far-sighted and constructive forest industry strategy has been adopted by the State Labor Government. It will be interesting to see the position the State Liberals take on that particular policy. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I commend Senator Archer in one respect. He referred to the potato industry, and I share his concern with the problems faced by that industry. I have already had some discussions with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on this matter and I will also be having some discussions with the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett). </PARA>
<PARA> The major contribution to the debate of Senator Spindler on behalf of the Democrats was a comment that he favoured selective tariffs. However, the list that he gave broadened his advocacy of selective tariffs into one of general tariffs to protect all rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell, again, was not too accurate with his facts. He referred to the alleged 25 per cent increase in wage costs facing the rural sector in this country. That is factually not correct. Senator Boswell referred to that being made up of a superannuation contribution of 6 per cent. That is not correct; it is 3 per cent. There may be a further 3 per cent superannuation increase in coming years; but it certainly has not occurred yet. Senator Boswell also referred to the cost of the minimum training levy of 1 1/2 per cent. Again, if Senator Boswell knew much about that proposal, he would know that most farmers will not be affected by the minimum training guarantee. It is not 1 1/2 per cent yet; it is one per cent and it has not yet been implemented in terms of its cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other comment I would make about Senator Boswell's contribution is that he referred to the ups and downs and the cyclical nature of the rural industry. That is true. I am afraid that Senator Boswell's contribution to this debate, in some contrast to other contributions of Opposition senators, was a real downer. It is no wonder that the representation of the National Party of Australia in the Senate has declined to almost nothing. Senator Boswell's contribution on this issue today is indicative of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Drought was one of the major problems that the rural industries faced in 1982-83. Another was the collapse in terms of trade in 1985-86. To those Australians living in major urban centres, the effects were indirect. Despite the indirect nature of those effects, they were nevertheless real and substantial. The effects were real because the income earned by our primary industries allowed us to continue to trade without chalking up increased foreign debt. The effects are substantial because they multiply through the regional economy and then through the general economy. Of course, I am never encouraged by a rural downturn such as that which now appears to be on the horizon. Having said that, all honourable senators know that our rural industries will always be subject to cycles. </PARA>
<PARA> When the wool industry was last in a deep depression, in 1970-71, other agricultural sectors were doing fairly well. When the fortunes of the beef industry collapsed in 1974, wool had very substantially recovered. We have been fortunate that it has normally been the case that, as one particular commodity experiences bad times, others prosper. Even when large areas of Australia were drought affected in 1982, some parts of the country held up well. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the effects of changes in international markets will act to substantially reduce returns to Australian producers during 1990-91. This cannot be emphasised strongly enough. That is the major problem facing rural industries in this country today. A characteristic of Australian agriculture is that the Australian farmer and the Australian Government have little or no control over world prices. Variability in price inevitably results in variability in returns to growers. Estimates for farm cash operating surpluses for 1990-91 show that price and wool tax effects will drive cash operating surpluses to lower levels than those which have been considered normal over the past few years. For example, in 1991-92 specialist wheat growers' cash operating surplus is estimated to decline by 35 per cent. For specialist woolgrowers the decline is expected to be 47 per cent, and for mixed livestock and crop producers the decline will be about 49 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that the relative contribution of the decline in net wool receipts essentially drives the total picture. The average figures for a decline in cash operating surplus are distorted by the extraordinary developments in the wool industry. To a lesser extent, changes in the world grains market affect the aggregate outlook for cash operating surplus. Estimates available to the Government indicate that diminishing returns in wool make up 58 per cent in the decline of cash operating surplus. Diminishing returns from cereals contribute another 36 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators who are fair-minded and objective in their consideration of these issues will understand that variability of returns is something that most Australian producers accept as given in their industry. It is the genius of Australian producers that they continue to make strong efficiency gains and continue to do things better in their operations. They know that their own efforts form the basis for their continued prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me catalogue the changes in world markets which will act to reduce returns to Australian growers and over which we have little or no control. We have seen a dramatic decline in world wheat prices resulting from two major factors. The first is that the wheat harvest in the northern hemisphere is at a record high; consequently, excess stocks are being released into what is a residual world grain market. This means that the price not only of wheat but also of other cereal grains will be driven down. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, will know that the US dollar price for wheat will decline by an estimated 27 per cent. Irrespective of changes in the level of the dollar, this decline will set the parameters of price falls in the world's grain markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major factor at play is the activities of the United States and the European Community. Clearly, corrupt trading practices put additional down pressure on prices. The costs to Australia of export subsidies and agricultural protection have long been recognised. The Government's efforts to wind back these practices and gain a meaningful solution in this round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations have been consistent and extensive. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not pretend that wins in the current GATT round will eliminate variability in world grain markets. I do not pretend that the long term solution offers the answer to short term problems which currently face Australia's producers. However, it is not possible to pretend that Australia exists as a discrete entity removed from the world trading system. In fact, it would be a curious flight of fancy to advocate such a proposition. Australia's lifeblood is trade in our natural resource based industries. We critically depend on open and unrestricted access to international markets if we are to achieve our legitimate goals of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Those whose analysis is not a product of their own imagination will understand this elemental fact. They will therefore recognise that the palliatives of rhetoric offer little when dealing with complex problems. The solutions lie in facilitating adjustment, in ensuring support to individuals, and in developing the industry structure which is best placed to handle the complex requirements of the 1990s. The solution also lies in forcing the pace of change in industries associated with our efficient rural producers. In other words, the solution lies in the measures which the Government now has under way and which the Opposition cannot offer. </PARA>
<PARA> The current difficulties of Australia's premier agricultural industry-the wool industry-are well known and well documented. Those who have an interest in history will understand that the current situation is a function of industry decisions made some three years ago. Of course, the response of the Government has been central to the maintenance of stability within the market and the viability of the Australian Wool Corporation and the industry itself. I have little problem with accepting that the extraordinary measures initiated by the Wool Corporation and the Government will mean that times will be very tight. However, I have no difficulty in defending the decisions taken as being appropriate, timely and proper, given the circumstances which now prevail in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who care to criticise the Government for difficulties-such as those stated by Senator Panizza-now being experienced by Australian producers might also care to explain the fundamental link which exists between world prices and the returns to Australian producers. It is a fact, and not just a matter of idle National Party or Country Party chatter, that the decline in farm cash operating surplus resulting from the application of a tight monetary policy is insignificant when compared to the total decline induced by world prices. A permanent element in the farm equation is that industries subject to economic pressure will not always survive but will always come through in a stronger, leaner and more competitive shape than they were in at the start of the pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> Industries survive but, sadly, not all individuals in those industries do, and our Government has very great sympathy and is attempting in a positive manner to ensure that those individuals are protected as much as possible. This will be the same on this occasion, but I am confident that all honourable senators must also be aware that our farm industries will gain long term strength from short term adversity. I have been encouraged to observe in the present debate on the downturn that there is a much broader appreciation in the media about the causes of economic difficulties for our agricultural industries and, consequently, about the breadth of necessary policy adjustments. It is no longer a question of attributing blame to narrow commodity policies nor, thankfully, of agricultural lobby groups mindlessly pursuing protection of various sorts for their own industries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four categories of policies affecting the economic well-being of farm and other rural industries which the Government has addressed and the Opposition has failed to address. The first category is to determine the general macro-economic setting; exchange rates, interest rates, inflation and wage policy above the others. The second is the provision of physical and social infrastructure of the industries and the communities in rural areas. The third is commodity policy. The fourth is the existence of a welfare net for those who, for whatever reason, fall upon hard times. Previous speakers for the Government have dealt with a number of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important when looking at macro-economic policy settings, and appropriate, to remind honourable senators that the overriding objective of macro-economic policy is to reduce the current account deficit to a level which stabilises Australia's net foreign debt. In pursuing this objective, the Government has employed a comprehensive range of policies aimed at slowing demand growth to sustainable levels and improving the productive capacity of the economy. The Government called on all arms of policy to slow the excessive growth in demand evident in 1988 and 1989. Fiscal policy remains tight. Wages policy has been tight, as is reflected in the continuing decline in real labour costs, unlike the continued assertions from the Opposition that there has been some sort of wages and cost boom. Monetary policy was tightened substantially in 1988 and 1989. In response to these policies, demand has slowed as expected, and the current account has improved from a deficit of over $20 billion last financial year to an annualised deficit of $17 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition contends that we should ease monetary policy in response to the downturn in the economy. It talks of recession and crisis. It does not do itself or Australia any service with such talk. We are not in the business of talking down the economy and talking up a crisis mentality. The point is that the slowdown in demand in the economy, and the consequent improvement in the balance of payments, reflect a set of macro policies which are on track. Official interest rates have fallen by four percentage points since the beginning of the year. The impact of this fall in rates will still be feeding into economic activity in 18 months' time. The Opposition, in calling for further falls in interest rates, illustrates its complete ignorance of those lags. </PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council was held in Adelaide in July 1990. I have looked through the report. I have been particularly interested in people in rural Australia. One section that I noted particularly was the drought policy review. I spoke about drought when a report came in earlier this year. One comment here is that the Council noted that the report I mentioned treats drought as 'a natural recurring condition, which in most cases is a normal risk that should be included in the management of Australian rural enterprises'. That might sound good in theory, but I do not believe that it is good in practice. If honourable senators lived, as I do, in the country, they would be very conscious of the fact that droughts are the effect of nature; that God does not send the rain at the right time. It is very difficult to include that-as is said in the report-as part of the management of Australian rural enterprises. The Government ought to take cognisance of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Most certainly, one of the bad things that the Government did was to do away with the income equalisation deposits scheme, under which, in good times, we were able to put money away so that we had reserves to fall back on in times of drought. I lived in a city until I married and went to live at Kingaroy. Rain was just a bit of a nuisance value in the city. But my word, if people go to live in the country, they realise how important it is. We have just been quite thrilled at home because we have had an inch of rain in the last couple of days. For nine whole weeks it had not rained. If people are trying to grow wheat crops, one good way to ensure that there is not a huge amount of wheat to be sold is if they cannot get rain to help their crop to grow. That was one matter that I was interested in. </PARA>
<PARA> But I noticed that in this report not one mention is made of the rural crisis-something that is really very important. We have just had a debate on a matter of public importance concerning the rural crisis and the fact that the Government does not realise the dependence of Australia on rural exports. One reads all the headlines about the wheat industry facing a crisis of confidence, about angry farmers planning to have a big rally in Brisbane, and about the worsening farm crisis. There is certainly a crisis in the rural industry. But one also reads about Mr Brian Courtice, the honourable member for Hinkler, saying that there is not a rural crisis; and one reads about Mr Hull, the honourable member for Kennedy, saying that perhaps a little more could be done. Sadly, he took the late Bob Katter's place. I believe that the rural area in Kennedy will suffer very much indeed because Mr Hull is not aware of the problems of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are just so many problems in rural Australia. The record current account deficits and the continuing very high interest rates are doing irreparable damage. Small businesses are collapsing. There is crisis everywhere. Then I read in our Courier-Mail just the other day that suicides were feared because of the looming rural crisis. The Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, has warned that farming finances will hit rock bottom in January and February. I believe that many farmers' incomes have already hit rock bottom. So the Australian Agricultural Council really should have said something about the serious crisis in the rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to talk about a review of grain marketing, and I think we all realise that there has been overproduction of wheat in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America and China. These are some of the problems--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is quite enlightening in a number of respects. One item in particular which caught my eye and which has particular relevance in view of the fact that Senator Cook is in the chamber is the statement that the superannuation industry now has assets approaching $130 billion and that superannuation coverage is estimated to be approaching 70 per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know where the Commission gets that figure or whether it would care to elaborate on it, but my understanding is that the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics statistics indicate that barely 40 per cent of the private sector work force has actual superannuation coverage, although some 90 per cent of the public sector has. If we take the weighted average, we end up with a little over 50 per cent. That, of course, is the reason why most of the major players in the game, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), have been prepared to concede that there is indeed a crisis in occupational superannuation, sufficient to justify the need for a national conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that struck me as extraordinary last week was that a prominent story in the Australian Financial Review said that the Government had agreed to convene a conference, that the agenda and timing had not been agreed upon, but that we would have that in due course. The ACTU expressed a deal of sympathy for this and, rather than simply bashing the employers over the head, said that as long as it was not a stalling tactic it was prepared to go along with it. Lo and behold, we heard nothing from the Government until about three days later when this tiny letter from Senator Cook appeared in the Australian Financial Review saying that it was all a bit premature, that his spokesman had been misunderstood and that the Government had not made up its mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it odd in the extreme, even if Senator Cook happened to have been away for a couple of days, that we had to wait virtually three days before we got this sort of response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact remains that Senator Cook was remarkably silent on the issue and has therefore left a great deal of concern in the community as to where the Government stands on the issue. Why does he not bite the bullet? It seems to me that a national conference, structured along the right lines, which concedes the crisis that there is at the present time, could be a very useful contribution. But again, the Government seems to be vacillating on it and is not prepared to do anything until the major players have come up with a deal and presented it to it as a fait accompli.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not exactly leadership, and I would have thought there was a very important role to be played out there. Instead, the Government seems to be more interested in other games, including the meeting on funder's funds, which I read about in the press the other day-in fact, I read about it in two newspapers, so someone comprehensively leaked the fact that the meeting was to occur. It turned out to have been a complete non-event. On my information, Mr Keating was bored, Senator Button was disorganised, and Mr Howe did not bother to turn up. So the end result is that nothing in particular was decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button's claim that something like $514m has been invested in the venture capital industry is not accepted by the insurance industry. As I understand it, it regards the figure as probably being double that, especially if it includes research and development. I think the sooner the Government clears the air on what it really has in mind the better, because it is making all these noises to appease the trade union movement about how this will lead to increased industrial muscle and how the industry ought to be a lot more imaginative, to quote the words of Mr Keating to the Life Insurance Federation of Australia in November last year. </PARA>

It is about time the Government concentrated on letting the commercial industry operate effectively and gave it a better playing field than the minefield of complexities and over detail that it seems to be burdened with at the present time.

<PARA> I note that the report states that an important function of the Commission is to provide advice to the Government on the proposed changes to legislation-we certainly have had a plethora of changes- and to provide adequate prudential safeguards which will lead to continued stability and community confidence in the insurance and superannuation industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is this Government's policy to encourage as many taxpayers as possible to be saving for their retirement. This is the whole aim of the current superannuation policies. People's superannuation must be protected, it must be safeguarded. There must not only be prudential standards, but there must also be an adequate body that has the guts to enforce those standards, and this is where I believe it is falling down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the growth in the superannuation industry that perhaps has become the bright spot of an otherwise sluggish investment market in 1990-91, but future superannuation benefits depend on the returns gained by investments made on the stock market, in property and in other sorts of enterprises, by both insurance and superannuation companies. Any person can tell, for example, that the stock market is not exactly in a buoyant position at the present time; nor indeed is the property market. For example, to take just one paper this morning, the Australian Financial Review said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Stock Market struggled to hang on to a modest gain yesterday, with another bout of short-covering providing the only boost to flagging trade. </PARA>
<PARA>It was further stated that the institutional investors generally believe that the market is in a downward trend. Indeed, these are worrying comments for those who have money invested in superannuation companies. Their protection, I suppose, is through a spread of investments, but if the whole market is depressed the whole economy is going down. There must be some concern about the insurance industry's ability to be able, in times of retirement, to provide income to match the future promised benefit outlined in some of those schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last couple of weeks, the prices of shares in many of Australia's top companies have been steadily dropping. Every now and then we have a little boost described in glowing terms as euphoria, but this is often very short-lived. One has only to read the share market action pages in Australian newspapers to understand the seriousness of the situation. We are feeling the effects of a recession not only in the rural economy but right across the board. This, I put to honourable senators, is also affecting the future of our ageing and aged population. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that the report under consideration states that the current economic climate is likely to impact on the results of the insurance and superannuation industries in 1990-91. I would have hoped for some elaboration on that. I am glad that the industry acknowledges the facts that are glaring at us in the newspapers today, but it should have added to what was said and given us a little more information. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned at the possibility of many future superannuants believing that they will receive a certain amount of money, which will now need to be revised as a result of our present share trading practices and because of the drop in property prices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak again on the report from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Migration Regulations, entitled Illegal Entrants in Australia-Balancing Control and Compassion which deals with the matter of illegals in Australia. I do so noting that today is 10 October and that a special concession available to illegals in Australia at the moment who wish to apply to regularise their status expires on 31 October, which is only 21 days, or three weeks, from now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this final opportunity to urge some of those people, if they happen to be listening to this broadcast, to take advantage of that concession. Although the majority report from the Committee contains some recommendations that some other means be introduced by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) to allow them to avail themselves of opportunities to regularise their status, a reply from the Government has not yet been forthcoming and time is running out for those people. I take this opportunity to urge them to seek to regularise their status. If they feel that they will not be able to gain the benefit of permanent residency by an application to regularise their status, the only course of action open to them is to remove themselves from Australia. I urge them to take either of those courses of action. </PARA>
<PARA> I do so for the reason that, from 1 November onwards, illegals, when they are apprehended, subject of course to the Minister's and the Government's response to the recommendations by the majority of the Committee, will be subject to mandatory deportation from this country-harsh action, but action of which notice has been given for well in excess of two years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have advised those illegals who have contacted my electorate office and sought advice on matters such as this to remove themselves, because if they are apprehended from 1 November this year and subjected to mandatory deportation, in some instances they will be leaving behind a home that they own that will have to go on the market in some sort of fire sale. Furniture and other possessions will have to be disposed of in Australia or arrangements will have to be made to remove them to the country which they are moving to. There are also the difficulties associated with children's education. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this final plea in the Parliament that people take advantage of this concession or, if they do not seek to take advantage of it, to voluntarily remove themselves from Australia. I doubt that all 90,000 illegals in Australia are listening to this broadcast, but I hope that people who know illegals will encourage them to take this action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand Senator Watson's laughter at that particular remark. I would not impute any ulterior motives to his frivolity; I suspect that he is laughing at the thought that we might have 90,000 people listening to the broadcast, rather than at the very serious subject that I am addressing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also reinforce my earlier remarks by recording in Hansard the fact that there has been an increase of 200 per cent in the resources available to the enforcement branch of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. There are now additional officers around the country checking up and following through on illegals. Their efforts-although not fully on stream-are paying dividends at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Two weeks ago in Perth the Department, in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police, mounted a raid on a market garden just north of Perth in a place called Guilderton and apprehended some 16 people of Polish nationality who were working there. The people were immediately arrested and detained until some of them were able to be released on bail or other provisions. This is an example of some of the resources-probably not enough-available to the Department. So the illegals who think they can continue to hide in this vast and beautiful country might have to think again after seeing evidence such as that in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> One very disturbing aspect of that Perth raid was the fact that not only were the people concerned illegally in Australia but also they were compounding their illegal situation by working. Indeed, one of the people actually had a tax file number. That concerned me because he was, as it were, a non-citizen, not entitled to work in Australia. I noted a report in the West Australian newspaper of Thursday, 4 October which quoted a taxation officer from the Perth office-Mr Rod Todman, Director of Revenue Collection-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> As far as we're concerned, we are only interested in people paying the right amount of tax, regardless of how they derive the income. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not surprise me that a person who is here on a visitor's visa, under which employment is prohibited, could be granted a tax file number. That is of some concern to me because people found to be illegally in Australia and therefore subject to a penalty attached found that further penalties applied because they were working. Penalties are also imposed on employers who knowingly employ illegals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter that the Government needs to address. The Committee in its report-I stress that on this occasion it was a majority recommendation of all members of the Committee rather than of those who were present who endorsed the report-recommended that the Government should look more closely at what penalties could be imposed on employers who knowingly engage in rorts that seek to exploit illegals who may be in their employ. Evidence, some of it anecdotal, has been given to the Committee previously that such practices are in existence, although I do not in any way suggest that those practices are widespread. This is of particular concern at the moment when Australia is facing growing unemployment. Hopefully it will not grow too much more. We are eager to ensure that any job vacancies that may arise will be taken by Australians legally entitled to work rather than by illegals in the country who are, therefore, not entitled to work. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by yet again, hopefully, encouraging those people who are illegally in Australia to either avail themselves of the concession that is available to them prior to the thirty-first of this month or to voluntarily remove themselves from Australia. If they do not do that, they are making a very conscious choice and there will be very little point in making appeals to parliamentarians, such as myself, for some compassionate outlook on their cases at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add my support to the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Patterson. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training who contributed to this report on priorities for reform in higher education, I wish to support the remarks of the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Aulich, and our other Committee members. I draw the Senate's attention to remarks made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, who is reported by the Australian as dismissing the report as having `a very shallow basis' and being a `totally useless' contribution to the debate on higher education. Certainly with the passage of time the Dawkins view is becoming less and less credible, if it had any credibility at the commencement. I take this opportunity to state that I stand firmly behind the Committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two years of work went into the report, including the consideration of 227 written submissions from higher education institutions, academic staff associations, students' unions, private sector organisations, individual academics, and State and Federal governments. In addition, 80 witnesses appeared at public hearings held by the Committee. I believe that the comment made by Mr Dawkins was an off the cuff, dismissive comment not worthy of a Minister for education. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the number of submissions and witnesses, I believe it was wrong of Mr Dawkins to dismiss the report as unrepresentative. Unfortunately, Mr Dawkins appears to share with his colleague Mr Keating a blind belief in their own infallibility-a dangerous trait in any individual, but particularly serious for people in influential positions such as Mr Dawkins and Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA> Submissions received by our Committee raised a wide range of issues. These included the relationship between higher education and the economy, funding policies for research, academic staffing policies, ways of improving access and equity, the place of higher education within the framework of continuing education, distance education, which is so important in Australia, links between higher education and technical and further education (TAFE), policies relating to overseas students, and management processes at both institutional and system levels. This was a very wide and a very comprehensive report, which I think was well received in academia, if not well received at the time by the Minister. With the passage of time, I think that even Mr Dawkins has had to eat his words. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did not feel obliged to make definite recommendations about all the matters discussed in the report; it was a discussion document. It saw its role, in part, as a catalyst for public discussion about the future of higher education in Australia. The Committee's report was timely after so many radical changes which have been forced on education institutions by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the report was to broaden the scope of public debate on higher education matters. In broad terms, the report criticised the standard of education and the quality of teaching provided by universities. In fact, the Committee found that university education in many places was too narrow and too specialised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also found that education was viewed as a greenhouse in which people fulfilled their learning obligations-usually in three to four years-and that there was very little continuing education or a sense of education as a lifelong process. Surely we have got to improve on that if Australia is, indeed, going to be the lucky country, the quality country and the informed country. </PARA>
<PARA> We found that the quality of teaching was, in some cases, quite appalling. Specific recommendations were made in relation to curriculum, communication skills, the quality of teaching, and continuing education. It is on this latter area-that is, continuing education-that I wish to make a few further comments. The Committee believed that it is becoming less and less realistic to assume that higher education can be provided, once and for all, at the end of schooling. The concept of lifelong education is beginning to take hold in Australia, and I commend certain professions for being ahead of the field. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's White Paper on education acknowledged that continuing education is a fundamental part of the education and training system, and that the principle of lifelong education is now accepted as fundamental to achieving social, cultural, technical and structural change, and to our future economic development. However, the paper said little about the implications of this view and did not propose any specific arrangements to increase the higher education sector's involvement in continuing education. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the impression was created that continuing education remains somewhat peripheral to the central purpose of higher education-an impression reinforced by the paper's policy position that, in general, continuing education programs should be self-funding. This attitude is not new. As a number of submissions pointed out, adult and continuing education has long been regarded as a marginal activity within the higher education system, not only at Commonwealth level but also within the institutions themselves. At the institutional level, continuing education departments have frequently been among the first to experience budget cuts at times of financial strain. As a submission from the Australian Association for Adult and Community Education rather pithily expressed, `Adult education has presented a soft target for cost cutting' because it `lacks the political clout in the forums where budget decisions have to be made'. I believe this is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all the sectors in the Australian education system, continuing education is the most decentralised. The activity crosses educational sectors, involving higher education and TAFE as well as a number of community organisations, and varies in structure from State to State. There is no central policy-making body. As submissions pointed out, it is difficult even to establish basic information on trends because there is no agency responsible for the regular collection of data. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognised that undue centralisation of responsibility and control may well damage the flexibility which is a vital element of this form of education. Nevertheless, the growing importance of lifelong education-in both economic and social terms-suggests that something more than a policy of benign neglect is required to ensure that continuing education is able to rise to the challenges of the coming decades. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Committee recommended that the Commonwealth establish a permanent policy focus for adult and continuing education at the national level. This mechanism should be established within the structure of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and should report, in the first instance, to either the Chair of NBEET or the Chair of the Higher Education Council. It should assume a leadership role for continuing education and develop policies appropriate to the emerging education needs of Australian society. A priority for this body should be the development of a national strategy on continuing education. Such a strategy would identify broad objectives for the future development of continuing education, and establish policies to achieve those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the recommendations regarding continuing education, and the other recommendations contained within that report, to the Senate, to the nation's higher education policy advisers, to administrators and to students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I do know how reasonable honourable senators opposite are. That is a judgment. I was commenting on the necessity for education of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). I was somewhat distressed-as were, no doubt, many others in the community who have some awareness and understanding of this issue-to hear her say that in Australia we really had gone over the top in respect of the matter of drugs in sport. That was said but some months following the death of a young body builder who had taken anabolic steroids and subsequently died as a result of that indulgence. That is but the tip of the iceberg. There is a very clear need for education in the wider community of the inherent dangers in the use of drugs in sport, not to mention the moral and ethical issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Committee, its report and findings are unique in Australia. With the exception of the Dubin report, commissioned by the Canadian Government as a result of Ben Johnson being cast into disgrace through taking anabolic steroids and cheating at the Seoul Olympic Games, there is no other inquiry of the depth and width of this one. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the report is not universally attractive-one could say that it is not universally respected. By and large, that is because it has had to focus upon and direct its attention towards the level of cheating amongst Australian sports men and women in this country, not only at the elite level but also at the very casual, weekend level. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had to focus upon the attitude of coaches and sporting officials as to whether they have been prepared to root out the abuse and use of drugs and the cheating allowed by virtue of their use, or whether they have tolerated them and turned a blind eye, being more concerned about the embarrassment that the athletes bring to the blazer brigade, the officials and that sport than they are concerned about the health of the athlete and the fact that he is obtaining an unfair advantage over other athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had to look at what steps have been taken to root out this cheating. We have had to look at how the Government has applied itself to the vexing question. We have looked at what steps have been taken in respect of the lethal administration, the lethal availability, of many of these proscribed drugs. I have to say that too often we were not surprised but disappointed to find that coaches, athletes, officials, administrators and governments had fallen well short of their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going through that which the Committee did discuss, let me in the few minutes available to me touch on those matters which we did not. To that extent it is a great disappointment to me that this Committee at least will not deal with them. The Committee did not confront the question of the ethics, the ethos or the morality of the use of drugs in sport. We did not define a distinguishable parameter of the philosophy in the use of drugs. For instance, we found that the argument was entangled with health. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the Australian Olympic Federation what its attitude would be if the wit of man allowed for the synthetic manufacture of a drug which enhanced performance but had no detrimental side effects. Would that be cheating? It certainly would not be a problem in respect of health. Then it would be argued that it was cheating because it created an unfair advantage. So then I asked: What would be the attitude to such a drug if it was widely available, as is orange juice, amino acids or other performance enhancing substances which are freely distributed and provided? There seemed to be no proper answer to that question because it had not been addressed. We just had this blind, and quite proper, notion that it appeared to be cheating, giving a differential advantage to one athlete against another and therefore we ought to outlaw it. But we had not addressed the questions of education or philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Olympic Committee has a range of substances, including beta-blockers. Outside beta-blockers we can have substances such as diazepam which is a brand name for valium. Valium has the effect that a beta-blocker has in a different way. But it has exactly the same effect in respect of its application by a pistol shooter or somebody in archery. To that extent it gives an unfair advantage, but it is not a banned substance. However, beta-blockers are. That demonstrates that there has not been a proper consideration of these questions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not questioned the distinction between a beta-blocker and amino acids. Amino acids are provided at taxpayers' expense, or they have up until recently, at the Australian Institute of Sport for the purpose of cloning the effect that anabolic steroids would have, except that amino acids are not lethal to the body and are not a banned substance. Perhaps they do not give any advantage, but that is an argument that was had in relation to anabolic steroids as well. Those questions have not been addressed, and I suspect that they will not be. The question of a level playing field, which was one of the arguments put in respect of drugs, was not addressed either. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, there is no level playing field in elite sport in the world. Some athletes cannot even afford running shoes, yet others have top of the range shoes. It is the same with medical treatment, training facilities, coaches and all those things which enhance the ability and performance of various athletes. If one had time, which one has not, one could turn to the question of education in Australia. I am absolutely horrified at the lack of information available to students. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I spoke about tensions in the coalition around the development of the coalition's foreign policy, particularly differences between the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party. I also mentioned some of the Government's achievements in the area of foreign policy. It is appropriate at this time to place on record the Labor Government's active and consistent position on South Africa and the fact that the Government has not been in the game of making Thatcherite concessions in terms of sanctions. The maintenance of sanctions and the fact that they are working and have the support of black South Africans again is an indication of the differences that exist between this Government's policy and what would be the policy in the unlikely event of a Liberal government being elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of issues have been raised in Australian politics over recent years which I think leave a bad taste in our mouths. The first was the one Australia policy and the whole immigration debate that was sponsored by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. Previous speakers in this debate have spoken of the multifunction polis. I will refer in a minute to the fear campaign that occurred during the last Federal election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson's fundamental position in his response to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was that Australia's status in Asia has somehow been reduced by this Government's actions. That is absolute claptrap. In fact, the Japanese must be particularly confused about what their position is, because on 25 March 1988 in an address to an Australian Chamber of Commerce luncheon the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do believe the time has come for Japan to look afresh at its role and responsibilities in the Western alliance. A unique opportunity exists for Japan to develop a broader political strategy that takes into account not only its own national self-interests but also the wider political interests of the Western alliance. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we can contrast that with Dr Hewson's recent statements that he did not support an extended international role for Japan. There is a great deal of inconsistency in what Dr Hewson is saying. On the one hand, he is saying that he does believe that Japan should be a member of the United Nations Security Council. But on the other hand-and I will quote from his response to the Prime Minister's statement-he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we do not believe that Japan should be assuming an international military role, even in peace-keeping operations, in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is a tremendous amount of inconsistency in the Opposition's position. It seems to me that, before Dr Hewson continues to pontificate on these matters, he ought to get his and the Opposition's act into gear. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose what has particularly offended me in recent times has been the scare campaign about the multifunction polis. I want to remind the Senate what occurred in the last Federal election campaign in the electorate of Lowe where, in an absolute desperation move and with a few days to go in the election campaign, the honourable member for Lowe, Dr Woods, put out a direct mail letter to his electors in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has approved in principle a Japanese proposal to build in Australia a City of the Future, a so called `Multi Function Polis'. </PARA>
<PARA> The favoured site for this huge project is Homebush Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> Far too little information is yet available to assess the merits and demerits for such a project for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing seems very clear: it would be wrong to site it at Homebush Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept is a massive one-the building of an ultra modern, high technology city inhabited by between 100,000 and 200,000 people (about 80 per cent of them Japanese Citizens) and providing a major industrial, commercial and domestic complexes. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on with a little more xenophobic and paranoid rubbish and concludes his direct mail letter thus:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary it seems that this idea in its current form has doubtful benefits to the economy and may well destroy the harmony of our existing community. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fighting this proposal on your behalf. I would value your support. </PARA>
<PARA>So I would say that there is no better example than that of the Opposition's attitudes to Japan-of having its foot on the accelerator at the same time as having its foot on the brake. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson, in his recent foray into international affairs, said that Australia should be following a policy which he either refers to, in his words, as `selfish' or as `enlightened self-interest'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is interesting that he sees both those as being the same thing. What does Dr Hewson mean by this? I believe, frankly, that his visit to China and his actions there indicate strongly that he means that we should follow, rather than a policy of `enlightened self-interest', a policy of `unenlightened hypocrisy'. That is, he pontificates about how Australia should resume full relations with China so that our trade relationship is not harmed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But just to have two bob each way, he makes a couple of little gestures. For example, he refused to attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games while he was there. Fortunately, I do not think that our Asian neighbours were holding their breath on this one. And then he wagged his finger at the Chinese leadership over human rights issues. Then, just in case his audience back home had not got the point, he made sure, and again using his words, that `informed sources'-the oldest one in the book-knew how upset the Chinese were by his incredibly strong line on human rights. He had to do this because, of course, the Chinese did not seem to think it was worthwhile mentioning that Dr Hewson had thrashed them with a feather. The Age of 24 September stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The exchanges, in which Dr Hewson pushed human rights issues, `jarred' the leaders, according to informed sources, and prompted some invited officials to stay away from a reception at Australia's embassy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the parliamentary statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with regard to his visits in recent weeks to New Caledonia, the South Pacific Forum, Papua New Guinea and Japan. In great contrast to the Yes, Minister comments of the new backbencher from New South Wales, Senator Faulkner, who spoke in adulatory terms of his Prime Minister, I have considered the statement carefully and disagree. This is yet further evidence that we now have in Australia a tired government-a government which is tired and out of ideas not only in respect of economic matters but also in respect of foreign affairs matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has been critical of the Government for some time in respect of foreign affairs matters. The Prime Minister's failures in his recent visits overseas demonstrate what is happening in this important area which goes to the heart of Australia's national interest. The Prime Minister went to Japan but came away unsuccessful. The Olympics did not come to Melbourne although this was the intention and the purpose of his visit. </PARA>
<PARA> He went to New Guinea and came away without any constructive solutions to the present pressing problems of that country, including Bougainville. He went to the South Pacific Forum and came away with similar failures, having alienated Pacific leaders on the two major issues that were before that Forum. The first was the chemical weapons question with regard to the facility proposed by the United States on Johnston Atoll to destroy chemical weapons. As an apologist, without a proper brief and without preparation of his case, instead of benefiting from the arguments that he should have been in a position to have mounted at that Forum, he appeared to be the dupe of another foreign government's analysis of the matter and he failed to convince the Prime Ministers of our close neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> On the second major issue discussed at the South Pacific Forum-that is the question of Fiji, assessments of the failures there as a result of coups, the overriding of the constitution, the failure of democracy in that country and the question of what the attitudes of other countries should be towards Fiji in these circumstances-the Prime Minister not only alienated the Prime Ministers of our neighbouring countries but also, through his inept behaviour and remarks, put off side Ratu Mara, the present Prime Minister of Fiji, and the Opposition which had, at least for some months, understood Australia's protest at the turn of events in Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Prime Minister returned from Japan, from Papua New Guinea and from the South Pacific Forum with this succession of failures. It is no wonder then that the Opposition has described the Prime Minister's report yesterday in the House of Representatives as further evidence of the failures of this tired Government-a Government lacking ideas and inspiration. The report given by the Prime Minister highlights the failures and inconsistencies of a tired Government lacking ideas and influence. It is a sorry record of unnecessary confusion and disillusionment, caused by the Prime Minister's own incompetent handling of important international issues. That is the Opposition's assessment of this matter, and it has been maintained by Opposition speakers in this debate in the Senate and also in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there has been a pattern of failure this year by the Government in foreign policy matters. I refer to a succession of issues. The first is the Government's failure to respond in good time to the opportunities to influence our neighbour China. It has taken the Opposition to set out an initiative to open the doors to dialogue with China, and only now is the Government beginning to follow our lead. </PARA>
<PARA> For some years now the Opposition has urged a series of constructive commercial measures to enhance Australia's advantage in commercial relationships with Taiwan. Only after we yet once more, in August and September, explicitly set out our specific reforms with regard to Taiwan has the Government now begun to act. Last Friday it was widely reported in newspapers-for example, on the front page of the Australian Financial Review-that the Government was moving, at long last, to take up some of the reforms that the Opposition has been urging for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I do not refer to any semblance of a two-China policy. There is one China and that is the Government in Beijing, which is recognised not only by the present Labor Government but by preceding Liberal and National Party governments of Australia. I am talking about initiatives in regard to Taiwan as an economic entity and maximising Australia's advantage in relation to Taiwan. I will return to these two areas, China and Taiwan, later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> A third failure has been the Prime Minister's inadequate response to Fiji. Now the Prime Minister has, it appears, ditched his own former policy on Fiji in favour of the more realistic and more engaging approach that the Opposition has been advocating for months. We should not close the door on our discussions with the present Government in Fiji. Rather, we should put our strong views about constitutional proprieties and about democracy by direct meeting and engagement with whoever are the representatives of that country. </PARA>
<PARA> A fourth issue on which the Government has at last begun to heed our initiatives has been our call for the ending of a ban on ministerial contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. We have the news only today of the terrible event in Jerusalem where, following some degree of riot, there was an over-reaction by the Israeli authorities in the shooting dead of more than 20 Palestinians and the wounding of some hundreds of other Palestinians.</PARA>
<PARA> The foundation for our concern is not only the loss of life and this completely exaggerated response to provocations, but the lack of a solution-even the lack of any pathway that would appear to be leading to a solution-to the Palestinian question. In the present circumstances of the Middle East with Iraq's aggression against and occupation of Kuwait, unlawfully and against all the views of the allied nations now arraigned against Iraq, an event such as the one in Jerusalem which we had reported to us today is the kind of spark which could have begun the shooting war, which could have begun an engagement of Israel in the tinderbox of military confrontation in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore all the more urgent that there be a constructive and positive response by the present Government in Australia to take the preliminary and foundation measures that will see a solution to the Palestinian question. There has been a failure to report to this nation any advances in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area is the now long drawn-out civil war in Sri Lanka and the Government's failure to put forward positive suggestions, especially since the change of government in India and, as a consequence of that change, the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka. The Government, however, now appears to look favourably on the Opposition's proposal, which is a Commonwealth role to bring peace to Sri Lanka. Various nations of the Commonwealth, including Australia, could work constructively in that country, with the agreement of the Government of Sri Lanka, to assist in the disengagement of the forces arraigned against each other. Senator Hill has outlined that proposal in detail and with very real coherence. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area where the Opposition took the lead concerned the question of the moment, the response to the crisis in the Gulf. It was the Opposition which called for a practical commitment from our Defence Force in response to the Middle East crisis, and this public statement was one day ahead of the Government's announcement of the Royal Australian Navy's deployment. Despite repeated calls to the Prime Minister in extensive correspondence by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Prime Minister has not yet informed the Australian public on the full extent or full nature of Australia's involvement in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we have had some disclosure of rules of engagement and guidelines with regard to the structure of command in the Gulf, but still the Australian public is not fully informed about our direct involvement with our allies in the Gulf region. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these instances where the Government has begun to follow the lead set out by the Opposition's declared policies, there have been three stark errors in foreign policy matters, and I mention them in passing. One has been the hypocrisy and confusion surrounding the Prime Minister's announcement concerning Chinese students in this country following the terrible events in Tiananmen Square on 4 June last year. Overemotionally, in a sweeping statement, without consultation or forethought, the Government announced a four-year extension for the visas of all Chinese students in Australia, irrespective of the merits of any particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, in contrast, has properly sought to have any Chinese student who would be in difficulty on return to China allowed to remain in this country. But the assessment of that matter should be on a case by case basis, and not made with the sweep of the hand, saying that 20,000 Chinese students could stay in this country for what appears to be an indefinite period but certainly whilst this Government is in power for a period of four years. This extends uncertainty. It blows the integrity of our immigration program, and it also gives signals to all those countries that send students for training in this country that our word is not reliable with regard to students being trained in this country with the imperative that they return to give assistance to their own country. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area that we see as an error, and indeed gross hypocrisy in the Government's decisions in the foreign policy area, concerns overseas aid. Foreign overseas development assistance has been cut by $100m because there was a bringing forward into the last financial year an amount of money that would ordinarily have been in this financial year. By this arrangement, whilst there appears to be the same dollar amount in the Budget Papers for foreign aid this year, on a closer examination one finds that there is a $100m cut. </PARA>
<PARA> On 19 September here in the Senate, I outlined my own assessments of this serious situation with regard to Australia's overseas aid. I highlighted then, as I do now, the hypocrisy of the Government in not honouring the promise that it made during the election campaign that it would maintain in real terms the amount of Australia's overseas aid. Very ironically, the cut of $100m is in fact the amount that the Opposition honestly declared before the election that we believed was necessary on the basis of guidelines we then clearly published, given the economic situation of this country and the need for us to be sure that we had the cloth to which we could cut our suit that the Australian public could afford. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government, against that statement, clearly said that it would maintain overseas aid in real terms, and gladhanded itself among the Australian public and overseas aid groups with the contrast that the Opposition would make a cut and it would not. However, only a matter of months after that election, this hypocritical Government has in fact introduced a cut of $100m, and reneged completely on its promise to maintain overseas aid in real terms. I think that the public in future ought to look to the honest statements of the Opposition against the hypocritical record of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area, which it is now very clear was a major mistake in the foreign affairs area, was the sale of Mirage jets to Pakistan at a time of extraordinary tension over Kashmir between Pakistan and India, at just the time when after several years of careful work in a bipartisan approach, there had been an increasingly substantial and close relationship between Australia and India. With no offence to Pakistan and to the other countries of south Asia, I say we have this $30m sale-30 pieces of silver-of some second-hand Mirage jets. It ought to have been entirely obvious to this Government that even this sale, however lowly it thought it was in value, being worth only $30m, was of direct offence to India and quite the wrong signal to give at that time. It was throwing an incendiary into a tense situation between India and Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the record of the Government, of which this Prime Minister has now reported to the Parliament with regard to his visits to several overseas countries. Not only has he failed in the visits that he made, but also he has failed in the various ways that I have now listed. It is no wonder that the Senate does not have confidence in the present Government in terms of the handling of Australia's foreign affairs decisions. Because I wish to be fair, I point out that there have been two initiatives, now somewhat dated, in which there has been some degree of success. One relates to Cambodia and the other relates to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation process. The goals of both programs have the full support of the Opposition. Of course, we all in this chamber wish to see a stable secure solution to the problems of Cambodia. Indeed, the Opposition, with strong initiatives which preceded those of the Government, wishes to see an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation process which will lead to the further prosperity of Australia and all of the countries of this region. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to estimate that the Asia-Pacific region will become the most prosperous-the largest in economic terms-in the world as a whole by the beginning of next century. There will be three centres of economic activity: one will be Europe, another North America, and the third the Asia-Pacific region. This third region, including Australia, will be the greatest. It is important that Australia take initiatives to maximise the bridges for understanding and cooperation between the countries in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with this in mind that I refer to the Opposition's visit to China recently and to our specific initiatives with regard to Taiwan. This has been referred to on a number of occasions by speakers, including Senator Faulkner, who preceded me. It is understandable that it be referred to because, in great contrast to the Prime Minister's visits overseas, this visit by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, was so strikingly dramatic as an initiative in the foreign affairs area, and so successful, that of course it has led to a great deal of comment around Australia and here in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson has made two significant journeys in the period he has been Leader of the Opposition. The first was to some eight countries in Asia: Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is significant that the Leader of the Liberal-National coalition went first to the Asia-Pacific region, to which I have been referring. He went with a very careful knowledge of the economies of these countries. His visit there was entirely successful. The second visit that he made was to China just a fortnight ago, following his short visit to Japan in support of Melbourne's Olympic bid. </PARA>
<PARA> As chairman of the Opposition's foreign affairs and defence committee, I had the privilege to attend in China with Dr Hewson, along with the Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, and the foreign affairs shadow Minister, Senator Hill. I do not believe that in recent history there has been any visit overseas by the three significant leaders of the Opposition: the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I observed every aspect of the preparation for that visit and, indeed, every aspect of our discussions in China. I believe that our objectives were achieved and that it was a most successful visit. I am happy to see that Senator Gareth Evans has not chosen to make one single criticism of this new initiative by the Opposition. Indeed, since we announced the terms of our visit, Dr Blewett has visited China and, in a measured and appropriate way, I believe, the Government ought to continue the process of dialogue that we have opened up. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Opposition's view that, of course, we are all-Government and Opposition alike-appalled by the turn of events in May-June last year. The massacre in Tiananmen Square last year appalled the world, appalled Australia. In our visit to the senior leaders of China barely two weeks ago our first communication was to reinforce that same direct criticism of the policies of any country that turns its guns on the people of its own state. The Army of China shot workers and students in the heart of the capital, Beijing. It is still graphically remembered by the Australian people and by the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this there has been a wall erected by the nations of the world that has isolated China for more than a year. There have been no ministerial contacts. There has been a cessation of all development assistance to China and, of course, all defence cooperation arrangements. No new proposals for World Bank loans-the Asian development loans-that have been extended to China in the past were being considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives of private businessmen were also greatly reduced because of the political atmosphere, and there was a shattering by these actions of the Chinese Government of the kind of trust and foundation that one expects to enable the greatest taking of opportunities for joint ventures, for trade and so on. We have also observed that there has been a tightening of consumption within China, partly government induced, to beat the inflation that was roaring in 1988 and also because of the anxieties of ordinary Chinese in their consumption patterns. They have been saving money rather than spending it. As a result, we are now not selling as much wool to China. Our trade has decreased. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has the view, and has held this view very successfully, that it is well nigh time for us to open the door of dialogue with China, to go at a senior level to Beijing to meet Ministers and officials and to speak frankly about Australia's attitudes, and at this transition time to have some influence with the developments in China. Following our own discussions with the General Secretary of the Party in China, Jiang Zemin, and the Premier of China, Li Peng, Ministers for education, textiles, foreign affairs and other senior officials, there will be a visit by a delegation of National Party members of parliament this month, and next month there will be another delegation of Liberal members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has taken the initiative to speak frankly to China and to listen carefully to China and to look to not only the very good economic prospects for mutual benefit between our two countries in the future but also the problems which beset us at the moment. This is the initiative that the Opposition has mapped out and it is of a pattern, with all that I have been saying through this speech in response to the Prime Minister's statement, that the Opposition has taken the lead and the Government has followed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), on page 3 of his statement, devotes four paragraphs to the somewhat disturbing events at the South Pacific Forum, but of course without giving the whole story. We could not expect him to give the whole story because he was roundly criticised by our nearest neighbours for the attitude he took over the plan of the United States to incinerate chemicals on Johnston Atoll. In fact, the Prime Minister has been very soundly discredited for his support of United States policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another aspect of the report I want to focus on is that of his suggestion to Japan that it should rearm; in fact, that that country should change clause 9 of its Constitution in order to take a greater share in the global security role. </PARA>
<PARA> In both of these cases the Prime Minister came unstuck because he was serving the United States Government rather than the interests of the Australian people and the interests of other nations in our region. He deserved to come unstuck, to be roundly criticised by our neighbours on both these issues. Other people have criticised him for other things but I will just say a few words about both those issues: Johnston Atoll and the speech in Japan in which the Prime Minister suggested that there should be an increase in military expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the Prime Minister thought that many of the criticisms made about the Johnston Atoll incinerator were unfounded and unnecessary and that useful talks were held in Washington following the Forum. I would like to expand on that a little to give some background information on this very delicate situation of Johnston Atoll, which the South Pacific Forum nations do not want to become a permanent waste dumping ground for chemical weapons; neither do they want to see dangerous technologies used which could have devastating environmental impacts on their region of the world. A newspaper article of 31 August 1990 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Greenpeace toxicologist, Dr Paul Johnston, from London University, said . . . that the risks of contaminants like dioxin entering the local food chain is high. </PARA>
<PARA> `There has never been a plant like this before. It would produce dioxins and hundreds of other uncategorised chemicals,' Dr Johnston said. </PARA>
<PARA> While the US had tried to assure the region that the US can control the emissions from the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agents Disposal System (JACADS), . . . that it is a `triumph of hope over experience'. </PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly, Dr Johnston was speaking before the JACADS unit at Johnston Atoll was closed down twice. The unit has been closed down twice since his warning in August because of unsafe emissions. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . once JACADS becomes operational, the other 95 per cent of US chemical weapons currently stored on the mainland were liable to be transported to the atoll for destruction. </PARA>
<PARA>That is because the primary incinerator for United States chemical weapons on the United States mainland-the one at Tooele Army Depot, 65 kilometres west of Salt Lake City in Utah, where 40 per cent of the army's chemical weapons are stored-has run into a great deal of problems between 1983 and 1987. A further newspaper article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The plant was closed for a year after pipe leaks released a nerve agent into the work area in January 1987. In the worst incident, in February 1985, nerve gas was released up to 75 times the . . . hourly safety limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the releases became available through the Freedom of Information Act. As a result, sites for the eight incinerators the army wants to build near its bases in the US have become the subject of environmental protests. </PARA>
<PARA> No wonder. Who wants to have a chemical incineration plant in their backyard when the record of the existing plant is so flawed with environmental problems. Dr Johnston from Greenpeace went on to say that though the United States has pledged that once the Okinawa and German weapons are destroyed JACADS will be closed down:</PARA>
<PARA>`I don't think they can be trusted. They won't shut it down, they will just keep on using it'. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, when they are putting such a lot of financial resources into developing this JACADS incineration unit on Johnston Atoll, it is very unlikely that, given the dearth of other destruction facilities on the mainland of the United States, they would close down the one that they can operate at Johnston Atoll. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, too, Greenpeace has suggested four other methods of disposal. Sometimes the people who are critical of this United States disposal on Johnston Atoll are reminded that it is a good thing to be getting rid of chemical weapons. Of course, that is the case. We would totally support the elimination of chemical weapons deposits and the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons. However, this is not the only method that could be used. It is the only method going at the moment but, as Dr Johnston says, four other safe methods of destruction could be implemented, and they are as follows: to neutralise the agents with other chemicals; to use an electronic chemical disposal system; to break down the chemicals with the sun's photochemical energy; or to use biological disposal methods. These new technologies, which are not harmful to the environment, could be up and running in 18 months, so that is the way we should be going. The people who are criticising the Johnston Atoll suggestion are not saying that chemical weapons should not be destroyed. Of course we believe they should be destroyed, and as soon as possible, but not at the cost of environmental havoc in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting that the United States documents which have been unearthed by the Herald newspaper in Australia reveal that the European stocks are unlikely to be considered for destruction before the year 2007. This has been the big ploy to get rid of the chemical weapons which have been stored in western Europe but not to destroy them there. If they are so safe, why are they not being destroyed in western Europe or on the United States mainland? It is rather disturbing that these state-of-the-art weapons systems which have been developed by various Western powers are not actually going to be destroyed immediately, but the information that has been obtained from the United States Defense Department suggests that they will be kept in a state of readiness for any particular use that may arise. Since all of this was discovered from the United States Army records, the Gulf crisis has blown up, and the possibility of the use of chemical weapons there cannot be ruled out. Both the United States and Iraq have used chemical weapons before. If this crisis develops into a full-scale military exchange-which I sincerely hope it does not-there is every likelihood that chemical weapons will be used by either Iraq or the United States or both in that conflict. The United States Army document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The European Chemical Stockpile contains the best maintained munitions in the US inventory and as such is considered material not waste. </PARA>
<PARA>Once these materials reach Johnston Atoll the weapons will be held by the Army's active chemical warfare unit, known as the Army Chemical Activity Western Command-a body not only responsible for the storage and disposal of weapons but, as its designation suggests, and as a United States Defense Department document obtained by the Herald which outlines its functions shows, required to:</PARA>
<PARA>assist in the preparation of toxic chemical munitions for shipment in deployment situations and to deliver to the shipping point. </PARA>
<PARA>The case in point that I have just mentioned is the Gulf crisis. So we really have to question the United States Government's repeated assurance that the weapons will be destroyed, and destroyed quickly; that the chemical plant will be shut down and that the Johnston Atoll will not become a permanent repository. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look at what some of the South Pacific Forum members have had to say about this. The Secretary-General of the 15-nation South Pacific Forum, Mr Henry Naisali, spoke at a news conference just after the South Pacific Forum when he compared the incineration project to the Gulf crisis and claimed that Washington classed Pacific Islanders as 'breadfruits and coconuts'. He was indeed very angry with the total disregard that seemed to be shown. The Deputy Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Mr Danny Phillips, was criticising Mr Hawke's position as supporting the United States line that this was a safe disposal, and he said that Mr Hawke's position had been based on prior consultation with Washington. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>He (Mr Hawke) said that we all agree that the destruction of lethal weapons is important for him. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree on that. But we do not think that Johnston Atoll is the right place to do that.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Phillips told ABC radio that Mr Hawke had been too quick to accept the idea of the destruction of this material on Johnston island. He said Mr Hawke had been strongly criticised by the leaders of Nauru and Kiribati during the closed sessions of the Forum. Mr Palmer, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, said that the debate was a real humdinger, so we can imagine what was said in the closed forum. But we have a few more quotes from the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Namaliu, who said at the time, in criticising the Australian position, that it was very unsatisfactory that Australia had provided scientific assessment of this proposal only at the last minute. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>They left it too late, in our view deliberately, so that we weren't given the time to make the assessment of information, and then to ask the right sorts of questions. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In the minds of most of us we suspect very strongly that there is some kind of collusion going on between the United States and Australia, in making sure that this thing was kept to the last minute, and we don't like it. </PARA>
<PARA>Such an approach had created a great deal of suspicion and mistrust. Solomon Islands Deputy Prime Minister Phillips went further, suggesting that Mr Hawke had been two-faced and that Australia's performance raised questions about whether it should be a member of the Forum. That is how strongly some of our Forum partners felt about the role of the Prime Minister on this question at the South Pacific Forum; hardly a victory. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I want to raise is the question of the Prime Minister's speech in Japan when he suggested that the Japanese Government should be taking wider responsibility in global matters, apart from what he said about the United Nations and Japan's role there. That would be an interesting debate, to consider Japan's possible membership of the Security Council, but the really disturbing part of that speech was that he suggested that Japan should increase its military expenditure. Again, we have to ask the question: Whom is he trying to please? We do not have to look very far to find the answer. The United States Government has been trotting out the line of burden-sharing for the last two years. They are under economic constraints in the United States. They do not want to have to foot the bill in the terms that they see it for global security, and why should they be policemen for the whole globe in security matters?</PARA>
<PARA> There are many of us who would rather they did not assume that role for themselves. But as they do assume that role for themselves, they expect their allies to take an increasing part of the financial burden, including Japan, including the Philippines, including Australia, and of course including New Zealand too in this part of the world. So the line of burdensharing has been trotted out by the United States Government, but not very successfully-certainly not in Japan, where clause 9 of their constitution forbids them from spending more than one per cent of their national budget on the military. </PARA>
<PARA> This suggestion from our Prime Minister comes at a time when we need to be encouraging non-military forms of conflict resolution in arms control in the North Pacific. That is what the Prime Minister should have suggested in Japan, but he is openly encouraging the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Japan-which is neither liberal nor democratic-to defy its own peace constitution and allow the deployment of self-defence force troops outside their own territory, which has been unheard of since the Second World War. We should be very thankful for that. Japan already has the third largest military budget in the world, despite its one per cent limit, because of its huge national budget. This is largely geared to anti-submarine warfare and defensive strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hate to think of the impact of Japan acquiring obviously offensive equipment such as nuclear submarines, aircraft carriers, nuclear weapons and long range missiles-all of which it could make quite quickly. The right wing has been chipping away at Article 9 for some years, and the latest move is the proposal to acquire a helicopter carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese hardly need any encouragement from the Australian Prime Minister to undermine their own constitution, but if Mr Hawke encourages Japanese military might, he is opening the door further for these kinds of developments and, of course, for further military exports from Japan, which would be a very unwelcome addition to the Asia-Pacific scene. Anyone who has been to Japan recently knows about the resurgence of the Japanese right, which feels the need to restore its pre-war military might as well as the worship of the Emperor and the promotion of Shintoism. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be supporting progressive forces in Japan who want to maintain the peace constitution, and not encouraging the hawks and the ultra-right, which is exactly what Mr Hawke did. Thankfully, his opposite number, the leader of the Socialist Party in Japan, Ms Takako Doi, told him in no uncertain terms that she did not approve of any extension of Japan's military role. One would think that the Prime Minister would be sensitive to the links with his so-called opposite number in the Socialist Party in Japan and not go there and openly support the ultra-right hawkish conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hate to think what might happen if the Japanese corporations who are lobbying to export military equipment got loose in a region where an arms race is already under way and there are a number of conflicts that could blow up or escalate at any time. If Japanese military exports, especially in the area of defence electronics, are anything like their television sets and cars, the situation could get worse very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also somewhat ridiculous to think that Australia can compete with Japanese military exports in the region. We cannot have it both ways. We want Japan to get involved, but we also want, according to our Defence Department, to have a big slice of the military exports in this region. Of course I oppose that as well. What he should have suggested was a regional effort to promote naval arms control in the North Pacific by putting pressure on the United States of America, which resolutely refuses to contemplate any such proposals. That would have been a much more welcome message that Ms Takako Doi, no doubt, would have been able to endorse. </PARA>
<PARA> So not only does he alienate our friends in the South Pacific by his support for the United States continuing to use the Pacific as a garbage dump for all manner of nasties, but he also manages to alienate our friends in the Japanese Socialist Party, our friends in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), who are not excited about the proposal of Japanese rearmament, and even the Federal Opposition, although I doubt that that worries him very much.</PARA>
<PARA> I need to reiterate the view that I expressed in the chamber a couple of weeks ago, that the Prime Minister's goal is to stay in power with the blessing of the United States administration. He can only stay in power with that support, which he earns by his attitude of subservience to the United States, as exemplified by these two recent episodes, which rightly earned him criticism from our nearest neighbours. </PARA>

<PARA>Clause 58, page 24, lines 2 and 3, omit the clause, substitute the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>``58 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Authority may, by written instrument, delegate to a person all or any of its powers under this or any other Act. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) The powers of the Authority under subsection 40 (1), section 42, subsection 47 (1) and section 56, may be delegated only to a member or officer of the Authority.''.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 58 says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Authority may, by written instrument, delegate to a person all or any of its powers under this or any other Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue of delegation of powers is frequently raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and indeed in its assessment of this Bill it expressed its concern at the unrestricted delegation powers granted to the Authority by Clause 58. To quote directly from the Scrutiny of Bills report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has on numerous occasions pointed out that delegations to a person are inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats concur with that concern. I recognise that the Authority needs to be provided with a certain amount of flexibility in order to ensure that its many and varied tasks can be carried out by the appropriate person. Without this flexibility there would be some very significant costs to both the Authority and to the Australian taxpayer. I am concerned, however, that the delegation of the very broad-ranging powers of the Authority is so unrestricted. </PARA>
<PARA> If we consider the powers contained in clause 10 of the Bill we can see that the Authority has the power:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to enter into contracts; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to join in the formation of companies; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to enter partnerships; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to let on hire plant, machinery, equipment or goods of the Authority not immediately required by the Authority; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) to invest money not immediately required for the purposes of the Authority in any manner that is consistent with sound commercial practice; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) to do anything incidental to any of the powers specified in this subsection or otherwise conferred on the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the very broad scope of these powers, I believe an unrestricted delegation allowance is inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> In trying to draft amendments that would limit the Authority's delegation power, we encountered the same difficulties that the Department of Transport and Communications encountered; that is, that to limit this delegation power without impeding the Authority's flexibility was virtually impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the revised amendment we have circulated is a satisfactory solution to this problem because it in no way reduces the Authority's flexibility but simply identifies those powers which are clearly inappropriate to delegate and limits their delegation to members or officers of the Authority. For example, clause 40 (1) states that the Authority may borrow money otherwise than from the Commonwealth, clause 42 allows the Authority to give security over the whole or part of its assets and clause 56 states that the Authority may engage such consultants as it thinks necessary. It is clear that the exercising of powers provided for in these clauses should be restricted to the Authority. That is what I believe this amendment achieves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, the Opposition supports the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. I wish to raise an issue that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) may be able to give me a couple of answers on. They do not relate to any amendments that we intend to move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister would know, the Opposition was opposed to the formation of a statutory corporation anyway. We believe it will be another quango, so why should we do it? There is a concern in the industry about yet more charges being levied by an organisation which has a monopoly on the service provided. This is fairly relevant because the Minister in charge of this Bill is also responsible for so-called micro-economic reform on the waterfront. When a statutory corporation is set up, certain assets get transferred. There is also a requirement that a user pays concept apply, to which I do not object, and that certain capital be transferred and a profit returned to the Commonwealth. In the information I have from the Australian National Maritime Association, there is a forecast new levy, which would come from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), at a cost to an Australian flag vessel of $8,560. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the details here; it is not appropriate because they relate to matters other than AMSA. But one would expect that, with micro-economic reform, we would have increased efficiency and lower costs per vessel, which are supposed to be for the improvement of productivity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have had an estimate given to me-this includes not only Federal government charges, which are expected to increase by around $50,000 for an Australian flagged vessel of 23,000 gross registered tonnes, but also additional State charges-that additional costs will be $170,000 per vessel. </PARA>

<PARA> I simply indicate to Senator Parer that a major meeting is taking place tomorrow between officers of the Sea Safety Centre, Maritime Operations Division, which will become, after the passage of this legislation, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority or AMSA, and the maritime industry. No doubt this will be the first of a number of meetings held to discuss the level of charges. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of costs to the industry, Senator Parer might be interested to know that, in regard to the achievements that have already been made by this Government in the shipping area, the reductions in crew sizes that have been achieved, largely unheralded, have all been achieved without any industrial disputation, rather than our taking the unions head on and emasculating them, as the Opposition would do. To the great benefit of the industries and shipping sector services in Australia, they were all achieved without any industrial disputation or days lost, currently saving on crew sizes in terms of Australian vessels around $300,000 in operational costs per year. This is the average saving on vessels operated by the Australian National Line. I am happy to pursue the detail of the charges that Senator Parer is talking about and to provide him with an answer no later than tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the Australian Democrats' amendment is concerned, as an indication of the sweet reasonableness that always exists on this side of the chamber, the Government indicates that it is perfectly happy to accept the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My first question relates to the repeated phraseology in the Customs (Detention and Search) Bill that actions be carried out as soon as practicable after the detainee is detained. That appears in subdivisions A, B and C. I am aware of a letter written to the acting shadow Minister for customs by Mr McInnis from the department dealing with the same point involving the phrase `as soon as practicable'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that Mr McInnis makes is one that I have no difficulty in accepting at all, but that seems to relate purely to subdivision C, which is the most important subdivision, under which someone may be detained for an internal body search. In the earlier subdivisions, relating to the frisk search and the external search, the same phraseology appears. </PARA>
<PARA> The case argued by the Australian Customs Service is that the phrase `as soon as practicable' has a meaning under common law. It certainly means that the Service has to proceed. It gives an example of 48 hours as being the maximum sort of period that would be acceptable as a delay. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that for subdivision C the time in practice would be very much less than that; it would be a matter of hours. My concern relates to subdivision A, which provides for a frisk search, and subdivision B, providing for an external search, where the terminology `as soon as practicable after the detainee is detained' appears in the Bill. Could the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) give the Committee some idea as to what sort of time delay is likely to ensue between a Customs officer's deciding that a frisk search or an external search is required and that search being carried out?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly the practice in my home port of Darwin is that this period is very short indeed. The definition of `practicable' or `possible' is not particularly relevant to a court. If there were an inordinate delay in carrying out the search, and if the Customs person involved was not able to give a reasonable explanation of what prevented the search from being carried out, should any action be taken in a court, if it could be clearly demonstrated that it would have been practicable to have done it in a shorter time, the court would deal very harshly with the person concerned. I have had some experience with the question of natural justice, to use that body of law. In fact, it is a rapidly developing area of the law. In my experience courts are inclined to deal very severely indeed with public officers who inconvenience or deal in some other way with a person under an Act where his behaviour is less than professional and where the Act requires him to carry out these procedures with due regard for the person's rights and the person's convenience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wording of that particular phrase `as soon as practicable' means precisely what it says in terms of the simple English meaning of the word; that is the regard that any court in the land would have if there were some delay. If it could be demonstrated in court that it was practicable- that is not a very severe test-for the search to be carried out sooner than it was carried out, the court would deal very firmly indeed with officers who were guilty of not doing so. The answer to the question, in a practical sense, is very soon after a person is detained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I thank the Government. It was remiss of me not to do so when I first spoke on this matter. I regret that I was absent when the second reading was being debated in the Senate; I was overseas at the time. I thank the Government and the Australian Customs Service for accepting some of the amendments I proposed earlier in the year. The requirement that a translator or a card with the text written in the language that is spoken by the detainee be incorporated is a very worthwhile improvement in the first legislation. There are a couple of other minor points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will return to the point that I am seeking clarification on at the moment. I accept what the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) is saying about the phrase `as soon as practicable' and going to a court. I am concerned, though, to see that we do not get into a court because if we get into a court we will have an angry passenger. This is not a frequently used procedure, but prevention is the way to go from a departmental point of view and from an administrative point of view. I am sure that would be the wish of the officers of the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I came through Sydney the other morning. I do not know how many officers manned the barriers-every one was manned. I do not know how many gates there are. There might be 38, 48 or 58, but there was a queue coming back from the barrier of thousands of people. Because of the curfew at Sydney Airport there is often the situation where three or four 747s arrive simultaneously between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock and there is a constant flow of thousands of people who want to get through. In that circumstance, if a passenger is detained for a search, I believe it is quite possible for a Customs officer to argue in good faith that the phrase `as soon as practicable' means as soon as he has finished the immediate task in front of him, which is processing those flows of passengers. If that is not a valid interpretation, I take it that the Minister would be prepared to accept that the phrase `as soon as practicable' could mean forthwith and 'forthwith' would be a directive to the officers to proceed straight away with that examination. The minor search procedures and the maintenance of good relations between the authorities and the passengers or tourists to the country are my points of concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Information about chemicals added to tobacco during manufacture is not available to me.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services is very concerned that the issue of added chemicals in tobacco and cigarettes diverts attention away from the fact that it is chemicals that naturally occur in tobacco which makes cigarette smoking inherently dangerous and which kill 18,000 Australians every year.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council has considered the issue of chemical levels, particularly pesticides which remain as residues in tobacco products. The Council had considerable reservations about setting maximum levels of these substances since this might be taken to imply that tobacco products are safe when, in fact, they are unsafe.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services is unaware of any current legal requirement by any State or Territory Government, under whose jurisdiction this matter would fall, for cigarette manufacturers to divulge such information.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has put in place the Cigarette Testing Program under a voluntary agreement with cigarette manufacturers. That agreement requires manufacturers to reduce over a period of time the levels of those substances which are considered by health experts to pose the greatest risks to health-namely tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. Smokers are informed of the levels of these substances on packages of tobacco products and by the Smoke Yield Table which is produced regularly as a result of the ongoing testing under the program.</PARA>
<PARA> Tar is the particulate matter contained in the smoke inhaled by the smoker. It contains a large number (about 3000) of organic and inorganic chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens (cancer producing substances).</PARA>
<PARA> Nicotine is the potent substance responsible for producing the pharmacological effects of smoking which many smokers find pleasurable and therefore which contribute to the addictive nature of tobacco. It is also implicated in other untoward effects of smoking such as coronary artery disease and reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders.</PARA>
<PARA> Carbon monoxide is a gas present in the smoke of cigarettes and is linked with the propensity of cigarette smoking to cause coronary heart disease.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) To talk of safety standards in relation to smoking is misleading and dangerous. No level of smoking is safe and this is true irrespective of the levels of added chemicals that might be present in cigarettes. It is for this reason that the Government has engaged in a wide range of activities designed to discourage Australians from smoking.</PARA>
<PARA> Through the Cigarette Testing Program mentioned previously, smokers are made aware that smoking exposes them to those chemicals occurring naturally in cigarettes which carry well-established health risks.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, health warnings have been required on all packets of tobacco products since 1987. Following extensive consultations with industry, these warnings were chosen on the basis of their effectiveness in conveying to children and young adults the hazards of smoking.</PARA>
<PARA> To assess whether there is additional value in giving information to smokers about the contents of cigarettes over and above that already made available, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has asked the Department of Community Services and Health to commission a survey of community attitudes on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Minister is seeking detailed technical information from cigarette manufacturers on those chemicals which are contained in tobacco products either as a result of the cultivation and treatment of tobacco crops or as a result of subsequent manufacture of tobacco into finished products.</PARA>
<PARA> These measures will assist the Government to determine whether the provision of information to smokers about added chemicals might represent a viable, additional strategy in its campaign to reduce smoking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government does not know the identity of the bodies discovered in the Mednoe grave. However, Soviet archival material which has recently come to light may help clarify the fate of the more than 15,000 officers of the Polish army and police forces taken prisoner in 1939 by Soviet forces occupying Poland's eastern territories. The prisoners were held in three camps in the Soviet Union, Kozelsk, Starobelsk and Ostashkov.</PARA>
<PARA> According to a report by Soviet historian N. Lebedeva based on an analysis of the archives, the material suggests that over April-May 1940:</PARA>
<PARA> 4,404 men were taken from the Kozelsk camp and handed over to the Smolensk NKVD; the disappearance of the prisoners from Kozelsk and the subsequent discovery in 1943 of over 4,000 bodies in Katyn Wood near Smolensk clearly suggests a linkage.</PARA>
<PARA> 3,891 men were taken from the Starobelsk camp and handed over to the Kharkov Region NKVD; the recently reported discovery in the outskirts of Kharkov in mid June of graves thought to contain the bodies of Polish officers would, if confirmed, conclusively establish the fate of the prisoners from this camp.</PARA>
<PARA> 6,287 men were taken from the Ostashkov camp and handed over to the Kalinin Region NKVD; while preliminary reports are scanty, they suggest that the grave discovered at Mednoe, near Kalinin, may contain the bodies of at least some of the Polish prisoners from the Ostashkov camp.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) On 13 April this year, the Soviet Union acknowledged its responsibility for the Katyn massacre, which an official statement called ``one of the gravest crimes of Stalinism''.</PARA>
<PARA> Following this statement, the Polish Head of State General Jaruzelski visited Katyn Wood to pay tribute to the slain Polish officers. President Gorbachev had earlier handed over to General Jaruzelski copies of archive documents concerning the massacre, and Soviet and Polish historians have since been cooperating in the search for more information, including the location of other graves. While the Australian Government has consistently condemned the Katyn massacre, and the disappearance of the other 11,000 Polish officers, it believes that, in view of the Soviet acceptance of responsibility, and given the willingness of the Polish and Soviet authorities to discuss it openly, the matter is now one for the USSR and Poland to settle, as they are clearly doing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the Honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Income is generally assessed on capital guaranteed approved deposit funds and deferred annuities on an ongoing basis. If the superannuation benefit is compulsorily preserved, or the rollover was made with a Friendly Society before 1 January 1988, income is assessed for the following twelve months when a withdrawal is made. People are not precluded from receiving Social Security benefits because they have money in a rollover fund. However, the rate of benefit payable is calculated using an income test. Income included from rollover funds can, therefore, affect the rate of benefit paid.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Superannuation is savings for retirement. However, it is often possible to access superannuation money before age 65. Where this occurs these payments are assessed as income for pension and benefit purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Where the rollover into a market-linked fund has been made on or after 9 September 1988, income is assessed on an ongoing basis. Rollovers made before 9 September 1988 are assessed only on withdrawal. People are not precluded from receiving Social Security benefits because they have money in a rollover fund. However, as mentioned in answer (2) above, the rate of benefit payable is calculated using an income test.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No; retrenched workers are not forced to rollover superannuation into market-linked funds. The Government acted in the 1988-89 Budget to assess income from both capital guaranteed and market-linked rollover funds in the same way. This removed any incentive for clients to select market-linked or capital guaranteed funds insofar as treatment for Social Security purposes is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Following the Government's 1988-89 Budget changes there is no problem-see the answer to Question 5.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, I am aware of the cooperative efforts of carpet manufacturers and carpet wool growers and the export success resulting from that cooperation. I understand some manufacturers have recently won tenders to supply carpets to large hotel developments in the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) New Zealand is the world's major exporter of carpet wool. The price Australian carpet wool producer cooperatives and the Australian Wool Corporation can offer producers for carpet wool is a reflection of the New Zealand import price. With the increase in the wool tax from 8 per cent in 1989-90 to 18 per cent in 1990-91, and pricing competition from New Zealand imports, producers are not in a position to pass on the cost of the wool tax increase to consumers and will therefore be forced to absorb it in their already slim profit margins. I have been advised that the increased wool tax from 1 July 1990 will result in a contraction in the carpet wool industry as producers make production decisions based on the relative profitability of alternative enterprises. Declining carpet wool production in Australia will be associated with increasing imports of carpet wool.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am concerned at the situation facing carpet wool growers in Australia. At the meeting of Wool Council of Australia (WCA) in Roma a resolution was passed-``to ask the AWC to consider excluding wool that is suitable for carpet manufacture (i.e. wool with a mean fibre diameter equal to or greater than 32 micron which is used in the production of carpet yarn) from the wool Tax Acts''. In response to the WCA resolution and a number of submissions and delegations from the carpet wool industry, I have written to the AWC and WCA seeking their views on this matter and am currently considering their replies. The issue is a complex one with wider implications for wool statutory marketing arrangements.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In the course of informal discussions between Department of Defence and AFP staff on 14 September 1988, a request was made by departmental staff for criminological assistance with the development of the Defence Fraud Control Plan. This was refused.</PARA>
<PARA> The offer to attach two AFP investigators to the Department to review certain Defence contracting procedures was first made in a letter from Senator Tate to the former Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, on 23 November 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> While there is no formal Memorandum of Understanding, the AFP made it a condition of the attachment that the AFP officers not be involved in specific fraud investigations, but rather that they familiarise themselves with Defence procurement processes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Two AFP investigators commenced attachment to the Department on Monday 6 November 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) While I cannot be completely certain as to which Public Servant the Senator is referring, I can say that the officer who is most probably at the centre of the Senator's question, did resign from employment in the Department of Defence. I am unable to say whether he has been re-employed elsewhere in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Public Servant did not make his allegations to the Department of Defence. He made his allegations to Mr Beazley in a letter dated 7 June 1987. The allegations were then passed to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I am not sure as to which documents the Senator is referring. Many departmental audits were completed in 1987 and many of them would have reference to the period 1980 to 1985. Audit papers and reports relating to the Senator's questions 3 and 5 have been provided to the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 May 1990 Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked a question without notice as to whether I was aware that ``although several of the related dependant rebates were increased for the 1989-90 financial year, and all are now indexed annually, no provisions were made in the 1989-90 Federal Budget for an increase in zone allowance?'' The Senator went on to ask ``what action has the Government taken, or will it take, to reverse the diminished value of the zone allowance?''</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> Zone rebates are set at a fixed dollar amount plus a percentage of any dependant rebates to which the taxpayer is entitled, plus notional rebates for children. As from the 1990-91 income year, three separate rates will apply. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> Zone A: $270 + 50% of dependant rebates;</PARA>
<PARA> Zone B: $45 + 20% of dependant rebates; and</PARA>
<PARA> Special Zone A and Special Zone B: $938 + 50% of dependant rebates.</PARA>
<PARA> As the zone rebates are linked to dependant rebates, for taxpayers with dependants the amount of the zone rebate increases with increases in dependant rebates which, commencing in the 1990-91 income year, are indexed annually.</PARA>
<PARA> The level of the base rebates themselves will continue to be monitored as part of the normal budgetary practice.</PARA>
<PARA> An extension of the remote area zone rebate arrangements was announced in the 1990-91 Budget; details are given in Budget Statement 4.</PARA>
<PARA> The zone rebate arrangements provided an estimated $125 million in tax relief in 1989-90 to Australians residing in remote areas.</PARA>
