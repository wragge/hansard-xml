<PARA>N.S.W. 2481.</PARA>
<PARA>15th January, 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> This Petition of a single citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia, begs to draw the attention of the Senate, to the continued inability of Federal, State and Local Governments to meet satisfactory Design, Construction and Maintenance programmes for Highways and Roads throughout the Commonwealth. Due in the main, to an inability to allocate adequate funds to the Highways and Roads, and an inability of all Political Parties to work together towards a common goal. The goal in this instance, being to reduce the number of road deaths on the Highways and Roads of the Commonwealth of Australia to a minimum. The generally acknowledged main contributory factor to these road deaths being the condition of the Highways and Roads.</PARA>
<PARA> This Petitioner does humbly request that all the Members of the Senate read and support in general the attached proposal for a possible solution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> This Petitioner also requests that, in future when Members of the Senate criticise policies or performance of either Party, they present along with their criticism, their solution to the problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now going to enter the second reading debate stage of the debate on the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Civil Aviation Authority Amendment Bill 1990. These are largely housekeeping Bills and the Opposition will not be opposing them. There are some general points we would like to make before we start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My starting point will be the second reading speech of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) for both Bills because in the first paragraph of both speeches, which are largely identical in content, the Minister said that a central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that government business enterprises be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumer needs. The Opposition supports that wholeheartedly, particularly the parts that both organisations be as efficient as possible and responsible to consumer needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of the situation is that the Government does not have the first idea about how it should go about setting up an efficient Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) or Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). Certainly the matter of being responsive to the consumers' needs is something that neither authority has attained at all. One of the great tragedies of the present time is that in a sector that is as vital for Australia's economic welfare and well-being as the transport industry the Government has seen the aviation industry purely as a milking cow. Seven years of Labor Government has seen a massive rundown in the infrastructure, which has got so bad that the Government is now in a panic drive to move and re-establish the radio-navigational aids and the radar surveillance equipment that the airways need. The services from a hardware point of view are very, very badly run down and, concomitant with this, has been a rundown in the morale and the professional competence of the bodies regulating the airways movements in this country, namely, the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA> We do need to regulate air activity. The argument really is about the degree of regulation and the method that is used. This Government broke up the old Department of Aviation and created two new statutory authorities which were allegedly going to be independent: the FAC, to look after government-owned airports and manage them on a private basis; and the Civil Aviation Authority, to regulate the airways and aviation activity in this country. That is fine in theory. In practice what we are dealing with is a statutory authority in each case which largely has monopoly powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not been able to come up with a system which fairly, justly and efficiently provides a system by which these monopolies could operate for the benefit of the community. The Government said to them: `You have to be self-sufficient financially'. That, of course, was one of the reasons why the Government promoted them. It wanted to get the cost of aviation off budget. But in saying to them that they had to pay their own way, the Government failed to recognise that in a monopoly situation there was no pressure in any way at all operating on the authorities to behave in an efficient manner. The consequences of that inefficiency are the very much higher charges which are now borne by people in the aviation industry, users of aviation industry and, of course, ultimately the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put that in simple terms so that everyone can understand: whereas once we had a single management structure running the Department of Aviation, we now have two parallel, bloated bureaucracies. We have two boards: we have a board for the CAA and a board for the FAC. We have headquarters for them. We have all the supporting staff. We have the great train of administrative baggage that moves with two authorities. The point is that they are not operating in distinctly different fields. To a certain degree, their operations are very complementary, one to another, one supporting the airfields, the other doing the air side of it-what is off the ground. The net result has undeniably been a blow-out in costs that affects the whole of the Australian community-not only those people who wish to use aviation services. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great disadvantage of the system is that it has not been accepted by the industry with any favour at all. The aviation industry views with extreme displeasure and disfavour both the FAC and the CAA. The airlines do not care terribly much because they are not affected by it. They are big enough to be a law unto themselves: as the pilots dispute demonstrated last year, whatever the airlines want the airlines get. It was just a phone call to the Minister and the Minister called the Civil Aviation Authority or the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation or the FAC, or whoever it was, and fees were waived, licences were granted or validated, and the airlines had no difficulty at all with the regulatory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> But the airlines are not aviation in Australia. The very great bulk of aviation activity takes place in what is described as the general aviation sector. That is a bad description because it includes so many different forms of activity. The big users of aviation service in this country, the people who fly the overwhelming majority of hours, who have the overwhelming number of aircraft, and all the rest of it, are those air work groups-people operating third level and commuter airlines, charter operators, training schools, training organisations, agricultural aviation and the business aviation group. They are the really big users. If one can find anyone in Australia in those groups who thinks that the FAC or the CAA have been an improvement in the management of aviation in Australia, I would be very surprised. As someone who is involved in the industry and who has been for over 20 years, I know that they are viewed with extreme disfavour because of their unresponsiveness to the needs of the industry and the inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a few examples of what I was talking about before when I said that the business of regulation of the aviation activities in this country was a matter of degree. We are a very regulated country in most ways. We have a huge number of people involved in government: look at the 800-odd local authorities in this country, the six State governments and the Federal Government. All of those legislative bodies produce legislation. It should not be any surprise that aviation is greatly over-regulated. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the easy examples to demonstrate in public is the way the Australian Civil Aviation Authority and its predecessors have demanded, as of right, that any new aircraft introduced into this country has to pass their own certification. It does not matter that certification is something that costs millions and millions of dollars, in the case of a regular public transport passenger aircraft that might involve six months or even a year's testing. It does not matter that this is done with great thoroughness and great sophistication by the American regulatory authorities or the British civil air registration groups or the European groups. All that stands for nought if someone wants to introduce a new aircraft into Australia. The operator of that aircraft has to go to the delay and the trouble and the huge expense of certifying it for Australian use. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite many appeals from the industry, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Government have turned a completely blind eye to this until the recent past. There is a glimmer of hope on the horizon that at last we will accept the professional credentials of certifying authorities in overseas countries. I hope we do. But the real question to be asked of the Government and of the Civil Aviation Authority is: Why has this nonsense been allowed to continue all these years since the Wright brothers first flew-at great cost, not to the airlines themselves, but to everyone in Australia? That cost of registration flows through the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other problems we have with the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation is that this Government has messed around with the administration for so long that the old corporate ethos, which was very strong in the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), has now disappeared. When I started flying, people were very proud to be members of the old DCA. In those days they had a great pride in their work. They knew that they were part of a regulatory authority whose professional credentials were recognised and respected around the world. They knew that the people at the top-whether it was Sir Richard Williams or Sir Donald Anderson-were practical airmen, great airmen in their own right, and that all the senior personnel in the Department knew what aviation was about. With all the changes that have taken place, starting with the Whitlam Government changing the title and the function of the Department and carried on by the Hawke Labor Government, the whole of the corporate spirit and that ethos-that pride in their being, the knowledge that they were doing an essential task and knowing what that task was-have disappeared from the aviation scene. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mean to be unkind to any of them-most of the senior executives of the CAA are charming people, very honest and hardworking and all the rest of it-but the sad fact is that one has to go down about three or four levels in the management structure before one finds anyone who has any real knowledge of what aviation is about. None of the divisional heads has ever earned a living flying or owning or maintaining aircraft. They are quite remote from it, and we have seen many nonsenses from this. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the important things the CAA does in a minor way is to publish a journal on air safety. To my knowledge, that has been going for about 40 years since the early 1950s. The purpose of this magazine, which comes out about six times a year, is to look at accidents and incidents in aviation and to draw lessons from them for the education of people in the industry. One of the attributes of this publication has been its extreme accuracy. Within the last 12 months, one of the articles in that journal was absolutely breathtaking in its ignorance. It talked about how the operator of an aircraft had a problem which was related to electrical supply and it confused the magneto switches, which provide the ignition service to a reciprocating petrol engine, with the master switch providing the electrical services. It may be hard for the Senate to understand the significance of that, but it is equivalent in theological terms to confusing the devil with God. It is absolutely unbelievable that that should happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Then a prohibition was issued that affected the Antique Aircraft Association, which is now very strong in Australia. It said that any aircraft engine that had not been subjected to a major overhaul within the last 15 years had to be withdrawn from service on safety grounds. Again, that is absolute nonsense. Most of the aircraft in that category fly only 10 or 15 or probably no more than 30 hours a year. They are very well looked after and they are kept under cover. To subject them to a major engine overhaul for which the expertise may be difficult to obtain in this country, purely because of the expiration of time rather than because of hours flown, which is the basic way of assessing engine life, is absolute nonsense. The important point is that no-one in the Civil Aviation Authority before that air navigation order was promulgated talked to anyone in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is hope on the horizon. The new Chairman of the CAA is Mr Dick Smith, who made a great name for himself protesting about the sort of nonsense in the administration of the CAA that has occurred in the immediate past. Indeed, he wrote a book which received a great deal of publicity at the time, called Two Years in the Aviation Hall of Doom. The trouble is that the aviation hall of doom is still in existence. I hope that Mr Dick Smith has the ability to clean up the Augean stables of overregulation in that industry, because they still exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Several weeks ago, by courtesy of Senator Robert Ray, I was on the lead aircraft, an Air Force C130, flying into Longreach on flood relief missions. When we flew into Longreach the C130 landed on the sealed runway, which is 5,000 feet long. Because there had been a lot of rain, the aircraft was kept on the runway. It was not taken onto the taxiway and on to the apron. Because an aeroplane was on the runway, the Civil Aviation Authority closed Longreach Airport. While the aircraft was unloaded, which was a lengthy process which took about 2 3/4 to three hours, there were four aircraft in orbit over the field, unable to land. It was bureaucracy gone mad. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we were in an emergency, in a flood situation. We were in a remote part of Queensland, and we had a prohibition from a Civil Aviation Authority which was hundreds or thousands of miles away from the scene of the action. Those aircraft could have landed with absolute safety because behind the C130 was 4,900 feet of sealed runway. I know that two of the aircraft were Cessna 172s which probably required no more than 600 feet in order to come to rest. One of the pilots was a very experienced charter operator who I know could quite safely have landed at that airport at the time, without compromising the safety of the C130 in any way. Illustrating the nonsense of the prohibition on civil aircraft landing was the fact that an Air Force Caribou came in and landed on the runway behind the C130. The whole of the airport was paralysed purely because of the inflexibility of an uncaring regulatory body. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other prospects for improvement that is on the horizon, though, is the report by Mr Owen Lawrie, which I have not yet been privileged to read. Mr Lawrie, an experienced engineer, was regional director in Queensland before he retired. The Lawrie report is into the degree of activity and involvement of the Civil Aviation Authority. I hope that Mr Lawrie's report is a cleansing operation with respect to the regulatory functions of this body, because it certainly needs it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, that is not to say that there is not a need for regulation. When people are flying for hire and reward they have to meet standards. But there are many people flying for recreation or for personal business reasons who do not need the same regulations that Qantas, Ansett or Australian Airlines need. Those people are grossly overregulated and suffer very great costs and limitations on their activities as a consequence. That is quite unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Bill itself. The Opposition is not opposed to the Bill and I wish to make only a few points in relation to it. The first part of the Bill deals with a freedom being granted to the Civil Aviation Authority with respect to certain State and Territory laws, which is unexceptionable. There is another section on negligent operation of aircraft, which again is eminently reasonable. The difficulty I have with that section is purely one of definition, because what may appear to be dangerous to someone else, in the eyes of an informed airman or operator may be safe. It is a matter of experience, capability and skill. While the Opposition supports the incorporation in the Act of the requirement to operate aircraft safely without hazarding life or property, we can see difficulties in definition when it is put to the test. </PARA>
<PARA> A very large section in the Bill deals with the carriage of dangerous goods and, given the way that aviation or air freight moves so many products, it is absolutely essential that the carrier knows what is in them, because a lot of people who consign goods have no knowledge of the effect of those goods if they leak or if they emit gases in an aircraft, and whether they are packed under pressure in aerosol packs and all sorts of things like that. We support very much a declaration of the contents of the goods and a definition of what is dangerous and not dangerous to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> A section of the Bill modifies the granting of air operators' certificates, which is something that we could talk about at great length. The only point I wish to make about that is that last year in the pilots dispute the Civil Aviation Authority could not issue air operators' certificates fast enough at the airline companies' request. Formerly, if one wanted an airline operator's certificate, like Mr Ellis in Tasmania, one had to be prepared to wait many months or years and face the possibility of total rejection, of getting nowhere if one wanted a licence to operate an airline. I hope that the changes that the Civil Aviation Authority adopted on granting certificates to the friends of Sir Peter Abeles and Australian Airlines are carried on efficiently, because if someone wants to get into business, if they meet the requirements of the Department, they should be granted the licence to operate straight off. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change deals with the composition of the board, its powers and duties, and the most significant part of that is that it takes the employees of the Civil Aviation Authority out of the Public Service Act. One of the great bones of contention between the CAA and the FAC has been that the FAC employees are allowed to operate under terms and conditions set by the board of the FAC whereas the CAA employees, who are allegedly employees of an independent statutory authority, had to conform to the Public Service Act. In regard to airworthiness surveyors and aircraft engineers, who are in very, very short supply because of the policies of the Government in this country and who can earn far more from overseas airlines or in private enterprise maintenance companies, it was very difficult for the Civil Aviation Authority, for example, to get people to make sure that airworthiness standards were being met with respect to maintenance and engineering. I would hope that, moving out of the Public Service restrictions into a system where the board has the power to set the terms and conditions of its employees, the CAA will be able to meet the market and attract the people that it needs to do the specialised job. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a requirement that the CAA revalues its assets every five years, which again is a way of the Government squeezing more and more out of the community, because the revaluation of assets is an artificial way by which the Government can demand that the CAA shows a greater return on its investments, which, by the way, the Australian taxpayer bought and paid for generations ago and which, with a typical Keating sleight of hand, were transferred and actually sold to the new CAA. Also, the tax exemptions that the CAA formerly enjoyed have gone. </PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the Bill deals with the imposition of liens. The Opposition is very strongly opposed to the power of the Civil Aviation Authority to impose a lien, in other words, to seize an aircraft when a payment has not been made to the Civil Aviation Authority. We will not oppose this through an amendment but we want to bring public attention to the Department's unfairness here. The problem arises because a lot of the arguments about fees paid by the CAA arise through the accounting incompetence of the Authority itself. </PARA>
<PARA> When this system was first introduced there were charges known as air navigation charges. People who owned an aircraft or operated one had to pay a registration fee which ran into hundreds or thousands of dollars. If they did not pay the fee, the old Department argued that it should be allowed to seize the aircraft and sell it for payment of those fees, which could mount up to quite a large amount. Air navigation charges no longer exist and the charges that are made are en route charges for flights made. It is a well-established fact of life that the accounting systems in the CAA are not accurate. People are being billed for accounts that they did not generate and there is great argument among various operators in the industry as to just what the account is about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority has taken a high-handed attitude, and if the bill has not been paid six months after presentation, the Authority seizes the aircraft and deprives the operator of his livelihood. Our argument is that there are parallels in all other forms of business with respect to payments of accounts, and those are the parallels of resolution before the courts, which the Civil Aviation Authority should follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill 1990. Again it starts with the pious hope that the government business enterprises be as efficient as possible and responsible to consumer needs. In relation to the latter part, all of the surveys that have been done in the aviation industry show that the FAC is held in even worse regard than the Civil Aviation Authority. That really is some achievement. It is held in bad regard because it is not in the least responsive to the consumers' needs. It is not interested and does not know anything about the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides a number of significant changes. One of the minor points at the start of it that interested me was the deletion of the requirement that the FAC should cooperate to the extent required with the Department of Civil Aviation. It is no secret at all that, whatever relationships might exist at board level between the CAA and the FAC, it is open war on many of the airfields around Australia where they both operate. The CAA treats the FAC with absolute contempt and that is reciprocated by the FAC. For the users of the airfields and people involved in the industry that friction is not at all helpful. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the Bill removes the anti-hijack limitations on the Federal Airports Corporation. It is essential that, as the operator of the real estate, it is involved in security planning. The record of the FAC has not been too good in this. In my previous responsibility as shadow Minister for Customs, I saw many problems, particularly with Sydney Airport, where the FAC would not cooperate with the Australian Customs Service on the creation of secure areas and the passage of individuals between them. Those problems now have been largely overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that have taken place in the CAA board are largely paralleled in the FAC Bill, with the exception that its employees, of course, are employed under terms and conditions set by their board. The exemption from taxation and sales tax has also been removed and in both cases in both Bills the charges set by the authorities have been subjected to Prices Surveillance Authority oversight. </PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the Federal Airports Corporation Bill gives the Corporation an exclusion from the Freedom of Information Act, which we think is quite wrong in view of the fact that it has a monopoly position. Overall, the Opposition supports these Bills. Both authorities will become a little more efficient if the boards of the authorities have the skills to exploit the opportunities that are offered to them by these changes. In the case of the FAC, the Bill will also help to create a climate where it will be easier for us either to remove or privatise the FAC when we get into government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Mr Deputy President, I wish to confine my remarks to the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1990, referring specifically to clause 4, relating to standards, and clause 47, the regulations. I shall deal particularly with standards and what is the appropriate standard to be applied as a safety factor in updating the position of aircraft. Now, I note with some interest the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure into the organisation and operations of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority, and particularly the following comments in relation to the CAA, the Minister and the Department with regard to the responsibilities of this Authority:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . in the context of streamlining the Department of Aviation . . . decided . . . to create the CAA . . . in addition to the setting of safety standards and having day to day regulatory control of aviation, the Authority would have `. . . operational responsibility for air traffic control, flight advisory services, communications, navigation and surveillance systems, and rescue and fire fighting services at airports'. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislative functions of the CAA require it to establish and administer an appropriate safety regulatory framework within which relevant civil air operations shall be conducted; and, secondly, to operate an effective and efficient system of air traffic services to maintain a high level of safety for all airspace users. Now, it is this latter function with which I wish to take some issue. In so doing, I refer to an ABC 7.30 Report screened on 25 May 1989, almost a year ago, when attention was drawn to Australia's air traffic control crisis. The 7.30 Report concerned itself with the $2.4m French air traffic control autonomous radar display system, more commonly known as ACARDS. Originally this system was ordered in 1980 but it was not delivered unil 1984. Housing to accommodate the system was not completed until 1986, and then it took a further three years to get it going, a total of nine years, by which time, of course, the system was outmoded. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole story is just a saga of botch-up after botch-up, though perhaps the blame should not be laid at the feet of the CAA, since it became operative only on 1 July 1988; or maybe the CAA was formed so that the Government could have a scapegoat, someone else to blame for this gross bungle. If the personnel previously in the Aviation Department involved in the ACARDS mess were transferred to the newly formed CAA, it is no wonder that few, if any, positive comments were made to the Senate Standing Committee with regard to its performance. I think this was certainly some indictment of that report. At the time of reporting, the ABC mentioned the number of near misses which had been recorded and the 2,000 reported mishaps, an average of perhaps five mishaps a day. To replace the whole system would take three years or, if history repeated itself, perhaps nine years. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent weeks I have had cause to travel to Canberra on a number of occasions and each time my flight from Launceston to Melbourne has been put into a holding pattern over Wonthaggi. This holding pattern has been maintained for a minimum of 20 and extending up to perhaps 40 minutes, and consequently my connecting flights to Canberra were missed. My first inclination, naturally, was to blame the airlines for poor timetabling. However, this week I again had cause to fly to Canberra and to have my flight again put into a holding pattern over Wonthaggi. I inquired of the cabin crew as to the reason for this continual holding pattern occurrence. To my absolute horror, they informed me that air traffic control had updated its systems so that a computer printout of a plane's position was now given every four minutes instead of the previous 30 seconds. So much for being updated. Obviously, something must really be wrong, and I seek clarification. There must be some misinformation. If not, I ask the Minister to look into it as a matter of some urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, I was absolutely horrified at this piece of information. How many variables can occur in what I consider to be an interminable four minutes? How many kilometres do various planes cover in four minutes? How many seconds does it take one plane to get into the flight path of another, thus allowing the potential for two planes to collide? I am sure that anybody hearing of this situation would concur with me that the Civil Aviation Authority is not adequately carrying out its legislative functions, and particularly that which requires it to operate an efficient and effective system of air traffic services, to maintain a high level of safety for all airspace users. </PARA>
<PARA> I apologise for taking up some valuable debating time at the start of what could well be a marathon effort for the Senate during this sitting period. However, while this matter is not directly addressed in this amendment Bill, I have referred to the appropriate clauses. I believe it is important and that attention should be drawn to this matter. I ask for clarification from the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of legislation is, as the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) points out in his second reading speech, in the case of the aviation industry the final step in the commercialisation of government business enterprises in that area. The second reading speech of the Minister goes on to say that this commercialisation is `a necessary and fundamental precondition to improvements in efficiency'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout the range of legislation which has come before this Parliament with regard to the commercialisation of government business enterprises, the turning of government authorities into business enterprises, on all occasions the Australian Democrats have expressed the view that that statement which I just quoted is not necessarily the case, that it does not necessarily follow that commercialisation ipso facto equals improvement in efficiency. As I wander through the commercial sector of the city of Melbourne, of which I am an inhabitant, any lunchtime I see bulging restaurants, in spite of the implementation of the fringe benefits tax, which caused me to question the efficiency of many of the commercial enterprises that operate in that city. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill and the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill cause us great concern, and I pick up Senator Watson's point: while claims are made by the Government in the second reading speeches on both of these Bills that consumers will benefit, we are concerned about what those benefits will be, particularly as there is great emphasis in this commercialisation on the need for the Civil Aviation Authority and the Airports Corporation to be profitable and, indeed, the expectation that they will be, which is shown by the removal of tax exemptions. That expectation seems to us to be at least potentially in conflict with any expectation of reduction in costs to consumers and-the point of most concern-potential reductions in the priority given to safety issues. We see a great deal of potential for conflict between the goals of a commercial organisation expected to make a profit and pay taxes and the goals of organisations which have oversight of our air travellers on matters of safety. Senator Watson has expressed some concerns about that, and those are concerns that we share. </PARA>
<PARA> As in this whole debate about commercialisation, we have questioned whether this is the way to go. We would also say that, if profit is to be made, then it is not necessarily the case that that could not be ploughed back into these government business enterprises or, indeed, into the authorities as they have previously been constituted. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to clause 4 of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill to demonstrate one of our concerns about the actual wording in the legislation. Paragraph (b) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>consistent with the Authority's obligations under section 11</PARA>
<PARA>and, even having regard to those obligations under section 11, we are concerned with the following wording-</PARA>
<PARA>have regard to any costs that would arise from complying with the standards. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of terminology gives rise to our concern about what is to be the priority in this new business enterprise-safety standards or costs. We would have welcomed wording which gave us more comfort that the standards would remain the highest of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that these Bills really just take the process to its completion, and therefore we will not be going to the wall kicking and screaming and will not call for a division in opposition to it. However, I am expressing our opposition to this whole process of which these Bills are a part. Of course, there other aspects to both these Bills we see as positive, including the ability under the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill for anti-terrorist activity to be undertaken, but one of the areas in both Bills about which we are concerned is the removal of Public Service Act coverage of the employees. We have been consistent across this whole package of government business enterprise Bills in that we do not necessarily believe that the only way to get flexibility and performance out of people who are currently public servants is to remove their Public Service coverage. As I said, we often question whether a businesslike approach is always the most efficient method when we look at the way many private businesses operate, but what we do say here is that we insist that the removal of Public Service Act coverage must not disadvantage workers in this industry. As I say, we reject the assumption that it is not possible for flexibility to be involved while Public Service Act coverage exists. In fact, I believe that must be a goal for all of us with regard to the Public Service, because, no matter how much more of this sort of legislation there is, we will always have a Public Service and we must be able to have flexibility within it. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly agree with the area of the operation of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA), but I would like to stress some of the aspects of the recommendations contained in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled the Organisation and Operations of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority. Chapter 5 emphasises and calls for extensive consultation between those authorities and the industry. We strongly support those recommendations and urge the authorities to take note of them as well as the reference to decisions of all kinds, including decisions about costs and charges, which are dealt with in this section of the legislation with regard to the PSA. We hope that those consultations will take place and that they are a major feature of the continuing operations of these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of concerns have been expressed in this whole area. What I think we are really saying is that we are concerned that pressures arising from the commercial objective that has now been set for the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation will cause increases in costs and charges that will find their way through to the consumer. We acknowledge, as the Minister said in his second reading speech on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, that the consumer is not just the person flying; this industry produces intermediate inputs into the rest of the economy. We believe that this commercial pressure could be a problem in that area. I quote Mr Peter Petroni, the President of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, writing in the April 1990 edition of that Association's journal:</PARA>
<PARA>The CAA's proposed safety regulatory charges for 1990-91 represent the area of greatest concern. Increases of 100 per cent are common for many of the 168 major items. Mr Owen Lawry, former Queensland Regional Director, was engaged as consultant to the CAA to review safety regulatory charges and stated in his draft recommendation that he considered that many of the services provided by the CAA were either unnecessary or could be better provided by industry. Mr Lawry's recommendations must be fully explored before any changes are made to the charging arrangements. Due to the current economic climate, I believe we should have a moratorium of price increases until all other alternatives are investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the assumptions behind this kind of legislation coming from the Government, and strongly endorsed by the Opposition, as we have heard from Senator MacGibbon-endorsed, as all legislation in these packages has been, because it does pave the way for future privatisation of these kinds of government enterprises by a future coalition government, which was a point made by Senator MacGibbon at the end of his speech-is that this is the only way to go. That needs to be questioned. I quote the Australian Institute of Navigation, just to make a very important point:</PARA>
<PARA>While the CAA does not borrow overseas directly, there is a long delay on much needed capital works. The system needs money, but that money must ultimately come from the air traveller because the Government has decreed that aviation, alone of all the public transport systems, must pay for all of its infrastructure costs. Shipping, rail, trucking and coach transportation are heavily subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an important point that we want to make in speaking to these two Bills. As the Institute of Navigation has pointed out, we really cannot see why the financial base of the air transport industry cannot be seen as a community responsibility in the same way as it is in other areas of transportation, particularly as-and here I go back to part of the remarks of Senator Watson-priority does need to be, and must be, safety, and, if it is, there is clearly a community responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the thrust of this legislation and the future intentions of the Opposition should it find itself in government, clearly the key goal would be profitability and commercial success. That is a matter of enormous concern to the Democrats. However, we note the comments of the new Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Dick Smith, when he stated in Australian Aviation in May this year:</PARA>
<PARA>My aim is to improve the level of travelling safety by getting as many people into the air as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Smith's stated goals-which the Democrats share-are safety and access to air travel for as many Australians as possible. We certainly wish the Chairman well in achieving those goals, and we hope that our concerns about the questions of priorities will be considered constantly in the ongoing work of the two Authorities which, as we say, we are concerned are perhaps being set off in directions which may be in conflict with at least, in particular, the goal of guaranteed safety and what has been, until now, an extraordinarily well performing industry in this country in an international sense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators for their positive contribution to this debate. I want to refer briefly to a number of comments made, in particular, by Senator Watson and Senator Powell, regarding the prime responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in respect of safety. In relation to Senator MacGibbon's contribution to the debate, he knows full well that I have general agreement with his approach to regulation. I hope that over the term of this Government, that general agreement with the approach he has to regulation will become more and more obvious in terms of the way in which the CAA operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon also spoke about the sections of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill dealing with carriage of dangerous goods. I know that the operators of both of Australia's major airlines are becoming increasingly concerned about the problems that could be posed for safety by this very matter-that is, the carriage of dangerous goods. I recall only last year-and I point this out to the frequent fliers in this chamber-an incident involving a Boeing 727 aircraft which caused me to sharpen up in respect of the carriage of dangerous goods. We all know, we frequent fliers, that there is a prohibition on the carriage of matches in luggage on board aircraft. Like a lot of other people who spend half their life living in motels, I had a fairly healthy collection of matchbooks from various motels laying around in the bottom of my suitcase because it was a handy way to keep the telephone numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an incident last year when a suitcase on board an aircraft containing a box of these matchs ignited and the aircraft was delayed. In fact, I was on board the flight. The aircraft was delayed for some hours at Adelaide airport, because when the hatches on the luggage compartment of the aircraft were opened the sight that greeted the eyes of the ground staff was not very healthy. Smoke was pouring out of the aircraft. Indeed, the entire internal contents of the suitcase had been combusted. Of course, aircraft holds, as Senator MacGibbon knows, are specifically designed to be particularly airtight to contain that kind of problem if it should occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure all honourable senators that my suitcase was cleaned out the minute I arrived in Darwin and that I will not make the mistake of throwing matchbooks into my suitcase again. That is just one example of why those sensible regulations do apply to things as simple as books of matches being carried on board aircraft. They can potentially cause air disasters leading to great loss of life. I know that the airlines are increasingly concerned about highlighting to a greater degree what is becoming an increasing problem on aircraft: the quite often innocent carriage of dangerous goods on board aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon also addressed one of the major thrusts of both the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill and the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill: the ability that it will give to both the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) in the recruitment of their staff. I consider that to be an extremely important objective of this legislation which in the future will lead to more efficient operation in both of those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I confess I do not understand Senator MacGibbon's comment on the sleight of hand, as he referred to it, of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in transferring expensive public assets to the FAC and the CAA, which are of course both government business enterprises, wholly government owned. I am not quite sure whom Senator MacGibbon thinks the Government should give them to. Nevertheless, I thank him for what was a positive contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson's concerns about the air traffic control autonomous radar display system as well founded. I have similar concerns about the efficient operation of that system. I will pursue a detailed technical response to Senator Watson's concerns and relay it to him as soon as I am able to-hopefully, later this week. </PARA>
<PARA> The one substantial matter raised by speakers during the debate that I want finally to address myself to is the question about the concerns of commercialisation of the operations of the CAA and any possible impact that might have on safety. I can assure all honourable senators that the primary responsibility of the CAA is, as it always has been, safety. However, having said that, I would like to say that I agree completely with the comments that have been made by a number of people-most notable among them the Chairman of the CAA, Dick Smith. A great myth has been perpetuated in this country that there is no cost consideration that can ever be or has ever been applied to safety. I know Senator MacGibbon will agree with me when I say Dick Smith is perfectly correct in saying that that is a myth. That has never been the case in Australia because there are always finite limits to resources. </PARA>
<PARA> As Dick Smith has said quite properly, if safety were the prime consideration without any regard to cost, we would insist that all aircraft were four-engined because that is demonstrably safer than having three engines, which is demonstrably safer than having two, which is certainly demonstrably safer than having one. Instrument landing systems would be installed in every airport in Australia, we would have coast to coast radar, and the sky would be the limit. That has never been the case and never will be the case in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I simply wish to reassert that, so far as the CAA, the individual officers who staff the CAA and the Government are concerned, the primary consideration of the organisation is, and will remain, safety. However, consistent with Dick Smith's approach, we sensibly acknowledge that we should be trying to get more passengers safely into the air. Otherwise, as Dick Smith is fond of saying, the only person safe to fly will be Kerry Packer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) why the exclusion was granted under schedule 2 of the Freedom of Information Act against the commercial determinations of the Federal Airports Corporation. It would seem to me that the public interest demands here that, in a monopoly situation, it be proper for the public to have access to information as to how the Federal Airports Corporation arrived at the charges. That is very important because the Federal Airports Corporation is a new body and operating in an entirely new field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The overall concept is very simple. What the Government said to the Federal Airports Corporation was that there were a number of fields around the country that the FAC had responsibility for and that it could earn what money it could from the assets it had so that it could pay for its administration costs. That was something that had never been done before in the country. The FAC immediately went out and bought new offices, new typewriters, new word processors and new cars. The officers paid themselves very high salaries-several times what they were being paid under the old Department of Transport and Communications-and they generated a whole host of expenses. Then they had to get income from everything that it was possible to find. The first thing these people did was to increase rental on hangars. </PARA>
<PARA> That might sound reasonable enough, but there are people who do not think so. I declare a personal interest on this. I would not want to mislead the Parliament or the Senate on it. Something like eight years ago I was part of a group who went into partnership, formed a company and built a hangar so we could hangar our aircraft. There is a very big capital expense involved in building a hangar. Building a hangar is not like building a garage and the old Department of Civil Aviation defined the most extraordinarily stringent structural requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in our case we had to cope with wind strengths up to either 140 or 160 miles per hour, velocities which had never been attained on the airfield on which the hangar was built. The result of that was that we had to overbuild the structure at vast cost. We assessed all of this before we went ahead and we decided, on all the information that was available, that we were prepared to undertake the financial charges which included the construction cost, the rental cost and the fact that we had a lease that ran for only 10 or 15 years; I forget what it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that a number of people in this country have made financial commitments after exhaustive examination of the best information they could get at the time. Then along came the FAC which said, `That doesn't matter, we are just going to set our own rules here and your rental is going to go up by so much'. We have seen rises of several hundred per cent in a lot of the services that are now provided on airfields. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only have we had increased rentals for hangars, we have also had things like the GAIT scheme, the general aviation infrastructure tariff, which is a tax placed on aircraft using FAC fields. We have seen people who are on airfields being subjected to increased charges. I have instanced the case in the Senate before of an electronics maintenance engineer who got billed for $500 or a thousand dollars or something to have a licence to enter the airfield. He used no facilities on the airfield at all. He used to drive on in a van which held all his electronic test equipment. Most of the items of electronic equipment, radio navaids in aircraft and things like that, are easily demountable. They are in black boxes, easily removed. This man did most of the work at home, but because he provided a service and that service involved his being on the airfield for a few hours a day the Federal Airports Corporation field charged him for a licence to operate on the field. </PARA>
<PARA> There was the famous case in Adelaide where the FAC tried to hang a very heavy tax on taxi drivers picking up passengers at Adelaide Airport. The FAC has turned its mind to every avenue, whether practical or impractical, to raise money from the airports over which it has control. The fact that there is no precedent here-there is no established pattern of 15, 20 or 40 years of these charges being in place-reinforces the case that I am trying to make: there is a very real need in the public interest for the FAC to be able to show to the public how it arrived at those charges, that it is not standing up like a latter day bushranging operation on a stand and deliver basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that, in view of all the Government's statements about accountability and the rest of it, the provision in this Bill that the decisions relating to charges be excluded from freedom of information is something that really needs some explaining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon knows full well as an experienced senator that these organisations are not able to behave like bushrangers and not stand up to intense public and parliamentary scrutiny of their financial operations. It is a nonsense to even suggest that they can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be taking a commercial approach to its charges. In a general sense and with some exceptions I think the approach that the people who use the system and get the benefit of it should pay a fair cost for that system is not an unreasonable one. Because it will operate on a commercial basis, the CAA is going to have to enter into its charging regime in a commercial way. It will also have to have access to highly sensitive commercially confidential information from its customers. For that very sensible reason it is not appropriate that that information be made readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that and supporting, of course, the necessity to exempt the CAA from that provision, I point out that it is not correct to suggest that these organisations as a result of this exemption are not subject to very intensive scrutiny. I know that through the avenues that are available through this Parliament Senator MacGibbon himself will no doubt give an intense scrutiny to everything both the CAA and the FAC do. Both of these organisations have to produce corporate plans which they have to make available to me. As a result of that they are then open to full parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The organisations are also subject to the intense scrutiny-and I must say from my own experience often very effective scrutiny-of Senate Estimates committees. Their operations will also be exposed to the full examination of the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has raised several points there. First, as to the scrutiny in a Senate Estimates committee, I am not aware that the FAC or the CAA now appear. Unless there is an entry in the accounts that gives them money in some way or other, we simply cannot get them before us. I would be delighted to have the opportunity to question them on their financial operations before Senate Estimates committees and I hope that they do appear. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that if they do not appear at Senate committees I will move a motion that certain statutory authorities be required to appear before the Parliament. I am not thinking only of those two bodies. A number of statutory authorities should properly be subjected to parliamentary surveillance, but have not been. But that is a bit of a side issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to get into a debate on the user pays concept because my views on that are well known. Senator Powell has gone now, of course; if she were in the chamber a bit more and had been here a bit longer she would have realised that the user pays concept is something I have spoken at very great length on in the past. I believe that the community derives a great deal of benefit from aviation. Senator Powell picked up what I have said on numerous occasions in the chamber: the aviation industry is the only industry that is required to fund itself entirely, whereas all other forms of transport-and indeed other services like medicine, health services, and education-are very heavily subsidised. The community does derive a benefit from aviation but I will put that aside for another day. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the points in relation to the user pays concept is that there is no consultation between the FAC and the clients. At Archerfield airport recently there were a number of incidents which related to security. Some property was stolen. I do not know the exact details of it, but as a partner in this company that owns a hangar on the airport, I do know we were presented out of the blue with a requirement that we pay $400 a year for a security surveillance system for the airport. There was no consultation with us, as tenants, in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The anomalous thing about it is that we have a hangar, like all the others on the field, that will withstand a 160 mile an hour wind. It is locked and bolted and it is not easy to break into. The thefts and the rest of it that took place took place from aircraft that were tied down on the field. The FAC wanted to charge us-we who had spent our own money in meeting security requirements for another reason-$400 a year each for the maintenance of security, but the people who were outside, who were the ones being subjected to the security risk, were going to pay nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> When we asked the FAC why it was not taxing the people on the tiedowns who need the protection it said, `Oh, it's all too hard. It's much easier to get into you because we know who you are'. I do not believe that is a responsible attitude. Maybe it is not bushranging, but it is the first thing to it. I cannot find out officially how the FAC in Brisbane arrived at the decision to charge those of us who own hangars on the place $400 a year each. That is the reason why I am asking the Minister why these organisations have this exclusion under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate turns now to debate the Government's amendment to the export market development grants (EMDG) scheme. This scheme provides financial support to Australia's manufacturing exports. The scheme is due to expire on 30 June 1990, only a few weeks away. This scheme has been subject to considerable review-it was reviewed in 1978 and again in 1982-by the Industries Assistance Commission; in 1985 by a committee known as the Ferris committee; in 1988 by both Price Waterhouse and the Bureau of Industry Economics; and, finally, it was reviewed by a committee chaired by Professor Helen Hughes, a review which was announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on 11 December 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The so-called Hughes report is an excellent document. It deals superbly with the problems of Australian manufacturers and it identifies the urgent need for reforms to be effected not just to the EMDG scheme but to the Australian economy. That is the main purpose of the Hughes report. The problem with Australian exporters, or manufacturing exporters, is the Australian economy. I will come to that in the course of my speech. On 28 August 1989 Senator Button announced that he had received the Hughes report. I want to turn to the Minister's press release of 28 August 1989 when he said he had received the report, because he said something else which I think was very significant. Remember the date: 28 August last year. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will consider the Committee's recommendations so as to finalise the details of the new scheme well before financial year  1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, well before 30 June 1990. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This will give exporters ample time to plan their export market development activities for the first full year of the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>And where is the new scheme? We have not got it. There is no new scheme. What the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill does is extend the existing scheme for another six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, Madam Acting President, we had a Federal election. During the course of that Federal election Senator Button and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) called a joint press conference at which they announced the details of the new scheme. Those who can remember it can recall that it was an absolute shemozzle because the Minister got it wrong. Senator Button started to talk about the additional funds which would be provided to exporters. One of the journalists there knew a little about export market development grants schemes and asked a few questions about facts, not about the rhetoric, and Senator Button could not get the answers right. </PARA>
<PARA> The result was articles like this headline in the Age: `Embarrassment for PM over slip by Button'. That article was in fact written by Michelle Grattan and I understand that it was Michelle Grattan's calculator which was ultimately used to try to work out what were the additional funds, if any. Articles appeared like one in the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 March 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was forced to sit stony-faced as Senator Button conceded under pressure from journalists that what was originally touted as a spending initiative would actually save the Government money over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button then offered varying estimates as to what the saving would be: $200m over five years, $90m over three years and $35m over three years. </PARA>
<PARA>The author of this article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The unedifying spectacle of the Industry Minister surrounded by television cameramen struggling desperately to come up with the correct figures took much of the gloss out of what was planned to be a key campaign initiative for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>What is this grand initiative? Here we are debating the Bill-the Bill is before the chamber-and I may say, Madam Acting Deputy President, that this grand initiative is a puff of wind. In fact, some people in the chamber-not you, Madam Acting Deputy President-may be able to think of a four-letter word synonymous with a puff of wind, because that is what this Bill is. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is now saying is, `We want more time. Give us another six months'. In fact, what it originally asked for was five years; the draft Bill, which was distributed by the Minister's office, in fact extended the existing scheme for five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Government learned that the Opposition was not going to put up with an extension for five years without further detail; we said that the most we would agree to was 12 months. I understand that the Democrats went along with that suggestion, and so the Government, because it could see that it was going to be rolled on this, said it would extend the scheme for just six months. It would look as if there was an understanding that it would bring down something in due course. Well, the Opposition looks forward to seeing that in due course. It is another promise by this Government, which has been making these miserable promises for three years, about what it will do. Throughout the election campaign Government members bamboozled the people of Australia by telling them that the Government was going to do all sorts of things. Here is the Government's first opportunity, and what was promised is not being done. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate: what about this promise by Senator Button and the Prime Minister during the election campaign? What about this promise to the people as the Prime Minister and Senator Button tried to big-note themselves on what they would do? Let me quote from the Minister's press release of 28 February, headed `The Export Market Development Grants Scheme extended and augmented with a new $55m discretionary scheme'. We know that they got the figures wrong, but let us see what Senator Button said. He said that the new scheme would support established exporters, and so on, and he referred to `that new scheme'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>It will encourage. It will also support. The new discretionary scheme builds on the experience of . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The people of Australia were in effect being told: `There is a new scheme; the Government has a new scheme. The Opposition has said that it will extend the existing scheme while it considers the report of Professor Hughes, but we of the Labor Party have a new scheme. We keep talking about it-the new discretionary scheme'. Where it it? The Minister comes in here with this Bill and says in his second reading speech, `Look, during the election campaign we came to realise that there were some problems, so give us another six months to consider these problems before we come down with the new scheme'. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, as I have said, that was our policy and that was what we were telling the people of Australia. We were being honest with them, while the Australian Labor Party was being dishonest. This press release referring to a new scheme is all lies. Members of the Labor Party were out there winning votes, talking about a new export market development grants scheme which did not exist. Of course, this Government has never worried about lies, never worried about misleading the people of Australia. I might say that its supporters in the press gallery have never worried about trying to drag it back where it is misleading the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn away from political questions to the really tough question of why Australian exporting manufacturers need financial support from the taxpayers of Australia. Let me say to the Senate that it is not just the manufacturing exporters who need financial support from the taxpayers of Australia to continue to survive. Such support is needed by every Australian manufacturer in every industry which has managed to survive in this country. The Government conceded that last year when it granted Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd $36m. Senator Button came into the Parliament and told us that Kodak's industry was the only manufacturing industry left in Australia that was not getting a taxpayers' subsidy and that is why the Government was granting it $36m. Just think about that. No manufacturing industry in Australia can survive without a subsidy from the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the words of the late Professor Sumner Miller, why is it so? Why is it that all Australian manufacturers need to be subsidised? We know what will happen if they do not receive a subsidy. They will fold, as so many of them have folded in recent years, and continue to fold. I was talking last night to a fellow who left this Parliament in 1983 because he lost his seat at an election and then put all of his savings into an industry. He has not only lost all of his savings; he has lost further moneys as well. He is now desperately trying to pay off the massive debts that he owes. Why is it so? Why can we not get up and running? In this country we produce great produce; we produce massive quantities of wool. But where are the industries in Australia which convert that wool into cloth? There are not any. They are all overseas. Other countries buy our wool and take it away, make it into cloth and send it back to Australia. It is imported as cloth by our few remaining clothing manufacturers. Why do we not have an industry that converts our wool into cloth? It is a very good question. We need to think about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a huge number of cattle. We produce enormous amounts of beef. Every day large numbers of cattle are killed. What happens to the skins? Do we turn them into beautiful leather? No, we leave that for the Italians, who are very good at it. They buy large quantities of our skins and convert them into leather. They then send the leather mostly to Hong Kong, where it is manufactured into clothing, et cetera, and then we buy the clothing and produce from Hong Kong or some other Asian country. Why is it so? Why do we not have an industry which converts all these skins into good quality leather? Why is it that our wharf labourers say that what we in Australia export is empty containers? That is our export industry. Every day they load container ships full of empty containers and send them back where they came from. Why is it so? I ask members on the Government side to address their minds to the question: why? The problem is the Australian economy. Under this Government, the Australian economy is now in a desperate situation. Under this Government the Australian dollar has had to be propped up by high interest rates because of the massive debt we have incurred overseas, and if we allow the Australian dollar to drop the debt will increase enormously. With every drop of one cent in the value of the Australian dollar there is an enormous increase in our overseas debt and in our difficulty in meeting the interest payments on that debt. So this Government continues to prop up the Australian dollar. But, of course, that destroys our exporters, who cannot sell their product on the world market with Australian dollars at this value. So our manufacturing exporters are in diabolical strife because of the Australian economy. Under this Government, where are Mr Keating's plans to do anything about it?</PARA>
<PARA> Look at the massive protection we give to car manufacturers. That is why we are all paying twice what we ought to be paying for our cars. Yet the industry still struggles to survive. Look at the problems in the textile industry. The textile, clothing and footwear industries receive massive protection, which is why our shoes and clothes are so expensive. Yet they still struggle to survive. Indeed, there is a Bill on the Notice Paper at present which will provide them with additional assistance to get out of the hole that they are in at present. A few shoe manufacturers have managed to survive. I can think of Rivers in Ballarat, which has only recently got going. I congratulate it. I congratulate the textile industry and the motor vehicle industry on overcoming the problems that they have had to overcome because of the problems in the economy of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Pacific Dunlop Ltd has taken one of our greatest manufacturing industries offshore. I am referring to Ansell rubber goods, the producers of rubber gloves and condoms, which exports those products around the world. Last year it closed its Australian plant and took it offshore. There is nothing wrong with the Australian work force. Certainly, there is room for improvement in our skill training, but fundamentally there is nothing wrong with the Australian work force. They are intelligent, able people. There is nothing wrong with Australian entrepreneurship. Some Australians have been the greatest con men ever, and that is a form of entrepreneurship. Apart from that sort of criminal activity, among the ordinary manufacturers and industry entrepreneurs in this country there are great skills, great ideas and great ambitions, but they are absolutely hamstrung, destroyed and broken down by the penalties which this Government has imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the major problem, the so-called macro-economic problems-high interest rates, high inflation, which are being created deliberately. Mr Keating is squeezing demand in the economy. Let me refer to an article by Mr Paddy McGuinness in the Weekend Australian of 5 May, which is last weekend. The headline is, `Wanted urgently: a new job for a tired Treasurer'. The article draws attention to the fact that Mr Keating refuses to face up to the fact that his policies have failed miserably. Because of the compliance of the press gallery he is able to get away with it. Members of the press gallery love him because he makes smart alec remarks and clever, vitriolic speeches. They can write a story about him without having to go into depth as to what he is really saying. They can write a surface story about how he has abused some person. Because of that they love him and they allow him to get away with the things he has been doing in this country for the last three or four years. Paddy McGuiness wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> He deserves some recognition-perhaps the embassy in Washington, Tokyo or Paris. But as far as Australian economic policy is concerned he deserves only one message-for God's sake, go!</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walsh, of course, is trying desperately to draw attention to these matters in his Cassandra articles in the Australian Financial Review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very responsible, and he is behaving in the way that parliamentarians ought to behave, except that he ought to be making these speeches in the Parliament rather than writing them in newspaper articles. Nevertheless, he is doing something to try to bring this Government into line with what it ought to be doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the Ministers know what the Government ought to be doing. Senator Button has repeatedly made speeches in this chamber in which he has drawn attention to the problems being created by his own Government. I get angry with him. I keep saying that he is number three in the Government. He cannot get any higher than that while he remains a senator, yet he is not able to bring the Prime Minister and Mr Keating into line. </PARA>
<PARA> This country has other problems for manufacturers. We want to maintain high living standards and higher wages for our work force, decent holidays and a good environment. But as well as those things-and we ought to accept that they are part of what we want for the Australian work force and the Australian nation-we impose other burdens on our manufacturers. We are not satisfied with asking them to provide these things which are worth while. We impose additional taxes, such as the fringe benefits tax. We impose high company tax rates. In addition we also have a complicated tax regime. A lot of manufacturers, instead of employing people to manufacture products, frequently have to employ one or two accountants a year just to maintain the records that are needed for tax purposes and other government requirements, both State and Federal. There is complicated regulation of industry, complicated company laws and complicated and heavy taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>On top of that, we have the infamous accord which in many ways prevents them from trying to negotiate productivity increases with their work force. It is very interesting that within the last week Mr Keating has described the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) as a fool. Mr Langmore claims to be the originator of the idea of an accord. He was pushing it when he worked for the then shadow Treasurer, Mr Willis, when the Labor Party was in opposition. I wish Mr Keating had recognised earlier that John Langmore was a fool and had decided that the idea was foolish, because we have been telling the Government ever since 1983 that the accord is absolutely crazy. It is holding down the salaries of people who ought to be getting more, while paying more to people who ought to be getting less. There is not the slightest doubt that it is creating problems in increasing productivity in manufacturing industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me turn to the Hughes report. As I said earlier, this report sets out what are the problems of this country. I will quote some parts of it. I know that it is a bit of a bore for people to listen to this sort of stuff. Quite frankly, I would like to incorporate the whole report in Hansard, but I will not do so. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Incentives--</PARA>
<PARA>and this Bill that we are talking about is an incentive-</PARA>
<PARA>which assist exporters to overcome the initial difficulties of entering foreign markets can play only a limited role in stimulating export growth. The economic policy environment swamps their effect. </PARA>
<PARA>What is being said is that these incentives are all right, but the overall economic policy environment swamps their effect. That is what I have been saying. One can give companies this subsidy, but until one gets the economic environment right, the subsidy will just manage to keep them alive. The report goes on to say. </PARA>
<PARA>However, because it will take time to improve economic policies even if new policy changes are initiated and ongoing reforms are accelerated, incentives to exporters can be used in the interim to increase the involvement of small and medium sized business in exports. </PARA>
<PARA> That explains why the report says, `Look, we'll have to keep this scheme going in some regard'. The report recommends some variations to the scheme, but the explanation for the recommendation that there be a scheme-and we on our side of politics have accepted that there has to be a scheme-is the economic policy environment in which manufacturers find themselves in Australia today. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is less well understood that our lagging economic performance is closely linked to our poor export growth. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Despite recent growth of tourism, service exports lag even further behind other industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this report was written before the pilots strike, which the Prime Minister pushed so hard and which in effect has destroyed our tourist industry. I go on and quote from another part of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Past reviews of Australian export incentives concluded . . . that the effect of macro and microeconomic policies far outweigh the influence of specific subsidies and incentives to export. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what I have been saying to the Senate. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Macroeconomic policies are by far the most important determinants of exports. The rate of exchange dominates the profitability of exports but, except in the short run, the rate of exchange is largely the outcome of all of a country's principal policies-fiscal, monetary, trade and income-and how they mesh together. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I have been saying. This Government has not got it right and has not had it right for four years. Senator Walsh is saying that. Sensible economic writers-not this press gallery that we have got up here-like Paddy McGuinness have been drawing attention to it. Until we get it right, the environmentalists will not be able to achieve what they want. Until we get it right, living standards of all Australians will fall and continue to fall. I will not make a prediction about what will happen to the Australian dollar because I am worried about these sorts of predictions by politicians becoming what in effect happens as a result of what they have said. It is certainly very worrying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will support the extension of this scheme, but we say to this Government, `You lied to the people of Australia, you did not have a new scheme, and we wait to see what scheme you will produce to this Parliament before 31 December of this year'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill is a one-clause Bill. Having listened to Senator Lewis for the last half hour, I think he is trying to load an enormous amount in a very light vehicle indeed, and I suggest to him that it collapses under the weight. One rather interesting thing he did say was that the Italians were going to buy his skin. Might I, with some good humour, suggest the sooner the better, and particularly if the Italians then sell it on to the people in Hong Kong to be turned into clothing. It might be more useful than what we have just been listening to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that this Bill is really a temporary extension of provisions already in place and is simply required to extend the provisions of the export market development grants scheme until the substantive Bill is brought in during the Budget session. We will be addressing our substantive remarks in relation to that scheme at that time. It is for that reason that we will be supporting the Bill and not supporting the amendments. The amendment that has been proposed by Senator Harradine is, indeed, an inappropriate place-leaving aside any merit that that amendment might have-in which to place a constraint in the operation of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, addressing the substance of the scheme itself, we have a large number of objections to a whole range of assumptions and processes which are built into the operation of this scheme. For instance, implicit in the scheme itself is the notion that trade is an end in itself and is desirable for its own sake. The Australian Democrats would clearly take the view that trade is something in which one engages to provide those goods and services which one cannot manufacture oneself, and it should be a small part of overall economic activity in a sustainable economy which tends increasingly towards self-sufficiency rather than locking us into more and more precarious relationships with other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, one need only look at the recent occurrences in relation to Australia's trade to observe the necessary failure-the failure which is implicit-in coming to depend more and more on trade relationships. We have been exporting live sheep to the Middle East for quite some time, and for a whole range of reasons, many of them completely spurious, sheep have arrived in the Middle East and have been unable to be unloaded. They have been kept in quite unsuitable conditions which have been, quite rightly, objected to by many of the animal rights lobbyists while arguments went on as to whether they did or did not have scabby mouth, were or were not old animals and so on and so forth. It seems to me fairly obvious that if one builds an economy which is increasingly dependent on exports for its health, then of course one lays oneself open to the arbitrary operation of other countries and the vicissitudes and changes which occur in the economies of those other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> One can point also to the recent failure of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to honour the payment of $100m for wool exports. Again, to the extent that we lock ourselves necessarily into trade, we make ourselves more precariously dependent on those trade conditions and circumstances and render our economy far more precarious and less manageable. Indeed, if I were to make a prediction, I would point to the fact that Egypt is one of our major importers of wheat, yet Egypt is also one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world. It can only continue to pay for Australian wheat as long as the international banking organisations, the International Monetary Fund and so on are prepared to support Egypt's adverse balance of payments. I predict that it will not be many years down the track before Egypt will not be able to buy or pay for Australian wheat, and to the extent to which we have built an Australian economy dependent upon that export, we will have made our economy more unstable, more precarious and certainly less manageable by the elected government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Implicit in the program of self-sufficiency which I have suggested is that, rather than export enhancement, we should be going more for import replacement. I recognise that the Government has also been pursuing that goal. We would strongly support that goal, and to that end we would support some of the remarks of Senator Lewis in relation to much of Australia's primary product which is currently exported unprocessed, processed overseas and then imported back into this country. It is clear to us that a great deal of value adding should be occurring and that that would lead in many cases to import substitution. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make the point that really it is only the value added which occurs when one processes resources of a non-renewable kind, such as our mineral resources. It is only as we value-add to those resources that we really get any wealth at all. I have made the point in this place before that, if we kept proper national capital accounts, the value of those resources in situ would appear in a national capital account. When we exploit those things and export them unprocessed we observe that there is no increase in the wealth of the country whatsoever and that the increase in the wealth of the country occurs only as we value-add, in other words, as we process those resources into finished products. To that extent the value adding part of any overall economic management program should place emphasis on import substitution and value adding. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one fears that this is not the way the Government is going, and the extension of this export market development grants scheme until the Budget time is presaged on a number of other reports which the Government has. We have not yet in this place discussed the Garnaut report, Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy, a report which looks at supposed very optimistic developments in north-east Asia and which suggests that Australia will successfully be able to lock into those growing markets with exports to the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I observe in passing that the Garnaut report was some 330 pages long but contained only 6 3/4 lines which dealt with the environment, and those only to the extent of saying that the Australian environment was a very pleasant one in which to be and asking how we could exploit that environment for the purposes of tourism. Garnaut recognised not a single environmental constraint to the growth and development of the north Asian markets in the future. There were no considerations of the problems of greenhouse, stratospheric ozone depletion, resource depletion or acid rain. They were not recognised as constraints in that economic model. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are extremely worried about the way in which the Government is basing its economic policy, of which this is simply a part. The Opposition is proceeding essentially along the same path. We believe this economic model is out of date, dangerous and simply will not succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, a moment ago we heard Senator Lewis indicate that he was quite ignorant of the fundamental fact that growth in the economy and environmental protection are inconsistent. He reiterated what others in this chamber have said, that one needs a growing economy in order to pay for environmental protection. He does not seem to recognise the fundamental economic reality that what is spent on environmental protection goes down as an addition to the gross national product and therefore what we spend on environmental protection is itself a direct cause of economic growth as currently measured. </PARA>
<PARA> He also went on to indicate that he thought that Mr Keating's economic policies had failed. I would observe, as an extension of what I have just said, that had the Opposition been in Government it would essentially have been pursuing the same economic model and, to the extent that it would have been possibly even less efficient in pursuing that model, would have brought us to the same position of failure even more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> One other thing is important to pick up, for the reason that it was an issue very much in the Murray Valley and other parts of Australia during this recent election. Senator Lewis said that it was appropriate that we put into place in Australia proper environmental and worker health controls. Of course, we would agree absolutely with that statement. But then he seems to support the Government in progressively deregulating and removing tariffs and various other protective measures, which essentially means that we import from other countries products which are manufactured under conditions which do not provide the same standards of environmental and occupational health protection. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time it has seemed to me and to other Australian Democrats that it is totally unfair on the Australian environment and Australian workers to expect workers to lose their jobs because we have quite rightly imposed proper standards of protection here when we then allow imports from countries where the same standards are not applied. It would therefore follow that we would support the application of tariffs which were not arbitrarily applied but were modelled on the real costs of the imposition of those environmental and occupational health protection measures. We believe that under such a system Australian industry is well able to compete and produce quality products. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated at the beginning, this is a very brief Bill. There is really only one clause. We do not believe it is an appropriate vehicle to cause to carry any amendments whatsoever, and for that reason when the substantive Bill comes back in August we will comment further on the sorts of amendments we would like to see. </PARA>
<PARA> We have considerable concern over a number of exports. We have expressed concern in the past over the export of uranium and of arms. Government policy appears to be at least partly dependent upon the build-up of sales of arms overseas. We object to those things and consider them far more significant than the sorts of amendments that Senator Harradine has suggested. But we think it more appropriate to debate those sorts of issues in relation to the export market development grants scheme when we have the substantive Bill before us, and not at this stage. Therefore, we will be supporting this Bill without amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating what was supposed to be the introduction of a new, exciting and wonderful scheme to enhance exports, the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990. That is what the Government told us during the election campaign. Yet here we have a Bill which says, `Please give us more time. We need a temporary respite'. The temporary respite, according to the draft of the original explanatory memorandum, was not to ask for the six months that this Bill is asking for but to ask for five years. The original intention was to extend the operation of the existing Export Market Development Grants Act from 30 June 1990 to 30 June 1995. The explanatory memorandum says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an interim measure to preserve the continuity of the Act pending the enactment of the Government's amendments to that Act jointly announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, on 28 February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>That refers to the farcical press conference that we all remember. Normally we would have been expecting to read about it on page 1 of the newspapers but, funny thing, it got buried down there on pages 5 and 7. The whole attitude to this question is indicative of the failure of the Government to formulate policies which will insist that industry be more productive and be able to export, and will enable Australia to trade its way out of the huge debt which has been accumulated under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of the Government concerning export incentives is indeed a record of inaction and uncertainty. Let us have a look at the last five years. In five years we have had five reviews. In 1985 we had the report of the national export marketing strategy panel and in 1987 the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which dealt with the submissions from Austrade following an audit report. In 1988 there was the Bureau of Industry Economics report, then a Price Waterhouse report commissioned by Austrade, and finally the report of the Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance, the Hughes Committee report. The Government has had the Hughes Committee report for nine months but the amendments are still not drafted and ready to be presented. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is providing for institutionalised uncertainty because the amendments, when they are finally to be introduced, are to be retrospective to July, being the date announced at that press conference on 28 February. Industry requires, most of all, consistency and predictability in Government policy. Without a clear knowledge of what assistance they can expect, firms are unable to take up the full advantage of assistance which is available in developing export strategies. Professor Hughes noted that continual change to the export market developments grants scheme has caused confusion and indecision, and frequent changes have created an advisory industry which appropriates a share of the EMDG benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> To look further at the history of the Government in this area, prior to the 1987 federal election the Government led industry to believe that there would be no tampering with the scheme. In June 1987, the then Minister for Trade, John Dawkins, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have written to all recipients of EMDGs-that is, the export market development grant scheme- assuring them that the Hawke Government regards the scheme as an integral of Australia's export effort . . . I have also assured them that we will not undermine that effort by chipping away at the spearhead of Australia's export drive, Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also gave an assurance during the 1987 election that Austrade funding and the EMDG scheme would remain intact. In the following May statement of 1988 changes were announced to the scheme. In the EMDG Amendment Bill of 1988 exports to New Zealand were excluded, an increase was made to the eligible expenditure threshold from 5,000 to 10,000 a year, the maximum grant payable was  reduced to $150,000 and to $100,000 for those in receipt of their tenth or subsequent grants and it was decided to treat the affiliated companies as one unit in the assessment of grants. </PARA>
<PARA> In Estimates committee hearings we found that little research had been carried out on the likely effect to exporters from the changes that were made. No answers could be provided to the question of what percentage of grantees would be likely to be first year applicants nor to the fundamental question of how many applicants would be exporters without the existence of the scheme. The Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) criticises the scheme and says it has failed to bring about the establishment of new products and the continued penetration into new markets. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA> Encouragement of new products is not achieved very well by the scheme. The data suggests that the development of new products appears, on average, to be minimal after claimants have been in the scheme longer than one year. </PARA>
<PARA>New markets were generally entered by firms in the early years of the scheme but from the second year to the eighth year only one new market per year per claimant was developed while beyond the eighth year new market development declined markedly. The BIE concluded that assistance was being provided to established exporters who were not developing new markets and to exporters not adequately committed to success in exporting. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Hughes, in the same vein, said that the stalling of export development after eight years in the scheme was apparent. Over 60 per cent of all firms that have claimed more than seven times did not enter a new market in 1987-88 and beyond the second year only 12 per cent of claimants promoted a new product in 1987-88, according to the Committee's findings. Professor Hughes further said that after the tenth year the average export earnings of claimants actually fell and that the ratio of exports to claims also declined beyond the eighth year in the scheme and also beyond the eighth year firms' proportion  of turnover exported declines. Clearly inducement should be provided to initiate new exports and markets rather than rewarding those already established. </PARA>
<PARA> The same report said that there was little correlation between market development expenditure and the level of export earnings. For instance, the more isolated markets of Africa, the Middle East and Latin America showed the highest ratios of export income to promotional expenditure while those markets accounting for the majority of promotional expenditure, such as North America, Europe and members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, had among the lowest ratios. </PARA>
<PARA> Could it be said that the real reason is the poor administration of the scheme, with cost overruns which result in people being not paid in due time? In March 1988 the Government found eligible grants had been underestimated by $64m. For weeks payments to genuine exporters were suspended. The cost of the scheme tends to increase every year due to the open access nature of the scheme. Funds budgeted by Austrade have been considerably below estimates of the next years costs which have resulted in delays of the payments to some firms and supplementary payments have had to be sought to match the funding of the amount for the eligible claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the scheme to be administered seems high. The cost of servicing each grantee has been approximated at $500. There are high levels of unprocessed claims at the end of the financial year and the carry over value of claims of $38m at 1 July 1989 was up from $20m from the 1 July 1988 date. Professor Hughes' conclusion was that there was no rigorous causal impact of EMDG payments on export growth. Most of the firms would have been successful without the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations from the Hughes report were that exporters should only be eligible for a maximum of eight incentive payments, that the minimum expenditure threshold should be increased from $10,000 to $50,000, that the maximum rate should be increased to $250,000 and the cut rate should rise to $25m, and that the rate should be reduced from 70 per cent to 50 per cent of eligible expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the Government's response to those recommendations that have been made? The Government's immediate response is to come here and ask for a six months extension of the existing Bill, having originally intended, according to the draft of their original memorandum, to ask for five years, and leave a system of uncertainty with industry not knowing exactly what might be brought in in six months time. The spectacle of Minister Button during the campaign, huddled with a group of journalists and television cameras, struggling to do his figures on the back of an envelope, only added to the uncertainty. The position that was finally brought to us by way of the media was altered no less than four times. No wonder the Government is on the nose with industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey of exporters' perceptions of the Labor Party before the election found that 80 per cent of respondents rated the Governments policies as either poor or average. The Government's overall policies have resulted in high inflation, which has undermined exporters' capacity to plan and produce for the export market. Tight monetary policy has driven up interest rates in an attempt to slow domestic demand and, of course, has impacted on exporters. Further reductions in protection, including tariff and non-tariff barriers, would make substantial contributions to the competitiveness of the Australian exporters. High costs of coastal shipping, on the wharves and railways, and the high costs of power and other utilities were supposed to be dealt with in the last term of the Labor Government. At the beginning of its 1987 period it said that that was to be the term of micro-economic reform, and it simply did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA> So what we have before us today is a plea from the Government saying, `We told you, the electorate, before the election that we had a brand new policy which would be introduced and which would assist manufacturers and exporters generally in reducing Australia's accumulated debt.'. What we get is a one page mea culpa saying, `Please, we are not ready. We have read it down and ask for six months' time to give us breathing space because we knew that the community would not wear five years'. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Lewis has already said, we will be supporting the Bill but we point out to the Australian electorate that they were fooled during that election period. We are not seeing this new `you beaut' scheme; what we are simply seeing is a plea, `Please give us more time to try to get it right and present you with something which will not be an affront.'. </PARA>

I have spoken about it many times. Each time we seem to have an inquiry or each time we seem to want to fiddle about with it, around the edges, we have one of these debates. I want to speak about it because of the great concern over the appalling lack of understanding and the mishandling that has long been part of the export encouragement program of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought that the Hughes report, the report of the Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance, was a very valuable document. It was valuable inasmuch as it raised all the issues. I was disappointed that in the end it came back and reflected the Government position. It certainly did not reflect the position of the exporters and the potential exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> It has already been said-and I do need to say it as well-that we are tinkering with the figures and tinkering with the fringes instead of getting the main game right.  The economy of Australia is in one terrible mess. There should be no need for a scheme of any sort. If we had the main game right we would not need tariffs, we would not need bounties and we would not need these inducement schemes. They are all expensive to run; they are all expensive to claim. The whole thing is so much out of kilter at present and we are trying to patch it up by these stop-gap methods. </PARA>
<PARA> We have this ridiculous dollar value which is an enormous handicap on business generally. We have a level of interest rates higher than that of any of the people that we deal with competitively around the world. We have an inflation rate that is driving people crazy here and damaging business enormously compared with the other countries that we deal with as competitors. None of those things is being attended to. The great whiz-kid of the Government on these matters just says, `I have lovely figures'. Well, if they are lovely figures I do not know what they would be if they were terrible. But none of these are being attended to and this scheme, whatever it turns out  to be, will not fix them either. We can wreck Australia's exporters if we really go about it this way. We only have to look at recent headlines in the paper. The  Age of 4 May, which I have here, has the headline, `Imports boom, economy busts'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>A disappointing slump in manufacturing exports, which have ended their promising surge of late 1989 and retreated to their lowest quarterly level for a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The results shocked the market. And so on. So it ought to shock the market, but it does not shock the Government. The Government just goes on and ignores that. Then we have the sort of problems that the exporters have. I picked up an article from the  Daily Commercial News of 8 May which was headed `Give exporters Fair Go, Govt Told'. It went on to tell of the ridiculous applications that are being made of various aspects of the Tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to make up our mind about what sort of a country we are trying to develop. Do we want to be a banana republic? I think the answer is `yes' at the moment, but I do not think that the people out there see it that way. Do we want to be a manufacturing or a producing country? Do we want to be self-supporting? Do we want to see ourselves just build up huge debt-debt on debt on debt-so that we cannot even pay the interest on it? Do we want to be like my colleague from the Australian Democrats who says, `We do not want to be a trading country'. Is that the way we want this country to head? What are we going to do?</PARA>
<PARA> I think Austrade under Lindsay MacAlister has done everything it possibly can. I think it deserves great credit for having struggled and struggled to try to encourage people to go into the exporting business, to try to get Australia off the hook a bit, to try to reduce our overseas deficit to some extent; but every time it finds a new customer, every time it finds a new potential dealer, the Government changes something and out they go. People I have come across in industry and in business have said to me, `Look, we tried it; it was all too difficult. By the time we filled in all the forms and saw all the people and put in all the returns it cost us more than we were likely to get back'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are an insular nation, one that clearly should be amongst the world's great maritime countries. But are we? No, we are a joke. I find that sea and air transport is much the same as well. This reminds me that a few weeks ago I saw headlines in my local paper at home that was congratulating a lady who had secured a market for selling proteas in Tokyo. For a small grower, that was a great achievement. I thought the next day that I would ring her up and congratulate her, and I did. After I had spoken for about half a minute, I suppose, she said, `There is something I should tell you'. I said, `What is that?'. She said, `The proteas never got there; they lost them between Burnie and Melbourne'. Not only did she lose the proteas; she also lost the customer.</PARA>
<PARA> How can we hope to be a trading nation when we cannot even start the things off right on our own doorstep? Where are we going to deal? People expect us to behave ourselves and behave in a reasonably professional way. Look at the effects of the airline problems on the Tasmanian exporters.  I think it is worth reading a small piece about a gentleman who is well-known to the Minister. This article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Roads and Transport, Mr Wriedt, yesterday accused the Hawke Government of hypocrisy and of inflicting unnecessary hardship on Tasmania by prolonging the national pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wriedt said in a scathing attack on the Government that he would neither forget nor forgive it for the role it played in depriving Tasmania of millions of dollars in tourist revenue last year. </PARA>
<PARA> `I believe it was a shameful exercise' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. That is the sort of thing that is going on all the time. Why the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Federal Government had to take the sides they did, why they strung it out as long as they did to the total detriment of the people that they are supposed to be serving, I will never understand, and neither will all these others. All those delays totally ruined many producers and exporters, and even the interstate ones as well. If one is trying to run a business that is involved in things like fresh cheeses, broccoli, cut flowers, crayfish and oysters, one just has to have regular, reliable and dependable service, and this is what Ken Wriedt was talking about in the Tasmanian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has been made already to the Government's attitude and understanding. The people out there have absolutely no confidence left as to what the Government might do about export markets development. How could one try and plan a business with the record that this Government has on this very subject? The classic blunders that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) made during the recent election campaign shows the level of importance that he places on exporting and how well he sees and understands what it is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am enjoying the conversation with the Minister but I would rather that he have his say at the end, if that is all right with him. Now that the Minister has raised the matter, I would like him to explain, as an interim measure, why five years was the date that was placed originally. Also, is that an extension of the scheme? Or is it the brand new whiz-bang scheme that was talked about two or three months ago? Is it an interim scheme, or is it a new scheme? Was it for five years, or was it not for five years?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everybody apparently is going back to the drawing board. What concerns me, and what concerns a lot of people out there, is that if they do not look out they are going to find that there is going to be yet another inquiry while we put it off a bit longer. How can manufacturers and producers plan anything out of this total confusion that the Minister has just demonstrated that he is still in?</PARA>
<PARA> One thing is clear, however, and that is that a scheme is essential. It must be simple. It must encourage triers and appropriately reward them for their efforts and it cannot just be a sop for the big people. It must give potential exporters a feeling that getting into the big league could help them and could be in the national interest. At present everything in Australia is being run for the importers. Every time we wipe out another industry we import the value of those goods, and every time we import them we stick it on the slate and the cost just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of government policy we have lost dozens of whole industries and we have severely damaged and weakened many of the other smaller ones as well, and they are still getting less. Up goes our foreign debt. Is this what we want? What are we doing about it? How long does this Government think that we can allow things to go on getting worse and worse and still do nothing about it? If we are to be competitive we must compete in a manner similar to those of the other countries with which we are dealing. It is as simple as that. I have a list of various countries and schemes here about which I have spoken to the Whip. I want to incorporate them. They list the main items that go with these sorts of schemes in other places. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we want to compete on the world markets, or do we not? If we are going to have a scheme it must be good enough to give confidence to our exporters so that they can start to wind back this appalling international debt that the Government has endowed on our children and grandchildren. Although this is only a one-line Bill that the Government may have thought could be just nodded through, I think it is important that I speak on it. The Government has no idea of what it is going to do so at least it might listen to us and then pick up something that it can use. </PARA>
<PARA> It all starts off with the fact that our currency value, still pumped up, is miles out of line with what it is truly worth. We have only to look at this trade-weighted index to see how far out of line we are with our current actual money value. Our interest rates, to pump up this dollar, are murdering our primary and secondary industries-absolutely murdering them. The social costs of the things that have already been referred to are borne by the  productive sector. The benefits go to everybody else but they are paid for by the productive sector, particularly the exporters. It puts them totally out of kilter with the other countries of the world with which they are competing. Our inflation makes us unreliable in the marketplace. Our industrial relations and transport reputation around the world is woeful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, Mr Keating, talks about his lovely figures. I think it is time we looked at a few more of these lovely figures to make some true comparisons. On the hourly cost for production workers, with Australia in an index of 100 as at 1988, it is worth remembering that amongst the countries of this area and around the world that we compete with the figure for New Zealand was 65, Taiwan 24, Singapore 24, Korea 23 and Hong Kong 22. And then we talk about inflation rates. Australia is currently running at 8.6 per cent, Japan 1.1, West Germany 1.2, USA 3.5, United Kingdom 4.7. Then we talk about labour productivity. Of the more industrialised countries, Australia produces $24,100 per employee per annum against the USA which produces $35,500, Belgium $27,400, and Japan $25,200. As for the real growth of labour productivity, the figure for Australia between 1967 and 1986 rose 2.6 per cent. The figure for Japan was 5.9 per cent; Canada was 4.4 per cent; and Germany 3.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Are these lovely figures? I think they are absolutely disgraceful. We have been told all about restructuring and all sorts of things like that, and where has it got us? This restructuring still has not lifted us out of the ruck and got us to where we can be a profitable and meaningful country in the trading world. Think of the bankruptcies, this huge splurge of bankruptcies. Both large and small people are going to the wall as a result of not being able to compete. Think of this huge influx of consumer goods. Senator Walsh has put a lie to the old story about this all being great new manufacturing plant. It is not, it is consumer goods: it is food, it is clothing, it is furniture, it is electrical goods. It is all these sort of things. These things are coming in here and wiping out our industries and blowing up our debt. We just have to face this. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are we going up in debt, not only are we not competing on an international scale; there are tens of thousands of people who are going to lose their jobs. Does  that worry anybody? Is the Treasurer concerned? I have seen the Treasurer a bit lately and I have not seen him looking as if he is terribly worried about other people's predicaments. What is going to be the result of all this?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I have two tables that I have shown to the Whip, as well, which I would also like to incorporate in  Hansard along with the one on the selected schemes. I seek leave to incorporate those now. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>KEY FEATURES OF SELECTED OVERSEAS SCHEMES</PARA>
<PARA>New Zealand</PARA>
<PARA>New Zealand's current scheme is the Export Market Development Taxation Incentive (EMDTI), which</PARA>
<PARA>provides for rebate/refund against tax, as a percentage of qualifying expenditure (53-64%). </PARA>
<PARA>qualifying expenditure includes: travel, salaries and wages, payments to agents, expenses incurred overseas, and expenses incurred in New Zealand to bring in overseas buyers, preparation of tenders or quotations, sales promotions, exhibition costs, etc. </PARA>
<PARA>EMDTI is to be phased out by 31 March 1990. It will be replaced by the Individual Exporters' Programme (IEP). </PARA>
<PARA>IEP provides funds of $NZ10 million. </PARA>
<PARA>funding is for two years and covers export survey costs, costs of hiring an export manager and promotion costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Canada</PARA>
<PARA>Canada provides a Programme for Export Market Development (PEMD). It is a shared-cost Programme designed to cover up to 50 per cent of approved expenses incurred on an export project. Repayment of PEMD contributions are required if a sale results from the marketing effort. It covers the following specific areas:</PARA>
<PARA>specific project bidding</PARA>
<PARA>market identification</PARA>
<PARA>participation in trade fairs</PARA>
<PARA>export consortia</PARA>
<PARA>establishment of permanent sales offices abroad</PARA>
<PARA>PEMD-FOOD: export markets for agriculture, fisheries and food products. </PARA>
<PARA>General Guidelines for the Programme are:</PARA>
<PARA>any business operating in Canada is eligible for assistance</PARA>
<PARA>products or services promoted under the scheme must have significant Canadian content</PARA>
<PARA>PEMD assistance is usually limited to $500,000 per year per company or group of related companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Japan</PARA>
<PARA>The only direct incentives available to Japanese exports are the `trade insurance' facilities (equivalent of EPC) administered through MITI. </PARA>
<PARA>Italy</PARA>
<PARA>Italian export incentives take the form of special purpose grants, rather than concessions of the EMDGS type. Financial assistance Programme is drawn up each year by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Trade. The Programme is drawn up in line with the following objectives:</PARA>
<PARA>Priority to specialisation in medium to high technology products with high `value added' content</PARA>
<PARA>maintenance of support to exports of `traditional' products</PARA>
<PARA>Priority to promotional investments with the highest profitability in the short to medium term</PARA>
<PARA>Co-ordination of specific promotional drives in order to avoid activities not forming part of specific priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Some examples of assistance provided are: International Fairs Office in Paris; specific grants to trade-oriented bodies; contribution to Chambers of Commerce abroad; contributions to fairs and exhibitions abroad; grants to exporting consortia. </PARA>
<PARA>Singapore</PARA>
<PARA>Singapore operates the Market Development Assistance Scheme (MDAS), which is a cash grant scheme aimed at defraying initial costs of companies' export development activities. </PARA>
<PARA>the scheme is discretionary in that grants will not be given unless the company has sound managerial and financial capabilities with positive net worth and working capital. </PARA>
<PARA>grants are given in respect of: setting up overseas offices; improving product/services; and developing new markets. </PARA>
<PARA>assistance is given on a project basis, via a cost-sharing arrangement, and for one or two years only. </PARA>
<PARA>maximum assistance per project is $250,000. </PARA>
<PARA>large firms setting up overseas offices and applying for MDAS are expected to involve small companies as a means of helping these small companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Singapore also operates Export Expansion Schemes, which include:</PARA>
<PARA>double tax deductions for trade fairs/missions, overseas trade offices, overseas market development and promotional publications. </PARA>
<PARA>companies seek approval prior to obtaining the tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>International trading Company Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other tax-based incentives that Singapore provides which are based on profits earned from exporting activity (e.g. the Export of Services Incentives)</PARA>
<PARA>Hong Kong</PARA>
<PARA>Hong Kong does not operate any market entry or development scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>however the Hong Kong Trade Development Council operates overseas trade shows and exhibitions. </PARA>
<PARA>United States</PARA>
<PARA>The United States operates the following major export assistance schemes:</PARA>
<PARA>the Export-Import Bank, which provides credits and guarantees insurance to US exporters. These are frequently subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA>the Export Enhancement Programme (General) which provides $1.5 billion for subsidies to US agricultural exports. </PARA>
<PARA>a variety of smaller agricultural export assistance programmes, such as the Dairy Export Incentive Programme. </PARA>
<PARA>Korea</PARA>
<PARA>The Republic of Korea operates the Export Financing Programme:</PARA>
<PARA>the Programme provides credit to promote exports of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>the Programmer is operated by the individual commercial banks at their own discretion, and has no direct connection with the Government's budget although the scheme is authorised and promulgated under the direction of the Bank of Korea. </PARA>
<PARA>the Export Financing Programme provides three types of financial facilities: loans for general export and import; loans for export of construction and services; and loans for preparing exports of agricultural and marine products.</PARA>
<PARA>India</PARA>
<PARA>The Government of India does not maintain any export assistance Programme which is inconsistent with the main GATT provisions. The main Programmes which are operated are:</PARA>
<PARA>Cash Compensatory Support (CCS), which is designed basically to reimburse unrefunded indirect taxes on imports used in export production. </PARA>
<PARA>the Government of India allows various deductions in the computation of taxable profits including the deduction of 4 per cent of net foreign exchange realisation and up to 50 per cent of export profits</PARA>
<PARA>Market Development Assistance (MDA) which is a multi grant rate scheme to cover inter alia sponsoring/inviting trade delegations to India from abroad, market studies, publicity, the setting up of warehouses/showrooms, research and development and quality control-MDA is mainly directed towards group promotions through trade associations, but also covers individual promotions. </PARA>
<PARA>Brazil</PARA>
<PARA>Brazil operates the following main export inventive schemes:</PARA>
<PARA>Working Capital Financing for Exports, which is a discretionary grant somewhat like EMDGS, giving a loan based on an adjusted fob value of exports or estimated exports</PARA>
<PARA>Financing for Trading Companies, in which the Government guarantees payment of financial fees up to 15% per annum</PARA>
<PARA>Financing for Storing of Goods, providing for the storage of goods for export under concessional conditions in special bonded warehouses</PARA>
<PARA>tax rebates are also available on profits earnt from exporting. </PARA>
<PARA>Finland</PARA>
<PARA>The Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry promotes export activity by granting support for export marketing activities, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>grants and loans are paid to exporters. Grants are a maximum 50% and loans 75% of total expenditure</PARA>
<PARA>grants are provided for marketing of export products, for participation in foreign trade fairs and exhibitions and for export campaigns</PARA>
<PARA>guarantees are provided for small and medium size firms</PARA>
<PARA>export credits are financed by the Finnish Export Credit Ltd. which is jointly owned by the Finnish Government, major banks and some industrial companies. FEC provides finance for medium- and long-term export credits and pre-delivery costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Sweden</PARA>
<PARA>The Swedish Government operates a range of subsidies, mainly through the semi-State-owned Swedish Trade Council, whose services are available only to subscribing companies. The main subsidies are:</PARA>
<PARA>general subsidisation of the operations of the Swedish Trade Council which provides consulting services and grants of up to 40% of costs of market research, trade fairs and market information</PARA>
<PARA>medium and long-term export credits for capital goods can be refinanced by the Swedish Export Corporation, which is jointly owned by the Government and the Banks</PARA>
<PARA>Norway</PARA>

<PARA>a tax rebate for successful exporters</PARA>
<PARA>a corporate tax exemption on certain products (20% of export earnings non-taxable)</PARA>
<PARA>Belgium</PARA>
<PARA>There are two types of assistance provided to exporters:</PARA>
<PARA>Fonds de Commerce Exterieur relates to new market exploration and development</PARA>
<PARA>Comprex is an interest bonus/credit system relating to certain types of equipment sales. </PARA>
<PARA>Fonds du Commerce Exterieur only provides assistance for new markets, which are defined as markets where sales do not exceed 6% of total exports. </PARA>
<PARA>aid offered is 50% of cost of eligible activity or 25% of cost if Belgian share of product/services is less than 50%</PARA>
<PARA>eligible expenditure includes EMDG type expenditure (plus accommodation costs)</PARA>
<PARA>excluded in export promotion to EEC countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Philippines</PARA>
<PARA>The Philippines' previous export incentives Programme was phased out on 1 January 1987. The Philippines no longer maintains an export incentive Programme. </PARA>
<PARA>France</PARA>
<PARA>France has two export market development schemes: ``Assurance Prospection'' or Market Development Insurance; and ``Assurance Foire'', or Exhibition Insurance, both operated by the Government owned Compagnie Francaise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur (COFACE). </PARA>
<PARA>the two schemes are insurance Programmes in which exporters pay a premium to insure against the risk that export returns from their market development activities or trade-show participation will not cover their expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>if export returns are less than expenses, compensation is received; if returns are greater than expenses, the exporter must pay back compensation already received. </PARA>
<PARA>claims can only be made in respect of activities undertaken after a contract has been concluded with COFACE. Two types of contracts are available-for small to medium sized companies without previous experience in exporting, and for companies which already have export experience. </PARA>

<PARA>assistance is provided by way of a loan up to a maximum of UK pound 400,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The eligible costs are similar to those under the EMDG Scheme and must be incurred solely and directly in relation to a proposed venture and a defined market. </PARA>
<PARA>the onus is on the firm to justify the proposal and demonstrate that the loan will be repaid based on a levy on sales. </PARA>
<PARA>The Company must be indigenous and must satisfy either:</PARA>
<PARA>minimum of 50 employees;</PARA>
<PARA>fixed assets of at least 500,000 Pounds; or</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. In November last year I asked the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, whether there were any lengthy delays in the processing of applications for Australian citizenship. The Minister replied that Queensland had the longest delay period of any State. I therefore ask whether the Minister can indicate what the delay period now is in Queensland and whether any action has been taken to reduce the delay.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am able to advise Senator Colston that processing times for citizenship applications in Australia, and in particular in Queensland, have improved quite significantly after delays that were operating last year-last year, of course, being a record-breaking year in terms of the level of citizenship applications-as well as the impact of the recent changes to the Migration Act. The Minister informs me that his Department is now processing applications nationally within its two-month target standard of service applying from the date of receipt to approval. Conferrals, of course, take longer and are generally outside departmental control. The rate of processing in Queensland was less than one month in March, although the Minister expects that such a quick turnaround may not be sustainable. However, the point of the answer is that processing in Queensland now is down to one month's delay.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="232" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fortunately, as soon as the disaster of the recent floods occurred, my department made special efforts to have staff go immediately to those areas. Upon doing so, not only was emergency cash relief distributed but also we managed to double the normal special benefit available in those cases, so that some immediate relief was made available to many thousands of people who were gravely affected by that very serious natural disaster. However, I do not think that our efforts can end there. Clearly, as people are still not living in their normal place of abode and are not expected to move into their normal place of abode for quite some time, it will be necessary for officers of my department to make special efforts to have more officers located in flood areas of both Queensland and New South Wales to ensure the speedy delivery of the social security benefits to victims. That process is being undertaken now. I do not believe that there is a requirement at this stage for many more of those immediate cash payments. I think that immediate need has now been met. Nonetheless, people are-and I do not use the phrase in any critical way-drifting back now, and it is irregular; it is difficult for us to know how many people will go back and at what time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consequently, we will have to keep this under constant review. That is being done. I believe that at the present time the efforts of the Department of Social Security are more than adequate to meet the need. I should congratulate officers of the Department. Some of them were wading through the waters themselves to deliver benefits at a very early point after the disasters had occurred. Those people I congratulate. My Parliamentary Secretary, Con Sciacca, also visited the areas almost immediately after the disasters occurred in Queensland. I think we have been more than on top of those problems.</PARA>
<PARA> In Newcastle the situation was much the same. We had officers on the spot immediately to help people with their problems. When one looks at it, while the Newcastle earthquake was obviously extremely serious, there were many more affected by the floods, and I think we have met the problems there more than adequately.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="233" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question is one which Senator Coulter gave me some brief notice of and it really in some way should be put on notice because it has a number of parts which are fairly complex. Let me say first of all that the multifunction polis is a future city concept that could assist Australia in meeting the environmental lifestyle and technological challenges of the next century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me explain the expression `multifunction polis' which is not of my making or the making of anybody else here. It is a view of town planners and industrialists that work patterns in the next century will be very much less dictated than they have been in this century by places where people live. That is to say, people will live, work and have their leisure-or tend to-in the same situations as they used to in the Middle Ages. Following the Industrial Revolution there was a breakdown of relationships between workplaces and living places and we now have enormous problems in big cities with people commuting across cities to go to work and to return to their places of leisure and living. It requires a fair conceptual leap to say that, with computers and technology in the next century, these sorts of things will be possible again.</PARA>
<PARA> May I illustrate the point. Major international companies are devoting their next century's strategy to what they call resort offices, which is to say that people will live in the environment which they happen to like and do their work in that environment. It may be the Caribbean or Adelaide or wherever one likes. They will be connected to their corporate headquarters by sophisticated communications systems, and so on. That is likely to happen, and that is in a sense the origin of the expression `multifunction polis'.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator's question has a number of parts, but I just want to say that the MFP would focus on research and development and scientific and new industry development. It would focus on developing skills in core MFP activities. The private sector committees which have been looking at the MFP proposal-thinktanks as they have called them-have identified a number of areas where value can be added to Australian resources, particularly, whether it be in agriculture or transport resources or in the types of services which Australia might appropriately network into South East Asia in the next century-telecommunications services, health services, education services and so on. They are the priority areas which have been considered by the so-called thinktanks which have been composed of academics and members of the 80 Australia companies which have been involved in this project.</PARA>
<PARA> Its purpose would be to foster key growth areas like telecommunications, education and health services, entertainment and environmental management. They would be the core activities of an MFP. I must say that the Government is fully committed to an examination of this concept, its implications for Australia and its overall feasibility in the Australian context. This country is always accused of being a country which is not prepared to look ahead. Indeed I do not mind saying we would not have some of the problems we have today or those we have had in the last few decades if governments, businesses and institutions in the past had been prepared to look a little further ahead than they did. But unless the Government is satisfied that the concept is economically sound, that it can be financed and, most importantly, that it is socially acceptable to the Australian community, it will not go ahead. Those decisions will have to be made in the latter part of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked me a number of other questions. I think his core question was why resources are not channelled into the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and universities in Australia instead of being devoted to a concept like this. The Government has made it quite clear from the beginning that the private sector essentially has the economic carriage of this project. That is to say, Government resources will not be poured into it. If, for example, at the central site of the multifunction polis there were a university or a research institute, of course the Commonwealth would make a contribution to that sort of thing as it would to any other activity of that kind, but it would be available to Australians just as much as any other resource currently funded by government at present.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as Senator Coulter seeks assurances about community consultation, environmental concerns and so on, I just say in the interests of abbreviating this answer that those questions are at the forefront of the Government's mind and they will be addressed. I believe answers which are appropriate will be provided. As Senator Coulter is particularly interested in the concept, I will seek to address those questions with him privately if he wishes, but I do not want to delay the Senate further at this moment.</PARA>

Did this ruling apply particularly to the ballot over a proposal to amalgamate the Electrical Trades Union of Australia (ETU) and the Australasian Society of Engineers (ASE)?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen a decision handed down by Mr Justice Gray of the Federal Court on 6 April concerning the proposed amalgamation of the Electrical Trades Union and the Australasian Society of Engineers. I think it should be said that the judge in his decision recognised that Parliament intended to facilitate amalgamation in its amendments to the Industrial Relations Act but ordered that the unions' resources and funds should not be used to promote a Yes case for amalgamation except in an extraordinarily limited way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The judge's decision, for me at least, is disappointing in that it is clear, I think, from the amendments we put through in the Act in 1988 that Parliament intended to help the merger process by the provisions of the Act, that amalgamation is indeed a strong policy of this Government and of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and that amalgamation of unions is one of the elements critical to succeeding across the wide range of micro-economic reforms that this Government has in view.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision may frustrate the attempt by these two unions, which have demonstrated before the Industrial Relations Commission a clear community of interest. That has been recognised by the Commission, as the Commission has indeed recognised that their successful merger would in fact further the objectives of the Industrial Relations Act. And, might I say to Senator Devereux, it is likely that those two unions would have been eligible for a government grant to promote a Yes case had this action not been taken.</PARA>
<PARA> Since that decision I have received some strong representations from within the trade union movement and from other organisations as well, I might say, to seek ways of overcoming the problem identified by the judge. Quite clearly, the best way to proceed is to amend the Industrial Relations Act. I have announced that I intend to review the Industrial Relations Act and bring amendments to the Budget session this year in order to focus particularly on union amalgamations-but not exclusively. If there are other matters, we can bring those too.</PARA>
<PARA> In the meanwhile, there is this particular case, and there are a number of other cases moving through the pipeline for amalgamation. What I am currently considering is whether or not it would be appropriate for me to make a grant to interested individuals who support an amalgamation where the Industrial Relations Commission has identified a community of interest and where it is said that that amalgamation is consistent with its policy. I recognise some of the inherent dangers in such a course and that is why I am giving it considerable consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case, the ASE and the ETU amalgamation case, it must also be observed, I think, Mr President, that certainly those opposed to the amalgamation, some of whom seem not necessarily to be members of the union, seem to have a plentiful supply of funds to finance the No case. In a situation where there is a clear Federal view of this organisation, it seems inappropriate not to examine ways in which the situation can be rescued.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Recent reports in the media point to a significant expansion in arms sales in the Asia-Pacific region. East-Asian nations spent approximately $US75 billion on defence in the last calendar year. Since January this year the United States (US) alone has issued 11,000 licences for arms sales-almost 60 per cent more licences than were issued in the equivalent period last year. Will the Minister inform the Senate what implications these purchases may have for the stability of the Asia-Pacific region?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="236" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me begin by saying that it is important to appreciate that the Asia-Pacific region is probably the most complex strategic environment in the world. It has not been the centre for engagement of the two superpowers in the way that Europe has been, but there are more independent actors of real significance in this region than elsewhere: not only the two superpowers-the US and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics-but China, Japan and India, as major powers in their own right, plus a number of other significant countries such as Indonesia and our South East Asian neighbours generally, plus the two Koreas and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All countries do have legitimate security interests and concerns and have the right to acquire conventional military capability to ensure their own security. Without this assurance there will be a lack of confidence, leading to regional insecurity. Defence expenditure figures of themselves are not a particularly reliable guide in assessing issues of stability and military power. The more important question is the types of equipment that individual countries purchase and whether this equipment is essentially for defensive reasons or whether, rather, it provides an ability to project and sustain military action against other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, any dramatic change or increase in offensive and power projection military strength in the Asia-Pacific region could be destabilising. In particular, the introduction or expansion of exotic weaponry-by which we essentially refer to nuclear, chemical or missile weapon capabilities-in the region would be particularly destabilising. For instance, I could imagine no more potentially dangerous and destabilising development than the acquisition by North Korea, the DPRK, of a nuclear weapons capability.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for these reasons that Australia is pursuing such an active policy of support for arms control measures, particularly in relation to nuclear, chemical and missile weapon capability. It is also important, of course, to try to resolve issues which might lead to regional conflict or confrontation. Again, our efforts to resolve the Cambodian issue are an example of this.</PARA>
<PARA> I can summarise all of that by saying simply that to the extent that arms purchases-whatever their volume-meet legitimate defensive requirements and thereby contribute to the confidence of regional countries, we see such purchases as contributing to regional stability. If, on the other hand, the arms purchases involve the introduction of exotic forms of weaponry in the region or otherwise unbalance the regional security scene, they obviously do not contribute to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The role of COCOM is to coordinate export controls on strategically sensitive goods and technology without interfering unnecessarily with West-East trade. The lists of controlled goods and technology are subject to a continuous process of review. However, a number of participants have felt for some time that the process has been too slow and too conservative in its approach. At a meeting of COCOM's principal policy making body last October, countries reviewed the economic and political reforms taking place in eastern Europe and agreed to review their controls and COCOM processes. A program of work is under way in this respect. Australia has been pressing for a substantial relaxation of the COCOM processes which in our view are unnecessarily impeding legitimate trade on quite a wide range of technology. Most western European COCOM countries have also been pressing for some time for such liberalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the excellent work of my predecessor Australia set about rationalising agreements with other countries on the payment of our pensions and, indeed, the payment of theirs. We now have agreements signed, or about to be signed, with a range of countries which include Canada, Ireland, Austria, Malta, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. Obviously we have been very active in the last few years. If one looks at the February economic statement one finds an announcement there of a saving by the Government on the non-payment of wives and widows pensions from 1 July next year for those who had not been in Australia during that 12-month period. That involved a saving across the board of about $30m. In the case of Greece and Turkey it involved a saving of about $14m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To enable that saving to be achieved, it would require Australia giving notice to terminate the treaties it signed in 1972 with those two countries. Back in 1972 Australia signed treaties with Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Malta which were to cover the portability of pensions. The following year Australia made a further announcement on portability of pensions which went much further than the terms of the agreement with either Greece or Turkey. So we have in fact done much more than that treaty ever required us to do, and we propose to continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Greece and Turkey, however, neither of those countries has ever abided by those two treaties; so the Australian Government is now looking at giving 12 months notice to terminate. But we would not presume to do that without some adequate consultation with the Greek and Turkish communities in Australia to explain not only the decision to terminate those pensions and get the savings but also our determination to get comprehensive, shared responsibility agreements with Greece and Turkey, which, I might say, would mean inevitably, over time, more money being paid into those countries, particularly Greece, because, looking at the model agreements that we have signed with those countries I mentioned earlier on, there would be many people now in Greece who would be entitled to part and full time age pensions who are not receiving them now and are currently ineligible for benefits. So this is not simply a taking away; it will inevitably lead to many more people in Greece who spent considerable amounts of time in Australia being able to receive Australian pensions.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the next month or so I will continue the meetings that I had this morning with the Greek community in Melbourne and I will be going to Greek and Turkish communities in Australia to explain that. I hope that the communities understand what we are doing and that Australia can proceed along those lines.</PARA>

Currently, 11 Chinooks are mothballed at the base awaiting sale. I also remind the Minister of the previously proven reliability of the helicopter in providing support during natural disasters such as the extensive flooding and fierce storms off the Queensland coast early last year when the Chinook was used to provide invaluable service to the community as it was the only helicopter capable of withstanding the gale force winds in order to rescue people stranded at sea. Though this is not the primary role of the Chinook helicopter, in view of the recent devastating flooding in western Queensland and New South Wales, when evacuation would have been easier and fewer livestock lost if this type of helicopter had been available, will the Minister reconsider the decision in light of the helicopter's effectiveness in supporting the community during such times?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Senator Bjelke-Petersen has followed this general issue with a great deal of interest. I do not agree with her presumption that a lot of livestock were lost because of the unavailability of the Chinook helicopter. Indeed, the support given by the armed services in these floods was deemed adequate by the State Emergency Service, and everything asked for in that period was supplied and dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One does not make defence decisions on the basis of what civilian use they may have. I have ordered that the decision to mothball the Chinooks be reviewed, but for military reasons, not for civilian reasons. We will be looking at that over the next few months. It may be that the decision to mothball them will remain. It may be that a compromise will be reached where some may be restored to service and others basically sold off or used for spare parts. That will be a military decision, not one based on civilian use. There is no denying that if we were to retain some Chinook helicopters they could be put to civilian use.</PARA>
<PARA> There was a lot of publicity and inference in Queensland that in this last unfortunate series of natural disasters somehow the rescue efforts and other contributions were inhibited by the lack of the Chinooks. I deny that. Adequate numbers of planes and helicopters were made available to cover the job. That is attested to by the State emergency services in New South Wales and Queensland. However, the final decision as to whether some, all or no Chinooks are retained will be made in the next few months.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I draw the Minister's attention to recent reports that a lack of quality is jeopardising Australia's wheat industry, which in my home State of South Australia could be worth as much as $1,000m. Overseas buyers of Australian wheat, particularly Russia and the Middle East, are demanding that something be done about falling protein levels in our grain. I ask the Minister what strategies and practices farmers could adopt to combat the problem. Does he think it is serious enough to warrant an education program in rural areas to help wheat growers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="240" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a need to improve the quality of the Australian wheat crop since buyers are becoming more discriminating. Over the past decade there has been some decline, I am informed, in the average protein levels of the Australian wheat crop. The problem is being addressed in a number of ways. The need for improvements in the quality of the Australian wheat crop was one of the reasons why this Government deregulated the domestic wheat market and provided greater flexibility to the Australian Wheat Board for its pooling and commercial operations. These changes have provided more scope for growers to receive appropriate returns for quality in their wheat crop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Wheat Board has also been very active in trying to improve the quality of the Australian wheat crop. For the first time, in the 1989-90 season it has introduced a system of load by load testing and payment for protein within the Australian standard white (ASW) grade, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the crop. A major benefit of this program is that growers delivering ASW wheat will be able to monitor the protein performance of particular varieties and paddocks on their properties. An accumulation of this information should prove invaluable in decision-making. Differential payments for protein within the ASW grade will bring new incentives for growers to improve protein levels in the main part of the Australian crop.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also emphasise that the Wheat Research Council has had this issue high on its agenda. I am sure Senator Panizza would know that. It has held discussions with the Australian Wheat Board and has organised a number of workshops to better define its research priorities. Quality improvement features widely in the Council's strategies. State departments of agriculture now also have programs for raising wheat quality. Raising protein levels is difficult because there has been a trade-off between protein and yield. In the long term, improvements in protein will depend on the maintenance and improvement of soil fertility. This issue will be addressed in the Government's sustainable development strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> To answer the last part of the question-is there a need for an education program?-from the body of my answer Senator Foreman can see that, indeed, a great deal of education is going on. The best way of promoting that education is through the Wheat Research Council, the Wheat Board and the State government authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The separation rate in the Armed Forces has increased over recent years. It is very much the case these days, though, that it will probably never return to the levels of, say, the 1970s. However, it would be very desirable if the separation rate no longer increased but, rather, decreased somewhat. There is a variety of reasons for that and Senator Newman is probably aware of most of those reasons. Some of them are societal-a change in society's attitudes. One of the reasons why it is occurring is simply the fact that the participation rate in the work force is so high and there have been so many opportunities for people to use skills and change jobs. A lot of it is to do with people training for something they may never be required to do. Therefore, to be more successful in future, one has to create within the Armed Forces conditions that are attractive and make people want to remain. There is a variety of options before Government at the moment. I am currently looking at some of those options. My colleague, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Gordon Bilney, is also studying some of those. But I do not think we will ever get back to the separation rates of the mid or early 1970s. However, it is very desirable to reduce the separation rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In her question Senator Newman pointed out the fact that the cost of recruiting and training is remarkably high. The increased rate also highlights one other thing, and that is that not enough training is done in the community as a whole. The Armed Forces are sometimes used just as a recruiting ground by lazy employers who do not want to enter into training themselves; rather, they simply go in and shark out.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that Minister Dawkins's initiative-which will be debated here and I will not anticipate the debate because I would be in breach of Standing Orders-will go a long way in overcoming that problem. It is particularly serious not just in relation to percentages but, rather, in certain areas of the forces where the attrition rate is much higher, and it takes quite a while to attempt to replace those officers. We will have to address specifically those particular issues and look for remedies.</PARA>

Senator Giles rightly says that the three-year national domestic violence education program (NDVEP) will conclude next month, but I think it is fair to say that government and most independent commentators have been impressed with the program and its effectiveness, particularly in increasing community awareness of the issue of domestic violence. I think its importance has been that it recognises and highlights the need for a high level committee coordinated approach between the Commonwealth and State governments to tackle issues in this area, particularly issues arising from a lack of uniformity in both legislation and police practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government firmly believes that the program has been successful, not only as an educative process but also in terms of raising for government and the community issues that need to be picked up and progressed in this term of government. As I said, the issues do relate to the area of Commonwealth-State relations, and the Prime Minister's announcement on 2 March goes very much to the establishment and continuation of a process to ensure that there is coordination in this extremely important area.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles asked specifically about education in this area. As part of the commitment given by the Prime Minister, the Committee will get funding in the vicinity of $1.35m over three years to provide a coordinated national strategy on all forms of violence against women, including of course spousal abuse, elder abuse and rape. It is anticipated that this coordinating role which will be undertaken by the Commonwealth-State Committee on Violence will be one that will continue also the community education undertaken under the previous NDVEP. Of course, it will ensure that the issues related to the Commonwealth-State coordination, the priorities for uniformity, the priorities for education, and the priority for attention given to legislation and police practices will be addressed over the forthcoming three years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 May just a couple of days ago Prince Sihanouk issued a statement in Beijing saying that he would be taking a long leave of absence from his position as leader of the Resistance Coalition, the national government of Cambodia. He also said that he would not attend a meeting with State of Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen, planned for the first week of June in Tokyo. Prince Sihanouk said that he was taking leave because of his age and his wish to leave war and politics and devote himself to the rehabilitation of his people through marshalling international assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prince Sihanouk has stepped aside from the leadership of the resistance on several occasions in the past, essentially to gain room for manoeuvre in the settlement process and in relations with his coalition partners. I have to say, however, that his latest announcement came as a great surprise to everyone since he had only very recently agreed to meet Hun Sen in Tokyo. It has not been entirely unknown in the past for Prince Sihanouk to change his mind. That cannot be ruled out. We certainly hope he will reconsider his position on this occasion. He has a very important continuing part to play in the settlement process and if his meeting with Hun Sen in Tokyo does not proceed this will certainly constitute an unfortunate setback to the emerging process of dialogue among the Cambodian parties which is so crucial if a comprehensive settlement is to be achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censure the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, for failing to meet the required standards in the conduct of his office as a Senior Law Officer of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA>I said in this chamber yesterday that we believed we had a responsibility to ensure that this Government met the high standards that the people of Australia had a right to expect of it. I regret to say so early in this Parliament, this Government, through the conduct of one of its senior Ministers, Senator Tate, has demonstrated that it is not meeting that high standard. </PARA>
<PARA> This censure relates to two aspects of the matter that we have been discussing in Question Time. On the first of those I think it is fair to say that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, has already been convicted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) although it might be said that he was being put on a good behaviour bond. That is his interference during the course of a press conference with the conduct of justice as it occurs in Thailand by presuming the guilt of a certain person who had been arrested there for being in possession of a quantity of heroin. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of this censure motion refers to a matter of which we might say the Prime Minister acquitted Senator Tate, but which on all evidence indicates that that acquittal was wrong. That is the Minister's recklessness or at least gross negligence in the conduct of his responsibilities which led to a trial in New South Wales being aborted. </PARA>
<PARA> This sorry matter commenced with a press release put out by Senator Tate, a press release of 2 May 1990. I refer to but one paragraph of that press release. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Minister for Justice, Senator Michael Tate, today released details of Australian involvement in the arrest of Prasert Yooyen in Bangkok, and the seizure of approximately 30 kg of high grain heroin. </PARA>
<PARA>That press release was the teaser. It was designed to interest the press because at the bottom was a note:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate will be available to expand on the details of this release at 12.15 p.m. at the Ministerial Wing entrance. </PARA>
<PARA>So Senator Tate expanded, Mr President, and we have a few excerpts of what he said. What he said is, in our opinion, the evidence upon which he should be convicted on the second count I have mentioned. He said, on the first count:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt this man has been the number one importer of heroin into Australia during the 1980s. Therefore this particular arrest will utterly shatter and, I believe, demoralise the forces of those who are peddling these drugs of death and destruction into our country. </PARA>
<PARA>There he is saying out of his own mouth that there is no doubt that this man has been the No. 1 importer-someone who is not convicted, simply arrested. As I said, Mr President, even the Prime Minister said that that was an intolerable exercise of Senator Tate's duties. What the Prime Minister failed to do, of course, was to take the step that followed, that is, to acknowledge that such standards could not be tolerated of his Ministers, particularly a Minister for Justice, and to dismiss Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the censure is what the Opposition is really concerned to discuss today, that is, the conduct of the Minister which resulted in the trial being aborted and his recklessness and gross negligence in doing so. The trial, of course, was a trial that was taking place in Sydney of, among others, the sister of the man in Thailand and of whom Senator Tate was talking, a person who had been arrested approximately a year earlier. We learnt today in Question Time that Senator Tate knew of the arrest of this person at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Tate has denied is that he knew that the trial was taking place. That, in our view, is irrelevant. If the trial was not taking place, the trial was pending. So Senator Tate knew that there was a trail to take place, at least, of the female Yooyen in New South Wales at the same time as he was making not only these allegations but these conclusions about the conduct of the male Yooyen in Bangkok. </PARA>
<PARA> The court in New South Wales said that this was intolerable, prejudiced justice, prejudiced a fair trial for the female Yooyen in New South Wales and prejudiced a fair trail for the other defendants as well. The judge, therefore, said that he had no alternative but to dismiss the jury. </PARA>
<PARA> The question, therefore, was: Should Senator Tate have known of the connection between the two Yooyens? Was he given any indication of any cause to have made further inquiries than he did? Was he in fact negligent in his duty in running the press conference and therefore prejudicing and determining that the trial in New South Wales be aborted? The answer, Mr President, is clearly yes. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer was obvious to the judge himself in New South Wales when he said-and I quote from the judgment of Judge Graham:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the person is or may legitimately be speculated to be the brother of one of the accused in the present trial. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate knew that they were both of the same name. He told us that he had received a briefing or had been advised of the arrest of the first Yooyen in relation to drug matters. We accept that Senator Tate has taken an interest in this area of the law and has taken an interest in trying to combat drug importations from Thailand. So he knew of that connection one year before this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that Senator Tate give consideration to putting before the Senate not only the report of the Australian Federal Police in relation to the arrest of the male Yooyen in Thailand but also the report he received from the AFP in relation to the arrest of the female Yooyen in Sydney a year before. So, he knew the female Yooyen had been arrested a year before. He presumably knew the trial was pending, if he believed it had not already started, although it is interesting to note that the trial had in fact been taking place for some weeks and that there had been press items relating to it. One can only wonder how the Minister can indicate, presuming he has been briefed properly on these matters-if he has not, that is his responsibility and he cannot pass the buck again-that he did not know of the existence of the trial. But even if he did not know the trial had already commenced, he knew it was pending. He knew that there were parties concerned of the same name, in circumstances where certainly a judge of the court in New South Wales concluded that there could be quite reasonable speculation that they were related. </PARA>
<PARA> This is different, because Senator Tate gets briefed on these matters. We now learn today that he was briefed by the AFP on the arrest of the male Yooyen in Thailand. This is not any simple drug arrest, I remind you, Mr President. This is an arrest of the person Senator Tate refers to as the No. 1 importer of heroin into Australia during the 1980s. He received a brief from the AFP on that, and we are asked today to accept that that brief makes no connection between this person who has been arrested-this major drug exporter to Australia-and his sister, who is standing trial in New South Wales on drug importation charges, charges relating to heroin being imported from Thailand. I have to say that it is asking a great deal of this Senate to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> But the matter is even worse. Not only do we have to accept this extraordinary set of circumstances, we have to accept a number of others matters as well. We learn of these matters through this exchange of letters between the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Prime Minister. One of the things we have to accept is that Senator Tate was not told by his staff of the name of the person standing trial. Interestingly, the staff member-we read from this document-has a different recollection. It is said in the letter from Mr Duffy to the Prime Minister that the staff member briefing Senator Tate before he played out this press conference and the subsequent doorstop briefings to the press `informed me that he recalled in relation to the Australian connection mentioning names to the Minister'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate says, `I do not recall that' and, not surprisingly, Mr Duffy and the Prime Minister decide that the Minister needs protecting and the poor staff member was clearly the one who has the faulty memory. We might say again, `Let us give Senator Tate the benefit of a second doubt'. But there is a third stage to this scenario. Senator Tate recalls that he was told that there was nothing to be said about any Australian links. What are the Australian links? Would not any Minister who was doing half his job properly ask the staff member, `What are the Australian links? What do I need to be careful about?'</PARA>
<PARA> Let us put it into context. This is a Minister who accepts that he knew of the arrest of the female Yooyen, who has taken an interest in this whole area, who has been to Bangkok and been briefed on the procedures; he knows what the AFP is doing up there. He now receives a further brief from the AFP about the arrest of the male Yooyen. He goes to the press and says, `This is the major importer of drugs into Australia'. The staff member says to him, in effect, `Beware of the Australian links when you go into this press conference later today'. Senator Tate says, `I really do not draw any conclusion from that at all'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would put to you, Mr President, that that is just too much to accept. At the very least, what the Minister should have done was explore the links and ensure not only that he did not detrimentally affect the trial that was to take place in Thailand but also that there was no way in which he was going to interfere with the proper conduct of justice in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very least we say that he was grossly negligent in his conduct and the result of his conduct, of course, was that the trial in New South Wales had to be aborted. The Minister told us yesterday that once things have settled down the trial can go ahead again. I think the Prime Minister and Mr Duffy may have said that as well in their letters. We are talking about a notorious family in this matter. This is not the sort of matter that will settle down. By his very conduct the Minister has ensured that it will not settle down because the trial has clearly been aborted in circumstances where there has been a great deal of public interest and public concern-and so there should be public concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up the time of the Senate in recalling previous occasions when Senator Tate has failed to meet the standard of responsibility that can be reasonably expected of a Minister, although some of my colleagues may well do so in the course of this debate. If it were a one-off instance, it may be argued that there was a little more merit in the Prime Minister's bestowal of a good behaviour bond and acquittal on the second count, but I say that that is not so. This matter is serious, and it must be put into the context of a series of occasions when the standard required of this Minister has been found to be lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Minister himself has previously put publicly what he regards as the standard to be adopted by Ministers and the level of conduct that the public has a right to expect of Ministers in these circumstances. I commend him for doing so. I make reference to one speech that he gave on 3 September 1988 entitled, `The Process of Effective Criminal Law Reform'. In that speech he talked about the Independent Commission Against Corruption legislation in New South Wales. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not need to emphasise to an audience such as this that a court always has the inherent power to deal with prejudicial pre-trial publicity in one of four ways; it may order the suppression of future publications; order a change of venue; it may delay the proceedings; or it may grant, in exceptional circumstances, a stay of proceedings. These are, of course, common law powers and capable of expansion or restriction at the instance of members of our judiciary. It is sanguine to recount the words of Justice Wills in the Queen v. Park, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>It is possible, very effectually, to poison the fountain of justice before it begins to flow. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret to say that this Minister in this instance, through recklessness or gross negligence, poisoned the fountain of justice before it began to flow and for that he deserves the censure of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Parliament has now met for three days. We have had a Question Time devoted to this issue, which has all the charm and warmth of the tip of an ice-cube, I suspect, in terms of its relative importance. As I said, the whole of Question Time has been devoted to this issue, and we are now debating a censure motion. I must say, as a relatively impartial observer, that I do not think the Opposition made much progress during Question Time, and nor did it during the last Parliament when it prepared series of questions on various issues. After the first two or three questions had been answered, Opposition senators kept asking the questions as if there were some logic about that program of questions. That was not so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this censure motion Senator Hill says that Senator Tate has failed to meet the required standards. He referred to a series of occasions on which Senator Tate is alleged to have done this. He did not identify that series of occasions. The argument turns on two issues. The first is the assumption in Senator Tate's remarks at the doorstop conference of the presumed guilt of a person arrested in Thailand. It is good enough for Senator Hill to come in here today and refer to this family as a notorious family. I do not think Senator Hill suspects that that sort of remark made in the Senate-to refer to these people, brother and sister, as a notorious family-will have much effect on the conduct of a trial in Thailand. I do not think Senator Hill expects that that remark by him will have any influence on a trial in Thailand or any effect on a trial in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I think Senator Hill is showing a sense of perspective, because for all the rhetoric on the other side of the chamber does anybody seriously believe that Senator Tate's comments made last Wednesday will affect the course of justice in Thailand?</PARA>

Of course, that is a matter for subjective judgment by each individual as to what influence he might have, but I think Senator Hill really gave that point away quite early in his piece and went to his main point, which was the effects on the trial in Australia. That issue made very little progress today in Question Time. In fact, the elaboration of the information contained in the letters of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) by Senator Tate today only goes to the question of his discussion with the Director of Public Prosecutions on the aircraft and his first awareness of the trial in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill says that we are asked to take a few things for granted in the course of this debate. I agree with that. Senator Hill goes through this tortuous attempt to make a connection between an arrest in early 1989 and the trial in Sydney, which has recently taken place, and the arrest of a person in Thailand a week or so ago. Senator Hill can exclude this smokescreen, this sweet-smelling argument that he puts forward like some bug which does it for its own protection, but all that is clear about all this is that Senator Tate did not make that connection. </PARA>

That is what he is talking about-an operational connection. Senator Hill asked for the tabling of those documents. They cannot be tabled because they reveal operational matters which cannot be tabled in the Senate. I know it is a long time since those opposite have had any experience in government, but one cannot as a responsible Minister table documents which go to the effect of secret or undercover police operations. It is no good Senator Hill interjecting, `Why do you not table all the documents?'. That cannot be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two points. First, in relation to a trial, presumably a pending trial, in Thailand, people here in the Senate and elsewhere will make their own judgments about the effects on the process of justice in Thailand of his comments at a doorstop interview. People will reach their own conclusions about the likely effects of those remarks on the process of justice in Thailand. I do not think Senator Hill really sees that point in connection as being very important because he certainly did not advance the argument very far. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point relates to the effects on the trial in Sydney. Of course, Senator Tate, the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have said that the consequences of Senator Tate's remarks have been most unfortunate. Of course, they are unfortunate because, according to the judge, they led to the aborting of a trial. Apart from the fact that the consequences were unfortunate, nothing can be said other than what Senator Tate himself has said about the circumstances leading to those remarks, namely, that he was unaware of the existence of a trial in Sydney and unaware of the relationship between the arrest in early 1989 of the persons who were on trial in Sydney last week and the arrest in Thailand. In terms of his intentions in relation to this matter and the information available to him, the remarks which he made can be described as nothing more than unfortunate in terms of the consequences which followed in the Sydney trial. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have exchanged correspondence in this matter which has been tabled in the Senate. The circumstances of last Wednesday's events have been fully described in that correspondence and the Prime Minister has exercised his judgment about the matter in view of Senator Tate's intentions and the information available to him, and also because of what I would say is an almost impeccable record in Senator Tate's administration of the justice portfolio, particularly in relation to the restructuring of the Federal Police in Australia, the appointment of an overseas network which was involved in the operations the subject of discussion, the enhancement of capacity for crucial intelligence against drug traffickers and a whole range of issues and procedures which have been enlivened, as it were, and performance improved as a result of the initiatives taken by this Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate has been intimately associated with those matters. I do not think there is any suggestion by anybody, even the Opposition, of any dishonesty or lack of integrity on Senator Tate's part. The worst allegation that can be made is the one that has been made here by Senator Hill that the Minister should have known of a particular set of circumstances of which he was not aware. In the Prime Minister's judgment, and in the documents that are tabled in his exchange of correspondence with the Attorney-General, there are a number of suggestions about how there could be improvements in making sure that both the Attorney and the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs are made aware of trials which are taking place and any relevant facts relating to those trials. It is a matter of regret that it was not done prior to this series of events but it will be done in the future, and Senator Tate will remain Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs and be responsible for administering those changes. </PARA>

I might say at the outset that Senator Button's defence and his evaluation of the seriousness of this matter are unique to Senator Button.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He needed oxygen. That was a very vivid example of the importance that should be attached to this problem. It is not the Opposition's case at all that Senator Tate ever knew that this trial was proceeding. We accept, of course, his denial of that; everyone has accepted his denial of knowledge that the trial was going on. The case we make against Senator Tate is based on a number of things. One, of course, is that this was no ordinary trial. This was a very serious trial, a very important trial, which was aborted because of some remarks of Senator Tate which were not carefully thought out or carefully prepared. We also have a concern, despite Senator Button's nonchalant attitude about the matter, about the effect that Senator Tate's remarks may well have on the position of the drug dealer Mr Yooyen in Thailand, whose arrest by Thai police was the basis of Senator Tate's statement and the beginning of this matter. So Senator Button's defence is extraordinary because his evaluation of this subject would not be supported even by Senator Tate himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what other perhaps more important players in this matter have said about Senator Tate's conduct. In relation to the effect on the position of Mr Yooyen in Thailand, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in his letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), which was tabled yesterday, says this on page 3:</PARA>
<PARA> I have also expressed my dismay to Senator Tate that in the course of his press conference he had presumed the guilt of the person arrested in Thailand. He agrees with me that his comments were unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is not the Opposition impugning Senator Tate about Mr Yooyen's position in Thailand; it is a very deep concern of the Attorney-General himself and presumably of the Prime Minister. I come to the Prime Minister and his attitude to this matter. Of course, we have read the document that was tabled and the very inadequate, limp, lame reasons the Prime Minister has given for not dismissing Senator Tate or calling for his resignation. In answer to a question yesterday in the House of Representatives from the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, Mr Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA> We-</PARA>
<PARA>speaking of himself and the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy-</PARA>
<PARA>are appalled at the lapse of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are dealing here with no ordinary error of judgment, no ordinary incompetence or failure or mistake on the part of a Minister. None of us expect Ministers to be perfect, but we are here dealing with a very serious mistake made by a Minister. Although I will deal with the question of his incompetent handling of the matter, which is really the basis of our charge, I think it is fair to say that, where a Minister personally is involved in a matter that has caused serious trouble, that in itself is a basis for his resignation. </PARA>
<PARA> This was no ordinary trial; it was a trial of three or four people who had been arrested in January 1989, about 12 months before the trial began. They were arrested and charged with conspiracy to import into Australia about 10 kilograms of heroin with a street value of $10m. Their arrest and their initial appearance in court, as Senator Tate has now admitted today, was known to him roughly, I presume, about that time in the early part of 1989. The trial itself was one that had proceeded, I understand, for some weeks prior to these remarks which led to the judge having to abort the trial. </PARA>
<PARA> These prosecutions of people alleged to be importing large quantities of heroin from overseas are very difficult trials indeed. The costs involved in preparation and the length of this trial up to the time it was aborted, of which Senator Tate has given no indication, will be not inconsiderable, taking into account the Crown, defence counsel, witnesses and so on. There is also the problem of witnesses perhaps being brought from overseas for these trials. I do not know whether that is the case here, but these are very difficult and very expensive trials. Certainly this was a most important trial and one which, as I said, was no ordinary trial. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate's defence is simply this: he did not know that the trial was taking place. My Leader, Senator Hill, has already gone through a good deal of the detail to show why Senator Tate should have known or understood that a trial was taking place, and he certainly should have made the inquiries at the time before he made these remarks after the press conference. But I think we ought just to recall for a moment what Judge Graham in the District Court of New South Wales said when he gave his reasons for aborting this very serious, complicated and difficult trial. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is one particular feature of the publicity which is of concern. It is, in particular, the set of statements attributed to the Commonwealth Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, who was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying among other things, ``There is no doubt that this man has been the number one importer of heroin into Australia during the 1980s.''</PARA>
<PARA>That was said by Senator Tate not in his statement but because he sought further press publicity and obtained it. He took full measure of the opportunity he had of having the ear of the press and he made these very great claims and allegations against this man who had recently been arrested in Thailand: `There is no doubt that this man has been the number one importer of heroin into Australia during the 1980s.' Judge Graham continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The same words were used by Senator Tate and he was seen to be uttering them when interviewed by the media during the course of the news program last night. He went on to refer to a belief that hundreds of kilograms had been trafficked into Australia by Prasert Yooyen [in Thailand] since the early 1980s and further stated, `The distribution of hundreds of kilograms of heroin throughout Australia requires a major network and we have intelligence holdings which I can't reveal to you about the nature of that network. </PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Senator Tate . . . was confident that the disruption of supply would throw the distribution network into disarray and that that would give leads which would be followed up. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand Senator Tate's answer today, he was only talking about some abstract principle or conception; there was a network. He did not have any names and we accept that he did not receive any names. But a network involves many people, and many people in Australia. There was talk about an Australian connection or Australian links, whatever the phrases were. Senator Tate, as Minister for Justice, has gained a great deal of publicity for himself over the years about his commendable work in this fight against drugs. But he has sought and received a lot of publicity for it. However, it has to be about Australians. The connections are not just some abstract thing as a network; rather, they are people. He knows that there has been trial after trial of these people in Australia. When he is thinking about the fact that there would be a great disruption of the supply which would throw these systems into disarray, he must clearly have had in mind the fact that people-Australians, or people in Australia-were being investigated by the police and who probably had been arrested and charged by the police, and who may well be on trial as a result of their participation in these heinous activities with which he has so rightly been concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what I find so extraordinary about the defence that so far Senator Tate has put up. He will have to do a lot better when he speaks in this debate, as I understand he intends to do. He will certainly have to do a lot better than his Leader, Senator Button. But in view of the statements that he has made-they are clearly on the record; they are in the judgment; and they were the reasons which motivated the judge in aborting that trial-he must have had in mind, when talking about an Australian link or Australian connection, that there was talk about people who would be the subject of police inquiries and charges. Once one talks about that, one must then think of the possibility of trials. </PARA>
<PARA> It certainly was not that there was no defence that Senator Tate was not in any way warned about these things. When one looks at Mr Duffy's letter to the Prime Minister, one finds that there seems to be some failing in communication from the Prosecutor, through the police, to Senator Tate's staff and to Senator Tate. I find it very disturbing indeed that, on such an important matter, there was such inadequate communication. I think that we would have been better served as a Parliament if the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and Senator Tate had provided us with some better explanation of those very great failings that appear in that communication to Senator Tate. But, despite that, the following fact is now incorporated in Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate recalls that he was told there was nothing to be said by him about any ``Australian links'' but [he said] at no stage was he informed that a trial was in progress. </PARA>
<PARA>The staff member told Mr Duffy that in relation to the Australian connection he recalled mentioning names to the Minister, but the Minister's recollection is that he was told nothing about any particular Australian end of the operation and no mention was made of the names of persons, domestic operations or trials. However, it is clear that the Minister was told about an Australian connection and Australian links when he talks about `a particular' Australian. Perhaps there was no reference to a particular Australian, but it must have been in his mind that Australians would have been involved. With all his past knowledge acquired over the years as Minister for Justice about the activities of people in this trade, he must have been very well aware that there were people involved and it was not just some sort of abstract network that he was talking about. It seems unbelievable that when he was told this, he, with his experience and with the responsibility that he was carrying, would not have checked it. When his staff member told him this, if he had checked with the staff and found the staff person had not perhaps got it straight from the Federal Police and then the Federal policeman had perhaps not done his job as well as he was told to do it by the Prosecutor, this sorry episode would never have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is the responsibility of Senator Tate, and that is why we ask that the Senate pass this motion of censure on him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to begin this contribution to what I take to be a most serious debate, because it involves a possible censure. I repeat what I said yesterday: that I do regard this as a matter of great seriousness and, indeed, yesterday in my public mea maxima culpa I think I indicated that I do believe that I was guilty of a serious lapse in relation to some of the matters that I expressed at the press conference last Wednesday. But I greatly appreciate at least Senator Durack's acceptance, apparently on behalf of the Opposition in the Senate, that I was never aware of the trial being conducted in Sydney. That is a very important matter, and not just to be put to one side, because I believe that that at least upholds the integrity of the statements that I have tried to make to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), which have been the subject of his letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in that I have been scrupulously honest in outlining my state of mind last Wednesday, and I am pleased that the Deputy Opposition Leader in the Senate, Senator Durack, at least has not gone so far as the shadow Attorney-General (Mr Peacock), who in his press release has accused me of perverting the course of justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To say that to pervert the course of justice is a most criminal offence is, of course, an understatement. The shadow Attorney-General has accused me in his press release-not in the Parliament, as I understand it, and not subsequently in his media interviews but in his written press release-of perverting the course of justice, which of course requires a quite intentional and deliberate attempt to defeat the course of a particular trial. It is highly defamatory. I am delighted that the Depputy Leader of the Opposition, I take it on behalf of the Opposition parties in the Senate, has withdrawn from making any such accusation against me. So there is no suggestion, apparently, that I ever intentionally or deliberately set out to cause any disruption, any undermining of the trial in Sydney, because I was unaware of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat-because apparently Senator Vanstone did not quite grasp the description of the event: The first I learnt of the trial was indeed when I was seated next to Mr Mark Weinberg, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, 30,000 feet in the air on a flight from Canberra to Melbourne. At that stage he indicated that he had concern. Naturally I shared that concern, but in the confines of the aircraft there was nothing I could do. That was the first time I became aware of the trial in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> If one asks with what intention or motive I approached the particular issuing of a press release and the press conference subsequently at the ministerial entrance, it was no more than to enhance the recognition by the Australian public of a major international cooperative, collaborative effort involving law enforcement agencies from Thailand, the United States and Australia which led to a major arrest in Thailand. I was trying to point to the confidence in the ability and integrity of each other's agencies which had allowed that cooperative endeavour to have its fruit in the successful arrest of a particular person. That was the only intention and motive which I had in my mind. Of course, as I say, I am pleased that the Opposition is not saying, as appeared to be the case in the press release of the shadow Attorney-General, that I may have intentionally or deliberately set out to undermine the particular trial in Sydney. Nothing could be further from my endeavours as a Minister concerned to stop the trafficking of drugs into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack has referred quite rightly not only to my expression of deep regret at the course of events and my language which led to the judge concluding that he must take the view that a jury might be affected by those particular words which I uttered. Naturally, a jury in a criminal trial should be influenced only by the evidence which is presented to it. I believe that the Prime Minister has indicated by his very wholehearted rebuke which he delivered publicly in the House of Representatives yesterday that the whole Government shares that particular concern. Indeed, it was a very public rebuke. For a Minister to be rebuked in that way in a proceeding in this Parliament is to be subjected to, I can assure honourable senators, a measure of punishment which-whilst it has been underrated, I believe, by Senator Durack-is a very real one to a Minister concerned. It is one thing to face the anger or wrath of a Prime Minister in the privacy of his own office-and that is bad enough-but I can assure honourable senators that it adds a peculiar dimension to the whole process when that rebuke is delivered in the way it certainly was in the chamber yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, I submit to his judgment and his language in relation to the matter. No doubt, in his mind, and in senators' minds too quite rightly, the consequences to me would have been far more fatal had I been aware of the trial in Sydney. I think, now we have clarified that no-one is suggesting that I was so aware. </PARA>
<PARA> What occurred, fundamentally, was a confusion in the communication to me of vital information which would have greatly influenced remarks I may have uttered last Wednesday. In fact, I suppose-everyone has the luxury of hindsight-that had I been informed of the matters of which I should have been informed, then I doubt whether I would have uttered any words, certainly not at the ministerial entrance, and probably not issued a press release of any character at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It has never been the practice for the office of the Minister for Justice to be informed of trials which are pending or are currently taking place. That particular lack of a procedure-as I say, I have never been informed in a structured way of such matters-led to the confusion which I mentioned in Question Time. So in a pressure situation when information should have reached me in a speedy and adequate way, the lines of communication broke down. That is something for which I accept a responsibility and have, of course, at the direction or the suggestion of the Attorney and the direction of the Prime Minister, ensured that procedures are put in place which will allow for a more structured notification of certainly trials in progress and those which are pending. Of course, there are many trials in progress at any one time in relation to trafficking of drugs in Australia. I guess I will have to look at those as they are brought to my notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to my knowledge of the arrest, I have conceded that I knew of the arrest of certain persons back in January 1989. I find it difficult to give only a partial indication of what was in the brief about the arrest, but I will tell the Senate that I was informed of the names of the two Australians and was informed that two Thais were also arrested. The names of the Thais were not given to me. In that situation-and I think it may help clarify some of the matters which have been put to me by Senator Durack-what occurred was a deplorable situation, in that I was left in ignorance of very vital information. I believe that that matter is now remedied and I think that, in so far as that action has been taken, the responsibility which I have to ensure, obviously, that that saga of events does not recur has been carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I need to say, and I do admit, that in relation to that particular press conference I was carried away by an enthusiasm for the collaborative and cooperative effort which had issued in the arrest of that person in Thailand. I did so because-and I cannot repeat the assertions I made on that occasion-I did regard it of absolutely fundamental significance in the international fight against drug trafficking. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not quite know the significance of that interjection. It was interesting that on the 7.30 Report last night, where Paul Lyneham made an attack, it was actually the third item-at least in the Canberra segment of the 7.30 Report, which I think is broadcast out of Sydney. The first item actually dealt with the death of two teenage girls in Sydney from heroin overdose. It took me back to the fact that my interest in this matter began in 1978 when I was in Sydney for a conference. I stayed at Kings Cross, went for a walk along Darlinghurst Road and noticed a fellow and his girlfriend slump on the footpath in front of me into the shelter of a doorway; they were obviously high on heroin. I said, `Can I give you a hand, mate?'. He said `Yes. Can you get me down to one of the squats towards Woolloomooloo?'. I bundled them into the back of a taxi, took them down, put them into one of the squats there and went up to the Wayside Chapel and put them on the blanket and soup run for that night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What made me very angry at the time was that whilst I did what anybody would do in a one to one situation with vulnerable young Australians whose veins were filled by these unscrupulous profiteers, no-one was getting at the profiteers, the financiers, the business people, the major organisers of the distribution of heroin out of the Golden Triangle into Australia. Therefore, I suppose, when I got the opportunity that I did three years ago to assume this particular role, I did so with some vigour. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I have concentrated on setting up an international liaison officer network which by some lateral thinking overcomes the fact that we in Australia, being an island continent, have a 3,500-kilometre coastline between Broome and Cairns every kilometre of which cannot be subject to Coastwatch surveillance 24 hours a day; we have almost 700,000 containers crossing our wharves every year; and we have millions of passengers coming through our airports every year. Rather than wait and have our law enforcement agencies try to deal with the matter domestically when heroin arrives in Australia I have been concerned to put AFP officers overseas into our embassies abroad in order to gather information and intelligence and to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, whether in Bangkok, Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong or Cyprus and more recently, of course, in South America in order to combat the drug barons who are targeting Australia with their cocaine in order to generate once again an international cash flow simply to keep their private armies and mercenaries well armed in order to defeat, in Columbia, for example, the oldest democracy in South America. </PARA>
<PARA> It is through that particular program of setting in place the overseas liaison officers and my wrenching the Australian Federal Police away from its old duties to streamline it-with 10-year contracts, for example, an absolutely revolutionary change in the way in which police are employed in this country-and through other measures which ensure that most severe penalties, including loss of superannuation, are felt by those who are tainted by corruption in the service of the Australian Federal Police that I have tried to create a situation where drug trafficking into Australia is either stopped in the source country or certainly the information that comes to us enables arrests to take place, charges to be laid and successful prosecutions to take place here. </PARA>
<PARA> In all this, senators will appreciate that I would do nothing, given that sort of background and commitment, to bring about the dismissal of a jury in relation to an importing charge in Sydney. I very much, as I say, regret that in the words that I uttered there were strong references to the person arrested in Thailand in a way which assumed his guilt; that is what the judge and the Prime Minister have asserted, and I naturally adopt that characterisation of my language. </PARA>
<PARA> But I believe that I can continue to offer to this nation-and I ask the Senate to indicate that it believes I can-service in the particular battle which is being waged in order to shape the future of Australians, more particularly young Australians. Senator O'Chee gave a superb maiden speech last night when he spoke of the way in which young Australians have so much to contribute to the future of this nation if they are allowed to have their full potential realised by an adult society which is prepared to create the conditions in which their creativity and their contribution can be made manifest to the benefit of us all. He was speaking as a young man of 24 on behalf of that generation of young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly my great desire that the future of young Australians not be moulded and shaped by the drug barons and war lords of the Golden Triangle as they peddle their drugs in Australia. In so far as I have begun that battle, I ask the Senate to indicate by its vote that it wishes me to continue in that particular task. I do accept, as I have said, that my remarks were most unfortunate, to adopt the language of the judge in the District Court in Sydney. But in the context of my personal ministerial commitment to the fight against drug trafficking, I ask the Senate to reject the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the letter written on 9 May by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) there is a sentence which I think sums up the matter under debate. The Prime Minister states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I agree with you that it is most regrettable that the Minister made remarks to the media which presumed the guilt of the person arrested in Thailand and also caused the Judge to conclude that he must abort the trial in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>I find only one difficulty with that particular sentence and that is the word `and' because, indeed, it was the presumption of the guilt of the person arrested in Thailand that caused the judge to abort the trial in Sydney. That is clear from a reading of the judge's comments. The connection that is made between someone who is guilty in Thailand with the people on trial in Australia is really the point in issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button in his defence of Senator Tate raised the point-and I must say I agree with him-that the press comment made by Senator Tate about the proceedings here, even carried on our national media, will have no effect whatsoever on the operation of the Thai legal system. That is not the point. The point is that the comments that were made had an effect on the operation of the Australian legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to speak over long, but simply point out what the substance of the exercise is. It can be seen from the comments that have been made, the documents produced in the House of Representatives and the answers given today by Senator Tate, that undoubtedly Senator Tate knew, first, that a number of people had been arrested last year, including a number of Thai nationals; secondly, that links were alleged to exist between those people who were arrested and others in Thailand; thirdly, the identity of the person arrested in Thailand; fourthly, the alleged links between that person arrested in Thailand and others in Australia. All of those items have come out in the last few days. All of them are in fact readily believable since any Minister doing his job-I have always had a very high personal regard for Senator Tate and the job that he does; he has always seemed to me to be on top of the detail-would know each of those four elements. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Senator Tate did not know when he made those comments that the trial was in existence. However, in terms of Senator Tate's ministerial responsibility he should have known. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody has doubted Senator Tate's integrity or honesty with regard to this. What is impugned is in fact the operation of his ministerial responsibility in this matter. The Prime Minister's statements in answer to questions in the House of Representatives very clearly and very directly also impugned Senator Tate's ministerial responsibility. In terms of the various statements that Senator Tate has just made to the Senate, those of us-and I include in this, I am sure, Senator Hill-who have worked with the Minister have absolutely no doubt as to his contribution to the fight against crime. That is not an issue. He has made a sterling contribution to the fight against crime, and that I readily acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> But despite my personal regard for him, and in fact my party's regard for him, and because of that distinct failing in ministerial responsibility in that he should have known of the damage that would be caused by the remarks that he made to the press and in that he should have known that those remarks to the press would be carried widely, we can do nothing but join with the Opposition in supporting this censure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the remarks that Senator Macklin has made in relation to the personal respect that I think all members of the chamber hold for Senator Tate and for the way in which he has sought to discharge his responsibilities and his motivation in that matter. Indeed, he and I have spent time in Sydney looking at issues of drug abuse, AIDS policy and youth homelessness in an attempt to find some way in which these matters might be addressed, in terms of national policy, in a way which would not be combative or partisan or indeed which would fail to address those problems directly. That is not the issue. Senator Tate's intentions, Senator Tate's motivations and Senator Tate's integrity are not at issue in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin has rightly said that the question of proper discharge of his ministerial responsibility is what lies at the heart of this censure motion. Senator Tate remarked at the outset that he had made something of a mea culpa; and it is a combination, in terms of his guilt in that sense, of both sins of omission and sins of commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The sins of commission are these: first, as one of the most senior law officers of the Crown he departed from the established principle of accepting the concept of a person, whether they happen to be in Australia or they happen to be in Thailand, being innocent until proven guilty. I am not a lawyer but I think the phrase which is used in the texts about this is that that presumption of innocence constitutes the golden thread which runs through the course of common law. Senator Tate, by his comments-not, I might say, throwaway comments or simply on-the-run comments but comments made as a result of putting out a press release at the bottom of which it says, `Senator Tate will be available to expand on the details of this release at 12.15 p.m. at the Ministerial Wing entrance'-and in deliberately choosing to make a statement to the media, made a statement in which the presumption of innocence, the very cornerstone upon which Ministers are charged with the solemn obligation to see justice done, was put to one side and a person was condemned by the Minister in a way which, as Senator Macklin has said, led to consequences in Australia which are consequences that neither Senator Tate nor anybody who has participated in this debate finds to be anything other than absolutely unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, he has caused, as Senator Macklin has said, trial proceedings to be aborted. They were expensive proceedings. But let us leave aside the question of whether they were expensive or not expensive and simply ask the question: can they ever be put back on the footing where they can be dealt with fairly? Will there ever be a situation where that matter can now be looked at without some juror at some stage having formed a view and that view being of such a nature as to permanently call into question the capacity of that trial to be conducted in the way it should be conducted?</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at what His Honour Judge Graham had to say, I think we will see in the details of his judgment that in fact that becomes extremely difficult. If we look at the statements made by Mr Duffy and by Mr Hawke, that they hope at some stage in the future it will be possible to deal with these matters, I think we will realise that there are a large number of people who really believe that the answer to that has to be no. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, he says, `Well, there is a failure of communications. My staff, the Federal Police, my advisers, whoever-there is a failure of communications'. They are the sins of commission in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the sins of omission? They are, firstly, the question of whether as the Minister for Justice he kept himself properly informed. He has said to us, both in relation to questions he was asked today and indeed in the comments which he made just a few minutes ago in this debate, that in fact it was brought to his attention that certain Australians had been arrested, that he knew their names, that certain Thai nationals had been arrested, but that he had not been informed of their names. </PARA>
<PARA> To be informed of their names, Mr President, all he had to do was read the newspapers. On 3 January 1989 in the Daily Telegraph there was an article in which the two Australians are named and the two Thai nationals are named. One of them, as has become apparent, is the person with the same surname as the individual whom Senator Tate has prejudged and whose name appears in Senator Tate's press release of 2 May. He could perhaps look at the Australian on 4 January, where the headline was, `Former Thai M. P. Charged' and the Australian's name is then given. It is a matter of some speculation and it is a matter of some public record that a person who claimed to have been a member of parliament in Thailand was one of those persons who was arrested in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, for a Minister for justice to say to us, `I was not informed by the police or by my staff or by the relevant authorities of the names of the Thai nationals' is not good enough when the names of those Thai nationals were a matter of clear public record. All that Senator Tate had to do was read the newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that I make is that Senator Tate has indicated on a number of occasions that there are international drug rings in Australia and that there are distribution networks. At the end of those networks, as my colleague Senator Durack has said, there are people who, we hope, will be investigated, will be prosecuted, will be tried and, if found guilty, will be properly and severely punished. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be presumed by any Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs that investigations undertaken by the police, for whom he has responsibility, will at some stage lead to proceedings which lead to trials which can be prejudiced by comments made in a pre-trial situation-not just that those comments have been referred to by His Honour Judge Graham, but, as Senator Hill quoted on an earlier occasion, that they have been referred to by Senator Tate in his own speech of 3 September 1988 entitled `The Process of Effective Criminal Law Reform-Some Considerations'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate is a person who not only has experience as a Minister of the Crown, as the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, but who has experience as Dean of the Faculty of Law. He is not a person unfamiliar with the traditions, the principles and indeed the operation of the law in Australia. He knows those things. He is seized of them and on this occasion they have somehow managed to slip from his consciousness as he proceeds-I think somewhat unfortunately-to attempt to bring about a situation in which, in a desire for publicity and recognition, he has exceeded the bounds that properly should have constrained him. </PARA>
<PARA> I make just two comments in terms of the editorial approach that has been taken to these matters. In today's Melbourne Age, in a comment by Michelle Grattan headed `An absence of justice and common sense', she writes:</PARA>
<PARA> If ministerial responsibility really counted for much, Senator Tate would be on the back bench today. It is hard to think of a clearer case of a Minister being personally to blame for a serious lapse in ministerial behaviour than that presented by Senator Tate's ill-advised comments about a man arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling, which last week led to a judge aborting a trial involving the man's sister and two others. </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on as to what are side issues, but says in relation to those that even if they were put aside he would be gravely culpable on two counts: first, the prejudging of the status of the accused in Thailand; and, second, the defence of ignorance of the trial in Australia, which she describes as irrelevant. She says:</PARA>
<PARA> It was not as though Senator Tate made his comments on the run. He released a statement on the arrest and called a `door-stop'. It was his responsibility to find out any relevant information before he did that. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the point Senator Macklin was making. It was the point we sought to draw in questions today. When he was advised by his staff, as a result of advice given to them by the Australian Federal Police, to be careful about mentioning the Australian link or the Australian connection, was it enough simply to assume that that meant some operational interaction? That can hardly be sustained because the press statement of 2 May makes much of the fact that the operation was a joint effort by Australian, Thai and United States authorities. In other words, here was the clear indication that the success of this particular matter was a result of the operational interlinking between the United States, the Australian and the Thai authorities. Yet what the Minister failed to do was to say, `What do the police mean when they say, ``Be careful about the Australian link. Be careful about the Australian connection''? What is the Australian link? What is the Australian connection?' It cannot be that there was operational interrelationship, because the substance of what I am saying is part and parcel of the success of the operation of the Australian anti-drug campaign. He failed to ensure that he was aware of precisely what that meant, and he should have done. </PARA>
<PARA> The second comment I refer to is in today's Canberra Times, where Tony Wright makes precisely the same point. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, in failing to sack the Minister for Justice, Senator Michael Tate, appears to have refined the concept of ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>He then poses the question that Senator Macklin has posed: whatever happened to the idea of the presumption of innocence? He goes on later to say:</PARA>
<PARA>A responsible Minister might, perhaps, have taken the further step of making inquiries about precisely what the AFP meant by `Australian connections'. Instead, Senator Tate issued a media statement and called reporters to a `door-stop'-a mini press conference-to crow about the arrest in Thailand of a man he said was the top heroin importer to Australia. And it blew up in his face. The Minister for Justice had ill-served the cause of justice. </PARA>
<PARA>In opening his defence, Senator Button said that all of this was the tip of an iceberg. It may well be in that sense that today's debate and today's questions were the tip of an iceberg. That may well be, but it is an iceberg which under the water at least has to sink the Tasmanian Titanic on this occasion. Quite simply, Senator Tate has failed to discharge his ministerial responsibility to keep himself properly informed. Secondly, as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, he has traduced that fundamental principle by making public statements about the presumed guilt of a man, which has not yet been proven, and that has had consequences in Australia that may be consequences in terms of the aborting of a trial-a trial which may never be able to be successfully completed and which may result in precisely the opposite outcome to that which Senator Tate and every honourable senator who has participated in this debate would want to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an occasion, I believe, on which it is not the Minister's motives or policy that are in question. It is simply the Minister's administrative competence and the proper discharge of his responsibilities as the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs and as a person who, with every other senator, is seeking to eliminate the drug trade and to punish those who are involved in it. That is the issue and that is the nature of the motion. The Minister has failed to discharge properly the responsibilities incumbent upon him and his high office, and it is because it is so manifestly proven that that is the case that the Senate must carry the censure motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to Senator Puplick's address, it seemed to me that what he was saying was that Senator Tate has been guilty of a lot of offences. The first, as I understand, is that he failed to read the newspapers. I am not being facetious when I say that. I think this is what has been put on the other side-that if he was not aware he should have been because he should have read the newspapers. If we are going to censure a Minister for failing to read newspapers, we are on new territory. From now on, all of us here, who are equally responsible to the electorate, will have to read every newspaper that is published in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill looks up quizzically. Senator Puplick said Senator Tate should have been aware, he should have controlled the police, and he should have known what they were doing. That is absolutely outrageous. It is an outrageous proposition to put that any Minister of the Crown should be in control of the police. It is an outrageous proposition to say that any Minister should interfere with a prosecution taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP); it is just not to the point to say that the Minister was unaware of the internal operations of the police force, because he ought not to be. There ought always to be a considerable distance between a Minister and the operations of the police force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next point he made was that the Minister's comments led to the discharge of the jury-and so they did. That is most unfortunate, but it would not be the first time that a jury has been discharged in this country. Juries are discharged to enable some time to elapse between the controversy that occurs and the start of a new trial, so that the jury can come to the issue with an unprejudiced mind. Of course, the longer this issue is talked about, the further off the trial date will be put. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a vote along party lines on this issue. I am sure that those on the other side will vote in a certain way because of a sense of outrage that prejudging should go on when anybody is coming to trial. Unfortunately, I have not had much time to prepare this speech. If I had time, I would produce copies of Hansard to show what propositions those on the other side put forward when the late Lionel Murphy was being traduced in this chamber. I would be very interested to read what was said about that. What did those opposite say about the fair trial or otherwise afforded to Lionel Murphy? What did they say when Lindy Chamberlain was being traduced in newspapers around the country? Senator Puplick referred to newspapers as if they were paragons. He said, `Look what the newspapers say about this outrageous action by the Minister'. What did the newspapers say about the Lindy Chamberlain affair? What do they say about trial after trial that comes up? What was said by those opposite last year about the so-called black mafia, about Charlie Perkins? What was said about Jim Curran, the Castlereagh by-election and the cemetery votes? I am sure that when I read Hansard I will see that on all of those issues those opposite were very conscious of the sorts of rights that they now proclaim should have been observed by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In order to try to bolster the bona fides on the other side, I am asked how many censure motions have involved Senator Tate. The fact is that there has been nothing upon which those opposite could hang anything on Senator Tate until they put forward this flimsy-I use that word advisedly-case against him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If those opposite were so outraged about this matter, why did we hear nothing at all from them last week? This matter became an issue only when the Government took it on and said, `This is a serious matter'. Following the reaction of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the matter, the Opposition filed in and said, `Here are some easy pickings. We'll censure this Minister'. I say that there is absolutely no evidence. Everything that has been put against Senator Tate has been put on the basis of inference. The only way in which the Opposition can even reach that stage is to say that the Minister should have read the newspaper or that he should have taken heed of a warning by the Australian Federal Police not to mention the Australian link. That is exactly what he has done. He has not mentioned the Australian link. The police did not ring him and say, `Don't mention this at all'. It has been accepted that there was no statement by the police linking the two names. There was no statement by the Federal Police that a trial was in progress. There was no statement by the Federal Police that if the Minister mentioned the name of a person in Thailand, that would have ramifications here. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what the police said, one sees that it was an invitation to Senator Tate to say the very thing that he said. So the warning by the police should not be taken as evidence that he was warned not to speak about the matter. In fact, it was a statement that led him to do what he has done. The police have encouraged him to go ahead and make a statement. They have said, in effect, `Make a statement, but leave out any mention that there may be a connection between this matter and the Australian situation'. It is a flight of fancy to turn that into an absolute warning to say nothing about the case. </PARA>
<PARA> People have become very pious about the presumption of innocence. They say, `There ought to be a presumption of innocence', and so there should be. The great scarlet thread which runs through the English law is that nobody should be taken to be guilty unless it is proved beyond reasonable doubt. Those opposite have had no trouble today, on the basis of very flimsy evidence, in saying that Senator Tate has ignored the sorts of rules that apply-and so they should-to this person in Thailand, and to the people here. Apparently, those rules do not apply in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Puplick said that what Senator Tate did on this occasion was to make a statement in circumstances where he should have known about a trial in Sydney. Senator Puplick said, `I accept what Senator Tate says, that he did not know'. So it is established that Senator Tate did not know about this trial. Senator Puplick goes on to say, `But, nevertheless, he should have known about it and, therefore, he is guilty of negligence as a Minister and should be censured'. But I think it is fair to say that the only two criteria, the only two reasons that he gives as to why Senator Tate should have known about the Sydney trial, are, first, that he should have read the newspapers--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are rhetorical questions. Those are the two bases. So it comes down to, as I said before, firstly, that he is to be censured because he failed to read the newspapers and therefore to put himself on notice; and, secondly, that when he got this tortured warning-everybody must agree-from the police he should have understood that there was a trial in existence. The police did not tell him that the sister of the person accused in Thailand was implicated, but they told him not to mention the Australian connection. That is a clear invitation to Senator Tate to say something about the arrest, which he did. So the two bases of the Opposition's argument fall apart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go to the question of Thailand. Clearly, if the person arrested in Thailand had been standing trial in Australia, it would have been most grievous for Senator Tate to have said what he did. But the person is not on trial in Australia; he is on trial in Thailand. And it is no good, without some sort of evidence, saying that what Senator Tate said here is going to affect the trial in Thailand. No speaker here has attempted at any point in the debate to show that the statement made by Senator Tate will have any effect in Thailand. The United States' Attorney-General is always talking about how people have been arrested in other countries, particularly in South America, and nobody seems to take exception to that. I do not take exception to that, because what is said there does not affect any trial that might take place in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at Senator Tate's actions, one must look at them in terms of what the consequences have been-and, indeed, Senator Puplick has quite rightly said that. The first consequence has been an aborted trial in Australia. There are many aborted trials in Australia, and that is to be highly regretted. Secondly, it is said that there have been consequences in Thailand as a result of what the Minister has said. There is just no evidence of that at all. So one really comes down to wondering what this is all about. There has been no suggestion in the debate so far that Senator Tate has been dishonest, that he has been perverse, that he has been anything but honourable. All he is accused of is making a mistake, and when one looks at that there is really no evidence upon which to base the mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish by saying that we either take these matters seriously or we do not. We either take this matter of censuring a Minister seriously or we do not. We either go round on a consistent basis or we do not. If honourable senators who debated the Murphy affair are now going to take a different approach to the voting in respect of this censure motion against Senator Tate, are any of the honourable senators who are going to vote against Senator Tate able to point to any unequivocal evidence that shows that he knew, or even ought to have known, about the trial in Sydney, other than that he should have read the newspapers? He did not know and not necessarily ought he to have known. The Opposition's only argument is that he ought to have known. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I introduce the Bill into this House in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA> The High Court recently ruled that the Government does not have the power to supplement a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal to provide postage entitlements to honourable members and senators. The Government has been advised that whilst the High Court was not required to rule on the question, its decision placed in doubt the provision of benefits having a pecuniary value unless provided by or under legislation. That advice indicates that if the High Court were asked to decide the issue it would probably find that, on the basis of S. 48 of the Constitution supported by the Separation of Powers Doctrine, only the Parliament can make provision for such benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the entitlements and facilities available to honourable members and senators have been provided by successive governments, in some cases since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from postage the entitlements which are not covered directly by legislation or indirectly by any Tribunal determination include travel in Australia for official business by Parliamentary office-holders; travel overseas on official business by the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Presiding Officers; the provision of office accommodation, home telephones and equipment for the four opposition office holders and the presiding officers in a capital city; the provision of postage in relation to the official business for Ministers, Opposition office holders, presiding officers, the leaders of minority parties and the whips. For honourable members and senators the entitlements not similarly covered are overseas travel as a member of a parliamentary delegation; travel in Australia for purposes related to parliamentary or electorate business; electorate office accommodation and equipment; postage; personalised letterhead stationery; Australian flags and printed material related to national symbols for presentation to constituents; publications available from the Australian Government Bookshop; and the transfer of bulk papers between Parliament House and the electorate office. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the provision of a postage entitlement to honourable members and senators, the bill provides an entitlement up to the limits determined by the government for 1989-90 until future postage entitlements are determined by the remuneration tribunal. The tribunal is to be asked to determine the postage entitlements of honourable members and senators for the financial year 1990-91. Other entitlements covered by the bill or new or supplementary entitlements can be varied or approved either by reference to the remuneration tribunal or by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the doubt expressed by the High Court on the provision to date of benefits having a pecuniary value which are not provided by or under legislation, the bill validates all benefits of a kind described in the bill which have been used by or made available to the parliamentary office holders including the leaders of the opposition and to honourable members and senators at any time prior to its commencement. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill also provides a legal basis for honourable members and senators to continue to receive their entitlements for the same periods they receive their parliamentary remuneration. This is relevant to honourable members seeking re-election on the dissolution of this house or to a senator seeking re-election on a double dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequential amendments are also necessary to the remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to support the provision in the bill that the benefits listed in the schedule to the bill shall be omitted or varied only if referred to the remuneration tribunal for determination or by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the high court's decision has raised serious issues which have cast doubt on many of the entitlements available to honourable members and senators to enable them to fulfil their parliamentary and electorate responsibilities. The government has moved by introducing this bill to rectify serious anomalies which, in some cases, have existed for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum for the bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>It was very interesting to receive this nine-page response to the 155-page report. Nevertheless, I must say that, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare I am reasonably pleased with the response from the Government, albeit that it was a little delayed. One of the most interesting things that comes out of this report on sheep husbandry is the fact that the Government has commented on the balanced reporting. In other words, the evidence given in this report reflected the views of all those people concerned with animal welfare and with the sheep industry. The Government summed this up and the importance of this Committee in point 4 of its response when it said that sheep husbandry is one of the several animal welfare issues which have assumed national significance. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>International concern over those issues is directed at Australia as a whole, tarnishing both Australia's national image and that of the sheep industry. Such concern has led on occasion to threatened boycotts of wool and other sheep products and even of the Australian tourist industry in a misguided effort to force discontinuation of practices such as mulesing, which are considered by some members of the international community to be unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>It is pleasing that this matter was aired publicly and the opportunity provided for animal welfare groups and the industry to put their points of view. At the end of the day, the Committee came up with a unanimous report that has been accepted by not only the industry but animal welfare groups as being a reasonable indication of the current situation. The Government has noted that. There are two important matters that come out of the report. One is the matter of mulesing, which is a practice looked upon by many as being barbaric and unjustifiable. On the other hand, the industry regards it as something that is very important in sheep husbandry. I might say that if this practice had been banned, as was suggested by some people who gave evidence to us, the overall effect on the wool industry in Australia would have been catastrophic. It is pleasing to note that those people who were most critical of the mulesing practices have accepted the Committee's view that until further research has been done and other ways of treating flystrike are developed, mulesing should be accepted. That was one of our recommendations and it is one that the Government has accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major recommendation the Committee made concerned the huge loss of lambs. This matter was brought to our attention by animal welfare groups. One person giving evidence claimed that up to 11 million lambs a year were lost as a result of weather conditions and so on. Subsequently, I think, those claims proved to be exaggerated but, even taking lower figures, it was a matter on which the Committee felt moved to make recommendations. I must say I am a little disappointed in the Government's response. It did not support our recommendation; it pointed out that lamb losses are multifactorial and that, even though management practices may be adequate, other factors affect mortality. The factor quoted was that a large proportion of maiden ewes when coming out of drought could cause a higher lamb loss. We put forward the view that it was a national responsibility to encourage more shelter belts and planting of trees on farms to effect shelter for ewes that are lambing. I still believe that that is a matter the Government should have supported. </PARA>
<PARA> This being our fifth report, I am pleased to see that the Government has realised the importance of this Committee and the fact that it provides an arena where people who want to raise matters on animal welfare can put their views. The Committee endeavours to report in a balanced way, and there is no doubt that reports such as this have taken the heat out of what could be very divisive arguments in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support Senator Calvert's remarks and the recommendations by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare in its report on sheep husbandry. We well know in Australia the importance of the wool industry, which is still worth around $5 billion. On top of that, we have the Australian sheep meat market and the live sheep export market. That is in trouble at this time but it is worth some $150m to $200m a year. As Senator Calvert has pointed out, the main criticism of the sheep industry relates to mulesing. I believe that the practice of mulesing has been the most forward move in the handling of sheep in the last 20 years. I believe that it compares, roughly, with the advent of pre-emergent sprays in the wheat growing industry in the last seven or eight years. The reductions of flystrike in sheep means a reduction in deaths from blowfly strike caused by the weakened constitution of the sheep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has also caused an immense reduction in the cost of wool production. The other night at dinner I was speaking to a Victorian who had just moved into sheep farming. He asked me how many men would be needed to tend 1,000 sheep for the whole year round. I surprised him by telling him that if everything was done correctly, with the help of shearing contractors, mulesing contractors and whatever other contractors are required for sheep farming, one person should be able to tend a flock of 15,000 sheep for the whole year round. So, that has to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that the animal welfare lobby raised concerns mulesing. It looks barbaric when one first sees it, but the animals make an immediate recovery from this operation the day after, and further down the line smaller amounts of chemicals are used on them for the rest of their lives. Before the advent of mulesing, the sheep had to be virtually dipped in chemicals to prevent fly strike. Chemicals got into the wool and problems would arise overseas as a result. The animal welfare lobby and welfare groups around Australia tend to want people to use fewer chemicals. I also want to use fewer chemicals, which means lower costs. But one has to undertake a number of practices so that chemicals are not required. If that can be done by mulesing, well and good. I commend the Government and the Committee for making such a recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended, and the Government accepted, that more research be done into using other methods, and I commend them for that; if they can find a better way, so be it. Furthermore, I am also happy to acknowledge that the Committee and the Government accepted that more money should be spent on harvesting wool by means other than the current shearing methods. The advent of a successful method will be a long way down the track, but I certainly commend the Committee's recommendations on improving mechanical methods, because the Australian shearing industry could run short of manpower if as many keep leaving the industry and are not replaced, as occurs now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to take just a few moments to comment on the Government's response to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on sheep husbandry. Before addressing that directly, I would like simply to welcome the reinstatement of this select committee in this Parliament, particularly, as I think, has been mentioned by Senator Calvert, the contribution that is made by this Committee to rational debate in an area which, in many other countries and before the establishment of this Committee in this country, was running the risk of becoming an area fraught with emotionalism on very good grounds on both sides of the argument. The Committee has provided a forum for rational discussion for all the issues to be fully aired and for productive development in the whole area of animal welfare. It is a Committee which was established on the motion of the first Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp. I would also like to pay tribute to the work of my former colleague, Norm Sanders, who was our most recent representative on that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, too, as both previous speakers have done, want to talk specifically about the question of mulesing and about how that has been dealt with in the Government response and in the report. Before I do that, I would also like to pick the point Senator Calvert made with regard to lamb lossses. I was brought up on a not particularly big farm, which was a mixed grain and sheep producing property on mallee fringe land in the Victorian Wimmera. I regret to say that, when we sold that farm on the death of my father, the tree shelter belts which he had left as a more traditional farmer of a past era, were immediately bulldozed down. I was back on that farm just a couple of years ago and noticed very distinct signs of land degradation and some evidence of dryland salinity creeping in. I regret that and I believe that one of the major issues in lamb losses has been the reduction of shelter belts in the past couple of decades. That episode that I speak of happened almost 20 years ago, but in the preceding 30 or 40 years that farm's lamb losses were very low. </PARA>
<PARA> In that area, too, and moving now into the requirements for mulesing, which the industry has found necessary in recent years, I think it is important to say that, to me and from my personal experience, animal husbandry means that the animals are husbanded by, if you like, a human being who cares about them and who has the opportunity to care for them on a regular basis. Senator Panizza mentioned that one person can look after 1,000 sheep and that possibly some of these techniques are necessary in that situation. My view is that we need more trees, but I think also that those people responsible for animals who are concerned about many of these practices, whether they are animal producers or animal lovers, would all agree that if we could have more human content in animal husbandry, we would treat our animals better. I welcome the Government's response to the recommendations in the Committee report that continued research into all means of preventing blowfly strike be a priority so that the need for mulesing is removed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the economic difficulties faced by all our primary producers has been an imperative towards some of these practices that have not been widely accepted in the community, and I think we do have to look at, for instance, funding of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in particular in the excellent work it is doing in this area. The Democrats have been critical of reductions in that area, which have very heavily impinged in a whole range of areas on the needs of rural industry. So, that and the other recommendations with regard to mulesing that support the work that is being done are strongly supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with other honourable senators in supporting this motion. In its comments on many of these recommendations, the Government has stated that they lie outside its sphere of responsibility. It notes that sheep husbandry was one of several animal welfare issues that had assumed national significance. The work of this Committee, which has achieved a great deal since it was set up, is a Federal issue. Although it is a Federal Committee, in the stricter sense many of the matters lie outside areas of Federal Government responsibility. But it is the only opportunity, at the Federal level and, generally speaking, dispassionate level, to examine such issues as mulesing, which Senator Panizza, Senator Calvert and others have talked about. I am pleased to note that the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on sheep husbandry have been accepted by the Government. That is the only sensible course of action. Anyone who sees flyblown sheep will understand the reasons for the use of the mulesing method. Even some of the most radical people in the animal welfare areas are now realising that. The choice is either that method or the use of chemicals-or looking after stock much more closely, which is not possible in the wide areas of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me suggest, though, that in places like Nyngan there is no possibility at this stage, with all the flood problems, of people taking a close look at their stock. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports our calls for an increased commitment to research efforts. But, having supported us, the Government is not prepared to put up any of the additional money which is needed for research to help in a lot of the areas mentioned in the Committee's recommendations. I am disappointed in that because I believe the Government is rather cynical in this regard. It supports the recommendations but is not prepared to assist with any funding. I think the Government should put its money where its mouth is. Some of its responses I cannot agree with. For example, it says ultrasound testing is too expensive. I do not believe that is the case. I think that if we are to save a lot of the more expensive stud animals the Government should take up that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation that the Government did not take up, in what I think is a bit of a cop-out as well, is the recommendation that the State and Territory governments increase the number of Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) inspectors authorised under the relevant State prevention of cruelty to animals legislation and provide additional funding to support them. The Government says it does not support that because it believes that to be a responsibility only for the States. I believe the Government should have come up with some money that would have made animal welfare inspections in the livestock industries a lot better. Generally people in sheep husbandry are very mindful of looking after their livestock in a most humane way because that is how they get the best profits. They are not inhumane in any way and I commend them for that. But some people are not so humane and we would be better off with RSPCA inspectors checking to see that they do toe the line properly. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to speak to the report of the National Science and Technology Centre in a manner that I hope will encourage people to take a much greater interest in it now that it is an accomplished fact and working so well. This report covers the period of 1988-89, which was a nine-month period of operation for the centre. The fact that it is within walking distance of this building is something that I hope people will take into account. I hope that they will take the opportunity in due course to visit the centre. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first nine months of operation, 365,000 people went through the centre, of which 60 per cent or thereabouts were adults. I think that is very good. We need a lot more people to go through and we need to spread the good news about the centre to as many people as possible. It is very much a vital operating centre and it has a lot of advantages. The objective, as stated on the first page of the report, is:</PARA>
<PARA> To promote a greater awareness and understanding of the present and potential contributions of the application of science and technology so that:</PARA>
<PARA> * young Australians are stimulated to pursue education and careers in science and technology, and;</PARA>
<PARA> * the community is better informed, and seeks out and uses applications relevant to their particular needs. </PARA>
<PARA>The centre's aims and objectives are very reasonable, and I am always very pleased to have discussions with Dr Michael Gore on the operation of the centre from time to time. He did a magnificent job previously with the establishment and operation of the old Questacon unit. The new centre is one of the best centres of its type in the world. More and more people around Australia are being exposed to the centre through the visits that it pays to various places. The sponsorship list is growing and includes some of Australia's major companies as well as international companies-companies such as ICI Australia Ltd, Shell Australia Ltd, IBM Australia Ltd, Telecom Australia, NEC, and Coles Myer Ltd. The dedicated people at the top of the organisation-a very good advisory committee headed by Sir Neil Currie and his deputy, Sir Laurence Muir-have got the Centre established and flourishing. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that in due course it is the intention of Dr Gore to invite all members of parliament to look through the centre. This is a bipartisan matter and both sides of the Parliament intend to do everything they can to advance the cause of the centre and of science. The country depends upon so much in the scientific area. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the people who are able to gain some appreciation of the advantages of science by seeing it in operation will be able to use it more in their daily lives and encourage others to become associated with it. In this way we will become less dependent on overseas assistance in so many ways. We have slipped a lot in the last few years and it is only by getting people to operate in a more scientific way, using the advantages that flow from science and technology, that we will recover. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of my colleague opposite. I think what Senator Archer said-particularly about bipartisan support for the national Science and Technology Centre, about its past and about its future is very important-and I am happy to say I agree with all of those comments. This centre has been running very efficiently and effectively. I certainly want to add my voice in urging people to go along and have a look at it. But most importantly, once one gets to have a look at it, one gets to have a go too. It is a hands-on learning centre and is therefore very different from many other museum-like places where people are asked to look only. In this centre one actually gets to have a go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we should also note that the centre marks Japan's major contribution to the Australian Bicentenary. In view of some of the nonsense that has been spoken-and indeed anxiety people have expressed-about things like the multifunction polis, perhaps we should acknowledge that, properly managed, international contributions from one country to another can be a matter of celebration and need not be cause for anxiety or fear. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to read the report of the National Science and Technology Centre. I think in some ways it portrays a lot of the character of the people involved in the centre. I congratulate Michael Gore and all those involved with him on the board on the way they have set up the centre and continue to run it in the efficient and beautiful way it is being run. </PARA>
<PARA> Not often does one get reports that actually have a heading called `Accelerated Evolution'. Particularly in a journal on science one could begin to think, `This definitely needs reading. What is accelerated evolution? What are they doing down there?' Actually, it is not a story about genetic material but about how quickly the idea for the centre was brought to fruition. The language of the report, in fact, does encourage one to read it, but I think it also indicates the sort of imagination and humour with which this centre is being promoted. The heading `Visitor Peaks and Troughs' is also an interesting one. One could imagine all sorts of strange things. </PARA>
<PARA> The section of the report headed `Safety and People-Proofing' shows the seriousness with which this centre has guaranteed safety so that when people are experiencing the hands-on displays at the centre neither their safety nor the safety of the centre is jeopardised. It is a matter of considerable importance and, as the report says, considerable cost. The humour that is used to interest people in what science can be and what science means characterises the centre and all those involved with it. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be entirely predictable to say that I was delighted to see in the mathematica room the very significant posters around the wall featuring significant mathematicians from history to note that every second poster actually refers to famous women mathematicians. I will not actually ask whether anybody here can name them. I have practised some of their names; I have certainly read about them in other places, but IBM's contribution to that mathematica centre, to those posters, to the book it produces and the way it actually acknowledges extraordinary women mathematicians down history I think is a matter of some considerable excitement. In science and technology centres we do not expect to find an acknowledgment of women's contribution in history, although they have made a huge contribution. Part of our history, part of our science centre has to be to remind people of those women so that they can discover not that women are learning science now, but that they have done so since time immemorial. They have just been forgotten or overlooked. So I am delighted that very famous women mathematicians are there alongside the famous men. I sincerely hope all in the Senate can eventually answer the questions of who they are. </PARA>
<PARA> I think too that I like the way the centre challenges people to appreciate the relationship of science to art and the relationship of science to everyday living. It is those experiences-the chemistry and physics in the kitchen, things which are often used to denigrate science-which in fact ought to be used to encourage people to see that science is part of everyday life. </PARA>
<PARA> Science and technology ought to be matters of excitement and enthusiasm for everybody in this society and this community. Clearly we need to encourage the number of people who know about science who visit this centre and of course make use of the opportunities, if they cannot get to Canberra, to visit the Questacon travelling science circus too when it goes in and around their area. I understand Senator Teague would like a word if he can get in in time. I pass over to him. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to say a little more about Questacon, the original proven concept that has been widened and made more permanent by the establishment of the Centre. Questacon is a word that is derived from a combination of the Latin verb `quaerere', to seek, and the medieval word `con' meaning to learn or steer, as in a ship. The genius of Questacon was that the physics and mathematics exhibits were hands-on to those who came to experience the Questacon centre; so too are they now in the National Science and Technology Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Both children and adults coming to the Centre learn not only by looking but also by touching, feeling and manipulating; so they are participants in science and technology to the extent that they move from one exhibit to the next, so it is a very active and not passive introduction to new ideas about science and technology. It has long been stated in this chamber by a number of my colleagues, including Senator Archer and Senator MacGibbon, and by me, that this country will prosper to the extent that we encourage a proper, full understanding of the potential of science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA> As a former Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, you, Mr Acting Deputy President, likewise share this commitment to enhancing in Australia a fuller knowledge of all the potential of science and technology. But this centre is not only about science. It is not only about what is true about the world in which we live; it is about translating science into technology, into invention, into those processes that will improve the environment in which we all live, not only in Australia, but also the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to give that type of insight and enthusiasm to increasing numbers of young and old Australians. I am delighted to see that more than a thousand a day are visiting the Centre and I strongly urge Australians to take up the opportunity of gaining from this national treasure which, as I said earlier, is one of the permanent gifts of the bicentennial year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly on this report. As Senator Teague said, it has been a theme of mine that the application of science and technology to the Australian community and the educational requirements flowing from it have been sadly neglected and downgraded since the early 1950s in this country. We enjoyed a great surge of support in the late forties and fifties for science as a consequence of the applications of science in the Second World War. Somewhere along the road from the mid-fifties onwards and particularly by the mid-sixties, the support for science, particularly in the universities, tapered off. Nationally we are paying a very high price for it today and it will be many years-15 or 20 years-before we can recover the position we should have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was interesting to be at lunch today with Admiral Watkins, the Cabinet member responsible for the Department of Energy in the United States of America, who talked about the priorities of the Bush Administration in America and how its fundamental task was to re-establish knowledge of science and mathematics in the American community through the educational system. It is an absolute priority with them in order to rebuild the capabilities of the United States, commercially and in all other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited the National Science and Technology Centre here some while ago. It was actually one weekend when we were held here while the airline dispute was on. I had been meaning to get there for quite some while after it had opened, because I had the privilege about 20 years ago of visiting the Toronto Science Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Without being discourteous to the board of the Centre here, I was disappointed on two grounds. I was disappointed because a large number of the exhibits, although they had been in place only for some months, were not working. I think that on two of the floors about one-third of the exhibits were not working at the time. I have not been able to go back since then and that may have been a transient, coincidental occurrence, but it is terribly important in the concept of this type of museum that the exhibits work all the time, because what we are trying to do here is demonstrate basically not only to children but to the whole community the application of scientific principles in various ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The other disappointment I had about the centre was its scale. The costs in setting that up really are very high and that obviously places a limit on what was done. I hope that the board of the Science Centre has ambitious plans to develop further. What impressed me so much about the Toronto Science Centre 20 years ago when I saw it was that it took discrete areas of activity-communications, for example-and would have a whole centre on everything from early smoke signals through to the early telephones, telephonic communications, the old manual switchboards, electronic switchboards, and radio communications. The Toronto International Airport was actually being broadcast in part of the room, and people could use the equipment there and see the full application of modern communications technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, with other things like lasers, there were little corners of the building where one sat on the floor or on steps on the carpet and used lasers to burn holes in bricks and things like that. Students from the university were talking about the basic principles involved. I think this is enormously important, because science is a living entity and it has to be seen in its relevance to the community. I support very much the concept behind this. I wish it well in the future and I hope the vision of the board is absolutely limitless. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Safeguards Office (ASO) is the body which has to do with nuclear safeguards, and I really want to restrict my remarks to one particular aspect. While safeguards, of course, have to do with two aspects of protecting radioactive materials, namely, the possibility that those materials maybe used for nefarious purposes unrelated to the civil use of those materials, they also pose a health hazard in relation to the possible escape of radioactive materials from any part of the civil nuclear fuel cycle. That is the part to which I wish to draw attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I am referring specifically to page 21 of the report, in which the ASO mentions that one of the problems it is faced with is zero real growth of the agency budget and the increasing size and complexity of the nuclear fuel cycle and the allied problem of information treatment. What I wish to pick up here is that, while the global standards for radiation exposure have been set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which was established in the 1920s, those standards have been implemented in each nation by national bodies. In this country, of course, they are implemented through the processes of the National Health and Medical Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what has happened over time, one finds that the allowable levels to which workers in the industry may be exposed have been reduced progressively from the mid-1920s until the present time, when the allowable level for industrial workers is 50 millisieverts in this country, although in several other countries the allowable level has been reduced to 15 millisieverts per year. That, I understand, is the situation which may obtain in this country in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> That recent reduction from 50 down to 15 is based on a reworking of the evidence in relation to the Hiroshima-Nagasaki survivors. The point of my remarks here is to draw attention to some very recent work published in the British Medical Journal on 17 February 1990 which looked at the incidence of leukaemia in the children of men who had worked in the British nuclear industry and were exposed to really quite modest levels of radiation. </PARA>
<PARA> They began with the workers in the reprocessing plant at Sellafield and discovered that the leukaemia incidence in the children of workers who were exposed to only 100 millisieverts of radiation in total, which is only two years at the present maximum allowable level, was between six and eight times greater than the leukaemia incidence in those who were not so exposed in the course of their occupation. Indeed, they looked at a number of other nuclear establishments and found that there was a linear dose-response relationship which went right down to much lower exposures at Aldermaston and Dounreay, in the case of Aldermaston 7.8 millisieverts total radiation exposure, and 47 millisieverts at Dounreay. These were both associated with a substantial increase in the leukaemia rate of the children of the men who were so exposed.</PARA>

But it does raise-and this is the point I want to make-the very serious question of whether even the present possible reduction to 15 millisieverts is anywhere near enough. I think what we will see with the ASO and similar bodies is the need to very substantially reduce this allowable level of radiation still further. That is a problem which will be faced by the National Health and Medical Research Council, by the ASO and by a number of other bodies, and it poses a very serious problem for the civil nuclear industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In the short time I have available to me I would like to say a few words about the Defence Housing Authority, whose annual report for 1988-89 is now before the Senate. As honourable senators would be aware, this is an authority for which I have a great deal of time. Certainly a lot of other government authorities could take some lessons from the efficiency with which this organisation has been set up and gone about its duties in providing good quality housing of a community standard for our defence forces. I have often on other occasions spoken of the detail of the work been done by it and I do not intend to do that this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise two or three matters relating to the work of the Defence Housing Authority which I believe should be given attention by the Government and by the defence forces. The current arrangement is that the defence services themselves allocate the quarters which are owned and maintained by the Defence Housing Authority. It is my personal belief that that arrangement is not working as well as it might, and I urge those in authority to reconsider the automatic assumption that the defence forces are the best people to allocate particular houses to particular individuals. It makes for complications of a number of kinds and, in my view, it is time to consider changing the arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly amongst the tenants of the Defence Housing Authority there is real concern that the Government proposes to change the policy governing the level of rentals that they pay. Honourable senators would be aware that servicemen get a certain element of subsidy for their housing, partly because it has been recognised for many years that their housing has been of a very poor standard. More important, perhaps, for the long term future is the fact that they are required to live in places where they would not normally choose to live. They are often places with some social deprivation and iso- lation, and that is recognised in rental subsidies. I would like to see the Government put out a definitive statement-and the new Ministers are in an ideal position to do that-reassuring the defence population that there is no intention of reducing the level of rental subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should also be looking much more seriously than it has to date at assisting Defence Force personnel to acquire homes of their own. The previous Labor Government made a mess of changes to the defence service home loans scheme and subsequently introduced a new scheme which, under scrutiny, has proved to be not a terribly satisfactory alternative and is certainly no great encouragement to home ownership. These things are examples of fiddling around the edges. I would like to see a fresh look at the whole question of housing Defence Force families, with greater emphasis being given to the benefits that would accrue both to the taxpayer and to the Defence Force families themselves if much more generous assistance were given to them to acquire their own homes. One of the problems being faced at the moment by those who own their own homes is that they are liable for capital gains tax if their service takes them away from their home for more than four years. I urge the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to change that quickly. Those people are not living away from their homes by choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which has bedevilled the housing of Defence Force personnel over many years is the question of scales and standards. The minimum level of housing standards applicable to Defence Force personnel, depending on their rank and their family levels, has become the maximum in many cases. It is a rigid, uncaring system, which I believe, with the advent of the Defence Housing Authority, should now be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Housing Authority is involved in joint ventures, which I welcome. However, it is currently involved in a major program at Tindal Royal Australian Air Force base of upgrading brand-new houses. I understand that something like $1m has to come out of the Defence Housing Authority's budget to repair work which was inadequately supervised by Australian Construction Services (ACS) only a year or two ago. That is a serious condemnation not only of the contractors concerned but, much more serious, I believe, of ACS which should be held in contempt for its failure to carry out its professional duties. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I have much pleasure in rising to speak on this annual report of the Australian Wheat Board on its 50th anniversary. The Board was born out of the disasters of the 1930s, when thousands of wheat growers and their families were driven off their farms. It was the combined efforts of the farmers of Australia and the Government of the time that got the Australian Wheat Board going exactly 50 years ago. I congratulate the Board on its performance over that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points out that for the  1988-89 season the Board achieved an average card price of $US175 a tonne. That, of course, gave a return to Australian farmers on the average of between $190 and $200 per tonne, which is a marvellous effort compared with the 1986 season, when we had virtually a record low price. Honourable senators will remember the triggering of the guaranteed minimum price, of which Senator Walsh has reminded the Senate so often. This price rise was helped along by the North American drought, which was unfortunate for farmers there but slightly more fortunate for the Australian wheat farmers because it pushed prices up. </PARA>
<PARA> Some innovations have been achieved in the wheat marketing system, as the Senate was told earlier today in a question to Senator Cook, who represents the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. One of those changes has segregated stockfeed wheat, for which the grower can now be paid immediately rather than having to wait for payment over the next couple of years. In answering the question Senator Cook pointed out the importance of the current system of payment based on protein content, where the price rises in accordance with each decimal point of increment in protein content. For instance, taking the average of 10 per cent protein content, the increment above Australian standard white (ASW) price is on average about $15 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister explained why the protein content of Australian wheat is declining. Indeed, eight to 10 years ago the average protein content of Australian wheat was 11 per cent; it is now down to less than 10 per cent. One explanation the Minister did not give, and it has a certain degree of credibility, is that the price of fertiliser in Australia has risen at a far greater rate than has the price of wheat, and by reducing the amount of fertiliser used, the protein content of the wheat is reduced. There are certain areas on the south coast of Western Australia-where Senator-elect Crane, who will be here on 11 July, comes from-where by the use of superphosphate on light land he has told me he is producing wheat with a protein content of up to 15 per cent. That is a great achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> We have experienced the first season with a deregulated domestic market. Although I have been a strong critic of that deregulation, I think it has been a worthwhile experiment. I suppose the experimentation will continue virtually for the rest of our lives, but I think that with that 17 per cent, and taking into account a few minor downsides in the system, deregulation has worked reasonably well in its initial period. It is now up to the Government to keep its side of the bargain by deregulating the other areas that it promised it would-namely, the waterfront, coastal shipping and the labour market. These are necessary parts of the deregulation package that the Government has told us about, which will go a long way to making Australia more competitive in overseas markets. </PARA>

I welcomed the report and I congratulate the Wheat Board on being in existence for 50 years. I hope that it continues to do as well in the next 50 years as it has during part of the last 50 years. I have a vested interest in whether or not the Board is successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year we saw the end of an era and the beginning of a new one for wheat growers in Australia. I am not really convinced that all the changes that were made to the legislation last year were for the best, but I am quite prepared to wait and see what occurs. The bottom line will be whether Australian wheat growers can continue to deliver premium grade wheat at competitive world prices and whether the Board can continue its commendable track record in negotiating good deals for Australian wheat overseas. Senator Panizza alluded to this point a minute ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether some of the changes that have been made in the domestic market have been for the best. I did say that I have a pecuniary interest. I grow sorghum and a lot of the other associated crops, such as sunflowers, barley, chick peas and faba beans. I wonder whether, having deregulated the market, we have not taken away a very stable operating system. In our neck of the woods we are finding that the Wheat Board has sold a lot of wheat on the domestic market to the local millers and that has actually depressed the price rather than encouraging the maintenance of a good floor price in the grain industry. </PARA>

<PARA> I believe that the Grains Council of Australia comprises an effective body of people. They are effective in their lobbying on behalf of the growers. They make recommendations to the Wheat Board. I am quite convinced that their abilities will see them through, so that if there are any teething problems with these new arrangements for the domestic market, they will, hopefully, be able to get the new Board to fix some of the problems to which I have just alluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board will have to keep a very tight rein on its spending. Growers will expect it not to blow out its budget. We note that the budget has gone from $40.8m to $42.7m. It says that that has been brought about mainly by the challenges of a deregulated market. I support Senator Panizza's comments about waterfront reforms. I hope that Senator Collins will not be all bluff and huff and that as a Minister he will do something about waterfront reforms. He has blustered about it so far. I hope that Mr Sharp, the shadow Minister in the other place, will make sure that he performs. The railways in New South Wales have played a good part with regard to the handling of the wheat crop for the Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that I am concerned about some areas of deregulation, especially with regard to the domestic market. I think it has had a bearish effect rather than a bullish effect on the grain industry in the domestic market. I hope that the Wheat Board can become all things to all people. So far it has had difficulty in doing this. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Pig Research Council on its annual report and on its efforts to increase commercial returns to members of the pig industry and the community in general. As I read the report I note that last year the Council supported a total of 89 research projects in universities, colleges, State and Commonwealth departments and other institutions and appropriate companies. These projects involved most aspects of the production, processing and marketing of pigs and pigmeats. I also note that $2.5m was distributed in accordance with the Council's research and development plan, with the principal areas of research being in pig health, growth and nutrition, meat processing and breeding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council most definitely should be encouraged in its efforts to maintain study into this vital industry. But we should not fail to remember that while we may be funding research into the industry it is important to not then kill off the industry with short-sighted, sometimes well-meaning, but disastrous policies which can affect this industry. I refer in particular to the importation of Canadian pig meat into Australia, as well as the general economic crisis facing the man on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Conservative estimates have shown that the importation of Canadian pig meat will force 20 per cent of pork producers out of the industry, as well as have disastrous spinoff consequences for the grain industry. It is hard to reconcile this fact with the knowledge that one of the objectives of the Pig Research Council is to increase the commercial returns to members of the industry and the community in general by improving production, processing, storage, transport or marketing. What is the use of improving these areas when there will be no one to operate the pig farms? In fact, I wonder how much consideration the Government gave the matter when it decided to allow the importation of Canadian pig meat, in light of current record unemployment levels in rural areas and the downturn now being experienced in economic conditions in many rural industries. How much consideration was actually given to the devastating effects this decision will have not only on those directly involved in pig farming, but also on such industries as those covered by the Queensland Bacon Employees Union? I think the answer is: very little. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only this short-sighted action which affects the pig industry. Also, many of the policies taken by this Government since it came to power are crippling those involved in primary industries. There is not much point in producing a product if it cannot be sold profitably. Similarly, it is not much use to so rationalise our rural sector that we eventually see the demise of the family farmer-the person who spends unrecognised hours and efforts producing that end product. I have made many trips over the years throughout my State of Queensland and realise the value of primary industry and the tremendous contribution it makes to the economy. With regard to this annual report of the Pig Research Council I am concerned in particular about those people who are so worried about the fact that the cost of running a large piggery these days outweighs the amount that they can expect to get for the pig meat that they produce. I do not see how people in any industry, whether it is farmers in the pig industry or the people we have just heard about in the wheat industry, can keep on going when the costs are just so hard. There are just so many costs. The price of fuel alone to all these rural producers is just so hard. I feel very sorry for them, and I can well understand why, at a meeting of the Burnett task force the other day, the pig producers were saying that it was hardly worth while carrying on because the costs are so excessive. </PARA>

<PARA>I bring to the attention of honourable senators the work of Dr Murali Nayudu. He has applied to the Wheat Research Council for funding, but I cannot see his name listed as a recipient. I hope that for his and the industry's sake his work into the problems of the fungus take-all can continue. Take-all is an economically devastating problem for the wheat industry and is estimated to cause a loss in production of $200m annually. This is likely to be a conservative estimate, given that little evaluation is made of crops lost as a result of take-all. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of disquiet in the community about getting value for money, and that is what everyone in this Senate is always concerned about. Much of the criticism levelled by farmers against research institutes, such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, concerns the relevance of the research being undertaken for farmers. This particular project is supported by farmers, who have had a direct input into Dr Nayudu's work. He is a molecular geneticist at the Australian National University actually working in the field with farmers. He has been up in the particular area where I live where take-all is quite a serious problem. He is learning at first hand what the problems are and finding workable solutions that are able to be applied in the paddock where the solutions need to work, not just at the laboratory bench. I believe that the Wheat Research Council should take a very close look at his work and seriously consider giving him funding. As I say, I cannot find his name in the Wheat Research Council's annual report. Hopefully, when I stand up here next year we will see it, because it is a very important area. </PARA>
<PARA> This sort of commitment to rural industry needs to be supported and nurtured, and it is this sort of project that the Federal Government ought to be talking about when it talks in glowing terms about its new commitment to science. Of course, we have had all these new commitments to science given by the Government during the last election. Let us hope that the Government meets the promises it has made and does not back away from them. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is a good report. Research is absolutely essential. With the exception of the person I have mentioned, I would be very happy to endorse the report in its entirety, but obviously the Council will have to think very seriously about where it spends its money. I just repeat that I hope that in the next report I see Dr Murali Nayudu as a recipient of research money for the root disease take-all which ravages the New South Wales wheat crops. </PARA>

<PARA>What is extremely interesting about this report of the inquiry into the death of Mark Wayne Revell is that in the first section, entitled `Introduction and Synopsis', there are some general statements which are pertinent to each and every one of the reports of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In fact, under the heading `The task of the Royal Commission' Commissioner J. H. Wootten states that the death of Mark Wayne Revell is in many ways typical of the deaths, concern over which led to the establishment of the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Wayne Revell is described as a restless, unfulfilled Aboriginal who spent hours drinking, a man who was detained for a reason arising out of his intoxication, who disappeared into police custody where no-one but the police had access to him and within four hours of being put in a cell was found hanged. Some time later his relatives were told that he had hanged himself, and they were told this by someone who appears to have revealed few details about what happened. So, naturally enough, the relatives were distressed, devastated and puzzled. The Commissioner states that there was no independent or thorough investigation at the time. There was a ritualistic gathering of exculpatory statements, and those in their turn were rubber-stamped by an equally perfunctory coronial inquiry in which the relatives were represented in a token way or virtually no way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one of the dreadful indictments of the whole system, and it does not apply only to Aboriginal deaths in custody but often applies to all deaths in custody. In fact, one case is currently being heard in the State of Victoria of a young non-Aboriginal woman who died under extremely strange circumstances in Pentridge Gaol. The Commissioner in his report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Had there been at the time an open and understanding attempt to meet the concerns of the relatives; a thorough, independent investigation; and a real attempt to confront and deal with the underlying issues which led to the occurrence of the tragedy, no Royal Commission would have been necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, our coronial system often is simply a rubber stamp of what the custodians of the time have said had been the cause of death. The aims of the Commission are stated very clearly in the first section. The Commissioner asks, `Why do Aboriginals die in custody in such appalling numbers?'. He found:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the much higher death rate is not to be found in discriminatory treatment in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, if we look at the statistics in my own home State of Western Australia we see that there are approximately equal numbers of deaths in custody for Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people, but of course very many Aboriginal people are imprisoned compared with the percentage of Aboriginal people in the population. Commissioner Wooton states:</PARA>
<PARA>If white Australians had died in custody at the same rate as Aboriginals between 1980 and 1988, there would have been some 7,000 deaths in custody, or about two per day, and no doubt a Royal Commission would have been established much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody will not complete its work but will close down later this year. The work has been valuable but it has not been valuable enough. The Aboriginal people feel that in certain cases charges should have been laid where death has been caused by neglect or extreme negligence, so there is some cynicism about the whole Commission itself. This is to be regretted, but what is to be commended are the sorts of statements which we now have written and inscribed into reports such as this one. </PARA>

<PARA> The progress report on this program of transferring nursing education from hospitals to tertiary institutions reports on the period 1985 to the present. To all intents and purposes it looks a very satisfactory report, and I welcome it. The program seems very progressive and, as I understand it, the nursing profession itself has welcomed it. One point of importance at the moment is that this year is the first time that Queensland has joined in the program, and it is hoped that by 1993 the transition will be completed throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the program is training 9,500-odd nurses, and it is hoped that by its completion it will be training 18,000 nurses a year, which is considered adequate for Australia's requirements, and I hope it is. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that two streams of nurses are involved in the transition. Some of them are trained in the hospitals at the moment. Of course, they receive their clinical and theoretical training in the hospital and receive payment while they are there. The other stream attends the colleges of advanced education. They are treated the same as other tertiary students and do not receive payment. They have a varying schedule that supplies their clinical training and theoretical training, which can be in the proportion of 60:40. In other words, they would be at the college of advanced education for 60 per cent of the time and then spend 40 per cent of the time in the hospitals, for which they are not paid, but of course they would be treated like all other tertiary students then. </PARA>
<PARA> The nursing profession seems happy with the program. I congratulate the people who are running it and look forward to its completion in 1993. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This very valuable report is a careful assessment of the lessons to be learned as set out by the Parliament House Construction Authority. It surveys the past 11 years, from the decision to go ahead with this building, the process of design of the building and then the contracting processes, the management of not only the construction but also the budget, and relations with both the government of the day and with members of parliament through the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreword is written by the Chairman, Alex Morokoff, and in a very modest way he refers to this building, the new Parliament House, as `one of the nation's most significant recent public projects'. I would rather have said-and not having been responsible for the Construction Authority, I would say as a senator who uses this building-that it is the most significant public building in Australia. I regard it as an enormous success, given the terms of reference and the goal of constructing a permanent home for the Parliament of Australia-and that means institutionalising in an even more concrete way the processes of democracy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I share the criticisms of many users of the building that it is a very large building and is not as cosy and does not make for people contact as much as was the case in the old Parliament House that we knew for so many years. But I believe this is the pre-eminent public building of Australia. Indeed, it is the pre-eminent building in Australia-and so it should be. As the home of democracy, it is the place where all the governments of Australia are held accountable to elected representatives of the people in the two chambers of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have time to refer briefly to only a few aspects of the report, one of which is that this building was completed on time and within budget. I also want to refer to the conclusions that relate to the Authority's relationship with elected parliamentarians in the process of decision making. Finally, I want to refer to the criticism in this report of the management by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation of electronic, cabling and other devices that are a very important part of this building. </PARA>

<PARA> I refer now to the budget. Chapter 15 of the report sets out very clearly the nature of the budget for this new Parliament House. When construction was approved in the Fraser Government period in 1978 the Parliament approved spending of $151m, but when it was actually completed two years ago there had been spending of $1.1 billion. Of course, it has become notorious in almost daily conversation around Australia, in Women's Weekly articles and the like, that there was a vast blowout in the budget for this most prestigious building in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I actually welcome the factual nature of chapter 15 because it shows how the $151m of 1978 became the $1.1 billion of 1989. It certainly is demonstrated in that chapter that this was not in any way the result of the Authority's mismanagement. It was not the result of any unexpected element--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the recent floods in the west of Queensland and NSW have been the worst in a hundred years, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) many families and individuals have lost their possessions and suffered great hardship and many local businesses cannot be re-established without substantial aid;</PARA>

<PARA> (d) further notes that, for the towns downstream of the floods, appropriate planning was greatly hindered because no accurate predictions could be made of the likely flood levels given the complex geography and the variables involved in the great western river systems as opposed to the eastern coastal rivers; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) calls on the Federal Government to fund an adequate research program as a matter of urgency so that an accurate computer model can be generated and developed to aid planners in future floods. </PARA>
<PARA>Major floods have recently afflicted western Queensland and western NSW, the worst floods we have seen for 100 years. I want to raise a matter in the Senate tonight in a bipartisan, apolitical way for the welfare of the people out there in western Queensland and western NSW. There are three topics I would like to cover. The first is the immediate provision of emergency services; the second is the provision of emergency services in the longer term; and the third is prediction services for these regions-prediction services relating to future flood levels and velocity flows of water through the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with the first of those topics, the immediate emergency services that were provided, and having visited those areas in western Queensland on a number of occasions, I think the immediate response was excellent, particularly from the uniformed services. The Royal Australian Air Force and the Australian Army gave excellent service. They provided all the resources that were required at the time. We had a little talk about Chinooks in Question Time today, and I will come back to that in a moment. I would also like to mention the Queensland police because I think that very much maligned sector of the Queensland community performed marvellously in the service of the community, as did the Queensland State Emergency Service, which is recognised as being the best organised and best developed emergency service organisation in the country. We did not seem to have much of a problem, if any at all, in Queensland with law and order, pillaging and things such as that, although there were accounts of such problems in other States. </PARA>
<PARA> I reinforce what the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said this afternoon about the provision of the Chinooks. The equipment provided by the services was perfectly adequate for the task and certainly no lives were lost. Undeniably, had the Chinooks been available they would have been extremely useful but, as the Minister said, the correct decision on that is on their military application. Do we have the military requirement for them? The answer to that is absolutely, unambiguously yes, and the decision of the Government to withdraw the Chinooks from service, which was purely a cost saving measure, was one of the monumental acts of stupidity in recent years in relation to the Services. However, I make the point that the emergency services that were provided at the time were excellent. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point in relation to emergency services, the longer term provision of aid, obviously leaves quite a bit to be desired. The floods that afflict western New South Wales and western Queensland are different in nature from the floods that habitually affect the east coast in areas such as the Hunter River in New South Wales, the Mary River Valley in Queensland, the Burdekin, and those other eastern coastal streams. The differences are twofold. First of all, there is a good predictive service with the coastal streams on the eastern coast because people experience these floods relatively frequently, every three or four years. They know from experience that if they get 20 inches of rain in 48 hours in the headwaters, the water will be 10 feet high in the main street of a town or something like that. So there is a good predictive service. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing about it is that help is always at hand because in the coastal cities there are hills as well as valleys. While a flood is quite devastating for those people whose businesses or houses are in the submerged areas, it is possible for them to seek refuge and to have support close at hand. It is entirely different out in the great western inland areas, where there is a very flat landscape, and for people in those towns that become inundated there simply is no refuge. It might be 100 miles for them, if they can travel on roads that are under water, before they get to dry ground and can get accommodation and food. So the scale of what is going on in the west is really quite different because of the flat terrain and the isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> While the immediate emergency services were excellent, the difficulty those people face now is knowing precisely what the State Government and the Federal Government are going to do to help them re-establish their lives and their communities. The paper shuffling in the bureaucracy and all the rest of it is going on. It has been three or three and a half weeks since these houses were flooded in some cases and these families do not know what sort of financial support they can get from either the State or the Federal government. I think that is quite wrong. They should be told as soon as possible what help is available because they have to make a decision whether they are going to try to re-establish their lives in those communities, and re-establish the communities themselves, or whether they are going to go to another part of Australia to re-start their lives. I have a view that it is not very onerous for the Commonwealth to give the businessmen and the families in those areas a remission on their personal income tax for the financial year 1989-90 to help them become re-established. Without minimising in any way the complexity of the need for financial support for these people, I believe the matter ought to be hurried up so that they know where they stand and can get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is the one I want to spend a little time on tonight and that is the development of predictive services. We really do need to know what is going to happen when we have abnormally high rainfalls in the central part of this country. We simply do not have any predictive services at present. It is a matter of saving life. When these floods occurred there was a total absence of an ability to predict how high the flood would be in various areas. Given the terrain, about which I was speaking before, a very flat landscape and no way of readily being able to move to higher ground, it becomes very important. Being so flat, the roads and rail services go out, and the only way one can move around there is by air, and in some cases the airfields go under. Perhaps there is a creek, as in the case of Cunnamulla's, between the airfield and the town itself. A predictive service is absolutely vital. If the water height can be predicted, in all these cases there is time, probably weeks, from the time the floods are in Longreach to the time they reach right down to the bottom of the Darling River in southern New South Wales. In Queensland it takes a couple of days before the Thomson River at Longreach flows down and ends up in the Warrego River, if indeed they link up. Certainly, in the case I am thinking of, there were probably 48 hours between the flood peaks in Charleville and in Cunnamulla. </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation one of the difficulties faced by the Army and the State Emergency Service was the worry as to how high the flood water was going to get in Cunnamulla. As I said before, the road from the township to the airport crosses a creek and was underwater. There are about 1,500 people in the town, and the debate was whether, if levee banks were built, they would be high enough, in which case there was no need to evacuate the town. If the water rose above the levee banks, there would have been 1,500 men, women and children in the township and no way of extricating them. In the end, the decision was taken to leave the people in the township and, fortunately, the levee banks kept the water out. </PARA>
<PARA> That led me to think what we could do in similar circumstances, which will undoubtedly occur in the future. Having looked at the matter, I believe it is possible to make a prediction. We need to spend some money on a research program and develop a computer model. The technology exists at present to put on computers a database of the terrain. There are such techniques as digital terrain modelling by which a digital topographic database can be created; in other words, the characteristics, the heights and all the physical features of the countryside can be recorded digitally and inserted into a databank on a computer. From that information, it is then possible for hydrologists, civil engineers and scientists to make predictions taking account of the soil types and vegetation. If they know the amount of rainfall that has occurred in the area, they can estimate where the water will go and make a prediction as to what flooding will occur in these towns. </PARA>
<PARA> We are doing that at the present time, albeit slowly. The Army Survey Corps has this in hand for various parts of the country. AUSLIG, the Australian Land Information Group, which is the old national mapping group of the Commonwealth, has this capability, as do, of course, the State mapping agencies. It is certainly a big exercise and it is expensive to put all that information into a database in a computer. But from a national point of view we need it, and there will come a day when the topographic features for the whole of Australia will be recorded in a database in a series of computers. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am putting to the Senate tonight is that the Federal Government should direct those agencies which have the power to prepare this database to acquire the data for western Queensland, western New South Wales and any other parts of Australia where it is appropriate, and fund them accordingly. Then, when we are are faced with future floods, the emergency services and relevant authorities can say, `Well, given that amount of water we will have, in the main streets of Cunnanulla and Nyngan, a flood level of eight feet, so we had better evacuate everyone.' It could be a matter of life saving importance. </PARA>
<PARA> These situations, rare though they might be, will occur in the future, and I believe it is a very worthwhile exercise for the Government to embark upon. We have been talking about heights of flood water in the western towns. The same technology will enable us to estimate flow rates. Some of the damage I saw in those western towns was caused not only by the houses and buildings being inundated by water but also by the velocity flow through there. I would estimate that some of the flows were as high as 25 to 30 knots, and that is surprising. When one looks at the flatness of the land, one would not think that the water velocity would be that fast. But it is possible to predict the velocities and the heights. I think that the community would benefit from such a move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter before us this evening is quite a serious matter in relation to the floods which have occurred in Queensland but they are in no sense unique, in that in this country we have an extremely variable climate. I suppose the most noticeable feature of the Australian climate is its variability and the fact that we are subject not only to floods but also to quite horrendous bushfires from time to time consequent upon long periods without rain. For instance, at present in South Australia we have had to reinstitute the fire warnings, which is the first time on record outside the fire season. The Adelaide Hills is an area which is very subject to bushfire and which essentially has had no rain since the weekend of the Grand Prix in Adelaide in October, I think it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, we have these problems of the intermittent and unpredictable occurrence of extremes of weather and the consequences in terms of flood and bushfire. But I cannot agree with Senator MacGibbon's suggestion in relation to computer modelling for the reason that he is assuming that the weather of the future will be like the weather of the past. I think we need to understand that with the very rapid changes in the composition of the global atmosphere, it is extremely likely that the weather of the future will be very unlike that of the past. To think that we can make predictions in relation to the future based on the past is, I think, to misread what we now understand about global climate changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the floods in Queensland have been described as the hundred year flood, it may well be that in the next century the flood return times will be once every 10 years, because another feature of the changing climate which is well understood by climatologists is that the changes in the extreme will be much greater than the changes in the mean; in other words, the frequency of occurrences of extreme events such as drought or flood will increase quite dramatically even with quite slight shifts in the mean temperature. Whilst nobody has yet said-and I certainly will not be saying-that a number of events around Australia in recent years are due to greenhouse warming, nonetheless climatologists are saying they are consistent with what one would observe if we were experiencing greenhouse warming. The Queensland floods fall into that category, but so do the four or five extremely heavy rainfall periods that have occurred in and around Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, the extremely dry weather which we are now experiencing in South Australia is absolutely without precedent and bushfire warnings have had to be given outside the regular bushfire season. I think the idea that we might establish a computer model which in some way will be able to predict either the occurrence of these events or the consequences of the events is rather unlikely. I certainly would support Senator McGauran to the extent that the collection of data on land forms and those sorts of things which, given certain rainfall, would allow one to predict the consequences of the heights of floods might be useful. But being able to predict the frequency of occurrence of these events and to plan where to put houses and how high to put them-the cost-benefit type analysis-is simply not possible, given the changes which are likely to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at many of the houses that went under water, it seems to me that one could make a more sensible suggestion along the lines of, what happened in Darwin, where after the cyclone the building regulations were changed so that all houses had to be able to withstand winds of a certain velocity. We now have in Australia extremely good ferroconcrete techniques which are used for building boats and, rather than put houses on concrete foundations, one could imagine these low-lying houses being built on ferroconcrete foundations which, in the event of flood, would simply allow the houses to rise and float; and, as the flood went down, the houses would settle back more or less where they were, provided they were sufficiently anchored. So one could envisage quite feasible changes in building regulations which would substantially reduce the degree of damage should such an event occur again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell has just suggested that it might be better to put them up three or four feet. But as I understand it, the topography of the area in which these floods have occurred is very flat and it would be somewhat difficult to find raised ground to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several other matters to which I would like to draw attention in relation to this matter of so-called natural occurrences which may have relatively minor consequences or, in some instances, very devastating consequences. One relates to the matter of insurance against these events. It is particularly true in the case of a bushfire-the natural disaster which we have suffered from particularly in South Australia-that often the consequences of a particular action bear no consistent relationship to the initiating cause. For instance, as happened in the Ash Wednesday bushfires, wires may clash together and start extensive bushfires. If those wires clash together in mid-winter and sparkes fall to the ground, the consequences may be quite trivial. But if they clash together and fall to the ground in times of very strong north winds and a temperature of perhaps 40 degrees centigrade, the consequences can be quite disastrous. So the initiating cause very often bears little relationship to the final outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises the very vexed question of appropriate insurance in the case of these so-called natural disasters. I believe that it would be appropriate to establish a national insurance scheme which would fund the cost of recovery from these sorts of events over and above the amount which it would be reasonable to expect individuals-or indeed anything up to State utilities-to insure themselves against. The effect of that would be that these excessive levels of damage-which occur rarely but may occur more frequently in the future, as I have indicated-would be covered by some sort of a national insurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise my next point in relation to the recent floods particularly in view of an answer given by Senator Ray to a question at Question Time today. He seemed to be arguing that the military defence forces should not be used for civil purposes. The question was particularly in relation to the use of certain helicopters. The gist of his answer-if I understood him correctly-was that, while he would perhaps consider the retention of these particular helicopters for military purposes, he would not consider their retention for civil purposes. In the opinion of the Australian Democrats, that is the wrong way to look on the whole defence establishment. We would certainly prefer to see a defence establishment which linked both military and civil defence into the one set of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn again for a moment to the question of bushfire. We have been proposing for quite some time that, under military control, there should be a fleet of the Canadian CL215 aircraft, which was developed in Canada for the water bombing of bushfires. These aircraft could also be used to ferry troops, or they could be used for the interception of boats engaged in illegal fishing around the north coast of Australia. They could land beside an illegal fisherman, somebody who was drug running or importing exotic diseases or carrying illegal immigrants-anything like that. These aircraft would be capable of landing right beside vessels, boarding them and making arrests then and there. That would be a far better way of dealing with the situation than the current method of so-called surveillance in the northern parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is but one example of the way in which we believe there should be an integration of the military services in-and let us hope it will never be necessary-the defence of Australia and in a civil defence program, which of course is necessary and is quite frequently called upon in the event of natural disasters like fire and flood. Moreover, it would give the military a clear role in the event of these civil emergencies. It would, therefore, help to allay much of the ill feeling in the community against the retention of substantial military forces in peacetime, when it is thought that military people simply sit around and do not do very much. If they were integrated into a civil defence program, then they could be seen to be extremely useful. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the relationship between the defence forces and the public would be very much improved by such a program. That would mean that the purchasing of military hardware would be done with an eye to its use in the event of such things as the floods in Queensland. A clear role would be defined for the military forces in the event that one of these disasters occurred. We strongly recommend that the shape of Australia's military defence structure be reoriented along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA> We see that there is a considerable need to address more adequately the problems which occur in Australia quite frequently but in an unpredictable fashion-the problems of fire and flood. They are a feature of the Australian environment. We are not convinced that the sort of computer modelling which Senator McGauran suggested would be able to make the sorts of predictions precisely, because the weather in the future is going to be, we believe, with substantial evidence, unlike the weather in the past. Nonetheless, we believe that successive governments in the past made inadequate provision for these, in a statistical sense, `predictable' disasters. In that occurrence we should direct attention to adequate national insurance which would cover the costs over and above the reasonably insurable costs by individuals and organisations. There should be an integration of the civil and military defence programs and under such a scheme there would be an easier way of dealing with these events when they inevitably occur in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I draw your attention to the lack of a Minister in the House at present. I request that a Minister be in attendance because I believe it is part of the Westminster system. I would like my contribution tonight to be heard by someone who will be able to take it into Cabinet. I will continue with my remarks while maybe the Government Whip or person in charge can muster one of the Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the motion moved by Senator MacGibbon. I know that Senator MacGibbon went out to western areas soon after the floods. Tonight I want to speak mainly about the Queensland floods. My colleague Senator Brownhill who visited the western areas of New South Wales will take up that particular issue and Senator McGauran will talk about the floods as they affected the Gippsland area of his State, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say most disasters in Australia are subject to some type of insurance, whether fire, earthquake or storm and tempest, but in the case of the floods that inundated western Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria there was very little, if any, insurance cover. In the areas of Blackall, Jericho and Augathella very few people had insurance cover. Maybe one or two in Blackall had some insurance cover. The cost of insurance is prohibitive so the people affected are completely dependent on the charity of people in Australia who answer calls for donations and government assistance to get them out of financial trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland, the loss is estimated by the Queensland State Government at over $100m. Three hundred thousand sheep and 11,000 cattle were lost at a cost of about $7.5m; 9,000 kilometres of fencing was swept away at a cost of $15m; the damage to dams and machinery is estimated to cost $7m. They are Department of Primary Industries and Energy figures. That adds up to around $30m for rural losses and that does not count the damage to homesteads and the contents of rural properties. </PARA>
<PARA> In Charleville, 159 of the 160 businesses sustained damage. The whole of the business area was under water. I think only one service station in the whole town did not sustain some type of loss. Out of 1,470 houses or dwellings, 1,180 were damaged. Alpha, Jericho, Blackall and Augathella sustained similar losses. The estimates for the houses and business areas are $2m for the clean-up, $4m for personal assistance, $25m for housing, $13m for contents, $6.3m for business and $30m for infrastructure, a massive loss in those areas. Added together, it comes to a total of more than $14m. That has been taken from the ecomomy of western Queensland and has to be replaced if Charleville and those other towns are going to have a viable future. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of help has been given, but it has been self-help and help from people living in adjoining areas. Adjoining shire councils sent men and equipment. Fire brigade equipment and trucks came from as far as the Gold Coast and all the adjoining shires. The grazing community answered the call by putting their firefighting and jetting equipment on the backs of trucks and jet spraying the houses, despite their own considerable problems and losses. </PARA>
<PARA> The state emergency services came from all the adjoining shires and towns. They came from as far as Gympie, Crows Nest and Toowoomba. The Army erected a tent city at the airport and fed, quartered and housed 4,000 of the townspeople for nearly a week. Special thanks go to two people there that I think should be mentioned. Cam Russell and Dale Wilson flew their mustering choppers all night until they were just about in conditions that were dangerous to themselves and their machines. They flew the small choppers around the hospital and hovered them over the roofs and evacuated people until the military helicopters could arrive on the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the help that has been given to these towns has been magnificent, but now the cleaning up is just about over, massive financial problems are emerging, particularly in the business community. I want to address my remarks to the business community at the moment. The Queensland Government sent in a team of assessors who assessed the preliminary damage to the business area to be around $6.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to the business people and to bank managers and managers of other financial institutions out there and they consider that amount to be very much underestimated. I think what has happened is that the loss assessors went into the major streets and assessed the retail businesses but they did not look for the shearing contractor who was operating not from commercial premises but from his home and whose house went under water. Such people would probably have $50,000 worth of shearing handsets and trucks and all the equipment that is needed to sustain a business. They did not assess the losses of kangaroo shooters who lost their rifles; of plumbers, carpenters, and all the other types of businesses run from the home. </PARA>
<PARA> Bank managers and other business people have assessed the losses at much more than the $6.3m that the Government has estimated. The position out there is that a number of businesses now are forced into having to restock their premises, having lost just about everything. Not unlike all Australian businesses, they have been only stemming the tide of the high interest rates, and any further losses or any further borrowings would put them out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of businessmen told the Premier and the Deputy Prime Minister when they visited that, even if they were given loans on non-interest terms, they would have to think very seriously about whether they could accept them because, together with the commitments they already have, they did not see that there would be any way that they could repay any additional loans, even if they were non-interest loans. So it is absolutely essential that some types of grants are offered to these people to help them get through their time of need now. </PARA>
<PARA> I called on one lady who ran a shoe store out there. I asked this lady whether she would mind me using her name and she said that she would not. Her name was Noreen Hendle. She had been running a shoe store out there since 1949-not a big business but a business that gave her and her family sustainable living. She is now, I think she told me, around retiring age and she had the mortgage on her business secured by a mortgage on her house. She had just purchased her winter stock and, together with her normal lines, which completely went under in the flood, she has lost something like $70,000. She is faced with the prospect now of borrowing a further $70,000 to restock her shop or just walking away and not being able to trade out. Then she wonders what will happen to the mortgage on her home. </PARA>
<PARA> She is typical of a number of people in that flood area that are just sitting there at the moment trying to make a decision. These people-there are 130 of them in Charleville-need to know immediately what type of assistance can be offered to the business community. They are uncertain what direction to take and what financial decisions to make. The Premier has promised assistance, but it is now three weeks since the flood and, while there is a promise of assistance, no actual assistance plan has been put down. These people are beginning to become edgy at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked yesterday in the Senate whether the Government could make its assistance plan known to the people, because they have been sitting there for the last three weeks wondering what direction they have to take. If there is no assistance in the form of grants, many of those businesses will have to close. If the businesses close, that will directly affect the viability of the town because one business depends on the next business. If the chain is broken, then the town loses its viability. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of extreme importance that the Federal and State governments announce their plans as soon as possible. Senator Button informed me yesterday that, while the Queensland Government had made some application for loans on a personal hardship basis, there had been no plan to assist the small business community out there. I believe that that plan will be coming down in the next 24 to 48 hours, and I fervently hope that the Federal Government can make some urgent provision to let the people know what assistance will be available. While there has been a great spirit of help and self-help out in the Charleville-Augathella area, people are now starting to become worried because they have had to clean out their inundated businesses and then return home to a flood damaged house. This is starting to weight very heavily on their minds.</PARA>
<PARA> While disaster funding is basically a matter for State governments, the Federal Government, I believe, can offer some form of assistance. I believe there are initiatives that the Federal Government could take. Senator MacGibbon alluded to a tax holiday. There are a number of people out there who are due to pay provisional tax. That is one area in which the Government could help. The traders certainly will not be paying provisional tax on next year's income and perhaps the Federal Government could refund the provisional tax that became due only in the last two months or so. That would be a massive help. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax is also something that the Government could look at-sales tax on replacement goods that are going out there. Perhaps the Federal Government could look at a way of not charging sales tax on replacement refrigerators, replacement tools, and replacement food. All that type of thing is an initiative that the Federal Government would be able to implement. </PARA>
<PARA> The business community has called for wage assistance. That precedent was established when the Government funded the airline strike so that a number of airlines' employees would not lose their income during an industrial dispute. That has been established. If the Government could for, say, three or four weeks assist the business community with a wage package to keep the workers employed, to create a cash flow among the businesses, then that would be a worthwhile project. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the Government does, it is absolutely essential that it advises the small business community whether it is going to give grants because grants really are the only way that the community will get back up and running. There may be grants required that will have to be in terms of the percentage of the loss sustained by the business, topped up by disaster funding. There are already in Queensland arrangements whereby small businesses can borrow up to $80,000 at 6 per cent. That maybe the way to go where the proportion of the loss is agreed to in percentage terms, topped up with 6 per cent loans. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I ask the Minister responsible for disaster relief as a matter of urgency to advise exactly what grants, loans and assistance will be made available. </PARA>

He was obviously very taken by his appearance and by his presence. Obviously he is a very noticeable person in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking to this motion tonight, I would like particularly to address my remarks on behalf of the people of New South Wales-the many thousands of those people in my home State-affected by the floods. We can all safely in the dry and protected chambers of this Parliament talk glibly about acts of God, and of course flooding naturally comes under that heading. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest for one moment that the floods could have been prevented by another act of God or that we ought to have foreseen them, but it is evident from talking to those involved that more should have been done sooner. More should have been known about the dangers and better damage control methods could have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> At the last count-and these figures were supplied to me by the office of the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture-a total of 50,000 square kilometres of the north-western area of New South Wales and an area around the Lachlan River has been flood affected. Around Australia-these figures are not from the New South Wales department-the area inundated is the size of Germany, France and Britain. So the floods are widespread and their effects are quite horrific. I know it is very hard for those who have not flown over or been in a flooded area to comprehend the extent of the disaster. Even for those of us who have seen floods before, I do not think it is easy to comprehend how a drought affected area changed overnight into a flood affected area. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity 10 days or more ago to go from Dubbo across through Warren to Bourke and Brewarrina; I came back and spent some time in Nyngan. I saw at first hand what had been happening to the people in that area and it was quite traumatic. I have had a little bit of experience with floods myself. In 1955 I happened to be out at a property called `Haddon Rig' near Warren and I know what it is like to walk all day through waters up to and above your knees, among the centipedes and black and brown snakes, and in the squelching mud. I can just imagine how it would have been for people trying to rescue their sheep in this flood, because the mud quickly becomes very sticky. I can remember quite vividly trying to swim across a small creek running into the Marthaguy on `Haddon Rig' and deciding, when I was halfway across, to hang on to a tree because I was getting a bit tired, only to find it was covered with black and brown snakes. I can assure honourable senators my tiredness quickly diminished and I swam on with renewed vigour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is not right; but it is not a nice experience. That is a while ago now, but I can understand that the people affected by the present flooding would have had similar experiences to those that I had on that occasion. One never forgets the experience of walking around all day in water up to and above one's knees, trying to save sheep, and getting back to one's bed at night, only to find it stuck up on bricks to keep it above the water in the house. Then there is the smell of the water, which I might add is not so bad in the first few days of the flood, but after that it really starts to stink because of the dead animals and, as the water begins to fall, the stinking mud. I can remember getting home at night and not having a nice place to lay my head. So I can understand a little of the heartbreak and the trauma and disruption that these people have been through. I would like to put on record my sympathy, and I am sure this chamber would join with me in extending sympathy, to those affected by the floods all over Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I saw the town of Nyngan, where we spent three hours. It was the most eerie experience that I have been through for some time. There were only a few people still in the town. The water marks were half to three-quarters of the way up the walls of some of the houses. I saw the smashed windows of the shops in the main street. I was struck by the stench of rotting food in the town. I saw motor cars jacked up on bricks to keep them out of the floodwaters-unsuccessfully, might I add, because what people thought from experience was going to be the level of the water was exceeded. I saw cars, some them still half full of water, in the streets. There were cars on verandahs where people had driven them, hoping to get them out of the water, some of them with the bonnet or the front end of the car stuck up at an angle in an effort to keep the engine out of the water. I can imagine the trauma that those people must have suffered when the water was going through their town. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there were all the household goods and other things that had been ruined. There are something like 100 businesses in Nyngan, employing maybe 500 people. Think of the problems of a place like a motel. The Nyngan Motel had 33 refrigerators, 120 chairs, 33 air-conditioners, 33 television sets and 80 doors-and doors do warp and get ruined very quickly with a flood. Let us not forget the fact that there are no guests in the motel to pay the way of the motel keeper for quite some time. I just mention a motel as a big business in a small town. It employs people and it has its own traumas. While we were in Nyngan we met Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair, who has been appointed by the State Government to deal with that disaster area, and I commend the State Government for having done that. Within about 24 hours the Rear Admiral had the whole thing under control, I would say. He is a very bright, intelligent and well trained man. I commend the State Government and the Rear Admiral for the job that has been done already. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget the properties and homesteads in those areas which are completely isolated by water; let us not forget the livestock that have suffered through the floods. We are faced with a geographic, economic, social and financial disaster that is having a more traumatic effect in the small area of Nyngan than it would in a bigger area. That night I visited Wesley Hall in Dubbo, where the evacuees were congregated, and I would like to pay tribute to them. They were magnificent. They were accepting the fact that they could not go back to their houses because there was a concern about the health risks in the town, apart from the fact that there was not any water available for them to wash their houses out if they went back. There was no electricity. Here they were in the evacuees centre, wondering what had happened to their houses, which they had left a night or two before. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at their problems. Most of us have a house, as they have. Think how we would feel to find the television set under water as well as the refrigerator, the stove and the washing machine. Think of all the stuff in the pantry, the electrical appliances-the toaster and the radiator. Then there are the carpets, furniture, bedding, curtains and the air-conditioners. In a hot area like that the air-conditioners are halfway up the walls of the houses and they were completely covered with water. One would not have expected it, but they were. Then of course there was the clothing in the cupboards and the personal effects that were left in drawers as people left the town in haste. I was told of an elderly person in one house who was standing in water up to his chest when they went to rescue him. Of course, the water came in very quickly when the levees went. Those people will clean up their town. They have the determination to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another person actually left his farm some years ago because of drought. That person, at the age of 58, decided to set up a carrying business in Nyngan so that he could retire to the coast at a later date. Of course, that person has no carrying business left because there is nothing there to carry at the moment. He and his wife, having worked for their retirement, now have a dismal future. We need help for such people. That is the picture I am trying to paint for the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> We need help from the community. I believe that the way in which the community has gone to bat for people in the flood affected areas has been magnificent. In our area, in the north west of New South Wales near Tamworth, one person who sells fuel at his fuel station said that he would give one cent for every litre of fuel that he sold over the weekend. What a great way to help during a disaster such as this. If every garage in Australia decided to give one cent for every litre sold in order to help fellow Australians during a crisis. The person from the local video shop said that he would give 10c for every video that was hired over that weekend. That was a very commendable effort. If only every video shop in Australia would do the same thing. It would not hurt them to do it. It does not hurt anyone to give a little in order to help our fellow Australians in need. I note that even in this Parliament House the social and sporting club is running a raffle for the flood victims. I think we are all compassionate. We all want to do something for people in the flood affected areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few things that do concern me. One is the line of command that is used during a flood crisis. To me, there seems to be too much of a backlog at some stages. The local people may realise that there is going to be a big flood but, just because the monitors located on the main river do not show that this will occur, the State Emergency Services do not really take full account of the effect of local water. I am told that some of the early warning systems for the major rivers are correct, but the minor local waters cause a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also problems regarding the way in which the defence forces are used. At this stage I would like to put on record my appreciation of the efforts of the defence forces which, when called in, worked tirelessly. I wish to thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for his quick response to my calls for extra aircraft to assist in fodder drops. There was confusion at that stage over what the requirements would be. People did not know how many sheep were caught, partly because the farmers themselves were hazy about what was happening. Senator Ray responded very quickly, the Hercules aircraft went out, and a lot of sheep were saved. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other stories, however, of the defence forces being needed a little earlier. One of the stories I was told is that soldiers were cooling their heels on standby in Sydney while residents were desperately filling sandbags. There are stories of farmers and townspeople not being advised of the impending waters until almost the last minute, when it was too late for them to do more than lock the door and let the dogs out. Let us not forget, as I said earlier, the people who were in those isolated houses with water all around them. </PARA>
<PARA> The frequency of bushfires has educated us so that we can better handle bushfire catastrophes. I do not believe that emergencies such as the earthquake in Newcastle have been properly addressed by the Federal Government. There has been a distinct lack of urgency in its response to calls for various relief measures to be put in place for Newcastle. Under the national disaster relief arrangements, there is a complex formula under which the Federal Government provides funds for States on a pro-rata basis, linked with the amounts that the States themselves contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that, in the case of the three disasters that have happened in New South Wales in the last few months-the earthquake, the floods and the hailstorms-the funding situation is not as good as it should be because it is spread over two years. I suggest that the Australian Taxation Office should give sympathetic hearings to those affected by the disaster who pay provisional tax. It is good to see that Senator McMullan is present. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, perhaps he can take that issue to him. I know that he has given some thought to it. It would be very much appreciated by small businesses and others in the community if they could be given a chance to adjust their provisional tax payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect to be considered in order to get the towns back on the right track is the need to keep people in those towns. I know that one suggestion by some members of the Federal Parliament at the time of the Newcastle disaster was to give people the unemployment benefit. That is not good enough because once people go on the unemployment benefit they are lost to the employer. This affects their comradeship with fellow workers and their long term employment record. We really need to have an unemployment benefit that is in some way locked into the employment situation. A grant should be made available so that the employees remain working for the employer until the crisis is over. Obviously, they would have the right to leave if they wanted to do so. That would help people to clean up the flood damage much quicker and in a much better way. Those are just two areas that I believe should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point with regard to the tax Act which I hope Senator McMullan will take on board relates to new fencing and the fact that it is deductable only at a depreciable rate. If it is a flood damaged fence I believe there should be total deductability in the year of expenditure because people have to rebuild their fences in order to ensure that their stock remains in the right place. </PARA>
<PARA> Those three requests are very minor ones which the Government could take on board in order to show compassion and to help people in the communities. The loans that are given by some State governments are not enough. People with these horrific problems need more than that: they need compassion and grants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew that Senator Aulich would understand. I wish to address the Victorian aspect of the floods and relate to the Senate what occurred in the Gippsland area. The aftermath of that flood was best summed up in the Age newspaper in an article by Gerard Ryle. I will read snippets of that article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was a week in which even the trees of East Gippsland were filled with the dead. </PARA>
<PARA>On one property 486 sheep did not survive. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The worst thing was watching them drown and knowing that you could do nothing about it . . . dead sheep hung from the trees. Twisted cattle carcases, entangled in wire, remained as testament to what locals described as the `worst flood in white-man history'. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Latest statistics show that about 290 cattle and nearly 2000 sheep and goats died, and about 500 kilometres of fencing was damaged. More than 90,000 bales of hay and about 590 hectares of crops were lost. </PARA>
<PARA>I read that particularly for the benefit of the Government. It seems that it does not know of the frustrations and trauma suffered by the people of East Gippsland. At Question Time this afternoon, even in answer to a dorothy dix question, the most compassionate Senator Richardson-and I say that tongue-in-cheek-did not name the East Gippsland area as flood prone. He does not understand that these people have suffered like so many others in New South Wales and Queensland. Senator Coulter only addressed the Queensland floods. He did not know that we have had floods in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Worst of all, during this whole debate, this very important debate on the worst floods in Australia's history-one of the worst natural disasters in Australia's history, ranking alongside the Ash Wednesday bushfires or the 1982 drought-we have not had a Minister in the House. We have had no-one to take our requests, the people's requests, to Cabinet. Senator Boswell rightly requested early on in this debate that a Minister come into the House and at least listen to what we have to say and what the people from these flood zones have to say. Not one Minister has come into the House. In fact, the Government has not even got a quorum in this House. We are debating one of Australia's natural disasters, and the Australian Labor Party cannot even get one Minister on the front bench. It has got a lightweight over there. It is pretty pathetic and very sad. </PARA>
<PARA> I do recognise the widespread devastation caused by the floodwaters in Queensland and New South Wales and the trauma it brings not only to individual people but to the whole community. Anyone who has not been through such an experience, such a suffering, does not truly know or understand the loss. But like all Australians, I feel for their loss as much as one can looking from the outside; and such a loss was felt by the people of east Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA> In political terms, the area is the seat of Gippsland itself, held by the National Party of Australia member Peter McGauran-a fine member-but more importantly it is my home district. As the speakers have outlined this evening, nothing jolts us out of our so-called assumed importance of our daily lives than the force of a natural disaster such as the 1982 drought, the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires or the present floods which could be best classified as the east coast floods. The force of nature in these forms really does humble the human pride, yet as always it brings to the fore the most heroic aspects of the human spirit-and that is probably based on the most powerful instinct of survival. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Government at the outset that the aftermath of these floods will be with us for some time to come and they should not be forgotten because they are now off the six o'clock news or the front page of the newspaper. The clean-up has just started; the costs are just being counted; and the families are now just going home. I believe that the Federal Government is in the process of reviewing its relief measures-and the measures that can be taken are in the areas of taxation primarily and direct grants. We urge the Government to fully comprehend the effects of these floods and, without delay, to face up to meeting the requirements of the people affected by way of direct grants or tax relief. We are asking for no more than what is fair and just and, indeed, that the Government should face up to helping these people immediately. To deny that swift and proper action is really to deny a very long history in Australia of helping people in need, particularly during natural disasters. We who represent those people await the Government response. We signal to the Government our determination to fight for the needs of these victims. </PARA>
<PARA> It is then important, in the light of the Government's ignorance and for the record, for me to outline the events as they unfolded in Gippsland so that this chamber can gain some measure of the effect upon the Gippsland region. During Friday 20 April and Saturday 21 April between 14 and 16 inches of rain fell in the Great Dividing Range running east-west-a natural boundary for the Gippsland region. It was a phenomenal rainfall, a record rainfall, the heaviest rainfall ever known to the area, and it would have been doubly worse had we not had a dry period prior to that rainfall. In fact, weirs or dams such as the Glenmaggie weir were only half full and were able to absorb, to some extent, that great rainfall. </PARA>
<PARA> The flooding of the Avon resulted in some 30 homes and shops in the township of Boisdale-the best publicised township to be flooded-being completely under water as well as farmhouses and properties within a two-mile radius of Boisdale and the river banks. A number of vegetable and dairy farmers suffered heavy financial losses as well as crops, livestock, fencing, fodder and equipment being lost. The Avon continued to wreak havoc downstream in the Stratford and Airly areas. Here the losses to farmers were immense, with the force of the rain again causing heavy erosion and destruction of livestock, fences and property. </PARA>
<PARA> The second river, the Mitchell River, filled up and gushed with the same velocity. The Lindenow Flats, which accommodate the richest vegetable and dairyland in Australia, bore the full brunt of the flooding. It can only be described as a scene of complete disaster and devastation. The losses in that area wiped out 25 per cent of Victoria's vegetable produce. It was a horrific economic loss to the State. More particularly to the vegetable growers and their families, the burden is immense, because the topsoil was completely washed away as well as their pumping stations, houses, sheds and livestock. The Mitchell River also affected the very large township of Bairnsdale, where the houses and shops along the river banks were flooded and knocked off their stumps. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time given to me I have attempted to outline for the Senate the dimensions of the suffering caused to Gippslanders. For this reason, I have not dwelt on the extraordinary and heroic rescue efforts undertaken by the emergency services on Saturday 21 and Sunday 22 April. Whilst the Victorian State Government agencies, including the community services of Victoria and the Department of Agricultural and Rural Affairs deserve the highest commendation for their swift and constructive response to the victims of the flood, much remains to be done. My brother Peter McGauran, the honourable member for Gippsland, together with the honourable members for Maranoa, Gwydir, Parkes, Riverina-Darling and Farrer have made representations to the Commonwealth on behalf of their constituents, and it hardly needs to be said that they will be looking towards all members of Parliament, including honourable senators in this Chamber, to support them in obtaining Commonwealth assistance to rebuild the lives and businesses of so many families. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minute or two I have left I highlight one particular heroic act that I believe should not go unannounced and should be written into Hansard, but I will be as brief as I can. Mr Barry Marshall from the east Gippsland district-a hay carter and crop contractor; a very well-known identity in the area-though a very modest man, is a hero as a result of this disaster and devastation. By his actions, he saved the lives of one particular family-a mother, father and two daughters. Though I do not do justice by not relating the full story to the Senate, the near tragic incident began when a car with a family aboard was washed off a bridge into the torrent. Fortunately, the family scrambled to the top of the car and clung to the rack. None of the help and efforts were successful in netting the car from the torrent. In fact, the situation became very dangerous and a matter of concern and nightfall was coming. For one moment it seemed a hopeless situation as the onlookers feared for the lives of this particular family. </PARA>
<PARA> Barry Marshall, aware of the river's course, went home, fetched his very massive tractor, well known in the district-I believe it is a hay cutter-and drove it to the bend of the river and then into the river, dangerous in itself, thus blocking a proportion of it in the hope, and it was only a hope, that as the car rounded the bend it would collide with the tractor and all could climb aboard and be rescued. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank God that this is what happened. It was a chance taken, but a chance successful. It was indeed the last chance for this particular family. It was dangerous for Mr Marshall to try it, as rescue efforts had previously given up on such a dangerous exercise. What was lost was the tractor, but what was saved was a family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I would like to extend my sympathies to the people of Longreach Charleville, Jundah and Alpha. I know all the areas in Queensland that suffered some sort of loss during the flooding. Tonight we are discussing a motion moved by Senator MacGibbon. It shows very clearly that it would be very difficult for any member of this Senate to disagree with it, except, I think, in one instance. Senator MacGibbon in his motion said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the recent floods in the west of Queensland and New South Wales have been the worst in a hundred years-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone would have any argument with that-</PARA>
<PARA>many families and individuals have lost their possessions and suffered great hardship and many local businesses cannot be re-established without substantial aid . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is any argument with that from either side of the chamber. The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA> recognises that it is now 3 weeks since the onset of the floods and that the task of rebuilding is urgent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I do not think anyone would renege on what is stated in that clause. The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA> calls on the Federal Government in concert with the state governments, to explain in detail, as a matter of urgency, what help financial and otherwise will come from government sources so that those people affected can plan for the future reconstruction of their lives and communities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will deal with that item in a moment. Again, I do not think that anyone disagrees with that. I think it is very clear that the information is available, but I think people need to know where to go. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> further notes that, for the towns downstream of the floods, appropriate planning was greatly hindered because no accurate predictions could be made of the likely flood levels given the complex geography and the variables involved in the great western river systems as opposed to the eastern coastal rivers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is any argument there. The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA> calls on the Federal Government to fund an adequate research program as a matter of urgency so that an accurate computer model can be generated and developed to aid planners in future floods. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure that we on this side of the chamber would agree with that because I think other things need to be done first, and then I think the Government should look at what has happened and look further down the track as to what action it takes in relation to further planning and research. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with item (c), which calls on the Federal Government, along with the State governments, to explain the details of help as a matter of urgency. I think it is quite clear to everyone that that is very difficult at this early stage and that it will be some time before accurate figures are available. Loss assessments after a natural disaster are a difficult and a time-consuming exercise. I do not think anyone would argue with that. It is very difficult to assess the losses and to say who lost and who did not. </PARA>
<PARA> I know a lot of people can tell us stories, and I could tell some stories about the floods and what happened to various people as individuals. But I think we need to look more broadly than that, at the total overall-what has happened to the town itself, the best way that we can plan to give that town money, and the way in which we can plan to overcome the sorts of problems that the citizens in the area generally have. </PARA>
<PARA> I walked through the chamber earlier tonight and heard Senator Boswell talk about the losses that people have suffered in the area. I know that the honourable senator was talking about estimates-and that is all one can call them, and in this case I only have estimates-but they show very clearly that there have been some major losses in the area. I think those losses need to be established to the point where we, as a government which has a responsibility to allocate money from the taxpayer, know that those estimates are correct-we know the losses that they are suffering and the estimates they make in relation to those losses are very clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me at this moment run through some of the costs that people have estimated at this stage. I think it has been said on a number of occasions that the total estimate for the flood would be $100m. Apart from the losses on home services, stock losses are 300,000 sheep and 11,000 cattle. Some 360 properties have been affected and 9,000 kilometres of fencing have been destroyed. The total loss to primary industry is in the vicinity of $30m. Costs so far are $2m just to clean the towns up. To bring things back to some normality would cost in the vicinity of $2m. Other estimates include $3.5m for personal hardship; $25m to repair houses; $13m for furniture; $10m for repair to shops and businesses; and $30m for road works and public buildings. Without road works in western areas, where people are isolated, it is very difficult for a community to sustain itself and work in a normal fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon said in his motion that one of the things that we should be able to do is to outline to people exactly where they can gain the funds from or where they can go and request some sort of aid, whether it be financial or whatever. I think it needs to be remembered-and I do not think it is anything new-that there is a Commonwealth-State natural disaster relief arrangement which stays in place for all national disasters. A summary of the particular things that would be done in relation to national disasters very clearly outlines where people would be able to gain some sort of financial or other help in relation to the problems that they face because of the floods in their area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just for an example read from the first part of the national disaster relief arrangements. In relation to needy persons it mentions grants for relief of personal hardship and distress. The purpose would be needs and emergency repairs to dwellings. The upper limits of the amount and rates of assistance would be: single persons $6,000, families $8,000. The remarks that follow those things that I have outlined mention that initial inquiries should be made to the local clerk of the court and that assistance is means tested and may be invoked immediately if the need is indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> That is very clear. It is a document that is put out by this Government. In the first instance, I suggest to people that they go to the clerk of the court and make an inquiry. Some of the information that I am relating now would be made available to them. Further down the list-and I will not read all the points there-the document mentions government and semi-government authority grants for the restoration of public assets, and concessional loans for primary producers for carrying on restocking and restoration. We talk about the 300,000 sheep that have been lost; that is the sort of thing that would be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> It mentions small businesses. I know we have been accused from time to time, in particular by Senator Boswell, of not looking after small businesses, but there are concessional loans for the re-establishment and the carry-on of small businesses. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know, but Senator MacGibbon suggested in his motion that the information was not available. I think what people need to do, first of all, is to assess the loss they have had and go to the people that might be able to give some some assistance. From that point they will be able very easily to work out where they should go to gain the sort of money they may need to carry on or to re-establish their business. Thirdly, the document mentions churches, sporting organisations and non-profit organisations. There are concessional loans and grants for re-establishment. I think those are the sorts of things that are talked about in Senator MacGibbon's motion, and that is the sort of information that should be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If those members of parliament who represent Queensland and those areas that have flood problems go to the Treasury Department and ask for information on national disaster relief, I am sure the information will be made available to them. In turn, as good representatives, they will be able to pass on that information to the people who require it. </PARA>
<PARA> I say finally that one of the problems faced by the people in the western areas is that the towns that have been flooded are badly planned. One of the things this Government or any other government should look at in the future is whether we should spend money on repairing what is there or whether we should look at re-establishing some of those towns. If we have to spend $6m or $7m to repair a town and there is another flood in 10 years or 12 years time and we have to spend another $8m or $10m, it seems to me reasonable to spend the money to re-establish, so that something can be done for those towns. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable senators would understand that in western Queensland the problems faced by the towns relate not just to the water and the flooding. The towns have wide streets and the councils cannot afford to put down all bitumen. They put a narrow strip of bitumen down the middle of the street and there is an area on either side that is not covered. The streets are so wide and the blocks are so big that there is a cost problem in putting in services. All those things should be looked at now. In the long term if things were done now it would be cheaper for this Government, for other governments and for the people of western Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are only a couple of minutes left but I would like to refer to a couple of matters that have been spoken of that have particular relevance to areas that are currently within my area of responsibility in assisting the Treasurer. Those are the tax matters raised by Senator Brownhill, which I thought were positive. I cannot give an immediate reaction to them, of course, because it is the first time those particular matters have been raised with me, but I do want to take this opportunity to say that I will make sure those matters, in so far as they relate to the Taxation Office, are looked at. I have already made a note to ensure that the matters he raised in his speech are taken up tomorrow by my office and reviewed. Like Senator Jones, I have a little difficulty with the last paragraph of Senator MacGibbon's motions, but the speeches that he and other senators made provided a substantial contribution. The Senate has discussed a very important national matter that deserves proper attention here. We do need to distinguish sometimes between talking about important things and saying something important. I think tonight sometimes people did one and sometimes they did the other, but it is worthwhile that the Senate should provide the opportunity for people to make contributions about great matters of national importance. These may not be contributions using the Senate as a legislative chamber, but contributions using the Senate as a forum wherein representatives of the people from the various parties can say to the Government: `These are important issues. They cross the normal party boundaries. They are not partisan issues. They are not matters at this stage requiring legislation but they are matters that concern us, as representatives of the people in the three States concerned'' Senator McGauran is right about that, if not about much else. There are three States affected and it is important that we do acknowledge that in those three States people suffered considerable-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity, in speaking to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990, to highlight two points in relation to this Bill and the matters surrounding its inception. I do not want to take up the time of the Senate tonight in arguing about the merits and demerits of the existing export market development grants scheme or, for that matter, alternatives that have been proposed. What I do want to do is canvass two particular points that arise from this Bill being introduced and the matters surrounding its inception. The first relates to the insight that those matters give us into John Button and his capacity; and secondly, the insight that the matters leading up to this Bill being before us give us in relation to the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I can deal first with the second aspect, the insight into the media. I noticed an article in the Age of 1 March by Michelle Grattan headed `How an export insider unmade Button's day'. Apart from the fact that the subeditor should really have `undone Button's day'-it would have been slightly more witty-the article contains some quite telling points. What Ms Grattan is saying is that had a Mr Pointer from the Australian Export Action Committee not had other engagements here at the time and had he not happened to wander into the press conference, the course of this whole matter would be quite different. As she said:</PARA>
<PARA> Just before 10, he wandered into the room where the news conference was to be held. He was just a face in the crowd. He told a couple of journalists that the Government's proposed changes in the existing scheme to promote exports would mean that many exporters would lose. </PARA>
<PARA>As we all know now, this is something that the journalists were not told in the media coverage put out by the Government. She goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> A glance at the wad of documentation handed out to announce a new scheme and alteration of the old one showed that some key figures were missing. The Government had told only half the story. It put figures on the extra money but not on the cuts being made in the present scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is why the article is headed, `How an export insider unmade Button's day'. What Ms Grattan is saying is that but for Mr Pointer's presence at the press conference, that point would not have been picked up at that time. It follows from that that, had he not been there, maybe the media would have allowed the deceitful packaging of the plan to get through, to get by. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, quite frankly, that allows some very worrying inferences to be made about the capacity of the media to scrutinise Government announcements. I do not know that that is the conclusion Ms Grattan wanted us to draw but it is certainly the one that jumps out from the article under her byline. She goes on to underline the point I am making that but for an outside who knew the back and front of this scheme, the Government may have got away with this deceitful packaging. She says:</PARA>
<PARA> If the figures had only been exposed as questionable, the news conference might not have turned into such a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if it was only the figures that were wrong that the Government was producing, perhaps the media may have let it get away with it, and that underlines the worrying inferences that we ought to draw about the capacity of the media. She goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it was quickly clear that Senator Button did not know the figures for his own scheme . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is the real benefit of Mr Pointer having wandered into this room at 10 o'clock. First, there is the obvious benefit that the deceit of the Government was pointed out, but the real windfall is that the deceit occasioned the media to sit up and ask some genuine questions and find out that when Senator Button was not aware of the detail of the questions that were coming he was not able to give decent answers and the whole nation was laughing. </PARA>
<PARA> There we were. We should not be laughing because it is pretty embarrassing to find out that the Minister in charge of industry is doing calculations on the back of an envelope to try to get it right for the national media. That is very embarrassing, but that was Mr Pointer's real contribution. He allowed us to see exactly what Senator Button's real capacity is in that area. The inference, of course, is that unless Senator Button knows exactly what he is going to be asked he has not had someone give him the exact answer and he will be caught on the hop. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the matter got significantly worse. The Government then went on to what I believe is a damage control exercise. A number of quotes by Senator Button mention that it was irretrievable and perhaps they would have done better to take his advice that it was an irretrievable stuff-up. I think that is what Michelle Grattan referred to it as, and I would endorse her remarks in that respect. One of the Minister's later clarifying statements, as they are called-which means, `I made a big mistake and I will try to work my way out of it'-stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of uncertainties of the level of the Australian dollar and the open access nature of the scheme, it is impossible to predict with any accuracy what payments would have to be made in 1991-92 and 1992-93 had the scheme not been adjusted. </PARA>
<PARA>What that says is, `Look, it is all a bit difficult and we cannot really cost our scheme.' The reason he said that is that he gave four or five different costings of the scheme in the space of a couple of hours, so it is no surprise to me at all that he issued a statement saying how hard it was to cost it. </PARA>
<PARA> But where does that put our Minister and the Government in relation to industry policy as it relates to exports? It puts them down at that end of the Chamber with what Senator Walsh calls the fairies at the bottom of the garden. One of the most stinging complaints attacks on the Democrats attacks in the recent election campaign was made by Senator Walsh, who made such a joke of their attempt to say, `These are our policies but we cannot cost them because it is too hard.' Senator Walsh expected the Democrats to be able to cost their policies with the aid of backs of envelopes and calculators, yet he himself, with a calculator, the backs of envelopes and a whole department behind him could not do it. Where does that put the Government? As I say, it puts them exactly with the fairies at the bottom of the garden and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is unable to cost its own policies. It is no wonder that our international reputation in terms of management of industry, for which in some regard the private sector is responsible but for which others believe the Government is responsible, and that investor confidence in Australia in that regard are dwindling rapidly. This fiasco, or stuff-up as Michelle Grattan refers to it, gives us a very clear insight into just how bad this situation is. </PARA>
<PARA> So, we have bypassed the big glamour announcement that was brought undone by the presence of someone who knew better, and we know that we now have a Bill before us to extend the existing export market development grants scheme by six months. Yet it was not much more than eight weeks ago that the Minister was prepared to organise for himself national television coverage to launch a scheme-I do not have the name in front of me at the moment, but it was some fancy new name for a reject version of the old scheme-and he was quite confident that he had all the details: `This is the way we are going and vote for us because we know what we are doing with export market development grants'-despite the fact we all knew later in the day that perhaps the Government did not. Only eight weeks later we know that the Government does not know and never did know what it was going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may try to get away with saying that that is an unreasonable complaint because all he is seeking now is an extra six months, but most people know that a week ago he was seeking considerably longer than that-another five years I think it was. So we have a situation where an Australian who wants to think about it can see that eight weeks ago a Minister announced a scheme but, when he was put on the spot as to the details of it, he could not answer and could not work out on the back of an envelope or with a calculator what it added up to, but nonetheless said, `Despite the fact that I cannot add it up, we have it all together and we know what we are doing.' Eight weeks later he says, `I think I need five years to work out what I want to do.' One week after that he said, `No, I can figure it out in six months.' We on this side of the chamber wait with anticipation to see what the Minister will come up with in six months, and I am sure we will look at it fairly and properly, but in light of what has happened in the past it could not be expected that it will be approached with an air of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I reiterate the two insights that I think are given by the scenario leading up to this Bill being before us. First, it tells us that the media are just as likely to swallow any well packaged fish that this Government dishes out to them. We could ask ourselves why that is the case, because we know that, had Mr Pointer not been there, the discrepancies may well not have come to light, Senator Button would not have been put under pressure and the whole nation would not have seen how incompetent he was. So, we can be very grateful for a strange face in the crowd at 10 o'clock on that morning. We can be grateful to him, but we should not let our gratitude to him or the luck of his presence in any way colour the concern we should have for what that tells us about media coverage in this nation and especially media coverage at an election time when we expect very strict scrutiny of both Government and Opposition proposals. We do not expect a situation where, unless someone taps on the shoulder of people in the press gallery and says, `You have been missed out of the picture', we will miss the fact they have been left out of the picture. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, despite all these colourful election announcements, we all know that last week Senator Button was saying he needed five years. Thankfully, he has now cut that down to only six months. As a rider to that, it is instructive to remember-I am not sure whether it was before or after this fiasco of a press conference-that the Prime Minister was describing Senator Button as one of his most innovative and assiduous Ministers. He was so assiduous that he could not add up the scheme at the time; so assiduous that a week ago he wanted five weeks to figure it out; and so assiduous that he has now suddenly changed his mind from five years to six months. The fiasco, or stuff-up as Michelle Grattan calls it, has given us a useful insight into the media and into John Button that ought not to be lightly forgotten. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is dealing with the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990. The purpose of that Bill is simply to extend the operation of the export market development grants scheme from 30 June until 31 December of this year. That extension, however, will have certain ramifications. In fact, it will enable those hard core porn merchants who have indicated that they will apply for grants in fact to do so and, therefore, to use taxpayers' money to prostitute the image of Australian womanhood overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that it is pretty rough for these hard core porn merchants to so denigrate Australian womanhood by exporting Australian made hard core porn videos, and not only that but to use taxpayers' dollars for that purpose. I would like to mention to the Senate that in fact one such merchant, the Mature Media Group, John Lark, has indicated that he wants a hefty slice of taxpayers' money for that purpose. He has reiterated again today that he wants a hefty slice of taxpayers' dollars for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I see Senator Coulter looking at me. He indicated this morning that it was not the appropriate time to take action. I beg to differ. It is the appropriate time to take action if we as the Senate chamber believe that taxpayers' dollars should not be used for that purpose. The very important question at stake is the status of Australian women as well as Australia's international image. A substantial part of the income of the Mature Media Group is derived from the distribution of video material which, in the words of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, treats women as `sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience' and `reduce persons to objects or occasions of sexual pleasure'. </PARA>
<PARA> The material that will be exported and promoted by taxpayers' dollars is exploitative and degrading. It is my intention in the committee stage of the Bill to move an amendment which will prevent any export market development grant going to anyone for the purpose of promoting the export of video material which has an X classification. Why? If the Senate approves of this amendment, then it will prevent the export of the degradation of Australian women and the export of material which exploits Australian women. It will prevent the export of material which, as the Joint Select Committee on Video Material said, engenders a `sexually callous and manipulative orientation towards women'. </PARA>
<PARA> If any honourable senator has any doubt about that and wishes to see an example of the type of material that is produced for export, I am quite prepared to show that honourable senator. I am willing to bet that, having seen the material, honourable senators would support my move to prevent taxpayers' dollars from going to promote this material overseas, because the material sullies the image of Australian women and degrades them in the eyes of the world. It depicts them in a manner that indicates that they are generally highly promiscuous and available. The material also promotes AIDS high risk behaviour. It is an interesting thing that here we are in the health budget spending millions of dollars trying to stop the spread of AIDS and this material depicts activities which are in the high risk area. The export of this material could, if the applications are made, be by courtesy of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that as far back as October of last year I raised this matter in the chamber. I asked a question of the then Minister representing the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. I referred to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 13 October 1989 which stated that Canberra's porn king, Mr Lark, would be applying to the Federal Government for taxpayer subsidisation of the marketing costs of his exports of X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say here that I know that 13 such videos have been produced in Australia, and it is very interesting to note that when the Joint Select Committee was in session Mr Lark was very coy about plans to produce this material in Australia. He is no longer coy about that. He is quite open and blatant in his statements that this is his multimillion dollar plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I get back to the question I asked on 17 October 1989 of the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. I asked her whether she had noted that the Joint Select Committee on Video Material in its majority report found that such videos treated women in the manner that I have just described. I will not repeat it. I asked her whether she agreed that an application for taxpayers' funds to market Australian-made hard-core pornographic videos was a contentious issue and that the status of Australian women as well as Australia's international image was at stake. I asked also what action the Minister intended to take on it. </PARA>
<PARA> To her credit, she did say that she had made a note to discuss the issue with Senator Button even before I had raised that question. She said so because she believed that this was a matter of `extreme sensitivity' within the community.</PARA>
<PARA> I then followed that up with a question to Senator Button. Again, in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) on 29 November I followed it up again with Senator Button. The effective response of Senator Button to my question and to the matters that I raised during the debate on the Appropriation Bill was that if the Lark media group applied for an export development grant there was no way that he could interfere in the provision of that grant. In other words, he indicated that if such an application was made it would be approved if it fell within the guidelines. The guidelines do not exclude hard-core pornographic videos. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might ask me why I am using the word `hard-core'. I am using it because it is a word that was used and I have a statutory basis for using it. As honourable senators will realise, when the Classification of Publications Ordinance was tabled in this place in 1984, I think it was, the explanatory memorandum indicated that there would be a new classification, namely X, and that would apply to hard-core pornographic videos. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now talking about that type of video. The videos which have been produced by the Mature Media Group for export, the ones to which I referred previously, have received an X classification. How many have been produced and have not received any classifications or perhaps not even been submitted for classification, I do not know. That matter was raised with me by Senator Walters. I acknowledge here that that is a problem. To cover the whole of the situation my proposal, which honourable senators have, will need to be amended to include videos which have not received a classification, because it is quite possible for videos to be produced in Australia for export and not be submitted to the Film Censorship Board for classification. So I acknowledge the point that was raised by Senator Walters with me during today and I would support her in any amendment to cover that situation, because it is an important one. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious question, a very serious question indeed. As I indicated earlier, Australia's image is at stake. Canberra has become the hard-core porn centre for Australia and the group that I mentioned intends Australia to become the hard-core porn centre for South East Asia and a major world porn centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators may not consider it appropriate for these types of videos to be banned for sale and hire in the Australian Capital Territory. Indeed, that question was considered in this chamber and it was narrowly lost. It was considered in another place and it was narrowly lost-by one vote. We are not dealing here with the issue of whether the material should be banned or not at this juncture. We are dealing with the issue as to whether Australian taxpayers' dollars should be used by hard-core porn merchants to promote these degrading and exploitative videos overseas. That is what we are dealing with. Unless we act now, if the producers of these videos for export do make an application to Austrade under the export market development grants scheme, Austrade will have to shell out taxpayers' dollars for that purpose. That is the issue we are discussing at this point of time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want that to be confused in the minds of honourable senators because if honourable senators vote against my proposition, what they are saying to the taxpayers is not only are they going to impose their view on them relating to these videos, but they are going to use their money and give that to the hard-core porn merchants to promote these X-rated videos overseas. I ask any honourable senator to go out on the street and seek to justify that position. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter, as I understand it, was not speaking for the Democrats as a whole, but he made an individual point that it was not appropriate now. I hope that I have indicated to Senator Coulter that it is appropriate to deal with this matter now because we have a statement by the major producer-the porn king, as he is described-that he intends to make an application under the export market development grants scheme. We are not dealing with an if and when situation; it is not a straw man; it is an immediate threat. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Collins, who is in the Minister's seat, to try to justify that amongst his constituents-to tell them, `Your hard-earned money and your hard-earned taxes are going to be given to the hard-core porn merchants so that they can prostitute the image of Australian womanhood overseas and make their fast buck in so doing'. It is not only an individual fast buck; it is millions of dollars. I ask him or any of his colleagues to try to sell that to the public if they intend to vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this appeal, particularly to colleagues on this side of the chamber who may be listening to the debate. This is a serious matter of conscience. It is a serious matter because we are dealing with taxpayers' money-people who do not want a bar of the export of the material. We can have our differences on whether the material can be banned or not but, when it comes to the crunch of whether we are going to require taxpayers to pay for the promotion of it overseas, that is another issue. That is the issue that we are dealing with today and that is the issue which is included in my amendment. I am quite certain, of course, that my amendment, if carried, will prevent the producers of hard-core porn, that exploitative and degrading material, from cashing in on taxpayers' dollars for the purpose of exporting this material. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I apologise for not raising this earlier when Senator Vanstone sat down, but there was a certain disturbance in the chamber. It relates to an expression used by Senator Vanstone. In the course of her speech she used the term `stuff-up', a term which I have never used. I find it personally extremely offensive, and I think anybody who looks at the origin of this term will find that it has very strong sexual connotations. I would ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to rule on the use of that term because I find it quite unparliamentary and quite inappropriate, especially in this debate in view of the matter which has been raised by Senator Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is little point in debating once again my private members Bill that attempted to prohibit the importation, sale and hire of the more extreme violence in R-rated and X-rated videos. Suffice it to say that women's organisations throughout Australia have told the Government in no uncertain terms that they believe that X-rated videos degrade the status of women, as does some of the extremely violent sexual violence in R-rated videos. Madam Acting Deputy President, for the benefit of new senators I will read just a few quotes from a cross-section of the women's organisations because some senators were not here during the debate. It will put in context how the women of Australia feel about these degrading videos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Joy Taylor from the Women's Electoral Lobby writes:</PARA>
<PARA>WEL is totally opposed to any portrayal of women that exploits or degrades them in any way or portrayal of women that reinforces the unequal power relationship that exists in society. </PARA>
<PARA> WEL ACT endorses the intent of your Bill to ban X-rated videos in the ACT. We believe that it is inappropriate for the ACT to continue to distribute X-rated videos in the face of the contrary decisions of the Attorneys-General in all States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Catholic Women's League says, `We are against the proposed non-violent erotica category and feel that the existing R and M classifications should be tightened'. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> I was just going through the various women's organisations that had supported my private members' Bill, the aim of which was to get rid of the more extreme violence, particularly sexual violence, in R-rated and X-rated videos. I said that the Women's Electoral Lobby had endorsed the intent of my Bill and that the Catholic Women's League also did, as did the Country Women Action Alliance. The Mothers Union of Australia said that it believed it illogical for the Government to support such projects as `Fair Go for Women' and affirmative action, which seek to improve the status of women in the community, and allow the free availability of material which depicts women as mere objects of male gratification. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a number of other organisations, including the women's organisations of Australia, and not only church leaders but Australia's largest trade union, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Union, the Australian Parent's Council, the Australian Council for Children's Films and Television, to name just a few. That women's taxes should be used to support the export of these videos is, I think, quite against the intention of all those groups that wrote giving the Government their views. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend, as Senator Harradine has already indicated, to move an amendment to his amendment by adding after his amendment the words `or has not been classified'. Senator Tate, who is in the chamber, might be interested in my amendment because it goes that just bit further than Senator Harradine's amendment, which would prohibit grant money being paid for Mr Lark to produce these X-rated videos. It would also deny Mr Lark money to produce child pornography and all those other videos that in this country we say are illegal. If he produces these videos and does not put them up for classification, according to the Australian Customs Service he is quite at liberty to export them. It is for this reason that I seek to add to Senator Harradine's amendment the words `or has not been classified'. I intend to move that amendment at the correct time in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. In respect of the amendment to be moved at the committee stage, in order at least to attempt to dispose of this matter tonight, considering the legislative program we have, I shall be very brief in my remarks. I would like to thank honourable senators who contributed matters other than the contributions to Senator Harradine's amendment. I think probably the most pertinent contribution during that part of the debate was made by Senator Coulter, who pointed out that this is a one-clause Bill which provides simply for an interim period to be allowed, so that the 50-plus recommendations of the Hughes Committee can be properly considered by the Government. We know, of course, that there will be a very substantial debate on the same piece of legislation in the Budget sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Could I just say, in touching on Senator Harradine's amendment, which will be moved at the committee stage, that the Government at this point will not support it and state the reasons why. The current situation under the scheme is that there is discretion already in the way in which these grants are allocated for prohibiting the application of funds for matters which are unlawful. Rightly or wrongly, at this point in time this is not an unlawful activity, although many people, including myself, may well find it distasteful. Indeed, if honourable senators want to be just a little philosophical about this, and I think it is probably a good idea at times to be a little philosophical, they could logically extend a precedent such as this, if it were created, to prohibit the application of public moneys for the export of other Australian commodities which many of us find even more abhorrent-things such as tobacco, alcohol, and so on exported to the Third World. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure there are a lot of people who would go along with a lot of these things but, rightly or wrongly, this Parliament at this point in time has declined to make this activity unlawful, though it may well decide to do so in future. Indeed, another parliament has recently decided, by a narrow vote or no, and that is the way democracy works, that at this time the activity is not unlawful. I believe it would be far more appropriate for this Parliament to proceed at this time not to accept Senator Harradine's amendment-I will canvass this if I need to, as I may need to, in the committee stage, which may well not be taken tonight-but for the Government to give careful consideration to what Senator Harradine is proposing. I can give him and the Parliament that assurance. It may well be, if Mr Lark's business activities are as profitable as he claims they are going to be, that he will not be eligible for grants under this scheme in any case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the six months that the Parliament has to consider the Hughes Committee recommendations, it might decide bringing down a full package of amendments to this legislation later this year, to create for the first time since this Act has been operating a precedent in establishing one special class of goods for which it is not appropriate to provide export grants. The Government may well have a view on that issue. Indeed, I have a view of my own, which inside the forums of my Party I will press, in respect of the application of public moneys for this purpose. Ultimately, of course, as Senator Harradine would be the first to acknowledge, it is the Parliament that determines the shape of the legislation that leaves this place and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that Parliament decides, upon mature reflection, that it is necessary. I simply put a cautionary note on it: at this point there is a discretion within the organisation to preclude the application of public moneys for unlawful purposes, rightly or wrongly. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine would be the first to concede that we have had this debate ad nauseam. The one debate that nobody could claim has not been canvassed to death in this Parliament is the question of X-rated videos. As someone who has participated in every debate on the matter while I have been in the Parliament, I can say that, rightly or wrongly, we have taken the position we have. </PARA>
<PARA> I would prefer to see the Parliament consider this very serious and pertinent issue that Senator Harradine had raised along with all the other recommendations for the amendment of this Act that have been raised by the Hughes Committee, which will be canvassed in a full and comprehensive debate in this Parliament later this year. From my own point of view I must say, taking Mr Lark at his word, that if it should be that he does make as much money as he suggests he is going to make, he will not be eligible for the grant anyway. Should it appear that he might be, it may well be at the end of this year the Parliament may well determine that it should have a particular view on this case. With the greatest respect, I think it is appropriate to leave these matters, along with the 50 recommendations of the Hughes Committee, to the substantive debate that will occur on this legislation in the Budget sittings. </PARA>
