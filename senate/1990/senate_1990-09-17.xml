<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations whether he has noted recent reports of the high levels of salary paid to executives of many of Australia's major enterprises. Do these reports indicate cases in which some of those salaries have increased by 11 per cent in the past year? Do they show that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, whose chief executive gets a mere $290,000, performed better last year than Westpac Banking Corporation, whose highest paid executives get nearly $2m a year? Can the Minister indicate whether ordinary workers, whose wage movements are conditional on progress and structural efficiency, are entitled to be confused or frustrated by these reports? Is it not a fact that these ordinary workers have accepted unprecedented wage restraint over the past seven years in the national interest and in the cause of economic reform? Can the Minister inform the Senate whether business executives have shown the same restraint over the past seven years?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2401" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm, as stated in the first part of the question, that high levels of salary are being paid to executives in major Australian companies. That has been reported in recent days in the press. As to the second part of the question, yes, in some cases the increases are in excess of 11 per cent. I have no reason to question the newspaper report about the Commonwealth Bank-Westpac comparison. However, I am not in a position directly to confirm those figures mentioned in the newspaper report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether workers are entitled to feel frustrated, many of them, through their organisations and in their own right, express frustration at what seems to be a growing ethic-if `ethic' is the right word-in which some employers are saying to their workers, `Don't do as we do; do as we tell you to' or, `Everyone must tighten his belt, but we as employers or senior executives won't'.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan also asks whether I can confirm the levels. A quarterly survey of executive remuneration is published by the consultancy firm Cullen Egan Dell Australia Pty Ltd. Cullen Egan Dell is an international management consultancy company operating in Australia, Europe and the United States of America. It is a specialist in executive remuneration and executive job search. It produces a two part survey which shows, in the first part, figures for senior management, which includes senior staff across a range of professions, including finance, personnel, data processing and engineering and, in the second part, figures for the senior executives of companies.</PARA>
<PARA> These are not good figures in the sense that they deal not with the total remuneration package but just with the salaries component. Anyone who follows executive remuneration knows that the total package is what is negotiated for not just that element that deals with salaries. Taking the salaries part alone, there is a significant gap between the salary increases in senior executive remuneration and the increases in average weekly earnings since 1983-84.</PARA>
<PARA> For the year to the end of the June quarter 1990, the senior management group had total remuneration increases of up to 8.3 per cent and the senior executives' total remuneration rose by 11 per cent for the same year compared to an increase of 6 per cent in the average weekly earnings of full time adults. In the last year ended June, a significant gap occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the six years to June 1990, senior management remuneration increased by 71.4 per cent; senior executives salaries rose by 89.2 per cent, and average weekly earnings for full time adult workers increased by 47.3 per cent. Over that six year period of survey, there was quite a considerable opening in the gap between the two levels. I might also say that it was expected by some pundits that the latest data would show a slackening of executive salaries due to economic conditions. The latest survey shows a continuance of the same level of growth in executive salaries.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on the basis that a picture is better than a thousand words. The graph from the sources surveys of Cullen Egan Dell, which I am holding up, shows pay comparisons from the year 1982-83 to 1989-90. The top line with the steepest incline represents the senior executive level, the middle line represents the senior management group and the line indicating the lowest level of increase represents ordinary workers in Australia who have practised significant--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to a speech he made in Melbourne over the weekend in which he suggested that Israel should now open a dialogue with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) and not use the Gulf crisis as an excuse to delay this dialogue. I ask the Minister: Does he believe that serious consideration can be given to an Israel-PLO dialogue before the Gulf crisis is resolved? Is there not an obvious danger that the resolution of the Gulf crisis would be tied to the issue of resolving the differences between Israel and the PLO? Was it not Saddam Hussein who tried to propose a linkage between the Gulf crisis and the Palestinian issue, for which he was roundly condemned? Why does Senator Evans make this comment now when, only last week, he said in Estimates Committee B, `Obviously the prospects of a formal dialogue between Israel and the PLO have not been improved by recent events'?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look on page 16. In the speech I referred to the desirability of Israel not using the PLO's reaction to the Gulf crisis as an excuse for not seeking to resolve the Palestinian question for a variety of reasons which I spelt out. In the course of making that particular point I said, on page 16, that any approach to the resolution of the Palestinian issue would require a spirit of statesmanship and, of course, a willingness to compromise on the part of the Israeli Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA>If that statesmanship is to be productive, it will necessarily involve dialogue with Palestinians, both inside and outside Israel and the Occupied Territories, who have been directly associated with the PLO.</PARA>
<PARA> I chose those words carefully. It is becoming increasingly evidently the case that it may well be necessary for more attention to be placed on those Palestinians within the country, particularly those who have come to exercise a substantial leadership role since the Intifada, with the present PLO leadership having less attention in the future, particularly in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> But it does not make any particular sense to go on applying the kind of test that the Israeli Government has so far insisted on applying; namely, that it will not enter into dialogue with anybody who has PLO affiliations, either as a member of that organisation or being very directly associated with it. The point that I am making is that the resumption of some form of dialogue, an attempt to resolve the Palestinian question, is not one that can be endlessly further delayed, because of the demographic time bomb and a whole variety of other considerations which I spelt out, and that dialogue will need to be with key Palestinian leaders. It may not need to be quite as much in the future as has been the case in the past with the familiar figures of the PLO leadership who have so comprehensively discredited themselves in the present crisis, but it will need to be with Palestinian leaders.</PARA>
<PARA> One simply has to go on assuming for the foreseeable future that those leaders, particularly those within the country that it is going to be worth talking to, are people who have had such associations in the past and will no doubt continue them in the future. It is a subtle but important distinction, from the way in which Senator Hill put the question, that I am making.</PARA>
<PARA> I made very clear in the speech that there can and should be no direct linkage between, on the one hand, the resolution of the Gulf crisis and, on the other hand, the resolution of the Palestinian issue or, indeed, a variety of other issues like the Lebanon one, which are endemic problems in the Middle East. Not only would it be wrong in principle to seek trade-offs in that kind of way but it would, in our judgment, be quite counterproductive to seek to draw that overt linkage.</PARA>
<PARA> However, as Secretary of State Jim Baker has himself said, there is absolutely no reason why an appropriate resolution of the Gulf crisis should not itself be a `springboard' both for the achievement of some more comprehensive and satisfactory security arrangements in the Gulf-and, indeed, the whole Middle East-and also for the resolution of those conflicts, in particular the very bitter and divisive continuing conflict with the Palestinian people. There is absolutely no reason why we should not think of an ongoing process.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, as I made very clear again last night in making this speech, it may well be that Israel can approach compromise, can approach the negotiating table, with a greater spirit of confidence in getting a secure and guaranteed outcome from that process as a result of the new world order that is conspicuously being put into place and being demonstrated, as well as being tested, by the present Gulf crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> So, in terms of the willingness of the international community to come to the aid of besieged or attacked small countries, in terms of the bridging of divisions that have traditionally in the Middle East made the resolution of conflict that much harder-in particular the division between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics-and in terms of the new and very effective role being played by the United Nations, there is greater cause for confidence than for pessimism about the possibility of a peace settlement actually being productive, upholding and not, in fact, undermining Israel's long term interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time late Friday night or early Saturday morning eastern standard time, the HMAS Darwin, in company with the United States frigate the USS Brewton, intercepted an Iraqi tanker. Initially that tanker failed to stop and failed to heed any of the appropriate steps and the USS Brewton fired some warning shots. The tanker still refused to stop. Ten minutes later the Darwin then fired some warning shots, and the ship stopped at that stage. A boarding party embarked, at which stage the tanker again took off, but following the intervention of another Australian frigate and a British frigate the ship eventually halted. A boarding party from the Darwin and the Brewton boarded, carried out the normal verification procedures and then allowed the frigate to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst this particular incident, being the first to involve boarding, has attracted a lot of publicity, it is simply a normal procedure in the multinational naval forces operating in the Gulf. I believe that the Australian role in it was carried out efficiently and with all the propriety of our rules of engagement, and I am quite pleased with the performance of Australian ships and personnel in that area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question which is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce relates to the Minister's knowledge that we are in the period of public consultation over the multifunction polis (MFP). Is the Minister aware that one of the first acts of public consultation during this period is a two day conference to be held in Sydney-I stress, in Sydney-with no speakers opposed to the MFP and costing those attending $995 each? Is the Minister aware that even a set of papers from this conference will cost almost $500? Is the Minister aware that the MFP Committee has called tenders for a $150,000 contract to convince the people of South Australia that the MFP is good for them and that the success of this public relations exercise will be judged and rewarded according to how much its efforts change public opinion in favour of the MFP? Is the Minister aware that tenders have already been called for work to commence on the MFP site? Does the Minister consider this a fair way to conduct public consultation so as to discover the will of the people of South Australia? If not, will he attempt to influence his State colleagues in South Australia to conduct open, unpressured dialogue with the public so as to discover whether the people of the State really do or do not want the MFP?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, Senator Coulter has a muddled set of information in his head. He started off by talking about a seminar in Sydney which is sponsored by some consultants and has nothing whatsoever to do with the community awareness program over the MFP. It a commercial operation run by a group of consultants in Sydney. I repeat, in case the honourable senator is not clear on this matter, that it has nothing to do with the community awareness program relating to the MFP. That was a little story that lent a bit of weight to an otherwise weightless question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the second and third parts of the honourable senator's question, I am fully aware that work is being done on the Gillman site, the proposed site for the MFP in Adelaide. That has to be done. If it was not done Senator Coulter would be screaming his head off and putting his environmental hat on. It has to be done and it is being done by the South Australian Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is there an air transport blockade against Iraq? If not, could Iraq effectively avoid the shipping blockade by engaging in an airlift-using Iraqi and stolen Kuwaiti planes-reminiscent of the 1948 Berlin airlift? Are there any signs of increased Iraqi air transport activity?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no organised air blockade of Iraq at present in the sense of some aviation equivalent of the stop and search process that is being applied on the water. While the possible need for such a blockade to ensure that sanctions are not broken by flights into Iraq has been raised, including I think on one occasion by British Foreign Secretary Hurd, our assessment is that the existing sanctions regime and its implementation are proving to be sufficiently effective so as not to make that really necessary. It should be appreciated that the potential for Iraq to try to circumvent the embargo by air is very strictly limited. This is because measures other than a strict and formal military blockade can be used and are being used to close off opportunities for sanctions busting by air. Such measures include not allowing direct air services, not allowing overflight, and not allowing ground facilities to be provided to aircraft which might be engaged in breaking the sanctions. Such measures, in whole or part, have been implemented by many countries and have certainly caused a major reduction in the activities of Iraqi Airways. Australia does not have any direct air links with Iraq, so the question has not arisen about us implementing any such measures, but we would do so if it ever became appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is conceivable that Iraq could seek to mount a major air transport effort to circumvent sanctions, but this would require the cooperation of Iraq's neighbours, and certainly a number of other countries as well. The international community would respond, I think, very quickly to any evidence of such cooperation. We are not aware of any indication whatsoever of increased non-military Iraqi air activity. There are Iraqi Airways flights to Amman, plus some special evacuation flights. Otherwise, Iraqi commercial flights are simply not operating. We will continue to watch very closely the situation in this respect, as will, in particular, the member countries of the United Nations Sanctions Committee. I can say that Australia would support any internationally agreed measures which are regarded as necessary to ensure the further effectiveness of sanctions in the event that it became apparent that the aviation route was being significantly applied.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The affirmative action Act becomes, at last, fully operational this year with the phasing-in of the last band-the third band-of those employers employing between 100 and 499 employees. That requires them to submit reports to the Affirmative Action Agency on the affirmative action policies and plans for those particular companies. Given that the Agency now has reached the full phasing-in of the original Act, it will be paying more attention to evaluating how the Act has been performing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will identify those factors which assist in the achievement of affirmative action policies, as well as those factors which inhibit the realisation of those goals. It has not been appropriate, until now, to conduct such a review during the phasing-in stage because the information provided would have been only partial, not full information based on a proper operation of the Act. I might add that the director of the Agency is required, under the Act, to conduct a review.</PARA>
<PARA> The review-which should be completed by the end of 1992-will be based, as I said, on how the Act runs, but there are three major projects already under way which will help to finalise that review. One is a three-year survey of attitudes to and knowledge of affirmative action and equal employment opportunity amongst private sector employers, employees and their representative bodies. Another is a series of case studies conducted over three years of the experience of 10 companies in developing and implementing their affirmative action programs. That project will involve companies which have performed particularly well under the Act. Thirdly, there is a detailed evaluation of the processes and impact of affirmative action implementation in a sample of higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> Other areas being addressed as part of the effectiveness review include an assessment of the impact of affirmative action implementation on enterprises; analysis of the labour market reform programs that we have-that is, the award restructuring element and how it impacts on women's employment status; and an evaluation of the operations of the Affirmative Action Agency itself.</PARA>
<PARA> The review process, as far as the Government is concerned, will be a very open one. We want key interested parties to be given every opportunity to participate. It is important to the Government that the review of this important social and employment policy be effective. As a government, we are committed to affirmative action. We want to see it work properly. We want to see a workplace, or a work force, not in which there are any second-class citizens but in which there is appropriate representation and recognition of the rights of all.</PARA>

As Senator Durack knows, we have committed three ships. The subsequent commitment of a logistics team and a medical team in support of those ships in no way could be considered to be an escalation of the Australian commitment. Having committed ships, it was inevitable that we would have to provide a logistic team to make sure that the ships were supplied and a medical team for the treatment of both injury and sickness. So at the moment we have had no request to commit ground forces to the Gulf region or escalate our forces there, and I am not going to speculate any further on whether such a request did emanate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not aware of any Australian companies which are involved directly or indirectly in breaching the economic blockade of Iraq. It would require a pretty adventurous company to seek to do so, given the range of legal measures and, of course, policy decisions that we have put in place. It is worth retailing them, I think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 7 August, all permissions under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations were withdrawn by the Minister for Defence, effectively blocking all exports of military related equipment to Iraq. The Australian Customs (Prohibited Exports and Prohibited Imports) Regulations were amended on 8 August to prohibit the import of goods from and export of goods to Iraq and Kuwait. Austrade in this respect has directed its staff not to engage in any activity in relation to the expansion or promotion of Australian trade to Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA> The Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations have been amended to stop the movement of funds in and out of Australia to or from the governments of Iraq and Kuwait, their agencies or nationals, without specific approval from the Reserve Bank. Again, migration regulations, effective from 31 August, ensure that prospective visitors to Australia who would be likely to engage in commercial or other activities involving Iraq or Kuwait in breach of United Nations (UN) Resolution 661 will be precluded from obtaining visas.</PARA>

Let me begin by saying that the circumstances of each of the instrumentalities which the honourable senator referred to are quite different. The question of, for example, privatisation in relation to Qantas is a different question from that relating to Australian Airlines, it is a different question from that relating to Telecom and again it is a different question from that relating to the Commonwealth Bank.

In my view, there are enormous reasons for having a publicly owned telecommunications carrier and the same reasons do not apply to a domestic airline. There are very different reasons for doing each of those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the question of the quantum of proceeds referred to in Senator Campbell's question, again one looks at each transaction or proposed transaction. But it is not the quantum of the proceeds which is an important criterion in terms of what the Government is doing or proposes to do. The important criterion is to enable each of these instrumentalities to compete vigorously in an international market or a domestic market, as the case may be. To be able to do that they require further equity capital. That is the important thing, not the quantum of the proceeds. There may be, of course, significant proceeds in one or two of these things, but it is not the most important issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As at least those on this side of the chamber will know, the Commonwealth is fully committed to addressing the problems of salinity, drainage and land degradation and the management of land and water resources in a manner which is economically viable and ecologically sustainable. That is a commitment throughout Australia, but it has no greater pertinence perhaps than in the Murray-Darling Basin area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has put in place a comprehensive package of initiatives and programs to address all of those problems in this area. Initiatives which target as a high priority issues of salinity and land degradation include the Murray-Darling Basin initiative itself, the Federal water resources assistance program, the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation, the national soil conservation program and the program for one billion trees.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has placed particular emphasis on the Murray-Darling Basin initiative with an allocation of $10.3m this year compared with $6.7m in 1989-90. The initiative was developed jointly by the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and promotes planning and management of the natural resources of the Basin for efficient and equitable sustainable use.</PARA>
<PARA> The key components of the initiative include a national resources management strategy which sets up a framework for community and government to address the current severe environmental degradation of the Basin. Funding for the second year of this program has been increased from $3.8m to $5.7m. The salinity and drainage program is receiving a total of $4.6m this year. A total of $38.9m has also been allocated this year under the federal water resources assistance program to the States and local government, and some of that will flow into the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>

The total amount being spent for 1990-91 in that area is $10.9m and as well there is $21.8m for 1990 for the national soil conservation program, some of which money is going to the Basin.

Further, is the Minister aware that over 5,300 sickness beneficiaries under the age of 20 years who, as health benefit card holders, will be eligible for the $2.50 weekly allowance until March 1991, will then cease being compensated because their benefit is not subject to a consumer price index adjustment increase at that time?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation for married couples is that they are getting $1.25 each as distinct from $2.50 going to a single pensioner. Were it the case that for them the safety net area did not cut in until $260, then they would be disadvantaged; but, of course, it cuts in at the same amount, $130, as it does for a single pensioner. Given that the average use of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by pensioners in Australia is 27 scrips per year, the average couple will be not affected at all by this, and in fact will not be coming to us for money early because they will not exhaust their $130 until the course of a whole year. It is only going to be in cases where one of them is particularly ill that they will be affected and get into that $130 net area quicker. That being the case, we have announced some changes, as Senator Patterson would now be aware, which will mean that they will not be disadvantaged even in that situation. So it is not the case that the Government wants to urge them to share drugs. That is not what we have in mind at all. As to rescinding the Treasurer's 'nonsensical statement' or something the honourable senator said, he does not make nonsensical statements and so we have no need to rescind them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Olsen raises a matter which is obviously close to my interest. I have taken a keen interest in it since taking this portfolio. There has been a long saga with the Australian Taxation Office buildings in South Australia. That is pretty well known to the South Australian community. There are two lines of thought in the South Australian community: one line is from those who want to build the buildings-they are very keen to ensure that that is done-and the other line of thinking is that maintained by those who currently own buildings that can be leased. They of course would prefer to see new buildings not built. In those circumstances the Government does not take one line or the other-nor should it. Here we are contemplating two special purpose buildings for the Australian Taxation Office, with its needs and requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is fair to say that those needs and requirements are such that they have made it impossible for people to tender to construct those particular buildings. At last call-which was some time last week-there was a long list of expressions of interest from builders to construct these buildings in South Australia. A long list of sites was also being contemplated. I think there is very much an interest in constructing the two special purpose buildings for the Australian Taxation Office and that interest is reflected in the South Australian building community.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen made some comment about the tender requirements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer him to his launch, with Senator Button, of the Offshore? What for? program at the Southern Cross Hotel in the recent recess. I ask: Is it a fact that the Offshore? What for? public relations exercise cost in the order of $260,000? Was the purpose of this costly exercise to encourage those in the Public Service responsible for government purchasing to be more aware of purchasing Australian-made goods? Could this not have been achieved with a simple directive? What was the purpose of distributing Aussie mugs to a range of people inside and outside the Public Service? From the Government's point of view, are not the real Aussie mugs the Australian taxpayers who yet again were required to pay for this public relations gimmickry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think someone on this side asked whether this was, in fact, my first question from Senator Parer. I can excuse that person for thinking that that might be the case as there has not been one for a while. Senator Parer comes in here with a great set of figures asking us to be stunned by them. They were all mentioned late last Thursday night during the Estimates Committee meeting. I think we all slept through them at the time, and I do not imagine that anyone is getting too excited by them now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The short answer to the honourable senator's question is, as indicated last Thursday night: yes, yes and no. They are the three answers to the honourable senator's three specific questions. The Aussie mugs have, in fact, been distributed. As I said the other night, many more have been distributed and are in currency than we have promoted in this campaign. The honourable senator can take that comment as he likes. In essence, the campaign launch was successful.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is concerned that purchasing officers within the Government structure are aware of the benefits of buying Australian, both in terms of initial cost effectiveness and longer term accessibility to service and backup. Those sorts of principles and issues are being pursued by the Government. This particular campaign is an important aspect of trying to get purchasing officers to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer talks about directives, regulations and all sorts of regulatory imperatives to do the same sort of thing. I would like to see how he reconciles that sort of argument with the argument pursued quite forcefully and consistently by his leaders-Dr Hewson and others-who argue for freer trade and less regulation. We are talking about raising the level of awareness within the public sector of the value of buying Australian products.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said the other night, once again it is not a new response. The concept of the Aussie mugs is a promotional item. I know it is very hard for people with limited parameters in their thinking to understand that people can respond to ideas and advertising-and this is one of them. If this had been done by the commercial sector, those opposite would be running around the country saying what a great idea it was. Since it has been done by the wicked public sector, they are knocking it.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us have some decency in this debate. Let us acknowledge that the Government purchasing sector has a role to play. That is being acknowledged, has been acknowledged and will be acknowledged by Australian producers. To the extent that the honourable senator is trying to undermine it, it will rebound on him.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="2414" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answering a question from Senator Michael Baume on Tuesday last week, I undertook to see whether I could supply some supplementary information about estimated receipt of unemployment benefit among people aged 15 to 19 years. Unemployed people under the age of 16 do not qualify for either unemployment benefit or job search allowance (JSA). Those aged 16 and 17 may qualify for JSA while those aged 18 or 19 may qualify for unemployment benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In case there was any misunderstanding from comments which I made on Tuesday, I want to make it clear that Budget estimates of unemployment and the number of unemployment beneficiaries are prepared by the Treasury, which does not give a breakdown by age group. The Budget estimate is for an average of about 475,000 unemployment beneficiaries in 1990-91. This figure includes job search allowance for unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume pointed out that youth unemployment has increased significantly over the past six months. Since April this year the number of JSA recipients has increased by 17 per cent, compared with a 14 per cent increase in the number of unemployment beneficiaries aged 18 years or more. This growth is easing at present and is consistent with Budget estimates. For example, between 3 August and 7 September the number of JSA recipients declined from 17,484 to 17,181. Trends for unemployment benefit are similarly consistent with Budget estimates. The increase in the number of people on unemployment benefit, including JSA, has been trending down over the last month. The increase in the last week ending 7 September was 1,200 compared with an average increase in the last month of 1,800 per week.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1990-91, expenditure on unemployment benefit is estimated to increase by 31.7 per cent. Expenditure on job search allowance for 16- to 17-year-olds is expected to increase by 23.5 per cent. These increases are not only attributable to changes in the number of beneficiaries but also to changes in rates, including through indexation and eligibility criteria. I have some figures to back up what I have just said on JSA. I seek leave to incorporate those figures in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>As regards J.S.A. the 1990-91 Budget estimates provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>An estimated increase in the average client population of 2,650. This will involve additional outlays of $6.38m.</PARA>
<PARA>CPI related payment rate increases at a cost of $3.99m.</PARA>
<PARA>The 1989-90 Budget initiatives will involve additional outlays of $1.71m.</PARA>
<PARA>Variation in running costs costing an additional $1.735m.</PARA>
<PARA>The estimates are also based on savings arising from the 1988-89 Budget initiatives of $1.21m, $0.4m from the 1990 Economic Statement Initiatives and $0.54m from the 1990-91 Budget initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed outlay for 1990-91 J.S.A. is $58.838m. This compares with actual outlays in 1989-90 of $47.169m.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday last I was acting as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health and I was asked in that capacity a question by Senator Boswell concerning the Health Insurance Commission's pharmaceutical benefits scheme tender. I was in a position later that day to answer that question but Question Time had terminated earlier. I am now in a position to give the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Health Insurance Commission has advised that the tender documents issued last year and referred to in Senator Boswell's question were withdrawn on the instruction of the Ministers concerned. No tender documents have since been issued, and a letter from the Health Insurance Commission of 20 December 1989 advised all companies that responded to the tender that the tender process would not now be proceeded with.</PARA>
<PARA> On the same day as that question was asked of me, the Assistant General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission, Mr Ken Hazell, issued a press statement headed, 'Proposed Commission News Release-New Australia Card Allegations Denied', the first paragraph of which-I will not read all of it-states:</PARA>
<PARA>`There is no truth in the assertion made in `The Australian' today that we are about to introduce a new Australia Card', Mr Wilcox, General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission said today. `Regulations passed by the Parliament last year did not give the Commission unfettered power to do anything it wanted to manage and improve the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)', he said. `They were necessary to transfer to the Commission functions and responsibilities previously carried out by the Department of Community Services and Health (DCSH). They do not enable the Commission to do anything that is not permitted by law' Mr Wilcox said.</PARA>
<PARA>The press release goes on for another page and a bit. Rather than reading the rest of it, I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate the remaining part of that statement in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The regulations are not linked in any way to the changes announced by the Government in the Budget to improve the administration of the PBS program. The Government has indicated that its Budget measures will be brought before the Parliament to give all parties the proper chance to consider them.</PARA>
<PARA> A letter was sent to pharmacists as part of a Budget package and simply outlined the administrative actions resulting from the Budget. It clearly indicated that any new systems will be developed in conjunction with the Pharmacy Guild and the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wilcox said, `There is no truth to the statement that the Commission is ready to call tenders for the computer equipment in a matter of weeks. No action will be taken by the Commission until there is clear legislative approval of the Government's Budget proposals'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has proposed a common form of eligibility for Medicare and PBS. A change to legislation will be required to do this and to enable the Medicare card to be used for both programs. The Medicare card is to be replaced but its replacement is not conditional upon any future use for PBS. It is six years since the initial Medicare cards were issued and the number of cards requiring replacement is increasing.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wilcox said, `There is a need to strengthen the card and reduce the risk to which lost or stolen cards can be reused. If the replacement card contains a magnetic stripe there will be no information encoded on the card that is not on the front of the card. It will not contain medical or pharmaceutical information'.</PARA>
<PARA> There has never been a proposal to link the records of the Commission with those of the Taxation Department or the Department of Social Security (DSS). For many years DSS has supplied information to DCSH (and now the Commission) about who is entitled to pensioner and concessional PBS benefits so that PBS payments can be verified. This arrangement does not and will not involve the transfer of income or asset data from DSS to the Commission or the transfer of medical or PBS data from the Commission to DSS.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I thank you and honourable senators for this opportunity to address the Senate. I stand here today as a Queenslander and a Liberal. I extend to both the people of Queensland and the Liberal Party my thanks for the confidence they have placed in me. In particular, I wish to thank my fellow Queensland senators-Senator Parer, Senator Macdonald and Senator MacGibbon-and their staffs; and I thank Senator Macdonald for his kind words last week and commend him on his excellent maiden speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland Liberals have a proud record of commitment to electoral justice and public accountability. I have no doubt that this played a large part in our electoral success. We now have four Liberal senators from Queensland for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1973 I attended a meeting that changed the course of my life. It was arranged by doctors who deeply cared to hear the then Minister for Social Security discuss his plan for heath care in Australia. His plan spelt out the mechanisms of control of the profession I love and the destruction of many of the principles which we doctors knew were the mainstays of the care of our patients. I decided to do something about it. And today I stand before the Senate, while the originator of that process now grazes-nay, some say `gallops'-on the Elysian fields of Yarralumla, blissfully unaware of the havoc he and his successors have wreaked on my profession and on the health care of this nation. Just as havoc has been wreaked by Labor, repair can come from the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that expenditure on our health care has been virtually static for the last 13 years. Of all the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, only Australia-together with Austria-has failed to keep pace with the consumer price index in its spending on national health care. We once had a standard of health care second to none, yet the ceiling has been set on spending for 13 years. We have a greater number of people requiring health services and a greater ability to service those needs. This is even more serious in view of the fact that the provision of health services and the standards of those services depend on the finance made available. </PARA>
<PARA> With increasing community demands and static government spending, standards must decline. The result is a public hospital system that is overcrowded and underfunded, while resources in private hospitals are under-used. Waiting lists for elective surgery-particularly in Victoria and New South Wales-have lengthened dramatically. On top of this, many privately insured patients occupy public beds. In 1989 privately insured patients occupied 25 per cent of the total acute patient bed days in public hospitals. Inevitably, this has affected all public hospital patients and those waiting to be public hospital patients. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Medicare, health insurance has become a luxury. Rates have rocketed and tax concessions have gone. Immediately before the introduction of Medicare, 61.5 per cent of the population had private health insurance. In March last year it was only 45.8 per cent-a drop of 30 per cent in the proportion of the population holding health insurance. Today, only 30 per cent of our people in Queensland have private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that all political parties accept the principle of community rating-that is, that the well pay for the sick, ensuring that everyone can buy health insurance at the same price-there are enormous financial pressures on the health insurance industry. The majority insured under the present system are those who make the most demands on it, so, naturally, costs spiral. Health funds are only attracting 35 per cent of Australia's young people. Private insurance premiums have risen 72 per cent in the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The paradox is that every one per cent who opt out of private health insurance cost the public sector $80m a year. The health tax-euphemistically called the Medicare levy; 1.25 per cent of income tax-funds only one-fifth of health expenditure. If one adds the outlays from the States and the private purse, the levy accounts for less than one-tenth. The major contributor is the taxpayer by way of general revenue. Today's health system is in serious trouble and, unless we do something urgently, tomorrow's will be very much worse. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a worrying set of new problems. The first is Australia's ageing population. One hundred years ago the population was one million with an average age of 20. Today it is 17 million, with an average age of 31. In 10 years time it will be 20 million, with an average age of 36. By the year 2000 it is estimated that two in every seven Australians will be over the age of 50. We now have the greying of Australia. Two-thirds of health expenditure is on the over 60s; one- quarter of health expenditure is directed towards the 3.8 per cent of the population aged 75 and over. Even without these changes, the cost of national health care will escalate dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we must appreciate the continuing impact of changes in medical technology. Just as members of this Senate have experienced in their own lifetimes the significant advances in communication, television, computers, facsimile machines and satellites, we in medicine have seen even more dramatic advances-computerised tomography (CT) x-ray, ultrasound scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, renal, liver and cardiac transplantation, ear implants, joint and lens replacement and coronary artery surgery, to name but a few. Genetic engineering is on track for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> While the increase in life expectancy has primarily come from the virtual elimination of infectious diseases and alteration in lifestyle, there is no doubt that the quality of life has been enormously enhanced by these procedures. The effect on health care expenditure has been dramatic. The use of ultrasound and CT scanning has doubled every two years. In 1983 there were 75 CT units in Australia. Today there are 230. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider also the cost of individual procedures. Bone marrow transplants and liver transplants are estimated to cost the community $100,000 each with no estimate for ongoing expenditure. There were 4,000 coronary bypass procedures performed in Australia in 1984, 6,000 in 1988 and an estimated 8,000 this year. With the aged proportion of the population growing all the time, one can only guess at demand levels in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the continuing cost burden of pharmaceuticals must be addressed. The high price of some of the life saving wonder drugs of the 1940s led Australian governments of both political parties to develop schemes to provide free or subsidised drugs. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) was the final version. In 1982 total expenditure was $688m. In 1990-91 it is estimated that the cost will exceed $1.5 billion, despite increases in patient contributions and changes in availability of drugs under the scheme. The recent Budget announcements do not address the long-term consequences of these cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, changes in the type of health services available to meet changing patterns of disease will continue to have a significant impact on health costs. Disease patterns are constantly changing. The most obvious example is the AIDS epidemic-a disease which was not even on the horizon 10 years ago and which will require an expenditure of $77m this year alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand for screening is burgeoning in the community, and not only for AIDS. Mammography has been clearly demonstrated as being efficient in the detection of early breast cancer and $14.7m will be spent this year. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) techniques have developed to the extent that one in every 100 births occurs as a result of IVF intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, no government can ignore the problems arising from the excess number of doctors in Australia. Between 1976 and 1986 the number of doctors increased by over 50 per cent from 21,200 to 32,800. As well as that, foreign doctors are migrating here. It is estimated that 350 medical graduates enter the country every year-the equivalent of the output of two Australian medical schools. There is now a low economic return for practising a professional ethic. We all know that the average family doctor adheres to the principles of hard work, high standards of honesty and integrity, and self-sacrifice. Excellence is demanded but not rewarded. Bulkbilling is encouraged and it leads to overservicing. The increased rate of bulkbilling is claimed as a measure of success when all it represents is exploitation of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Entrepreneurs are encouraged to establish glossy 24-hour clinics to the detriment of the average family doctor. The greatest problem facing the medical profession today is its own low morale. Twenty years of government intervention in professional freedom have exacted their toll. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the decay in capital infrastructure resulting from a severe shortfall in capital investment in the public hospital system also threatens the standards of service. Public hospital capital expenditure was 7 to 8 per cent of recurrent costs in the 1960s. It is now down to 3 per cent and equal to that spent on private hospitals even though public hospitals represent 75 per cent of the total number of hospital beds in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What then are the solutions to the health dilemma? The major issues in health care delivery are frequently described as access, financing and quality. Politicians are concerned mainly about access, bureaucrats about financing, and patients about quality. Australian governments of both persuasions have been attempting to bring the costs of the health care system under control-unsuccessfully for the last 17 years, as is evidenced by the number and frequency of changes since 1973. There have been no fewer than six major changes in Australia's health care arrangements in this time. Similar efforts have been made in the United States of America and Great Britain resulting in any number of proposals, such as health maintenance organisations, diagnosis-related groupings for hospital reimbursement, and day surgery proposals. All are dominated by the aim of cost containment and all inevitably affect access and quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is failing and will continue to fail because state control is fundamentally unsound. It has failed in eastern Europe and it will fail here. The ageing of the population and demand and cost of technology and pharmaceuticals make it inevitable that privatisation will occur whether our political opponents like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge is to ensure that privatisation occurs in the right way-that is to say, privatisation has to occur in a way that ensures we get the highest quality, up-to-date health services at prices the people can afford to pay. Cost containment has never been, and never will be, a solution to the problem of providing a high standard, contemporary health care system which allows equitable community access. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to get rid of the myth that government can underwrite unlimited first-class health care which is available at all times and which is cheap. There will always be an excess of demand over resources because of change. I believe we have to get back to fundamentals and base our system on several basic principles. It is an Australian tradition that access to all services-not only health care-should be open, and I do not see this changing. An Australian health care system must encompass this particular philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> The first principle is that the care of the individual is paramount. The standard of health care should be high and there needs to be adequate financial incentive and professional freedom for health carers to pursue excellence. One cannot expect caring, compassion, time and kindness from government. The second principle is that there should be freedom of choice for the patient. </PARA>
<PARA> We as politicians, however, have a responsibility to ensure that a safety net exists for those incapable of providing for themselves and, acting on their behalf, to ensure that value is obtained for every dollar of expenditure. We also have a responsibility to the aged and infirm, the chronically ill, the young mothers and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to our dilemma is to retain a publicly funded system for those who need help, while providing incentive to individuals to care for themselves by insurance either directly or by the establishment of superannuation-type funds specifically allocated for health care costs in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> A publicly-funded system is also necessary in order to retain the very high standards of teaching and research that have been a hallmark of Australian medicine. Nothing is free. The alternative is rationing-there is no other choice. Rationing means allocating resources where the most good is achieved in terms of quality of life at the cheapest cost to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> This line of thought opens up the whole spectrum of questioning the economic viability of a range of procedures such as in vitro fertilisation, heart and liver transplantation and even coronary artery bypass procedures. Whatever we would like to think, there is a limit to maximum life expectancy. Life is a continual battle against death which we will all lose. Death is inevitable. A diminution in mortality from one cause will be balanced by an increased number of deaths from another cause. Even the elimination of cancer today would only lead to a theoretical increase in mean life span of about 2.3 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The days of measuring health care outcome by life expectancy are gone. The thrust for the future will be in the quality of life, not in quantity. Years of misdirected effort have seriously jeopardised our system of health care. There is little evidence that the system, as it is presently structured, will be able to cope with the demands confronting it over the next decade. This country must make some fundamental choices about the type and standard of health care we require in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the second matter of great concern to me. The second event that has occurred over the last 17 years which has contributed to my decision to seek elective office has been the apparently deliberate attempt by the legislature to denigrate the importance of the family unit in Australian society. The effect of this has had a dramatic impact and it will flow on to the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party believes in the importance of the family and that the standards of a free society should support family ideals. I believe that Australians have a responsibility to protect family life as the basis of civilised living and in the caring for young and old. Yet what has occurred? Children have become scarcer. They have become an economic decision for families. Children under 15 represent only 22 per cent of the population and they are expected to represent only 20 per cent in 10 years time. At the moment too many children who might be born are not. We are losing one in four unborn members of our population. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as ensuring a proper working environment, we need to do more to help the many mothers who would prefer to rear their children at home. Some recent surveys show that 80 per cent of young mothers would prefer to be full time home-makers while their children are very young. Instead of policies that discriminate against those who produce children, we must promote the sorts of policies that encourage and nurture families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> Today 51 per cent of married women are in the paid work force compared with 29 per cent in 1966. This increased proportion of women in the work force has been one of the most significant changes in the Australian economy over the past 25 years. This trend reflects both changes in community attitudes as well as changing economic circumstances. Where are the days when somebody could afford to be at home with the children-in a home that was not under threat of being resumed by the banks?</PARA>
<PARA> While these changes have been significant, they have been matched by other features of contemporary society. For instance, some 45,000 children each year see their parents divorce. There is no doubt that there is a social cost reflected in the number of divorces each year and the increasing number of single-parent families. We now have 77,000 homeless children. The cost is becoming greater each year. I see the family as fundamental to our society. I believe it is worthy of protection. It certainly should not be subjected to assault through the complacency of government. The Bauer report, prepared for the President of the United States, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is no accident that every totalitarian movement of the 20th century has tried to destroy the family . . . The essence of modern totalitarianism has been to substitute the power of the state for the rights, responsibilities and authority of the family. </PARA>
<PARA> The family is the main intermediary between the individual and the state. The Labor Government has done nothing with tax policies and discriminates against ordinary families. The family strengthens the individual against the state. It is time to call a halt to this trend. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us here in this chamber and in this Parliament are leaders. As such we have a responsibility to our nation to halt the slide in our already depreciating standards. I for one am going to stand up and be counted in support of the importance of the family unit in the care of children and as a refuge from the fragmentation of society. I am not so naive to believe that an appeal to moral values or adherence to the Ten Commandments will be successful. </PARA>
<PARA> Policies need to be implemented which actively and positively discriminate in favour of the family. I instance income splitting and a home-maker allowance as initiatives which must be given serious consideration. True, the problems we face are great. Instead of ignoring them we must recognise that every problem is a challenge. The greater the challenge, the greater the opportunity for success. We must be prepared to seize these opportunities. We cannot afford to procrastinate. Mr Deputy President, these will be my goals as a senator. </PARA>
<PARA> The philosophy of liberalism, in its approach to health care and families, provides the most convincing and humane answers to the problems I have outlined. My time as a senator will be dedicated to applying this philosophy in a very practical sense in the interests of my constituents, the people of Queensland and of my country. Thank you. </PARA>

I also offer my congratulations on the maiden speech of Senator Herron. I am not sure what it feels like to be the first person to give a maiden speech but I certainly know what it feels like to be the last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is with a great mixture of humility and pride that I give my first speech here today in the Senate. In particular, it is a great moment for me to be representing my State, Tasmania, and also for me to be representing my Party, the Australian Labor Party, yet again in government. </PARA>
<PARA> The State of Tasmania was discovered by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman. He called the island Van Diemen's Land. Then he sailed away and it was largely forgotten. The next to visit Van Diemen's Land were the French explorers who left little but names again, such as D'Entrecasteaux and Freycinet. Van Diemen's Land was also on the visiting list of the Americans and the Russians, but they were beaten by the English, who, recognising Tasmania's geographical isolation, realised the possibilities of a penal colony to end all penal colonies. Over the next 50 years of first settlement, approximately 40 per cent of all the convicts that were sent to Australia were sent to Tasmania. In touching on the theme of Tasmania's geographical isolation, I would like to acknowledge and thank the Hawke Labor Government for continuing to recognise the difficulties that the isolation has caused for our State by ensuring that the freight equalisation scheme was retained in full and unchanged in the recent Budget. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The freight equalisation scheme is of great importance to our State. In answer to the interjection, it was retained in real terms. I wish to draw the Senate's attention to not just the disadvantages that are created by Tasmania being an island State, but also the advantages. It is a State with a unique environment, a unique history and a unique cultural background. It was that background that attracted my parents to the State of Tasmania in the mid-1950s-my mother because she was an English migrant who had originally settled in Sydney and found the climate too hot to bear; my father because he wished to find a permanent position in radio and ultimately as a television announcer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My mother was of Scandinavian-Swiss background. She was brought up in a fairly comfortable middle class family in the outer suburbs of London. Her family were committed socialists. Her father was an architect and a staunch pacifist who served four years in prison during World War I because of his beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA> My father, Ray, served in the other place as the honourable member for Franklin from 1969 to 1975 and for a few short years as the State member for the same seat. My father was born in Sydney, the son of Spanish-Irish parents. He was born during the Great Depression. The Great Depression was an era which caused enormous problems for most people in this country. For my father it was a particularly difficult period because he was orphaned at a very early age, his parents dying in a motor vehicle accident. My father's brothers and sisters were fostered out and he was never to see them again. As an orphan he had to struggle to feed himself and to educate himself, leaving school at the age of 14. When my father talked about the years of the Great Depression-and he very rarely talked about them-his comments were couched in terms of his determination to ensure that such events never occurred again on the face of this planet. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, it is with pride that I speak here today, but it is mixed with sadness because my father, although he was aware that I was preselected for what is regarded as a safe position on the Senate ticket, was not to see my election to this place; he died late last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to acknowledge the role that my wife, Helen, has played in supporting me through that particularly difficult period. I also acknowledge the support she has given me over the last five years in the various roles I have played in the political and industrial movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, it was the influence of my family that originally led to my interest in politics. I first stood for a political position at college in year 12 when I was elected President of my college. It was a noteworthy election for one primary reason-I was elected by 13 votes on Friday the 13th. Since that day I have always considered 13 to be my lucky number. </PARA>
<PARA> I went on to the University of Tasmania, where I majored in political science and administration. I was Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the Students Union. However, I was not noted for my academic study. Like many students I found going through university without financial support somewhat difficult. So at the end of my first year I obtained a full time night shift job at Wrest Point Casino. During those four years my life was a whirl of working at the casino by night, student politics by day and precious little study in between.</PARA>
<PARA> My work at Wrest Point led to my activity in my trade union. Appropriately, with a name such as Sherry, it was the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia. In that union I was elected as State Secretary at the age of 23, after a four year struggle involving three ballots and two Federal Court hearings. I then spent 10 years as State Secretary of that union. </PARA>
<PARA> During that time I was involved in the traditional industrial activities that some would like us to be involved in and those on the other side would like us not to be involved in, including a position as a Federal councillor of my union and also as a national negotiator in a number of key industries in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not just my union activity and industrial activity that led to my interest in politics. Over the last 10 years I have also been deeply involved in the hospitality industry in a number of areas, including a position on the board of management of the college of hospitality in Tasmania, as a member of the Employment and Skills Formation Council, as a nominee of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and also involved in various training organisations, including the tourism hospitality training committee in my State. But it was in representing individual workers and protecting them against exploitation that added to and confirmed my belief that in our society individuals need protection, where appropriate, from those who have greater economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to my family background and my industrial involvement, I have been provided with inspiration by a number of individuals in the political labour movement. I do not wish to comment on all of them, but I simply mention one who has been particularly important to me, and that is the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clem Attlee. He led the British Labour Party for 20 years, and was Prime Minister for 6 years. He was a person not renowned for his great oratory but certainly was renowned for his discipline and his commitment to the labour and socialist cause. </PARA>
<PARA> Clem Attlee also led a government that could, quite rightly, be termed to have carried out the most revolutionary changes in any society in economic and in social terms in any democracy in this century. There were such changes as the National Health Act, the Education Act, the nationalisation of a number of key industries and, above all, the recognition that the United Kingdom was no longer a world power and the recognition that there was a need to reside peacefully over the conversion of an empire to a commonwealth of nations. Many of the changes that occurred at that time would not be relevant in today's society. But Clem Attlee and his approach to British society and to the British Labour Party provided an inspiration to me. </PARA>
<PARA> On my election to the Senate I take the place of Ray Devlin. At this point I acknowledge the work that Ray did on behalf of Tasmania, particularly those people on the north-western coast of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The election as a senator is slightly less vigorous than some of the previous elections I have been through. I have been a candidate not only in union ballots but also for the the State seat of Franklin. The only noteworthy event to me in the Federal election was being attacked by a dog and having it reported in the media under the headline, `Dog takes a nip of Sherry'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two primary principles in the Labor movement that I believe in very strongly and I believe separate us on this side of the chamber from those on the other side of the chamber. The first is the Labor Party's absolute commitment to democracy. Shortly I will come to some examples to dampen the horrified looks of some members opposite. The other principle that I strongly adhere to is the Labor movement's determination to protect those in less fortunate economic circumstances in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the Labor movement's commitment to democracy, I refer to a couple of examples. The first is the recent events that have occurred in Tasmania. As many would be aware, last year the previous State Liberal Gray Government called an early election. Its members discovered that 17 is not bigger than 18. But they would not give up office. They were determined to press on and demanded another election, having just lost one. </PARA>
<PARA> This sort of behaviour totally discredits our democratic system. Gray is still at it: he is still trying to have another election, calling on the Tasmanian upper House to reject Supply, not on the basis that there has been any economic incompetence or indeed any corruption-in fact, if one looks at the economic incompetence one sees that it lies with the previous State Liberal Government and if one looks at corruption one only needs to see that one of Tasmania's leading media magnates is resident in Risdon prison-but on the basis that a school is being closed or that a hospital is being closed. That is supposed to provide the reason for a fresh election. </PARA>
<PARA> The other example I wish to draw to the attention of the chamber relates to the events of November 1975. We all know what 11 November was traditionally remembered for prior to 1975. The only comment I make is that on that day I swore that I would never forget. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the economic advancement of individuals in our society, the Labor Party ensures that, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate way, the individuals in our society are protected from those in stronger economic circumstances. It is the Labor Party that, where appropriate, uses the State to protect individuals in our society. I wish to give an example of where I believe it is appropriate that that is carried out-in the area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with interest that many of the first speeches of Opposition senators and honourable members in the other place were devoted to industrial relations. They talked of freeing the labour market of rigidities and restrictions. They talked of individual employers having the ability to negotiate freely with individual employees, onerous restrictions imposed by awards being removed, and no interference from third parties such as unions and industrial commissions. They said that, if this happened and individuals had the right to sit down and negotiate with employers on an equal footing, it would lead to a boost in productivity and everyone would be happy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is far from the truth. In reality, if we examine the bargaining power in any system such as that, we see that it is the employer who is in the dominant position. I draw the attention of honourable senators to an example in the hospitality industry. Imagine an employer having the right to negotiate with individual employees, one by one. The proprietor, flanked by his legal advisers, would call in the individual workers and engage in this process of collective bargaining. I submit that we know what the outcome would be. The employer would submit to the workers, `If you don't cop $6 or $7 an hour, you don't have a job; take it or leave it'. That is the sort of equity that the Liberal and National parties are arguing for in their industrial relations changes. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of problems is facing this country: the balance of payments; public sector infrastructure, including railroads and ports; severe regional unemployment in many areas; the distribution of wealth and the environment. I wish to touch on a number of problems associated with education and training. At present there are two stark ways in which we can improve the economic circumstances of this country: one is to decrease wages and decrease conditions in order to be more productive and the other is to increase the education and skill levels of our workers in order to increase productivity and output. I much prefer the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are in this country a significant number of problems in attaining that improvement. If we are to be a clever country, greater investment in training and skill formation is required. At present our investment in that area is mediocre by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards. I draw the attention of the chamber to the Minimum Training Guarantee Act which was enacted earlier this year as an example of a way in which this can be encouraged. It is in the area of skill formation and training, the less glamorous side, if you like, of the education debate to which I wish to draw attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country millions of people are locked out of the education and skill formation structure. They are locked out because the training system in this country is not coherent, it is not portable and it is not interrelated. Some of the problems include a lack of appropriate formal training in many industries and a lack of access to training including the problems of funding, functional illiteracy and the apprenticeship scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I still find it incredible that one of the major props for our training structure is the trade system-a trade system that is a thousand years old and in many ways acts as an impediment to training in that it restricts, by virtue of age, people being able to obtain apprenticeships. It also, I suggest, has acted strongly as a disincentive to females obtaining access to the trades system. </PARA>
<PARA> The example I have given in the trade area suggests that the structure of training itself does not provide sufficient flexibility for persons to enter and continue in training throughout their working lives. Training should be delivered in a more modular form so that, if they wish and depending on their age and their attitude, persons can add to their training for the whole of their working lives.</PARA>
<PARA> Training in this country is not sufficiently integrated. If people move across an industry or within an industry, there should be a logical career path for them to follow. Training is not properly accredited in many industries-a theme I will come to a little later. The quality of trainers in many areas is very poor. Overall, training should be linked to satisfactory career paths for individuals and also to wages and skill levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the problem of private providers of training. Recently electors have drawn my attention to a number of problems. Those problems concern the quality of training offered by private providers. In my State of Tasmania-and I am sure in many other areas of Australia-there are many private courses being promoted by various organisations. Two within the hospitality industry have been drawn to my attention. The providers of these private training courses talk about giving diploma and certificate courses. They advertise the places at which these courses are taught, such as Wrest Point. They give government registration numbers and talk in fairly glowing terms about the future for people who undertake these courses.</PARA>
<PARA> The two particular courses I am talking about were drawn to my attention by a number of electors. On checking into these hospitality training courses, I found that neither had any formal registration and that the providers had sought registration but had been rejected. The Government registration number in the advertisement was not a registration number of the training course but the membership number of their employer association. The private providers claimed to give diplomas and certificates. That is totally misleading. If those courses are not accredited, the title `Diploma' or `Certificate' means absolutely nothing. The content of the courses on evaluation is not in accord with recently established national standards in the hospitality industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Heavy promotion is given to the venue. People who read the advertisements in the case of Wrest Point, which I have mentioned, will see that it seems to indicate that Wrest Point is delivering the course. On checking, the general manager of that establishment found to his horror that his establishment had been booked by this training company not on the basis that training courses were to be provided but on the basis that the training company was having a function there. </PARA>
<PARA> Individuals pay quite a deal of money for the privilege of attending these courses. In this case, the individual who came to me had to pay $200 and, on attending the course, was asked to pay further money for materials. When the examination was conducted at the end of the course, the training providers and the supervisors left the room. So everyone cheated and everyone got an A plus. Having completed this examination in which everyone obtained an A plus, the participants were urged to go into the work force and work for nothing to gain experience-in fact, urging individuals to breach the industrial law. I suppose to add insult to injury from the point of view of being a Tasmanian, on investigating and making my phone calls, which were quite difficult to make, I found the courses are based in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that area of private providers of training in which there is very little regulation or control. It is an area that I believe needs a great deal of research and one which I have referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which I am a member. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge that this country faces, particularly in the economic sphere, is a very difficult one. The future economy of the world in the 1990s and well into the next century will be dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, of which we are a part. It will also be dominated by the north Atlantic countries as a co-dominion. We are part of the international economic system; there is no way of avoiding that. The challenge for the Labor Party will be to ensure that we can successfully compete against that economic system. The challenge for the Labor Party will be to ensure that for the people of Australia this is carried out in terms of our social justice and equity goals. The challenge for me as a senator for Tasmania will be to ensure that those goals are carried out. That is a challenge that I intend to meet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief remarks on one aspect of the Government's response put down by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). The Government has had this report before it for some time-since June last year-but not for quite as long as governments sometimes have reports before them. I welcome this response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to direct my remarks particularly to page 7 of the response in which the Government addresses the recommendation that the Commonwealth prohibit tobacco advertising to the full extent that it has the power to do so. The response then points out that the Commonwealth prohibited tobacco advertising in the electronic media as long ago as 1976. We have been informed that further Commonwealth action has taken place following the passage through this place and the House of Representatives in December last year of an Australian Democrats private member's Bill to implement a total ban on tobacco advertising in all print media. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in its response reiterates the point made then, that it believes that tobacco advertising on billboards, hoardings and in cinemas is a matter for State and Territory governments. Some governments have acted in this area. I think it is worth noting that in this area it appears at this point that the New South Wales Government is taking the longest time to come to the view which has been reached by South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia by way of legislation and by Tasmania, Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory by way of draft legislation. We await developments in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining area of Federal responsibility contained in the Government's response relates to elements of the Broadcasting Act which allow for what is known as `incidental tobacco advertising'. That exemption to the electronic advertising ban, which was in the legislation in 1976, has resulted in the broadcast of events such as the Benson and Hedges World Series Cricket, Winfield Cup Rugby League and so on. In fact, there has been an injection of an enormous amount of tobacco industry money into sports sponsorship via which electronic advertising has continued, particularly on television. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has stated in its response that it believes that any proposal to remove this exemption needs to be evaluated and the likely impact on such sponsorships has to be looked at, as does alternative sources of funding for these activities. We are told that the Government intends to examine this matter and that a further statement will be made at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have looked at this matter. At this point I will not take the time of the Senate to put our point of view. I simply say that, as foreshadowed last year and again earlier this year, in the next few weeks we will be moving amendments to the broadcasting legislation to close that loophole and to address the concern which remains in the area of advertising tobacco products and which is leading to an increase in the use of tobacco products. This is a major public health issue in this country. Because this is an area of responsibility of the Commonwealth, we believe that, as the last move in the area of electronic media took place in 1976, it is certainly high time the Commonwealth played the role that it should play in terms of closing the loophole which was left there. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of alternative sources of funding, the Commonwealth Government does not have to look very far. In those States where the State responsibility has been taken up, organisations have been established to provide alternative funding of a very satisfactory nature. An example of this is the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation in my own State. As the Australian Grand Prix just yesterday would have shown, it is not absolutely essential that the tobacco companies have everything their own way. Of course, a minor exemption was made by the State Government of Victoria in that case. Nevertheless, the major sponsor did turn out to be a health promotion sponsor rather than a tobacco sponsor. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to the Government's further statement on this matter. I simply hope that the statement will be available at the time the Democrats put forward their amendments to the broadcasting legislation in order to close the loophole which, as this report notes, is clearly a concern of the Government. We will then have carried out the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority that the Commonwealth act in all ways it can against the advertising of tobacco products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise just to make a few very brief remarks, particularly in view of the fact that we will have before us, possibly late tonight or tomorrow, the Customs (Detention and Search) Bill 1990 which seeks to extend certain powers in relation to detention of and search for people who may be carrying so-called hard drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to page 3 of the Government's response which reviews the findings of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee held that, contrary to popular belief, the majority of users of drugs of dependence do not become addicted to them, and addicts generally give up their drug use sooner or later. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that of all the drug-related deaths that occur in Australia, some 80 per cent are related to the consumption of tobacco in one form or another; some 10 per cent are related to the consumption of alcohol; and all other drugs together make up the other 10 per cent, of which hard drugs-the figures which I have are now several years old-make up only 2 or 3 per cent. Yet enormous efforts, enormous amounts of funds and so on go into the prevention of death and injury in respect of that very small percentage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting, therefore, that the Committee has found and the Government has chosen to reiterate the Committee's finding, that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . contrary to popular belief, the majority of users of drugs of dependence-</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is a reference to hard drugs-</PARA>
<PARA>do not become addicted to them, and the addicts generally give up their drug use sooner or later. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly puts the onus fairly and squarely on to the Government not to procrastinate too long in referring this report to the ministerial committee and waiting for yet another report before some action is taken. It is quite clear to me at least that we need to change our policy in relation to the treatment of those who use the so-called drugs of addiction and who, if handled in an appropriate way, can be got through to the stage where they will very often spontaneously give up those--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I suggested in a motion in the Senate, I think two years ago, if we were to make those drugs available to consumers of the drugs under conditions of medical safety and legal safety, we might well overcome the problem of the traffickers by undercutting the market and removing the enormous crime associated with that trafficking, which quite clearly involves this country in enormous expense. Quite clearly, the report says that we are incapable of removing drug addiction by going down that road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply stress the figures again. I stress that we are putting enormous resources into a very small part of the overall problem if what we are concerned about is the damage to health and the damage to life which the consumption of drugs causes. We urge the Government to look closely at the possibility of coming up with a less crime-oriented and more treatment-oriented approach to the problem of drug use and drug addiction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am most concerned about the response the Government has given us regarding the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I believe that it replaces parliamentary representative democracy with Cabinet authoritarianism. In accepting recommendations 1 to 6 in the report, the Government has made mechanical alterations which could be applied regardless of the system of voting that was being used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recommendation 7 in this report is the key recommendation. It offers the chance to meet those very concerns which led to the generation of the report. In paragraph 4 of the Government's response we are told:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the D'Hondt system was introduced into the House by the Government . . . following clear indications by the Opposition parties that they would not support the introduction of either a single member constituency system, or a system under which half the members are elected using House of Representatives rules and half using Senate rules. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government rightly believes that support for those options would not be given now either. But that does not mean that the D'Hondt system remains the only possibility. The recommendations in the report clearly cite the proportional representation system used in Tasmania. Why would the Government support this recommendation in the Committee, yet reject it in the response that we have before us now? We have in the response the feeble line, `in view of the costs associated with conducting a referendum . . .' I cannot accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we now so parsimonious that we count the costs of democracy? While we are spending millions of dollars per week parading about on foreign seas defending America's oil interests, here in our symbolic seat of democracy we quibble at spending a few hundred thousand dollars to exercise one of the basic tools of democracy-the referendum. I ask whether this is the best response the Government can come up with:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in view of the costs associated with conducting a referendum, the Government has decided not to accept the Committee's Recommendations 7, 8 and 9. </PARA>
<PARA>Does this pathetic response truly reflect this Government's valuation of democracy? I hope that in this chamber the Opposition will reject such an attempt to ignore, even to insult, its members on that Committee. I hope that members of the Opposition, as champions of the rights of the individual, will not be misled by the backroom boffins, the manipulating mandarins, who place such a low value on the due processes of democracy. On page 77 of the report we see the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Commission pointed out that the extraordinary length of the ballot paper, a factor which contributed to the duration of the count, was not caused by the number of candidates, but by the number of parties, and by the requirement that independent candidates be listed horizontally above the ballot line. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the contention of the Australian Democrats that the D'Hondt system is an abomination-that in fact it is not an electoral system but a list system which favours party listing. That is evidenced by the ACT Administration information pamphlet, which in part reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the D'Hondt system in Europe, voters normally only mark the ballot paper once to indicate the party of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA>That appears on page 65 of the report. It is the D'Hondt system which has encouraged the creation in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) of a multitude of parties which tried to distinguish themselves from each other by composing their extraordinary names. I am sure that we are all too well aware of those. Those very names and those very parties were not created in response to a particular community desire to generate political parties but were imposed as a result of the system, the abomination, which we ended up with. </PARA>
<PARA> To resolve that problem, if the Joint Standing Committee's recommendations were accepted in full, we would have the opportunity to establish in the Australian Capital Territory an electoral system which would give ACT electors the opportunity to democratically choose a system which would not suffer the anomalies and the problems of the D'Hondt arrangement and which might actually reflect the preference of the electors. I recommend the Committee's recommendations in full. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a most important document in the debate on the defence of Australia. It is a challenging document. It is not one with which everybody will agree and certainly there are many things in it with which I do not agree. Nevertheless, it is a very important step along the way to raising the awareness of defence as an issue in this country, which is long overdue, and it has to make for debate on defence in this country to be better informed. </PARA>
<PARA> In his report, Mr Wrigley has proposed a number of measures. It is a very large report, approximately two inches thick, and certainly deserves substantial study by anybody concerned with defence in this country. There is not a lot of time today to discuss the report in depth, but in it Mr Wrigley canvasses issues such as the civilianisation of the Defence Force and the privatisation of some of the functions, both of which are measures which other defence forces, notably those of the United Kingdom, where I visited last year, have taken steps towards. Some of those steps can be very useful, but-and I issue a note of caution here-they are sometimes not appropriate and we could find, when the time came to defend the country, that some of these measures did not allow us the flexibility we should have. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues that concerned me about Mr Wrigley's report is that he compared Australia's situation with those of several countries with which I do not believe there is a fair comparison, namely, countries in Europe where conscription is part of life and where people then go on to national service, a continuing reserve obligation. That does not occur in Australia. Mr Wrigley also compares Australia with the United States of America, where there are enormous financial attractions for putting people into the reserve forces. That does not happen in this country and it is not proposed here because of the enormous expenditure. If it is, it is not costed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that Mr Wrigley proposes that we no longer have any need for an expeditionary-type force. One only has to recognise the vast size of this country to realise that we must be able to take our operational deployment force to the far corners of the country with the logistic support that it would need. When I have spoken to Mr Wrigley on this matter he has said that civilians will be there and that when Australia is attacked they will bring up the arms and ammunition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned because the history of the union movement in Australia has not been one that would give us reason to believe that the support would be there when the country needed it. We have had several occasions when ships going to war have not been loaded when the need arose. Even Kangaroo 89, the exercise last year, had to be rewritten to some extent because some ships were tied up at the dock because of a dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wrigley would like us to recruit 52,000 men and women for a reserve force, and yet only last week the Auditor-General reported on how, in his assessment, the reserves have become ineffective through lack of training and resources; he doubted that Australia would be able to recruit even 26,000-half the number proposed by Mr Wrigley-by the end of this century. I understand that Mr Wrigley relied quite heavily on the material unearthed by the Auditor-General, and I find it strange that he did not come to that conclusion himself. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to remember that over the last six or seven years the regular force and the reserve force have both gradually become more and more under-resourced and their manpower levels are getting lower and lower. So anybody who is concerned with our defence forces and with the defence of Australia should take these two reports and study them closely. They are both extremely valuable in the national debate and should not be ignored by serious commentators who want to see our country better defended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to be indicted because of some of the results that have been documented for us by the Auditor-General. I must congratulate his staff on the way they dealt with the difficulties of coming to grips with some of the material which was not readily available. We have a reserve force which is demonstrably not as effective as it should be and yet we are training those people at a relatively high cost compared with the regulars; they also are not getting the support they need. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, the Wrigley report and the Auditor-General's report into the Department of Defence, Australia's Army Reserve, are two major statements which this Government must address. The debate on defence must not be allowed to die. It is the most important issue that faces this country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This document has just been received by honourable senators. It covers a wide range of matters affecting the disabled community. It is an extremely important document and I believe it will arouse some fears within the disabled community. Today I wish to speak to only two items in this report which are the concern of the veterans community, namely, the National Acoustics Laboratory (NAL) and the Rehabilitation and Artificial Limb Appliance Centre (RALAC). The National Acoustics Laboratory has been studied in considerable detail. There was an interim report brought down a month or so ago by the Industry Commission. As a result of that report evidence was taken around the country and this final report has now been produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Acoustics Laboratory has a number of recommendations, the most important of which is that it be permitted to compete with other suppliers for non-hearing services programmed clients provided it is first converted to a government business enterprise operating on a fully commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most outstanding features of the National Acoustics Laboratory, for anybody who has any dealings with it, is the incredible and inordinate delays for people awaiting a hearing test. The report gives examples: the actual waiting time at Hurstville in New South Wales had risen from 20 weeks in August 1989 to 37 weeks in January 1990, while, for the same period, actual waiting time at Orange had risen from nine weeks to 22 weeks. In a number of NAL hearing centres, it was reported, the waiting time as at 29 May 1990 was as high as nine months. The Commission came to the conclusion that even the reduced waiting times which NAL is now achieving are not satisfactory and that greater competition in the private market will be in the interests of all concerned If that will bring down the waiting time I believe veterans, amongst other disabled people, will find that a great improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems quite strange, when we turn to the RALACs, that the Commission did not make a similar recommendation. In fact, it suggested that the RALACs should be abolished. In the interim report the possibility was canvassed that they remain under public ownership, but the final report suggested that the RALACs should be abolished. I feel that would be a severe distortion of the system at this stage. In my own mind there did not appear to be a sufficient number of private enterprise organisations to be able to cope with the number of disabled people who need limbs. Down the track, that probably would be the case. A better proposition would be to have two stages whereby there would be much greater competition, and a freeing-up and deregulation of the system-which is currently very heavily regulated by the Government, through the Department of Veterans' Affairs-and once the private sector had taken up the slack, possibly the RALACs could be shut down if it was still considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst a number of quite useful recommendations there seems to be one quite clearly not covered that I would have expected to be there. There seems to be no requirement for prosthetists to be accredited. It seems to me that as paramedics are in similar positions to physiotherapists and the like, it is an important omission. The issues facing the industry are training and supervision of standards, and accreditation of the prosthetists, I would have thought, was an absolutely vital ingredient if we are to go down the route that the Industries Commission is suggesting in this report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the annual report of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), I would like to comment on several matters which should be of grave concern to all honourable senators. During the recent Estimates Committee the AEC assured the Committee that the goal of maintaining an accurate, complete and continuous electoral roll was to be discharged by undertaking comprehensive habitation reviews across the entire nation. This step should help to ensure that elections are held using the cleanest possible electoral rolls. </PARA>
<PARA> In a debate in May this year many senators aired concerns about the state of the rolls, and cited many problems and irregularities that have been drawn to their attention. The major problem is that none of us have the capacity to undertake the detailed examination necessary to check allegations of this nature, so any complaints are usually dismissed as purely anecdotal. </PARA>
<PARA> We await with interest the results of the AEC survey investigating enrolments in six electorates in the lead-up to the last election, and we expect an undertaking that resources will be made available to correct any weaknesses identified in Commission records and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context it is rather alarming to note that the submission of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party to the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission warns of considerable pressure upon the AEC to achieve financial savings. We seek assurances from the Government that any economies will not be at the expense of improving the State rolls. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern I have is that should our State of Queensland decide to introduce a joint enrolment system, with the Commonwealth undertaking the responsibility for maintaining the rolls, then Queensland will again suffer because resources are not made available to cope with the State's population boom. We are all familiar with the unfairness shown in allocating, for example, funds for education, which has seen the supply of tertiary places in Queensland lag far behind the level warranted by equity and population pressure. The problem will be particularly acute given that Queensland growth rates show no sign of abating. </PARA>
<PARA> Before surrendering its right to maintain an interest in this process the State Government would be well advised to ensure that Queenslanders do not suffer yet again because of the distorted priorities of this Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In Estimates we were told the Commonwealth expected to realise significant savings if the joint enrolment procedures were introduced. What are the odds of any of this money being spent in Queensland to upgrade the rolls?</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the largest electorates in the whole of Australia are McPherson and Fisher in Queensland, and that the top five electorates across all States are in Queensland. The AEC states its goal is to keep divisional enrolments as equal as possible over the life of a redistribution, but the dynamic population growth in my State of Queensland has made this an impossible dream. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties were heightened by significant flaws in the projections of enrolment increases relied upon by the AEC in preparing the Queensland redistribution. Unfortunately, the AEC allowed local divisional returning officers to adjust projections based on their so-called local knowledge. There were some spectacular errors. The worst was in McPherson-which is based on the Gold Coast-which ended up at the redistribution mid-point in December 1987 as more than 14 per cent over the target. Because of its strategic position on the State border this led to a ripple effect which caused many seats to vary significantly from the average enrolment. In fact, of Queensland's 24 seats, fully eight were more than 5 per cent off target at the half-way point, compared with the statutory goal of no more than 2 per cent variance. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned to ensure that the redistribution due next year does not suffer from the same handicap, and have sought an undertaking that the enrolment projections research paper is released well in advance of the deadline for submission so that it can be carefully examined and, if necessary, the projections for underlying assumptions can be challenged. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish briefly to draw to the attention of the Senate the problems being faced by the Australian Maritime College (AMC), which is an excellent organisation and has been the centre of excellence for the nation in training maritime students. It has had enormous difficulty over seven months in trying to get some sort of response from the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) to the amalgamation safeguards which the college proposed back in February of last year. For seven months the college has waited for a reaction from that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The college gave general approval of the broad principles of amalgamation in September 1989. It is keen to retain its role as the national centre for maritime education and training and it has tried, therefore, to maintain its identity as a college within the new university which is to be put together with the maritime college, the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology and the University of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's delay in responding to the maritime college I find quite incomprehensible, rude and certainly not in the best interests of the students who will be attending the maritime college in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The maritime college wishes to maintain a nexus with the Commonwealth, although it is prepared to see a new single, integrated university in Tasmania. I draw the attention of the Senate to the quite unacceptable delays occasioned by DEET to an organisation which deserves prompt and courteous attention, and a response to reasonable requirements in what was supposed to be a negotiated position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Maritime College has gone through the development stages and is now at one of consolidation. The college's first students were enrolled in 1980 and, since that time, it has developed into an institute which has been recognised as one of the leading maritime education and training institutions. This has enabled Australia to ratify an international convention on the standards of training and certification for seafarers and to implement current Government initiated changes to shipboard practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the college is being encouraged to take on more students, it has not received a funding boost in the 1989-91 triennium. Thus the course offerings unfortunately have had to be reappraised. Because of the demands placed upon the college to serve the training needs arising from the adoption by the Commonwealth of recommendations of the Shipping Reform Task Force a budget shortfall of $324,724 was expected in 1989 and whilst reimbursement of this deficit has been promised by the Commonwealth, as of September 1990 unfortunately no money has been received. So unless additional funding is provided for the college it will not be in a position to provide the sum total of training required as per the recommendations of the Shipping Reform Task Force for the remainder of the triennium. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to address is the proposed amalgamation of the Australian Maritime College (AMC) with the University of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Institute of Technology. Following some eight months of negotiations, the AMC's council endorsed in September 1989 the principle outlined in the heads of agreement negotiated between the three parties relative to a merger of the three institutions. So the move towards amalgamation had resulted from policy initiatives embodied in the Commonwealth Government's July 1988 White Paper and, although it is a viable institution in its own right, the AMC did not qualify for membership of the unified national system and was consequently left with no option but to seek an amalgamation partner. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMC will enter amalgamation mindful of the national nature of the college and the need to be able to protect its role within the combined state tertiary body. One of the college's success stories is its consultancy and research company, AMC Search Ltd, which undertook 52 projects during 1989. The largest project was a half a million dollar contract with Petrona's Malaysian national oil company, which involved the ship sim-modelling of the design of the maritime marine facility for a refinery in Malaysia and a simulation study to determine the optimum layout and the design of the facility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has concluded that there is a need for the construction of a Perth office and warehouse complex for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The proposed office building will have an area of 5,508 square metres on two levels, and the area of the warehouse is proposed to be 1,120 square metres. The cost of $13.926m will be reduced by the sale of the CAA's warehouse site at Mount Claremont in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee heard evidence that the Western Australian field office of the CAA is presently located in expensive leased accommodation in Perth's central business district. The lease on this property expires in October 1991. The CAA accepted the report of the consultant who recommended the move from the leased accommodation to Perth Airport because: leasing costs are high; the CAA's major clients are at Perth Airport; and savings could be made by way of relocating the office staff. The CAA purchased a suitable block by the Perth Airport in November 1988. The Committee supports the CAA's belief that it should be in a decentralised location, close to its clients. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few brief points I would like to make in connection with this report. First, the roof of the warehouse at Mount Claremont contained asbestos sheeting. Evidence was given that this is safe provided it is undisturbed. Should a new owner decide to demolish the building, care will need to be taken to adhere to the appropriate Western Australian code of practice for the removal of this material. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee was told that use of solar panels for heating within the proposed building was not found to be practical commercially. The Committee reiterates the point made during last week's tabling of the report into the Australian Taxation Office's dedicated computer centre that means of improving energy efficiency in new buildings will be kept under scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the CAA's original proposal had included sale of its workshops at Mount Lawley. The combination of a National Trust classification on the main building, restrictions on construction on the block and uncertainty about the future of the CAA's workshops combined to remove this from the proposal. The Committee accepts this situation and, while not making a recommendation on the issue, endorses the principle of bringing all relevant CAA operations to Perth Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there were concerns expressed about such things as public transport to the airport, banking and child care facilities and the cost and availability of food in that part of the airport. The Committee notes that the CAA has been seeking to ensure these services are adequate for the staff at Perth Airport. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate on this legislation towards the end of last week, Senator Cooney, speaking for the Government, claimed that the Opposition's attitude to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 was determined, at least in part, by what he described as our unease with regard to trades unions and the ordinary working person. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, what we see today is the unease of the ordinary working person with trades unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the private sector of the Australian economy less than one-third of employees today actually belong to trade unions. Workers are voting with their feet in terms of their attitude to trade unions and are showing a distinctly negative attitude to union organisations. There has been a significant decline in membership over a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> A clear motive behind this legislation is an attempt to stem that decline in union membership by making preference to unionists much more stringent and thereby tightening up the de facto compulsion to belong to a trade union. People will have to join unions because of legislation-not because of the merits of union membership or because of the services or benefits that they might obtain by belonging to a trade union. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do we need such compulsion? Clearly, it is needed because all the other elements of this legislation reinforce the negative aspects of trade unionism which deter people from becoming members. I refer to the concentration and centralisation of power in few hands, the trampling on the rights of individuals, and the reinforcement of anti-democratic procedures. Each of these three negative elements is clearly evident when one considers the key purposes of this Bill and the specific clauses which give effect to them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are six key purposes to this legislation. The first is to increase the membership threshold. The minimum membership for which a trade union will qualify for registration will go from 1,000 members currently to 20,000. Secondly, it will make amalgamation procedures less stringent. Thirdly, the legislation will oblige the Industrial Relations Commission to take advice from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Fourthly, the Bill will recognise federations of unions prior to formal amalgamation. Fifthly, the Bill will provide exemptions from secret postal ballots. Sixthly, it will reinforce and extend preferences which the Industrial Relations Commission may extend to members of a trade union. </PARA>
<PARA> To give effect to those key purposes there are six focal clauses in this legislation. Clause 4 amends the objects of the existing Industrial Relations Act to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation and development of unions. Clause 10 amends section 118 of the Act to strengthen the onus of consultation on the Commission to consult peak organisations, such as the ACTU, when considering demarcation disputes arising from a union's attempt to extend its coverage. It obliges the Commission to consider not only agreements but also any so-called understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 reinforces the preference provisions of the Act and extends their scope. Clause 12 amends the minimum membership requirement for registration of a trade union from 1,000 to 20,000 members. Clause 14 proposes a two-stage review of the registration of small organisations-those with fewer than 1,000 members in the first stage and fewer than 20,000 members in the second stage-beginning in March 1992, to see whether they should continue to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The final focal clause to which I refer is clause 15 which repeals the existing amalgamation provisions and replaces them with provisions which, firstly, explicitly recognise union federations under section 236; and, secondly, introduce a new section 253h, which provides an exemption from the necessity of having a secret postal ballot of members to approve amalgamation-a secret ballot of duly constituted meetings of members can suffice. </PARA>
<PARA> The plans by Mr Kelty-the somewhat controversial plans which he has had for some time-to reduce the number of unions connects with the ACTU's wages push outside the Industrial Relations Commission. This has its origins in the Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement document of May 1987 and in the Australia Reconstructed document of the same year. His plans and this legislation are recipes for further increasing and entrenching union power-not for improving industrial relations and productivity but, as I said earlier, for establishing a minimum size for Australian trade unions of 20,000 members. This is an increase of some 2,000 per cent in the minimum allowed size of trade unions. This will not be more conducive to the development and maintenance of effective industrial relations processes in any industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's rationale that larger and fewer unions will achieve better industrial relations is fatally flawed. Kelty argues that the law has prevented unions rationalising federally. But these amendments will not allow a rational trade union structure to develop. There are currently about 300 or so registered trade unions and Kelty wants this number reduced to 20 mega-unions-a cut of some 93 per cent. Presently only 45 unions have memberships of more than 20,000. It will be interesting to observe the negotiations between union officials and their clamouring for this Government's amalgamation handouts at taxpayers' expense so that Kelty's cluster approach can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The date specified after which newly registering unions will be required to have the larger membership is 28 February, 1990. All registered small unions would have a further two years, after which, if they failed to have 20,000 members, they would have to show cause why they should be allowed to stay registered. Why should the onus of proof be on a small union to justify its continued existence and survival?</PARA>
<PARA> Through this legislation the Hawke Labor Government is just caving in to Kelty and the ACTU and their fantasy of amalgamation for the union movement. That amalgamation agenda of the ACTU includes mergers flowing from the vote of only the smaller union body if it is less than 25 per cent of the body it is joining. It also seeks to allow the merging unions to form a federation which is recognised by law and can act on their behalf before industrial tribunals while the merger itself is being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> This item has the effect of making the formal merger a fait accompli and more difficult to prevent by allowing the establishment of those federations. Allowing a vote in favour of a merger to be taken at a meeting of members, instead of by what the ACTU regards as the time-consuming and counter-productive method of the postal ballot, is just another part of their agenda. Of course, this is a much less democratic means of achieving mergers and amalgamations, because we all know of the thuggery that occurs at some union meetings in regard to votes taken on issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Also on the agenda is the freeing up of union funds and resources to promote the cause of the merger. But what of funds for those wishing to oppose such a merger? There is no provision for that at all. There is also to be an allowance for unions to change their operating rules while a merger is under way. No doubt we will have to watch for some sleight of hand that will undoubtedly occur there. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelty has suffered some embarrassing setbacks in the prosecution of his agenda-namely, the failure of hoped-for mergers between the building workers and the engine drivers and between the electricians and the engineers. His proposals require massive changes to the heartland of unionism in this country. We need to recognise that, contrary to what this legislation will provide, size on its own is no guarantee of internal efficiency of any union. It would be nothing more than national suicide to encourage and create an umbrella of cumbersome conglomerates which could fall into the control of a small group and particularly of the militant Left. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition-the Liberal and National parties-firmly and wholeheartedly supports union restructuring, but we support it on the basis of the development of enterprise unions and enterprise agreements. This is a fundamental tenet of our industrial relations policy. It is clear that Kelty and the ACTU are stooping to desperate measures to shore up a dwindling union membership and their own power base. This legislation is nothing more than an attempt by Kelty and his ACTU colleagues to halt the decline of union membership and influence. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement of a minimum union membership of 1,000-never mind 20,000-clearly violates the fundamental principle of freedom of association. It is a direct contravention of Convention No. 87 of the International Labour Organisation, to which Australia is a signatory, which established the right of workers to absolute freedom of association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, quite contrary to its initiatives in those other areas, is putting up legislation which will tighten the anti-competitive, monopolistic stranglehold of the unions. On the one hand Minister Beazley and Treasurer Keating are fighting publicly over the limits of increased competition that they think their Party members might tolerate in telecommunications and, on the other, the Government has introduced a Bill, which is before us, seeking to decrease competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems that in this area, and indeed with the development of its megacom proposals, the Government endorses the concept that big is beautiful. It seems to have forgotten that big is also unwieldy and unresponsive to individual needs and requirements and, by definition, concentrates power into the hands of a few. Mega-unions that do not have to compete for membership will have no necessity to bend over backwards to look after their members. Amalgamation of unions into 20 or so mega-unions will not lessen demarcation disputes. The only way to do that is through enterprise-based unions, and the minimum size requirements of this legislation will actively prevent such organisations from coming into existence. </PARA>
<PARA> Kelty's big dream has a number of very serious defects and detrimental consequences for Australia-that is, if it is ever realised. It would prevent forever the emergence of enterprise unions. No empirical evidence exists to support fewer but larger unions as being more efficient, or for that matter any more conciliatory, than that which currently exists. We need only look at the behaviour of the building industry unions and the metal unions over the years to confirm that. </PARA>
<PARA> A study by the Business Council of Australia called Enterprise-Based Bargaining Units: A Better Way of Working, which the Opposition applauds and supports, argues most comprehensively that there should be fewer unions within enterprises or industry. We support that view. The Council's survey highlighted that amalgamations of small unions, however, would not reduce the number of major unions among its member enterprises. It is those major unions which are responsible for most of the demarcation disputes which cripple industry from time to time. Fewer unions would not necessarily result in fewer disputes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no logical flaw in the coalition's position and that is clearly recognised in the community which has accepted our policy and strongly endorsed it over the last couple of years. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures has shown that minimum sizes seem more likely to reduce the number of federally registered industry-focused unions than they are to reduce the number of federally registered craft unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The union movement's amalgamation proposals, to which this legislation gives effect, will not solve the problem of multiple coverage in workplaces. As an example, the top 12 unions which have membership in Business Council workplaces will only be reduced to nine under the union amalgamation proposals. This will not significantly reduce the number of unions in most workplaces because the extent of overlapping membership is relatively small. Take for example the recent rubber workers-storemen and packers amalgamation. That amalgamation will reduce the number of unions in only 4 per cent of plants. A more significant amalgamation, such as the proposed Australian Workers Union-Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia amalgamation, will reduce the number of unions in just 16 per cent of plants. </PARA>
<PARA> So much more is needed than the approach endorsed and supported by the ACTU and which will be implemented if this legislation passes. Amalgamation needs to be linked to productivity, instead of the amalgamation and the development of unions as being an end in itself. There is no encouragement of new, single enterprise unions and, as I have said, if this Bill were successful in being passed, the emergence of new, single enterprise unions would be prevented. </PARA>
<PARA> The section 118 amendments will increase the ACTU's influence on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's deliberations of demarcation disputes which arise from union claims of coverage of workers by increasing the onus on the Commission to consult with the ACTU and by obliging the Commission to consider not only agreements but also undertakings. However, these so-called undertakings are not defined and the practical effect of these proposed changes will be to allow the ACTU to put a point of view as an undertaking in camera with no opportunity for any other party to confront it. The amendments significantly water down the important section 118 of the Act which allows the Industrial Relations Commission to alter union coverage by transferring members to another union and denying coverage by unions of particular industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The acknowledgment of federations of unions contained in the legislation is completely unnecessary because most unions would have such provision within the terms of their own constitutions. Practically speaking, its inclusion merely pre-empts the result of any subsequent vote on amalgamation by union members. Union members are not required to vote on federation, but acceptance of a proposal to federate by the Commission, with the commitment to amalgamate in three years time, will undoubtedly be represented by proponents of amalgamation as approval by the Commission for amalgamation. Therefore, the federation provisions effectively will reverse the onus of proof on opponents of amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> It will become easier for unions to control the vote by controlling membership of the meeting which is voting, with the introduction of a provision exempting amalgamation proposals from a secret postal ballot by members and the substitution of a secret ballot at duly constituted meetings of the members. As I said earlier, we know only too well how votes at many union meetings are conducted and the intimidation and thuggery that goes on at those meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11, which reinforces and widens preference provisions, is a blatant attempt to make compulsory union membership universal. </PARA>

The clarification which clause 11 provides for preference to be given to union members in virtually every aspect of employment-hiring, promotion, regrading, training, leave and overtime-is aimed at ensuring that any person who is not a union member will be unemployable. It is a back-door way of forcing everyone to join a union if they want to work. It is a way of widening and legitimising the closed shop which is already widespread in many industries in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have all seen the signs on building sites that read `No ticket, no start'. If the Government has its way with this legislation, we will see that sign up in every workplace in the land. It is a gross violation of civil liberties and a direct contravention of article 20, item 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states: `No-one may be compelled to belong to an association.' How can this Government, which has sent its warships halfway round the world in the name of human rights and civil liberties, in the same breath try to bring in a piece of legislation that seeks to restrict those same rights for its own citizens?</PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the attitude of the Democrats to this legislation which was put last week by Senator McLean. In listening to his remarks last week, one could only be convinced that either Senator McLean has severe amnesia or else he must have been severely embarrassed at the speech he had to make because the Democrats that have joined him since the last election have caused an even greater lurch to the left on the part of that party. Senator McLean put the view that amalgamations of unions should be encouraged and accelerated. He indicated that his preferred minimum size and that of the Democrats was for 10,000 members, compared with the Government's proposed 20,000, but he really did not seem to be too fussed about whether it was one or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate, and indeed the people of Australia, of what Senator McLean said on behalf of the Democrats in moving an amendment to the Industrial Relations Bill less than two years ago-an amendment which reduced the minimum union membership requirement from the Government's then proposal of 3,000 to just 1,000; an amendment which this Coalition supported in the absence of Democrat support for our own proposal for no minimum size. In moving for a minimum size of 1,000 Senator McLean said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats saw these amendments as constructive and responsible in that we have been approached by a considerable number of small unions who argue they are unable to find, and will remain unable to find even within the three-year period allowed for adjustment, compatible unions with which to amalgamate successfully. Some indicated they had in fact pursued the course of amalgamation in recent years only to find that it did not service their needs. They have withdrawn, only to find that this Bill proposes that they be forced into amalgamations which have proven unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> We draw attention to the fact that our revised suggested figure of 1,000 as the minimum required limit of employer and employee organisations is simply in line with the recommendations of the Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems, which proposed a minimum membership of 1,000 for both employer and employee organisations. This figure will provide an opportunity to meet the needs of smaller unions. This is the figure which the Government in the 1987 Industrial Relations Bill found acceptable and which at that time was acceptable to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> We are not convinced that in the interim 15 months there has arisen a need for the Government or the ACTU to argue the non-acceptability of 1,000. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course we do not accept it, because we do not believe that there should be any minimum size. But the Democrats less than two years ago said that 1,000 was the preferred minimum size for a trade union. We now see them falling into line with the Government and accepting at best a minimum size of 10 times what they were prepared to accept two years ago. We see Senator McLean supporting this massive increase from 1,000 to 10,000 in minimum size. These two minimum sizes are of a completely different order of magnitude and completely different logic in terms of preferred choice between them, and yet the Democrats have changed courses within the short space of two years. They have done so without so much as a `beg your pardon' or any justification or logical explanation in the speech which Senator McLean made to this chamber last week. One can only conclude that they have done yet another deal with the Government to get some preference with regard to some other activity further down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Week by week it is becoming more evident that the Australian people have already decided who will be given the responsibility of governing this country after the next election-and we all know it will not be this mob opposite. What has been recognised is that this long-suffering country is sick of low productivity, and sick of the absence of wealth generation which this Government fails to encourage. Until our industries are free from the malaise affecting our transport system, our telecommunications sector and our over-regulated labour markets, productivity will remain the poor country cousin; and they will not be free from this malaise as long as Labor remains in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord, which this Government has trumpeted loudly over its time in office, is in fact part of the problem in Australia rather than being the solution. We must move away from a centralised wages system and place more focus on negotiations in the workplace together with enterprise-based bargaining structures and procedures if we are to determine wages and conditions fairly. The place of trade unions should not be as an arm of Executive Government, as they are under this Government, controlling industrial policies. Their place is not around the Cabinet table with de facto Cabinet member status directing decisions. Unions should represent their members in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called labour market is not really that at all in Australia. It is a centralised process whereby wages outcomes seemingly have no limit. We have wage increases which apply right across the board, disregarding the differing abilities of various industries and firms to pay these increases. Our nation's poor productivity is aggravated by this appalling labour system which has demonstrated its inability to accommodate changing industrial needs and the changed demands of international competition. Yet we still have some people living in cloud cuckoo land. Laurie Carmichael, ACTU Assistant Secretary and Deputy Chairman of the Australian Manufacturing Council, has actually stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . pressing industry to become more 'competitive alone' is not a policy pursued by other countries with whom we are required to compete. </PARA>
<PARA>Any casual observer would know the emphasis our competitors place on efficiency, making a complete nonsense of Carmichael's statement. But he is also ignoring the fact that our competitors are so far in front of Australia that they could rest on their laurels for some time before we would catch them, even if we make a serious commitment now to improve productivity. But of course, they will not wait for us; unless we act now, they will go further and further ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> We are ranked third, only behind Mexico and Brazil, as the most indebted nation in the world. Surely a more cooperative, a more flexible and a more effective industrial relations framework which reflects incentive and resourcefulness is what we desperately need-a system based on completely voluntary enterprise-based agreements as its primary feature, rather than the continuation of featherbedding. If we are going to solve our international debt problem, where the gap between imports and exports represents about 4 per cent of gross domestic product, we need in effect to increase output by 4 per cent from every worker and every business in a form that foreigners will buy or that we will buy instead of foreign products, without that being able to generate any improvement in our real living standards. That is the way we will have to operate if we are going to overcome that foreign debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing approach of this Government, which is a broadly corporatist interventionist approach, will not provide the opportunity for that necessary increase in output. It is at the enterprise or workplace level where organisational and economic vitality originate and survive. Centralised productivity is but a statistic rather than a reality. Certainly there is an element of enterprise bargaining now under way in Australia, but this is just a move to catch up with longstanding arrangements overseas. Meanwhile, those overseas countries, as I said, are moving further ahead in their transformation to an even greater enterprise focus. That is why Australia must press forward to adopt the coalition's proposals for a complete enterprise-based industrial relations structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to what this Government believes, big is not beautiful; in fact, small is beautiful. Employee participation, decentralisation of organisation and power at all levels are ideas which have come of age in the Australian community. That is the best way of achieving productive outcomes in the labour market and, indeed, of encouraging cooperation between employers and employees to lift the productivity which this country desperately requires. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of passing the amendments which this legislation seeks to achieve for the Industrial Relations Act, we ought to be amending the Act to enable a specified number of employees to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission for a change of union coverage in their workplace. We should also be amending the Act to permit the registration of new enterprise unions, totally regardless of size. That would allow us to move towards the approach which the coalition has for several years advocated as the only way to achieve meaningful improvement in our industrial relations structure. Our policy represents a complete break from centralised wage fixing and is the only alternative for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a sense of dismay and sadness that I note the introduction of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 into the Senate. For a long time, the Australian Labor Party, the people sitting opposite me, have purported to further the rights of the working class. Yet, by the introduction of this Bill and by its passage through this Parliament, the Labor Party will deprive ordinary workers of the right to self-determination; it will deprive ordinary workers of the chance to work harder for their betterment and for the betterment of their families; and it will take away the economic strength of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon I shall address two matters. The first is the increasing preference for unionists which is included in this Bill and the second is the provisions in this Bill which relate to the forced amalgamation of unions, quite possibly against the wishes or the interests of the members of those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us first turn our attention to clause 11 of the Bill-the clause that extends the preference to unionists. I will tell honourable senators some of the matters to which that preference clause relates. It relates to the engagement in employment. That means that if one does not have a union ticket one does not get a job. It relates to promotion, regrading, transfer and retention in employment. In other words, if one ceases to be a unionist one can lose one's job. It relates to the taking of annual leave. In other words, if one does not pay union dues, one cannot go on holiday at Christmas if one wants to. It relates to overtime and it relates to vocational training. The message to the Australian worker and to the Australian public is very clear: unless workers abide by what union leaders tell them, in the future they will not have a chance in the work force; they will not have a chance to get on and provide for the future of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look in detail at some of the matters mentioned in clause 11. Let us look at retention in employment. What happens if workers cease to be union members? What happens if one does not join a union or belong to a union now and the provisions of this Bill take effect? It means that someone can determine whether a worker loses the right to keep the job. The right to a job and to promotion should be based solely on ability, and not the membership of a union. </PARA>
<PARA> We, on this side of the chamber, believe that people should have a right to work for their prosperity. Yet, in this Bill, we see pernicious attempts to take the incentive away from ordinary workers. We see an attempt by the other side of the House, the side that purports to govern in the national interest, to take away from people the opportunity to work harder and to improve their skills, and to take away the right to promotion on merit or to promotion based upon the contribution that employees make to the employers and to the Australian economy as a whole. That is why we and all thinking Australians believe that the provisions of this Bill are wholly unsatisfactory and that they constitute a backward step in civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with interest that when this Bill was introduced into this chamber last week, Senator Cooney, a well-known believer in civil rights and in the right of people to free association and so on, spoke in its favour. That disappointed me greatly. I would have thought that a man such as Senator Cooney, with his experience in these matters, would have recognised the dangers inherent in the passage of this Bill through the Parliament-the danger that once and for all ordinary workers, ordinary Australians, ordinary men and women with families and kids, will lose the right to security, to happiness and to prosperity because it is being taken away from them and put in the hands of their union bosses. </PARA>
<PARA> This argument is not raised on the basis of ideology or of vested interest-unless it is the vested interest of every single Australian worker, man or woman, to choose what organisation he or she will belong to, and to choose how, where and when he or she will work. This Bill will take that right away from them, and take it away for ever. That is why we, on this side of the chamber, are wholehearted in our opposition to this Government's attempts to destroy the rights of the working class. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what this Government intends to do by way of forceful amalgamation of unions. It is very clear that this Government is wholeheartedly behind the idea of mega-unions. Why? Because it puts more power in the hands of the union leaders. When it puts more power in the hands of the union leaders, from whom does it take that power? It takes that power away from the ordinary worker in the shop, in the factory or on the work site. The workers are but a small cog in a large and inhumane machine; a small cog in an apparatus that can quite easily and happily ignore their wishes because they account for only a small number of members. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is wholly unsatisfactory for us and for the Australian population. We believe that people in this country should have a right-a fair dinkum, honest, inalienable right-to determine which organisation they will belong to and whom they will have representing their interests. The arguments that this Government brings forward with this Bill are analogous to saying, `Oh well, you can't belong to a political party unless it has a minimum number of members'. In essence, it says that ordinary Australians have lost the right to freedom of association and that they have lost the right to democracy in the workplace because they cannot determine who will represent them. </PARA>
<PARA> How will the big cudgel of the Labor Party be taken to the small defenceless unions? I will tell honourable senators how. It is written very clearly in this Bill. It will be taken in two stages. During stage one, between 1 March 1992 and 28 February 1993, organisations of employees fewer than 1,000 in number will be forced to justify their continued existence. During stage two, from 1 March 1994 to 28 February 1995, organisations of employees fewer than 20,000 in number will be asked to justify their continued existence. The mechanism by which this will be done will be to have a designated presidential member empowered to inquire into the continued existence of those organisations in what this Bill grandly calls `the public interest'. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the personal interests of the members of those organisations? What about the contribution that they have made over years, years and more years to the prosperity of their families? What about the contribution that they and their organisations have made to improving the standards in their workplace? That contribution will be lost once and for all. Their hard won freedoms-freedoms that those on the other side of the chamber spend so much time trumpeting about over and over again-will be lost forever. The Australian workers should ask themselves: Who is taking this freedom away from us? Who is taking away the rights that have been won? The sad answer is: the Labor Party which, for so many years, has masqueraded as the party that looks after the interests of Australian workers, but which is shown by this Bill and by the explanatory memorandum that supports this Bill to be the party that takes away the rights of the ordinary worker and the freedoms of ordinary Australians, and concentrates them in the hands of the faceless men in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the intention of this Bill is that small organisations should have to justify their continued existence. It should be wrong that anybody in this country should have to justify his liberty, his freedom and his right of association. Those rights are inalienable rights recognised not just in this country and countries throughout the Western world but recognised by the international community at large, both in the United Nations charter and in other international conventions. These are inalienable rights and yet they seem to have been ignored by the Government in the introduction of this Bill. It brings me a grave sense of concern and a grave sense of sadness that government members can trample over the rights of ordinary Australians, with not even a sense of remorse or with an apology, but with a smile on their faces. I look over and I see Senator Bolkus grinning from ear to ear. I just think about the poor ordinary Australians who will lose out through the adoption of this Bill. It brings me a grave sense of concern that the Government should have so little respect for ordinary Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course there is no point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. Of course there is no substance to what Senator Bolkus said. It was merely a cynical attempt by Senator Bolkus to justify the behaviour of this Government, a cynical attempt to justify its lack of concern for the rights of ordinary Australians. It shows the same contempt for Standing Orders that this Government has shown for Australian workers. That is yet another vindication of what we on this side of the chamber have been saying all along through this debate that this Bill is wholly unsatisfactory for Australian workers, for the Australian economy and for the future of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us return to the provisions of this Bill relating to the forced amalgamation of unions. We have to ask ourselves what will happen to the members of the organisations that this Government hopes, implicitly, through the provisions of this Bill, will be deregistered? What will happen to those people? To start with, unless they join one of the mega-unions-and we have to assume that they do not belong to a mega-union for one very good reason: they do not believe that a mega-union can represent their interests fairly and squarely-they cease to be a member of an organisation within the meaning of the Act. If they cease to be a member of an organisation, they lose the possible right to the preferences given to members of an organisation under clause 11. Therefore, if people belong to a union and that union is deregistered, they will lose the potential right to engagement in employment, promotion, regrading, transfer, retention in employment, taking of annual leave, overtime and vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will take those rights away from all Australians in small unions unless they back down and say, 'Yes, we give in; we will join your mega-union'. The reason that those people do not want to belong to a mega-union in the first place is that they recognise that, as small cogs in a very large machine, they have very little importance at all to the union leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that not even the national interest but the public interest is being used to justify the loss of the personal rights of Australians that are being guaranteed in many other countries through international charters. Yet this Bill floats through this chamber and through this Parliament with a lack of concern and without any fanfare on the part of the Government. I suppose that, if I were in the Government and introducing this Bill, I would not be heralding its introduction into this Parliament with any great fanfare either because it is very clear that there is not a lot of good news in it for many ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly the consequence of this Bill, increasingly the consequence of the forced amalgamation of small unions into mega-unions, will be a continued decline in union membership. I predict that increasingly there will be a sense of dissatisfaction with those big unions amongst ordinary Australians. Their members will try to vote with their feet. But we have already seen that the provisions of clause 11 of this Bill will penalise them for doing so and penalise them most unfairly. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of the process by which the unions will amalgamate? What of the process by which the members of those unions will be asked to decide whether to agree to the amalgamation? One of the provisions of this Bill that Senator Chapman so astutely pointed out a few moments ago is that there is a provision to avoid a secret postal ballot. Let me draw the attention of the chamber to a number of other provisions relating to the process of amalgamation that alarm me greatly as a person who is interested in civil liberty, freedom and the right of association. I refer the chamber to the amended section 237(1) of the Bill, which will provide for an existing organisation to use its financial and other resources in support of the proposed principal amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, all the odds are stacked in favour of the mega-unions. All of the resources of the union will be available to the union leaders to put their case. What of the people in a union who do not agree? They might in fact be the majority. Do they have any access under this Bill to the resources of a union-their union-to fight the case for amalgamation? Do they have the right to draw on those resources and say, 'No, we don't want to become a member of a mega-union'? The answer is very clear: the answer is no. This Bill denies to them the right to use the resources of a union to oppose an amalgamation. All the odds are working in one way. All the odds are in favour of only one side of the case and not both. That brings me a sense of despair. That would not be inconsistent with other provisions of the proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations Bill. For example, proposed section 242(3) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>...that an outline in no more than 3,000 words must provide sufficient information on the scheme to enable members of the existing organisations to make informed decisions in relation to this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>But there is no provision in that subsection for the information to be true and correct. People can be provided with information but, if it is not true information and if it is not correct information, they do not have a snowball's chance in hell of making a right decision. Yes, they will make a decision but not necessarily the right decision, nor will it necessarily be the decision in their best interests. There is no provision for truth or correctness in this Bill, just as there is no moral truth or correctness in what the Government wishes to do by the introduction of this Bill. That is why I believe the Senate must reject the motion for the second reading of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we have seen a move by the Government to extend the preference provisions for unions and, therefore, deny rights to people who are not members of unions. We have seen how the Government will brutally force the amalgamation of small unions and take away from ordinary Australians the right to determine who will represent them in the workplace and the right to freedom of association. Gone forever with this Bill will be the right of Australians to have enterprise unions. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Queenslander I took great pride and satisfaction in participating in the formation of watershed industrial relations laws in this country under the previous Queensland Government. These laws were embraced wholeheartedly by numerous enterprises throughout our State, ranging from Metway Bank Ltd, to Power Brewing, to the South East Queensland Electricity Board workers. I am greatly dismayed to see the industrial relations laws of this country going backwards at a time when they should be going forwards to give people more freedom, more rights and more opportunity and, most importantly, to give ordinary workers a greater sense of satisfaction in their jobs. This is what is being lost through the introduction of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear that the people who received voluntary employment agreements in Queensland-the people at Power Brewing, the people at Metway, the people in 25 organisations across my State-were very happy with the right to form their own union. But under this Bill they will not have that right at all because unless they make 20,000 in number they do not make the grade. That is unsatisfactory to me and I know it is unsatisfactory to many ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As we go into the last years of this century and enter the first couple of years of the next century, we should be looking for industrial relations laws that really address the question of efficiency, that really address the question of the satisfaction of workers with their jobs and that really address the question of how secure and comfortable people feel with the representation that they have in the workplace. Yet, as I have said, we have seen this Bill being introduced into this Parliament-a Bill which will turn back the clock on individual freedom, a Bill which will turn back the clock on reform of the labour market, a Bill which will turn back the clock once and for all on the opportunities of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House have brought before this chamber overwhelming arguments as to why this Bill should be rejected. If it transpires that the Australian Democrats, combining with the Government to do some dirty, shady deal behind the backs of the Australian people, put this Bill through with amendments so that, instead of having 20,000 members a union has to have only 10,000, I hope and trust that the Australian people, the ordinary workers of this country, will remember who did the dirty deed to them. I hope that they will remember that this Government and the Democrats took away their right to freedom of association and took away their opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons we oppose this Bill; for those reasons the Australian population will oppose this law; and for those reasons I believe that this Bill is a gross contravention of the rights of ordinary Australian workers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we find the Government kowtowing to the unions. We have the spectacle of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) saying to Bill Kelty, `I will jump, but just how high do you want me to jump?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has responded to the direction of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in a number of ways. The purpose of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 is to implement the ACTU's agenda. It does it in a number of ways: firstly, by reducing the number of trade unions from about 326, which we have in Australia at present, to about 20 industry-based unions; secondly, by strengthening the ACTU by forcing, through legislation, the Industrial Relations Commission to consider consulting with the ACTU and employer councils prior to exercising its powers in relation to demarcation disputes; thirdly, by strengthening the union preference provision; and, fourthly, by providing an exemption from secret postal ballots. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with these points one at a time. The first is the decision to increase the minimum membership of unions from 1,000 to 20,000. As I said, the aim is to end up with 20 industry unions. This obviously discourages the formulation of small enterprise-based unions-unions which can easily negotiate with their employer for better pay and conditions in return for greater productivity. These individual agreements would not flow on to other enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give one example. Honourable senators will remember how efficient individual negotiations can be. I would like to talk about Mudginberri. The 27 employees of Mr Pendarvis at an abattoir in the Northern Territory were delighted with his offer of better pay for greater productivity. They accepted these contract rates. Rather than being inhibited by the limit imposed by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) on the number of beasts they could kill in a day, he told them that if they killed more beasts than the unions allowed them to, he would pay them greater wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The immediate result of that employer-employee negotiation was that both parties were delighted. The men received more money and the employer had greater productivity. The employer had greater export markets and Australia benefited from those overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that is where the happy story ended because then the AMIEU, backed by the Government and the ACTU, set up a picket line and stopped those enterprise agreements. Indeed, the Government's own inspector refused to cross the picket line and he was backed by the Minister of the day. Consequently, that enterprise lost its exports and even though it won a court case, the company finally went broke. Once again, Australia lost precious overseas markets-a situation very common with this Government. The Government was assisted in that by the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, at the moment we have one Government senator in the chamber. The Minister for Industrial Relations is not here to take his Bill; indeed, no Minister is present. The Government is so sure of the support of the Australian Democrats that it is treating this Senate with absolute disdain. The Minister does not believe that he should be here taking his own legislation. He passes the responsibility on to Senator Bolkus, of all people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, a new senator from Tasmania, is interjecting. Honourable senators will remember that in his maiden speech he said that the Australian Labor Party believes in democracy. I will come to that in just a few minutes. If any piece of legislation that the Government could put up would make it clear that the Government does not believe in democracy, then it is certainly this one. I wish to quote from an article written by Joe Thompson, a former Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union, headed, 'The ACTU's Grab for Power'. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst on the surface a proposal to reduce the number of unions seems sensible and appropriate, a closer look reveals the potential for unions, organized largely on political lines and no likely reduction in demarcation and membership disputes. The net result could well be to give the ACTU greater power to pursue whatever political objectives its Executive decided upon-and an increased potential for large-scale disputes based on such objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> A recent ballot for amalgamation of the membership of the Building Workers' Industrial Union (BWIU) and the Federated Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Association (FEDFA) narrowly overturned the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The name planned for the union was 'The Construction, Mining and Energy Workers' Union.' Foundation of such a union would have opened the way for a national union crossing the whole broad spectrum of industry, including not only building and construction, but mining and extraction, power generation, and coal loaders as well as the operation of all types of cranes, including overhead cranes and all forms of mobile equipment. It was intended that, following the amalgamation of the BWIU and FEDFA, there would then be an amalgamation with the Miners' Federation and the Timber Workers' Union. In short, one union would have had the potential to institute stoppages extending far beyond the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This would have meant that the whole nation could have been halted by an executive decision to close down our power stations; or our coal exports could have been halted by closing off all our coal-loaders. These are only some of the things which could have occurred with an amalgamation of this type. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Joe Thompson, former Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union, had to say on the matter. His main comment was:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless steps are taken to control this power we could find ourselves in a situation of being controlled nationally by a handful of union executives. </PARA>

I do not think Senator Sherry would have any idea of what Joe Thompson's experience is all about. The flow-on from an award from such a union as Joe Thompson was talking about would make the mind boggle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now move to the second purpose of the Bill-the strength of the ACTU. Apart from the creation of large militant unions under this Bill, the Commissioner would be forced by this legislation to consult with the ACTU. The legislation actually says, 'consider consulting' but the pressure on the Commission resulting from the inclusion of this clause is considerable. If, during consultation between the Commissioner and the ACTU, the unions assure the Commissioner that there will be an all-out strike if they do not get their way, what sort of pressure will that put on the Commissioner to change his opinion? The employers are meant to be consulted too, but they do not take strike action. The ACTU can put considerable pressure on the Commissioner. Why should an independent Commissioner be forced to consult with the ACTU or, indeed, with anyone? If he wants to he can; he has always been able to. The ACTU is running scared. Its membership is falling away rapidly. It now represents only 41 per cent of the work force, and 34 per cent of the private sector. No wonder it is telling the Government to jump. This legislation, in conjunction with closed shop unions and compulsory unionism-'No union ticket no job'-leaves people without a choice as to whether to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a senator in this place saying that the Labor Party believes in democracy! He is a very new senator and he will learn that, unfortunately, his Party does not believe in democracy; there is no such thing on his side of the chamber as real democracy. There is no such thing on his side of the chamber as saying to a man, 'If you don't want to join an association you will not be compelled to'. What honourable senators opposite say is, 'No union ticket, no job, mate'. That is not democracy as seen from the this side of the House; it is democracy as seen from the Government benches and no more. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy is not to have compulsory unionism: if a man wants to join a union, he is entitled to do so. If he does not want to join a union, then he is quite entitled not to join. We see that as democracy. To further strengthen the union, preference provisions have not been identified in clause 11. I will now quote clause 11 because I think it is an important section in the Bill. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The following matters are examples of the matters in relation to which it may be directed under subsection (1) that preference is to be given:</PARA>
<PARA>The first is engagement in employment. It is very clearly set out that preference will be given to union members only: no ticket, no job. The next one is promotion. That can also be used. If one is not a union member there is no need to look for promotion, because it will be denied. The next is regrading: `You do what you are told. You stay where you are. There is no regrading unless you are a union member'. Next is transfers. There are no transfers available to non-union members. The next matter is retention in employment: `You will be the first to get the sack if you are not a union member'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Faulkner interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice Senator Faulkner over there saying, `Hear, hear'. The next matter is the taking of annual leave: `No annual leave', or `You will take it when we tell you, if you are not a union member'. Overtime: `You, mate, do not get overtime. You are not a union member'. Vocational training: `You do not get it if you are not a union member'. They are only examples. The mind boggles at what else the Government can include if it so chooses. Those are only the examples that are given for union preference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having preference provisions is totally opposed to civil liberties of any Australian. It is totally opposed to democracy. It is totally opposed to the way this side of the Parliament is interested in running the country. Yet this Government keeps telling us that it believes in individual rights. </PARA>
<PARA> We who have been here in the Senate longer than Senator Sherry have dealt already with the Australian Bill of Rights and with the Australia Card-with all of those matters that this Government has attempted-and we have been able to knock them out. Apart from freedom of choice being infringed, this clause will not create productivity, efficiency or any incentive for the Australian employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, clause 15 abolishes the existence of amalgamation provisions. I consider one of those provisions to be very important. It requires a secret postal ballot for all members of the unions intending to amalgamate. The Government has abolished all the previous amalgamation clauses and put in a lot of new ones. But the one it has altered is the requirement for a secret postal ballot. It means that one can apply for an exemption. Why has the Government done this? It is because until now the provision of a compulsory secret postal ballot has meant that the amalgamations have not gone on. As Joe Thompson said, a very large amalgamation between the builders and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association was defeated. Having a requirement for a true democratic vote has not worked. The amalgamations have not occurred. This Government has been trying, since it first came into power, to amalgamate the unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Party Government brought in the secret postal ballot. It is the only way to go, the only true democratic form. The Government cannot get through its amalgamation agenda under that system. It just cannot do it. The membership does not want it and keeps voting it out. Every time the members are given a secret postal ballot, they vote it out. So what has the Government done? It has said, `It is easy; we will do away with that democratic choice. We will make it possible to have an exemption'. The exemption entitles the membership-because the Government does not want to appear too draconian-to have a secret ballot at a duly constituted meeting of the membership. We all know what those duly constituted meetings are like: the intimidation of members, the strong- arm tactics to prevent members attending. We have seen it so often over the years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this evening the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, which can be easily described as the Bill by which the Government seeks to ensure that, yes, there are fewer unions, but bigger unions-20,000 being the minimum membership of unions, with some minor exemptions. I want to speak against that proposal on the basis that the Government's emphasis is in the wrong direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will paraphrase some words of a former Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. He made the remark that only 32 per cent of private sector employees in Australia belonged to unions. He thought that fact should be borne in mind by `those who believe that the sine qua non of better industrial relations is a tidier and more convenient institutional framework for the peak councils of unions and employers and the Federal Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that that is what this Government believes-that a better industrial relations system is achieved by having a tidier and more convenient institutional framework for peak councils of unions, employers and the Federal Government. There is not much space in there for union members. It is not more convenient for them to be part of a union of 20,000 members. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no surprise to women, in particular, that unions have been losing favour in the community. Their membership proportionally is dropping. It is a matter of particular interest that in 1976 just under 44 per cent of women were in the labour force. Now, as we all know, the figure is up over 51 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the participation of women in that time-between 1976 and 1989-has soared, one might say. But when one looks at female union members as a proportion of the labour force, one finds that it was around 38 per cent in 1976 and has declined to about 36 per cent. While more women are rushing into the work force, they are not rushing into union membership, and that is because the unions have not been delivering. They have been so concerned with their own internal power plays, and doing things other than representing the best interests of the person on the shop floor, that the person on the shop floor has said, `Look, Jack, you can go somewhere else. I am not joining if I can possibly avoid it'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of regret to me that a large number of people cannot get a job unless they join a union. If it were the case that we had true voluntary association, one could choose whether one wanted to join or not and still get a job on a building site-for example, in Adelaide where as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, will know well, there are plenty of signs up saying, `No ticket, no job'. Unions cannot be proud of the membership they have at the moment. A good proportion of it they have only because people need to survive.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the first point I want to make: the Government has got it wrong. If the Government is hoping that streamlining union membership-shoving people into bigger unions-is going to be a good thing, I think it is mistaken. Yes, it will make it easier for the Government to negotiate with the peak employer groups and unions, and for those two groups to negotiate with the Government, but it has left out the little bloke-the employee-whom they are meant to be representing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party now seems, in one respect at least, to have come round to the views that have been put by this Opposition for a long time. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may well remember that when the coalition's industrial relations policy was bandied about as being a potential disaster, enterprise agreements were a bad thing, and we did not want to go to them, we wanted to go to bigger unions for ease of negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see that in 1984 Senator Button said as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's policy will have the effect of weakening the role of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and encouraging decentralised bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason it is interesting that he said that in 1984 is that what the Government would have us believe now is that it can have it both ways; it can move towards these bigger unions with a 20,000 membership and still, in some way, cater for decentralised bargaining enterprise agreements in some form. In other words, the Government wants to have it both ways, and it just cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Ralph Willis, in referring to Mr Howard, said:</PARA>
<PARA>He has publicly said that he sees industrial relations as the `new economic battleground' and has a vision of thousands of Mudginberris around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians don't want these policies. Employers don't want them. Unions don't want them. Clearly, his--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Howard's--</PARA>
<PARA>own party doesn't want them either. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be a good thing if we had thousands of Mudginberris around the country. If the people on the shop floor took the power they have got into their own hands and said to their unions, `You are simply not representing us in the way we want', if people could negotiate directly with their employers, that would be a good thing, and I would be happy to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said of the Government's industrial relations approach that the hallmark of it had been `to seek outcomes which, while preserving equity, deliver the maximum feasible restraint in average outcomes for labour costs. And, as the evidence which I have presented clearly shows, our approach has been highly successful'. One could stop there, but he goes on to say, `It is understood that this may, at times, be at the cost of a degree of flexibility'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the whole point. Up until about 18 months ago Labor has always criticised the coalition's policy to move towards enterprise bargaining. We agree that it would be better for employers to deal with one union, but what we say is that it need not be a 20,000-strong union, it can be a union for that particular workplace or company. That would clearly be in the better interests of the employers and employees together. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Labor has now come around. We find in 1989 Senator Button saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I agree absolutely that the more we can introduce flexibility into the wages system and the more we can have industry and enterprise level negotiations on wages and other matters, the better the system will be. </PARA>
<PARA>I could give other examples of Labor's pretty rapid road to Damascus. Some time between 1985 and now Labor purports to have discovered the value of enterprise based agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the face of those words, the Government still presents the Senate with a Bill to limit the size of unions to a minimum of 20,000 and the interrelationship between those two sets of phrases that are trotted out by Government members has yet to be adequately explained. What I want to do is move on and explain why I think enterprise unions are better, why I think industrial relations are better when they can be conducted on a one to one basis rather than by huge, super unions that do not necessarily represent the interests of the workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear that I am not alone in this. The Federated Clerks Union of Australia, in its most recent publication, describes industry unions as a flop and it says that industry unions, where they have existed, have generally failed to organise white collar clerical and other employees, whose wages and conditions have fallen behind. The union says that, as a minority of employees in a company, white collar workers suffer neglect of their conditions where production workers dominate industry unions and it goes on to give examples of countries that have moved towards industry based unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just select Sweden as one. The union says that, with 25 industry-type unions, Sweden is often held up as a model for Australians to follow. But Sweden's industrial production is right down to minus 3.3 and its inflation rate of 10.2 is the highest of the 13 developed countries. But, looking to what other people do is not sufficient reason or rationale to decide what we should do. I would like to turn to the following statement in the Business Council Bulletin of June 1990, where the Council said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the great global battles-Apple versus IBM, Coke versus Pepsi, Bond Brewing versus Fosters --</PARA>
<PARA>This might now perhaps be a little bit out of date. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Wool Growers versus Dupont Synthetics, Honda versus General Motors, McDonalds versus Burger King, Caterpillar versus Komatsu-the winner is not defined by country, industry or craft. The winner is the enterprise or set of enterprises best able to compete in world markets. </PARA>
<PARA>Those examples make it abundantly clear that a union that covers McDonalds and Burger King together is not going to be much help to McDonalds and Burger King competing against each other or competing internationally. But a union that is for McDonalds, where the McDonald workers can have their say, and another union that is for Burger King, where the workers for Burger King can have their say, and perhaps have some real contribution to make as to how the two compete, is a very sensible union. The future of the bloke who works for McDonalds depends on McDonalds doing a better job than Burger King. So why would we want to force him into a union that represents both?</PARA>
<PARA> That just seems sensible. As the Business Council said, the great global battles are fought on the basis of an enterprise or a group of enterprises not on an industry basis. We do not have computer unions having some reason to do a better job than say soft drink unions. That is absolutely ridiculous. Senators have to understand that the competition is at the product level, the enterprise level, enterprise to enterprise or group of enterprises to group of enterprises, and this suggestion that we are debating tonight flies totally in the face of that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the Business Council that has this view. Power Brewing has effectively implemented what the voluntary employment agreements in Queensland would otherwise have done. An article in the Weekend Australian of 4-5 August this year, read:</PARA>
<PARA>In effect, Power is seeking to achieve the same result as the VEA-the exclusion of the influence of the Federated Liquor and Allied Trades Union from its Yatala brewery and 124 employees --</PARA>
<PARA>Now, why would that be the case? Why would the employees be happy to get rid of their union? It can only be because the union has been slack on the job. The union has not been representing the employees. It has been all about getting itself more membership and about factional battles within the Australian Council of Trade Unions, not about representing the workers. That is why we have the Mudginberri and Power Brewing cases and others. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a particular example I want to raise tonight and you, Mr Acting Deputy President coming from South Australia, will no doubt be familiar with this example of a firm called Safries in the south east. It is a firm that makes chip potatoes-not crisp ones-potatoes that are cut up and sent off to fish and chip shops where they are heated up. The Adelaide Advertiser of 31 May 1990 reported:</PARA>
<PARA>A group of 27 women and three men employed by a South-East food company have ditched their union and negotiated one of the State's first shop-floor industrial agreements. And according to the management of the Safries potato processing plant, in Millicent, the women are teaching their bosses a thing or two about industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Why? Because the bosses are listening to what the shop floor has to say. These people down at Safries could not give a hoot what the guy at the top of some union with 20,000 members thinks, and the reason they could not give a hoot about what he thinks is that they are pretty sure that he does not give a hoot about what they think. He does not know about their problems down in the south east and the problems that are associated with their particular enterprise at all. This enterprise agreement has turned into an absolute boon. Later in the article the employees are reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>Before all this happened we just clocked on and clocked off and went home and didn't think anything about the company. </PARA>
<PARA>But now they have an interest and they have an opportunity to have some say and control their lives in a way that the particular union was never going to let them do and surely that they would not have a chance of doing if the union became a strong 20,000 member union. What the women have to say about the Food Preservers Union, which was trying to negotiate an agreement-this is the union that was ditched by them-is this:</PARA>
<PARA>They came to Millicent, signed most of the workers up, but we never had a say in what was happening about our wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>That pretty well says it all. That is why enterprise based agreements are better. When someone else comes in from outside, that person does not have the interests of the members at heart and does not understand how the enterprise is working. All that union representative is on about is building the union's bureaucracy. What we are seeing now is the unions trying to place the protection of their own power above the interests of workers and above that of the economy. We should very strongly resist such a move. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, can I return to my first point-the remarks that Mr Howard made some time ago. What he said was that the sine qua non of industrial relations is not having a tidier system so that big business can negotiate with big unions, and that will be all very convenient for the Federal Government. Yes, that might be a tidier system and it might look a cleaner system, but it is not one in which workers have a greater say over their daily lives. Therefore it is not a system that I can advocate as being one that is a positive reform at all. Quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Labor Party should, I think, take the opportunity in their future speeches to explain exactly how they see that enterprise agreements, which they frequently mouth on the radio as being something that they want to move towards, will interplay with this arrangement that they are putting forward. I know that in the Industrial Relations Bill they have an opportunity for employers who want to opt out to do so, but that is very small cheese compared to what the coalition is talking about-all workers having a say directly in how their wages, conditions and other benefits are worked out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. Once again, whenever this Hawke Labor Government brings forward industrial relations legislation to the Parliament we see the actions of the Labor Government running true to form. Whatever specious comments are made by Ministers as to the greater efficiency of the industrial relations structures, the fact remains that the substance is always legislation that first and foremost suits their political minders, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What did we have in 1987 but legislation that was so blatantly sectional, seeking to deprive the victims of union action of their common law rights, that this Government was forced to drop it in the trash can in order to survive the 1987 election. In 1988 the industrial relations legislation that was passed may not have dared to set unions above the law, but it was certainly a self-serving exercise that was aimed at easier amalgamations, just as the ACTU wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have the Government coming back for another bite at the amalgamation cherry, in what will mean a strengthening of those bureaucratic forces on the industrial relations scene that will retard the development of enterprise-based and productive arrangements. That is a very sad day for Australia because from here on in we go backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has made predictable remarks about greater efficiency and a supposed enterprise orientation of these changes in outlining the fact that about 100 of the current 149 federally registered unions either will disappear or will exist at the discretion of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is freely admitted that the onus will be on these smaller unions to justify their existence. Thus, the principle of freedom of association is crudely discounted by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This is exactly where there is so firm a policy difference between the Hawke Labor Government and the Australian Democrats who accept the same principle against the coalition. I am proud to uphold the principle of freedom of association for employees, whether to belong to any union, to decide which union may best represent them, or to form their own union. That is where the Government and the Democrats combine and will never ever have the same attitude as the coalition. I am most disturbed to think that the Democrats on this occasion are yet again siding with the Government to bring about the demise of what we see as the ultimate goal for the employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not fall into the trap set by this Government and confuse the wholly desirable formation of enterprise unions with the encouragement of amalgamations by this kind of coercive legislation. Amalgamations are not about efficiency or better industrial relations. They are simply about power, and we should not forget what this is all about. The ACTU wants more power and the Government is seeking to give it to that body. </PARA>
<PARA> This is exactly what Mr Kelty told us in 1987 in his paper Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement. He made it clear then that the ACTU objective was not the formation of industry unions but `the unionisation of all employees in a company'. With only 32 per cent of all private sector employees currently unionised, we can appreciate his even greater sense of priority today. I again quote Mr Kelty:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to unionise not just part of the company but all of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the motive of the ACTU in requiring this Labor Government to bring forward this Bill, and one should never forget it. Its desire is just simply not negotiable. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU in 1987 spelt out its objective of just 20 unions and made it equally plain that productive efficiency was not the motivation. What Mr Kelty wants is greater control, not even by union officials as a whole but ultimately by the ACTU leadership and its bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelty in recent years has sniffed the wind overseas where better skilled and better paid workers are finding unions irrelevant and has sounded the warning that once unionisation falls to 20 to 25 per cent of the work force the influence of unions in national power structures passes the point of no return. Quite deliberately, therefore, he has sought to consolidate and institutionalise union power in Australia, with the key players of the ACTU setting the agenda for the handful of massive unions through control of such paid positions as secretary, research and education officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Consolidation of large unions is a sure means of entrenching existing holders of power, as it becomes extremely difficult for an effective challenge to be mounted against office-holders. The cost, for example, of sending just one circular to a membership of 100,000 would effectively start at $60,000. A number of smaller unions under the control of politically inconvenient moderates would, of course, disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation with its objective of forcing amalgamations, far from moving towards an enterprise approach, is a recipe for less control and influence by the rank and file. We can be sure, however, that the ACTU objectives that I have outlined are being concealed from the membership whose choices will be limited if the Bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, if passed, will make impossible the already difficult task of establishing new unions when existing bodies, through their political stance, may be anathema to prospective members, or when workers see a need to form a genuine enterprise union at grass roots level. Existing industrial relations bureaucracy has already prevented the formation of an alternative union for teachers. Now we have a Bill before the Senate that will make a further mockery of article 2 of the International Labour Organisation that supposedly enshrines the right of workers to join organisations of their own choosing. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago when the Senate last debated a major change to industrial law, the Democrats shied away from an arbitrary minimum size of 3,000 that was then proposed by this Government and joined the coalition in forcing it down to 1,000. Today, it is a different story. Clauses 12 and 14 of this Bill seek to raise the minimum to 20,000 and, predictably, the Democrats tell us that a figure of 10,000 has become acceptable. What a conversion! Once again, it is thunderously apparent that the Democrats have no understanding either of industrial realities or of any principles. </PARA>
<PARA> All this Labor Government needs to do is to take a ball park figure and the Democrats will fall into line with an acceptable compromise. They do it all the time, we have got used to it but on this occasion it is particularly sad. Can we ask the Democrats why industrial realities have changed so much in two years that a 1,000 minimum, which was acceptable two years ago, should be raised tenfold today? They would not be able to answer because they do not know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose, Senator Macdonald, that is right. A few extra trips overseas would be very handy. Of course, the Democrats always want extra staff. They grizzle and complain that they have not enough staff. But they have more extra staff than one can poke a stick at and they still cannot do the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A minimum size of 10,000 will eliminate some 90 of the 149 unions to which I referred earlier. The Government's limit of 20,000 would eliminate a further 12. Halving the figure does not, therefore, make a great deal of practical difference. But the Government and the Democrats have seen fit to hold hands yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the proponents of this Bill to justify it on the grounds that existing legislation makes amalgamation difficult when such is the wish of the membership. I challenge them to tell us just where the present system is thwarting genuine rationalisation of union coverage that this Bill will rectify. The facts are that amalgamations can take place under the existing rules and they do already. Nor are unions prevented from coming to agreements to secure rationalisation of coverage at particular plants with 12 different unions, for example, clearing out of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and leaving four. </PARA>
<PARA> What is a fact under this Bill is that the kind of rationalisation of which the ACTU does not approve will in fact be prevented. Single enterprise agreements, notably by the ironworkers, have been concluded successfully through existing section 118 of the Act. Thus the Full Bench of the Commission ratified the Southern Aluminium agreement of Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia coverage of a new site to the exclusion of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and the Electrical Trades Union of Australia in December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the kind of decision that does seek to eliminate demarcation disputes and may even point the way to the `single union no strike' deals that have been concluded in Britain by the forward thinking electricians union, much to the ire of Neanderthal union bureaucrats, I might add. It is equally clear that this is not what the ACTU wants. If ever there was any doubt as to the retrograde nature of this Bill, it is the new requirement that in approving such agreements the Australian Industrial Relations Commission shall, under section 118, consult the peak union councils. In simple terms, the ACTU will get the power of veto. That is what it wants. That is its whole aim and objective in this exercise and one must not forget it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has no concern whatsoever to promote enterprise agreements or single union coverage when it deliberately gives its ACTU paymasters the power to thwart such agreements. Moreover, the coalition is equally opposed to the strengthening under this Bill of preference clauses or the reduction of the need for postal balloting. Both of these are actions that impinge further on freedom of individual choice and erode freedom from possible intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sherry launched the most unbelievable first speech this afternoon. He said that only the Australian Labor Party stands for democracy. Yet it is the Labor Party that seeks to remove the right of secret postal ballots by unionists. That is some strange frame of democracy. Yet Labor members say they are the only ones who believe in it. Both these actions proposed in the Bill have nothing to do with the interests of unionists but everything to do with the conveniences of the big unions and, of course, the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever a Labor government presents legislation to achieve ACTU-driven mergers we are told that the legislation will make life easier for business in eliminating demarcation disputes. This is simply a massive red herring. We know it, and I am sure the Government and the Democrats know it. The sad reality is that we are the only ones to admit to it and to talk about it. This Bill in no way alters the system of craft unions to replace them with industry unions, the only sure means of tackling this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government was determined to have good unionism here, it would take a trip to Japan for example and look at the system the Japanese have with unions. It would have a look at how few strikes they have. Senator Sherry has the gall to shake his head. I bet he has never even been to Japan to look at the union set-up there. He should go and ask the major corporations when they had their last strike. They would not believe that he could even ask such a question. But that depicts this Government's mentality-its lack of understanding about unionism, industrial relations and how the system can work to the benefit of this country. The one thing that we learnt from Senator Sherry this afternoon was that he does not know what he purports to be here for and that is rather sad. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive that Australia's employer organisations are not fooled by this grubby exercise in entrenching union bureaucracies. In July the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) stated firmly that what employers want are industry and enterprise unions, and that union size is irrelevant in achieving this goal. And what does the Government do? It dishes up this piece of legislation. The CAI has rightly accused the Hawke Labor Government of pursuing the wrong end for the wrong reasons, moving from what was a minimum membership requirement of 100 prior to 1988 to a possibility of 20,000. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to have improved productivity, there must be scope for single union agreements of the kind that exist in Britain. This will not be brought about by amalgamations, and true restructuring on enterprise lines may well result in the formation of smaller unions. The adoption of size as the criterion for viability shows up the limitations of the thinking of this Government and its masters, the ACTU. It is the CAI rather than the ACTU that is upholding the principle that trade unions are associations of employees; employees should have the right to control their structures and future. This is a right that the Bill will erode and business efficiency will not be the winner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia is described as the voice of the major corporations which might be thought to favour amalgamations, but in May the Business Council bulletin politely knocked the legs from under the Government's case. But did the Government take any notice of that? Of course not. The only people who it takes any notice of are members of the ACTU. The point was made that the existence of small unions is not the main element of the bargaining union problem. The problem, as the coalition has stated so often, is the system of craft unions and the award structure that has been created to serve their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pointed out that amalgamations as sought by this Bill will not change the fact that of the 12 unions that predominate in Business Council companies, nine or 10 would remain. Their membership has an average coverage per plant ranging from 5 to 53 per cent, a very long way short of the single union ideal. The simple fact is stated that these moves are not designed to create industry unions but that factional and political allegiance appear likely to be at least as important determinants of amalgamations as industry compatibility. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation cannot alter the fact that craft unions have spread their membership over thousands of workplaces and the consequences will remain. The Government and the ACTU by their actions are not committed to a workplace approach and the potential for demarcation disputes will unquestionably remain while there is an average of five unions per workplace and of 11 in larger plants. The Government is happy with that. Yet it knows that a totally different system works better and more successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> A slight reduction in this average is not going to create the enterprise focus that is essential for better industrial relations and competitive industries. In the name of greater flexibility, this Bill will create self-interested, inflexible cartels that will act as a barrier to sensible agreements between management and employees or intelligent union leaders and to the formation of genuine enterprise unions. These are the objectives to which the coalition stands committed and more Australians are realising that this is the only sensible policy for the future. But in this piece of legislation we are quite clearly going backwards and we should not forget that it is quite willingly supported by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is the result of the failure of contemporary Australian unionism to make itself relevant to today's work force and Mr Kelty has revealed why it is so important for the ACTU to consolidate its power. The statistics show that between 1976 and 1988 trade union membership of Australian employees fell from 51 per cent to 42 per cent. Within the private sector that has to provide the engines of growth for the national economy, unionisation has fallen in the six years from 1982 to 1988 from 39 per cent to 32 per cent compared with a fall from 73 per cent to 68 per cent in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> ACTU apparatchiks, such as Mr Kelty, cannot speak for the Australian work force, least of all for the majority of employees involved in earning the export dollars that keep this country afloat. Therefore, in my opinion it is a scandal that this Labor Government, with the collusion of the Democrats, is set to enshrine ACTU dominance over the unions when members of the work force are voting with their feet against this approach. The Government that purports to represent the working class and the workers yet fraternises with the Sir Peter Abeles of this world and all the big businessmen around the country could not give a continental about what is really going to affect the workers out there. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between the coalition policy and that of its Labor and Democrats opponents is the difference between institutionalising the dominance of craft unions and opening up the prospect of enterprise unions. It is the difference between increasing the power of a handful of ACTU power brokers and providing free choice and freedom of association to the employees. It is the difference between rigidity and flexibility, and I have no doubt as to which approach is best for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will fight this vigorously both within this Parliament and outside in the public arena, because the people of Australia need to know what this Government is doing to this country. They know that we are already going down the mine shaft with a tail wind, and this will help it go further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I urge the Government and the Australian Democrats to seriously consider the results of the proposals set out in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and take heed of the warnings that my colleagues have so clearly and forcefully put in this debate so far. In particular, I urge the Government to rethink the plans to increase the membership threshold for registration of unions from 1,000 to 20,000 members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government in Queensland has taken a number of decisions which, along with the proposals that we are now considering, have set the genuine union movement back many years. The Cooke Inquiry into union corruption and the Goss Government's repeal of voluntary employment agreements (VEAs) are two matters of significant concern to the real interests of workers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill says, `We want big unions and fewer unions, and we do not want them to be inconvenienced by such things as secret ballots for all members on such pithy issues as amalgamation or where the union's money should be going'. What happens when we have big unions and less accountability? The consequences of this are only too clear to those of us from Queensland. What we have seen in Queensland is an ALP State Vice-President, Ken Goodhew, and his mates, abuse their position on the executive of the Federated Engine Drivers Association of Australasia. We have seen slush funds used to buy Gold Coast apartments and to pay for prostitutes-a misappropriation of union members' funds to an extent that is almost unimaginable. In the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia, mismanagement amounted to more than $1m unaccounted for as well as consistent evidence of ballots being rorted. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not really matter who the unions donated their money to if it were done with the consent of their members, but when a union donates the funds of its members-as we have seen the liquor trades union do-to the election campaigns of two Labor Ministers in Queensland, Bob Gibbs and Anne Warner, without so much as even notifying their membership let alone giving them a say in it, then that union is no longer performing its rightful duty, which is to look after the conditions of its members in the workplace. These things are on the record and I suggest that the Cooke Inquiry has merely scratched the surface of some of the rorts and frauds that have gone on in the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Cooke Inquiry is permitted to continue by the ALP Government in Queensland, there is little doubt that further revelations will come out which will do irreparable damage to the increasingly fragile credibility of a party, the ALP, that shot to power in Queensland on a platform of honesty and accountability. The things that I have mentioned here are just a hint of what happens when officers of a big union are given too much free rein. </PARA>
<PARA> Many factors are responsible for the rise of these problems, and I shall identify just a couple of them. The biggest seem to be those factors which result from the size of the union. The bigger the union, the easier it is to get away with irresponsible conduct, and the easier it is to avoid any of one's members knowing anything about it. In a larger union the average member has far less contact with office-bearers and less efficient representation by the union on his or her behalf in the workplace. Second, of course, is the accountability issue and the very concerning absence of secret ballots on decisions so important as the donation of union funds to political parties. There is also the factor of size and accountability that makes the unions neglect their real duties in preference for spending time and money pursuing internal left versus right factional battles. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill fails to address the problems which are rife in unions all over the country. In fact, they go a long way to encouraging a climate where union corruption can flourish. As Senator Harradine pointed out in a recent press release, this Bill will force some 632,000 workers, or 18.6 per cent of the total membership, out of their unions and into another union- a larger union which will almost certainly understand the needs of these new members less than the smaller enterprise-based unions did. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party is not anti-union: we want more unions. We want unions-be they of 50 members or 25,000 members-that are enterprise-based unions more concerned about the working conditions and particular needs of their members than about wasting resources on factional battles and power broking. We want unions to take the lead in the search for productivity gains that benefit the employee and the employer. The Federal Government should take a good hard look at the results of the policy decisions which the Queensland Government has recently made. Instead of encouraging productivity gains and enterprise-based agreements, which have benefited the employers and the employees, we have seen a big bold step back into the dark ages in Queensland-those dark ages of industrial chaos which we in Queensland had to put up with during the South East Queensland Electricity Board (SEQEB) dispute prior to the introduction of VEAs in our State. With the abolition of VEAs at the end of this month, hundreds of Queensland workers will be worse off. With the removal of VEAs, SEQEB workers will be $60 to $70 per week poorer. </PARA>
<PARA> I must congratulate Senator Sherry on his speech this afternoon. It was a very lucid speech on his view on industrial relations and other matters-a view, of course, which we do not share but which he put very well from his point of view. He raised the point of the poor little workers going into a big room with the employer and all his lawyers and being browbeaten into submission on some deals that they did not really want. I suggest to Senator Sherry and members of his party that he should ask the workers at Power Brewing, or the SEQEB workers, or the Metway Bank workers, or ask the workers of 25 other companies which adopted VEAs, whether they thought they were being browbeaten and stood over when they were getting so much more in their pay packets. That is what it is all about. They were doing much better because they were working out with their employers what was best for their industry, and they were sharing in the profits that the increased productivity brought. </PARA>
<PARA> These workers in Queensland, who had VEAs and were very happy with them, are being made to suffer. Why are they being made to suffer, losing $60, $70 or $80 a week out of their pay packets? Simply to pay back the big unions that supported Wayne Goss and the Australian Workers Union conservative right wing faction of the Queensland ALP. This is a great example of big unions looking after themselves and not giving a damn about their memberships. </PARA>
<PARA> The bosses of a number of Queensland unions were scared stiff of their members waking up to the better conditions being experienced by workers who had VEAs in the companies I have spoken of. It is very disturbing to see the same thing being proposed at a Federal level as we have had at a State level in Queensland. The Federal Government wants to pay back Bill Kelty and his mates for their loyal support by rounding up the unions and killing off the smaller ones and those with minds of their own, so that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) can have complete control of the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it amazing that the ALP thinks it can get away with this grab for power by using the argument that a mere reduction in the number of unions will lead to more efficient industrial relations negotiations in the workplace and that employers want this legislation for this reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia's survey on the subject showed that amalgamations would not reduce the number of demarcation disputes. Most of those presently happening occur between the bigger unions, in any case. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed, but not really surprised, to learn of the Democrats' back flip on this legislation as they back flip on so many matters. It was only a couple of years ago that they opposed the Government's proposal to increase the minimum union membership to 3,000. They are now saying that 10,000 is probably okay. What has changed? Could it be that this time the only difference is that the Government and the ACTU have put together a better backroom deal for the Democrats? Could it be that they have offered better carrots than they were able to offer before? It is possible that the ACTU and the Government do not really expect to get the minimum membership to 20,000 this year, but they have probably aimed high knowing that the Democrats will do a deal and will compromise. In a year or two, the Government may introduce another amendment providing for, say, a 40,000 member threshold, comfortable in the knowledge that, provided it gives the right carrots away, the Democrats will again compromise and the Government can then get back to the 20,000 that maybe it was looking at. In the end, it matters not a great deal whether it is 20,000 or 10,000, the outcome is pretty much the same. It is a bit like the old adage that someone would be better off being hit by a 50 tonne truck than by a 100 tonne truck. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have a responsibility to the people to use their power sensibly. They should forget the backroom deals with the ACTU. If the Democrats pass this Bill, they will have to live with the consequences, which my colleagues and I have spelt out very clearly. The Australian public-the workers and the genuine unionists-should be made aware that it was the Democrats who again sold them down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to take the Bill away, think about the matters my colleagues have so sensibly raised in this debate, and bring back a Bill that encourages enterprise-based unions and voluntary employment agreements so that the workers of Australia get some real worth out of the unions they pay for so handsomely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to speak for very long. I foreshadow some matters that I hope the Government will take into account between now, the second reading stage, and when the Senate considers the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 in the Committee of the Whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my intention to vote for the Bill at the second reading stage in the hope that there will be time for the Government to consider some aspects of its effects on a number of individual unions. If the Government does not consider that, it is my intention to vote against certain provisions of this legislation in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I do not think it necessary, I mention that I probably have a vested interest in this matter as I am President of one of the largest unions in my State and Honorary Secretary of one of the smallest unions, which, being a very small union, is not registered under the Industrial Relations Act. However, the large union is registered under the Act and probably stands to gain from this legislation fairly substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider that the action being proposed by the Government ultimately to deregister unions with fewer than 20,000 members will in fact force 638,000 workers, or 18.6 per cent of the total union members, out of their unions and into other unions. This is industrially naive and disregards the rights of workers; that is, their rights to freedom of association under the International Labour Organisation convention. My problem with this legislation is very similar to the problem I had with the legislation that Mr Viner introduced into the Parliament some years ago. When the legislation got to this chamber, this chamber established a Senate industrial relations committee, of which I became Chairman. The problem with both the Viner legislation and this legislation is that they view union restructuring, such as amalgamation of industry or enterprise unions, as something of a panacea that will bring about improved industrial relations. But the industrial fact of life is that industrial relations outcomes are determined more by the desire of the parties to see that an industrial relations system works than by the size of individual unions. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, as a result of this legislation, there could be the enhancement of careerist leadership of unions. Careerist leadership of giant conglomerate unions, as envisaged under this legislation, aloof from the rank and file and oblivious to the rights of the members of the other unions, could cause havoc to industrial relations outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> To force, as is envisaged by this legislation, hundreds of thousands of union members out of their unions into other unions is a denial of workers' rights. Many unionists who are members of the smaller unions of under 20,000 have a long association with those unions and have developed a loyalty to them and to their fellow members within those organisations-a deep sense of belonging. This will be taken away by the Government's legislation, and I cannot accept that. I wonder whether the Government has written to all of the unions likely to be affected by this legislation. If it has done so, what are the responses coming back to it?</PARA>
<PARA> I am conscious of the need, if it is at all possible, to cut down the work of industrial tribunals and others that consider that because of the number of unions involved that their workload is more than it would otherwise be. I am not so sure that that is the case. In my experience it is often better to have, in a particular trade, an industrial award that covers smaller organisations with union members whose representatives know what they are talking about and are able to put their case cogently before the industrial tribunal rather than have to rely on, as it were, professional representation.</PARA>
<PARA> Over many years we have had this argument within the trade union movement as to what constitutes industrial unions, and still there has been no agreed definition within the trade union movement as to what constitutes an industrial union. It really comes down to a concept of what is big is best. I do not agree with that. We used to hear the argument advanced that amalgamation would overcome demarcation disputes. Well, it may and it may not. Let me remind the chamber that one of the biggest demarcation disputes ever followed the amalgamation of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia. A dispute arose on the west coast of Tasmania as to whether a fitter member of the new union or a boilermaker member of the new union would cut a bolt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister knows as well as I do that these proposals contained in the Bill are not necessarily a guarantee for a better industrial relations outcome. I conclude on an appeal that the Minister take the opportunity between now and when this Bill will be considered in the Committee of the Whole to contact all unions likely to be affected by the legislation so that those organisations will be able to consult their membership thoroughly and respond to the Minister, and through him, to the chamber. It may well be that he has already done so. I do not know. Obviously, he will be able to let the Senate know when he rises to respond to this second reading debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-This debate relates to the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1990. It is a Bill to amend the Industrial Relations Act to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions. It has a number of other amendments, most notably an amendment that has been the subject of debate in this chamber which sets out in fuller detail the provisions that would be required of a preference direction in the Act to the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of honourable senators have made sound and sober contributions to the debate and I thank all those who have contributed. It is a Bill of some importance, given that it talks about the structure of one of the major agents in the social process in Australia-the trade union movement. It is a Bill that has arisen from an exhaustive series of consultations through the National Labour Consultative Council (NLCC), a body which is tripartite in nature, a body consisting of members of the Australian Government, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). It is a consultative process that was commenced after each of the relevant organisations-not just those that I have named but organisations with a particular interest in this field both on the union side and on the employer side-were notified of change and invited to contribute to the Government its views about the course of that change. </PARA>
<PARA> The consultations in the form of the legislative committee of the NLCC took nearly three full working days to complete, were exhaustive in their scope and detailed in their consideration. Finally, the committee was unanimous about the purpose contained in the objectives of this Bill, although it is right to say that that unanimity did not extend to each of the particular measures, that the Government has chosen in its wisdom to propose, as amendments. Indeed, it should be said that the Confederation of Australian Industry was reserved about a number of features, most notably and publicly the feature of our amendments that prescribe a minimum size of unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn to the remarks of a number of speakers in this debate. Before I do, perhaps I should deal with the remarks of the last speaker, Senator Harradine, who is an independent member of this chamber, who has exercised his independence over a series of governments and who, prior to being elected to this chamber, had a long and, dare I say it, distinguished career as a union official. His criticisms carry more weight than the criticisms that might be made by others. His question was: have we written to each particular union that may be affected? I say in answer to that question that, before we began the process, we conducted an exhaustive array of consultations notifying all of the interested groups that we were starting it, that we were going to pursue it and that we were inviting their comments on it. I can also report to the Senate that I am not aware of one individual union which has brought forward a particular criticism of the course we have embarked on, or the conclusions we have arrived at, notably the minimum size of unions. No-one has written to us about that or notified us of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of consultation is essential and it is a process that this Government is noted for; in fact, it is the raison d'etre for this Government being elected in terms of its industrial relations position. While that process is important, in the final phase of that search for consensus the Government must make a decision and must work and live by that decision. I invite Senator Harradine to debate with me, either privately or in this chamber at the committee stage, whether, in searching for consensus, that process cannot be one in which the consensus is at the lowest common denominator, or in which the smallest union with an objection about its fate under these amendments holds all of the organisations back in the making of a decision. I am sure, knowing characteristically that Senator Harradine is an ardent advocate of a particular point of view which he decides on, that he and I will have the opportunity to join more closely in that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is something unique about the Senate from a government point of view. That uniqueness is that this chamber, and this chamber exclusively, does not have a Government majority. It is possible in this chamber that government legislation can be defeated. That is why it is true to say of the Hawke Government that, for all of its years in office, it has not been in power because the power has resided in the Senate. The power to obstruct, change or alter the course of key legislation exists here. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for those reasons that I have listened particularly closely to the arguments advanced in this legislation. I say as an observer-if I may confer that status upon myself for a moment-that it is particularly notable that the Australian Democrats have supported the substance of the amendments we seek, although not in all cases the detail, and have reserved their rights to make what I regard as heavy criticism of some of the detail in terms of the degree in which the Government wishes to apply those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have conducted an informed debate on this Bill. But I do not concede and I will not concede at this stage that their arguments are true as to the proposals they have advanced. We cleave to this legislation because it is necessary in the national economic interest and it is essential to achieving the micro-economic reform that all parties in this Parliament argue is the direction in which Australia needs to go. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an importance as well to build into this legislation incentives for change. In the end we can observe nothing more than resolutions for change but not actions on those resolutions unless there are incentives to make the final commitment to find a better way to alter to the better course. </PARA>
<PARA> I must acknowledge that in the debate Senator McLean, representing the Australian Democrats, made a constructive and, I would regard, principled argument, the basis of which I respect; nonetheless, I disagree with it. I will pursue the opportunities that exist between now and in the committee stage to argue out those issues with him and other Democrats as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should contrast that to the role of the Opposition. Members of the Opposition have not sought to be constructive; they have not sought to raise principled argument; they have not sought a basis of knowledge on which to fashion rationality; nor have they commanded particular respect by the way in which they have put their views. The Opposition, comprised as a coalition of the National Party and the Liberal Party, led by John Hewson, represented in industrial relations by John Howard and represented here by Senator Durack, aspire collectively as a group to be the alternative government of this country. What they say on industrial relations should carry a particular force; ergo, what they do not say should also contain a particular force. </PARA>
<PARA> Many things have not been said in this debate which would, by their very nature of not being addressed and being omitted by design, stand as a criticism of the hollowness and emptiness of many of the Opposition's views. For those who aspire to be an alternative are bound not only to say what they oppose but also are bound to say what they stand for and how circumstances would be different or, in their view, better if they had the opportunity to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> They have failed that test on industrial relations because their arguments have been mostly inspired by vague, ideological meanderings, by uninformed comment about the nature of industrial relations; indeed, in particular places of key importance, by prejudice, by bigotry and by an ignorance or envy, as articulated just this afternoon by Senator Grant Chapman in respect of Mr Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, as if tackling the man not the ball is some sort of argument for rationality. They have done this at a time in which the Australian electorate knows-because this is one thing as a policy initiative they have proclaimed-that if they are elected next time, they intend to introduce a consumption tax. It is rumoured by those journalists who seem to have access to the internal workings of the Opposition that the level of that consumption tax will be about 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> So at a time in which members of the Opposition have had an opportunity to lay out an industrial relations alternative, and we know that there would be a consumption tax of the order of 15 per cent if they were elected, they have not answered-and this is an opportunity for them to do so-what the world would look like in grappling with that supercharge to inflation in a decentralised, uncoordinated workplace-by-workplace negotiation system such as they have proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants this legislation because it will encourage one bargaining unit per workplace. The recent survey by the Business Council of Australia (BCA) showed that for workplaces of between 100 and 500 employees there are at least five unions; beyond 2,000 employees there are up to 11 unions. The ACTU believes that that should be rationalised. </PARA>
<PARA> We agree that it is ideal to have in one workplace one bargaining unit representing the interests of all. This would enable the removal of demarcation, flexibility in the use of labour, proper training to be introduced and multiskilling. This would be the basis of increased productivity and future wage negotiations on how that productivity, once achieved, is best shared. That is the basis of accord mark 6-a move to more direct bargaining in the workplace, given that, nonetheless, while one is decentralising from a central system, there is a requirement on a government in the public interest and because of human compassion to see that the weakest in the workplace are protected by some central constructs on wage fixation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in this legislation seeks to give a union organisational coherence to micro-economic reform by encouraging the development of industry unions in industries-a development that we see as particularly important. That is our position. It is fundamental to achieving rationality in the union structure. From the point of view of unions being free associations democratically comprised, that is an essential change. But from the economic point of view, the wider public interest point of view, the point of view of a more vibrant economy, the achievement of the micro-economic reform benefits that this legislation brings is important as well. </PARA>
<PARA> There are at least five points of condemnation to the Liberal position. The Liberal's theory of union structures for this country is just that-a theory. It has no support. There is no support from unions and there is no broad support for it from employer organisations. The BCA, the closest organisation to its viewpoint, does not explicitly endorse this particular plan that the Opposition proposes; in fact, the BCA has distanced itself from the more gung ho elements of Opposition expression. Firstly, is there support? The answer is no. Secondly, is there a model elsewhere in the world that we can look at for the Opposition's structure? The answer is no. John Howard admitted that at a seminar I attended with him held by the Australian Financial Review earlier this year. What he has instead is an eclectic gathering of various elements of different systems which he has chosen the best of, rejected the balance of, and then said that this is a new structure. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a reference in rhetoric to Japan. The structure being talked of by the Opposition is not Japanese and it ignores the essential structure of the Japanese system as if a culturally different nation from Australia could travel its system across the Pacific to here and impose it anyway. The Opposition has failed to acknowledge that, while it is true that there are enterprise unions in that country, they are organised into federations and central councils of federations. So from a different approach one gets the same construction as we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, is there a model that we can examine? The answer is no. Fourthly, is there a theoretical base to the Opposition's ideological meanderings? The closest it might be said to a theoretical underpinning of its argument might be the report entitled Transforming Industrial Relations in New South Wales: a Green Paper by Professor John Niland to the New South Wales Government for its amendments last year. But there are things in the Niland report that the New South Wales Government chose and others that it rejected. So it is unfair to John Niland to say that the position adopted by the Federal Opposition reflects his position. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate one example. He has argued in his report to the New South Wales Government that limited immunity from common law activity is necessary if we are to have the type of system that he proposes-workplace negotiations and small enterprise unions. That element, essential to the overall, was rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there a theoretical underpinning for the Opposition's position? No. Has the Opposition advanced a plan to implement its proposals? It has not. It is opposed by unions; it is not supported by employers; it confronts the Industrial Relations Commission and turns it into a marginal organisation or, worse, one that is impotent. Any aspiring government must have a huge credibility gap when it shows that it has an unsupported theory with no theoretical base and with no plan for its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the consumption tax which the Opposition has said that it will implement will be a positive decision to escalate inflation in this country. Without an accord with the trade union movement, how is it to contain that inflation within a wages policy outcome, as is essential to our economic well-being?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we know from the Opposition that it will go down what it perceives to be the Thatcher road of deregulation and decentralisation on this front and abandon any prospect of an accord. So the economic underpinning necessary to ensure that tax discounting of consumption tax impositions does not break out into higher inflation and higher wages will not be there. The Thatcher road is now epitomised by a movement to double digit wages and double digit price growth in England, at levels above those which pertained under the last British Labor Government a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly and perhaps lastly, does the Opposition have a record of achievement in this field to justify confidence by the community in its alternative model? One has only to look back at the record of the Fraser Government, a record of double digit unemployment, double digit inflation and massive industrial dislocation in this country to appreciate that one of the reasons why the electors of Australia chose the Hawke Government in March 1983 was that they wanted national reconciliation, national reconstruction and a turning away from the divisive nature of Liberal Party practice in industrial relations. That was a key plank in the election of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there a record of confidence? Is there a record to justify confidence? There is not. All of the electoral surveys show that voters in the Australian community regard a Labor government as better equipped than a Liberal government to handle industrial relations matters. All the public opinion surveys in the period running up to the 1983 election showed that what the community wanted was a government that could deliver relative industrial calm and a situation in which dispute matters were sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude this element of my speech by saying that there is no support, there is no model, there is no underpinning theory, there is no plan, and there is no record upon which the Liberal Party alternative, advanced as it has been in the second reading debate, can have any standing whatsoever. For an Opposition which aspires to government, that is a massive condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered also that the Liberal Party and the National Party-the coalition-have chosen this course of making themselves irrelevant to the main debate. It is a free choice. They have positively sought irrelevance by putting themselves at arm's length from employer organisations, unions and the general body of community support. When one considers the massive changes that are taking place in industrial relations in Australia -changes which are important for this country-one must see those changes as representing a great effort at reconstruction; a great effort at orderly, structured, debated and worked out change. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, the true radicals- those who wish to jettison the tried and true principles, who wish to throw over the system of arbitration that has stood this country in good stead for the last century; those without support, without theory, without model, without plan and without record; those who wish to disown the practice of industrial relations and the managed reform that this Government is working through with the unions and the employers in this country-are the Opposition. They have created in their industrial relations meanderings a bastard child of industrial relations: ill-conceived, unformed, impractical, without precedent and, more importantly, dangerous, if the Thatcher model is to be seen as something close to what they seek. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters have been raised in this debate, many of them arising from the instinct to find the red herring or the instinct to promote ignorance rather than reason and rationality. The first is the contention that somehow big is bad and small is beautiful. The second is the contention that the International Labor Organisation (ILO) convention on the freedom of association is being disdained by this legislation. The third is the suggestion that preference is abhorrent, and the fourth is the personalised attack upon the Secretary of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> As my time has almost elapsed I shall deal quickly with each of those. Senator Chapman in his contribution today could see no logical inconsistency when he referred to the criticism by the Business Council of Australia of the minimum size of unions under this legislation being 20,000 members. He then argued that big is bad, and because the Business Council of Australia had said this he cited it for support. He saw no illogicality in the fact that the organisation which represents the 200 largest companies in this country argues that big is bad. But it argues that only for the unions; it does not argue it for itself. The logical inconsistency is that if it believed its rhetoric, it would apply that rhetoric to its members and break down its organisations into small companies. It would disband its organisations. If those opposite preach that big is bad and join the Business Council in its view, they too are responsible for that illogicality. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, big is not bad; big depends on how things are organised. This Government preaches that an organisation should be flat; that the number of people between the rank and file and the leadership should be a minimum; that the democratic control of organisations is a key characteristic in determining whether they function well or not. We would go further and say that it is desirable under this legislation that the organisational focus of a rational trade union structure should be on the enterprise. If that is the way in which it operates, it will indeed be a positive advantage to this community. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'big is bad' argument tends to ignore a series of five separate reports over some 13 years commissioned by Liberal and Labor governments on technological change in the manufacturing sector and on industrial relations generally. Let me cite them: the report of the Jackson Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry in 1975; the report of the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia in 1980; the report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, set up by the Fraser Government in 1977; the report of the Hancock Committee of Review of Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems set up by our Government in 1985; and the Pappas Carter study on Australian manufacturing industry set up just this year. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those reports, based on a wide body of evidence, synthesising the arguments and drawing conclusions, found that it is desirable to achieve a reduction in the number of unions in Australia and to rationalise those unions along industry lines to enable them to service the needs of their members, to enable the artificial constraints of demarcation in the workplace to be broken down, and to achieve one bargaining unit per workplace. That is the advice given to governments based on a body of considered inquiry. The Fraser Government took no notice of it; we intend to listen to it. We intend to enact it. Our preference, as I have said, is that the union organisation have an industry focus. </PARA>

<PARA> This afternoon in the debate to which I listened closely, one of the arguments raised was that somehow we were offending ILO conventions, freedom of association conventions, and the rights of the individual. This argument was espoused by a number of Opposition senators, most notably and ludicrously by Senator O'Chee. I do not like being lectured by conservatives about the rights of individuals because their history is to ignore those rights when given the chance. The freedom of association convention was brought down by the ILO in 1948. It waited 25 years through the long somnolence of the Menzies Government, through the Holt Government, through the Gorton Government, through the McMahon Government, until the Whitlam Government in 1973 adopted it. </PARA>
<PARA> The freedom of association convention exists in Australia because a Labor government put it there. Now I am lectured from the Opposition that we are somehow breaking our own standards. The basis of that convention is to recognise the inherent rights of voluntary association by unions. The plan advanced by the Opposition in terms of one union per enterprise is a plan which, at its base, has the belief that one can somehow impose that structure on the existing structure and abrogate the voluntary nature of the association of the existing structure. Those who claim freedom of association on the one hand are, by virtue of their own policy, talking about its direct and blatant abrogation. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have done is to say that there should be an amendment to the Act so that there would be a minimum size of unions of 20,000, and that that is a matter for the Industrial Relations Commission to determine because, if unions can make a particular case, then they can be excluded from that base. We have also said that there is no offence against freedom of association because that would require some sort of regulation of the right of unions to be disbarred from entry to State jurisdictions. That is not proposed; unions have that right and, if they choose it, it is there. Thirdly, we have said that, after all, unions are voluntary associations, that what they choose to do with their registration or otherwise is a matter for them, and that that is their free choice. But if they want to be registered with the Commission, there is the choice about what is the national interest. That is the choice that also should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, if this argument of freedom of association had any force, it would have been trotted out last time, because the Act provides for a minimum size of 1,000. If those who argue for freedom of association are right, that is illegal. It has never been challenged. It is not illegal; it stands; it exists; and it is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> The most shameful element of this debate has been the personal attack upon the Secretary of the ACTU. If honourable senators opposite do not have an argument, they attack the man. If they do not have a case, they argue the individual. If they do not have anything to put, they smear and exhibit prejudice. That is what they have done against Mr Kelty. In his defence, even the most ardent conservative newspaper pundits regard him as a gifted visionary, and say so in their columns. They may disagree with his vision, but they do not argue that he is the bogyman, a title the Opposition has tried to confer upon him in this debate. It is a disgusting and disdainful effort at playing the man and not the ball. It should be abhorred. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first occasion for many of us to deal with this new structure. The experience we had is not one that one could describe as entirely satisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts which dealt with this report-a committee of which I am not a member, but which I attended as the relevant shadow Minister-the procedures, which we were told would be a reflection of the procedures of the Committee of the Whole, were, in fact, not a reflection of procedures of the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, we were advised by the Chairman of that Committee at one stage that she had heard enough discussion at that particular point and she wished us to proceed without further discussion-would we please bring the discussion to a conclusion. That, to my knowledge, is not part of the procedures of this chamber, nor is it within the rights of a chairman of the Committee of the Whole of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that in passing because it seems to me that there is a failure by the Government to understand what are the proper procedures to be adopted in such committees. I frankly expressed some disagreement with the chairperson over her right to request that the discussion on that particular point be brought to a conclusion. I asked that the chairperson withdraw that request and my request to her was refused. It seems to me that if this new procedure is to succeed, it will succeed only if there is a level of goodwill on both sides, which, quite frankly, was not manifested in that Committee inquiring into this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say I feel uneasy in these circumstances about our accepting this report, which involves the rejection, on party lines, of two Opposition amendments; in which the vote was recorded; and in which the Opposition members of the Committee asked that their opposition to the matter be recorded. I am not privy to the discussions about the nature of the report to this chamber by that Committee, but it seems to me to be totally inadequate for this chamber not to be apprised of what really happened in that Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At some stage I would like to make a few comments and perhaps now, following Senator Michael Baume's remarks, would be the most appropriate time. One of the things we did in our Committee and I would have to say at the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology that I was able to attend in the morning, was examine very closely the procedures that would be followed in this chamber subsequent to the report of the Committee. I must say that on that day I went through the Standing Orders-I think three times-in relation to what would happen in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not claim to be the final authority, Mr Temporary Chairman, but my understanding is that what you have told us now by way of ruling is what one would understand from reading the Standing Order. I also understood that, if a motion or an amendment was circulated in this place, we would effectively go back to the Committee of the Whole and that would pre-empt the report of the Committee or it would, at least, be considered at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning, I saw on my table, amendments to be moved to this legislation and I presumed that they were the Opposition amendments as well as the Government amendments-I may be wrong on that-and I presumed that we were going to proceed in the way that Senator Michael Baume and Senator Chapman had indicated they would be proceeding in this place when this legislation came back in here. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few points I would like to make. First, I thought, notwithstanding that we are trialling a new way of dealing with legislation, that there was a clear understanding that a referral of a piece of legislation to the Committee would have with it the intent of trying to short circuit proceedings in the Senate but, in case Senator Michael Baume misunderstands me, in no way to pre-empt discussion in this place. The Standing Orders make it quite clear that, even though a Bill was deliberated on in the Senate Standing Committee, of course it could be debated at length and again when it was brought back into this place, if that was the wish of any senator. I must say that that is somewhat disappointing. I understand perfectly the right of any senator to raise things in Committee of the Whole, but I do think it is going to give us grave pause when we come to considering why we should refer legislation to the Senate standing committees if it is in no way to short circuit the deliberations in here. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what we have to do is test this procedure over time and see what is the preferred balance that would allow the optimal play of goodwill. I think at this stage it would be much better to ascribe good intentions to senators, rather than anything else, and say that we are testing the waters of a new process and that therefore options should be allowed. But I do say that it raises a considerable difficulty for the hours that might be spent deliberating on Bills in the Senate committees if the whole debate then recurs in here. I feel a little disappointed that Senator Michael Baume should, in a somewhat churlish manner, chide the Committee and in particular myself--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought one might suggest, `Well, Senator Chapman, would you like to consider winding up?' Senator Michael Baume knows full well that what I ruled was that there was no way any senator wanting the call in that Committee would be denied it, and that was how I proceeded to act. Senator Michael Baume got the call again and made his point again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the record, I would simply like to commend the new Senator Crane, who has been in this place a very short time, but who, in a very succinct two or three minutes, made all the points that needed to be made. In fact, Senator Chapman did say how succinctly Senator Crane said that and I commend the assessment of Senator Chapman. Senator Crane was very succinct and contributed enormously to the deliberations in the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I also find it a bit disappointing that Senator Michael Baume would want to be so churlish about not being there for the deliberations of the Committee, in particular because Senator Faulkner, as I recall, specifically moved a motion to allow non-members of our Committee to stay for what we specifically called a private meeting so as to allow Senator Michael Baume to stay there and he agreed on the ruling from the Clerk-Assistant that any private meeting did not allow non-member senators to stay for deliberative considerations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In formulating our decision about how to make the report, we would have to say that we were in deliberative mode. Indeed, I think Senator Michael Baume, with some grace and agreement, happily left the committee at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will leave the Minister to refute that one. I will let my words stand. It does not contribute to constructive discussion for Senator Michael Baume to put the points that he has been making here. The points that were constructive were the amendments moved by the Opposition. If honourable senators read the Hansard report of proceedings they will see that there was an agreement in principle between the Government and Opposition on this point and a disagreement about the preferred way to proceed in addressing the question of discrimination on the grounds of age. That is the only point and I think Senator Crane made this point very succinctly in the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are to try to deal with the proceedings in regard to legislation passed by committees, we must look at the process, examine what has happened here today and see what might be the preferred way of tackling the report of the Committee, particularly if amendments are circulated. I guess that that is another thing we are trying for the first time. Also, I think it would be helpful to the Committee of the Whole and to the legislation committees if we could deliberate on these matters with optimal goodwill. I would prefer that we get to the points at issue in this legislation rather than become involved in a lengthy discussion about procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee's considerations we were assisted by the Opposition spokespeople, who were not members of the Committee, and, as I have already said, by Senator Crane's comments. I think we were also assisted by the Minister's response. Our Democrat colleague, Senator Bourne, made her points and the Democrats' position very clearly and put her arguments very constructively. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge that I see is the ongoing fine tension between the time that could be saved in referring legislation for this sort of deliberation to a committee and then with a report back to the Committee of the Whole versus the proper and appropriate permission or allowance for any senator to raise these matters again in the full Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume seems to suggest that the report is insufficient in that it does not list in more detail the deliberations of the Committee. We have sought, as I think every committee has, considerable assistance in writing that report and advice on how best to do it. We are advised that most committee reports, and we believe we should like to stay with this precedent, give the conclusions of the Committee. Senator Coates said-and this was misheard by Senator Michael Baume-`There is a Hansard', not `Read the Hansard'. There is a Hansard record of the deliberations to assist honourable senators and there are the minutes of the meeting if anybody wants to see them. I am not sure, but I would have thought that the minutes of the meeting belonged to the committee and would be available to the members of the Committee. But, again, that may be something on which we have to seek a final answer. But as Senator Chapman and Senator Michael Baume were in attendance at that Committee meeting, I would be very surprised if they were not allowed to have access to the minutes of the meeting. I would have thought that the points raised by Senator Michael Baume do not help deliberations in this place and that it would be more constructive to take Senator Chapman's amendments and address them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on this matter. I make it quite clear that there is goodwill on this side and we want the new procedures to work. But as honourable senators would be aware, the Standing Orders are silent on a number of important areas that are yet to be developed. They will be developed by practice and discussions across the chamber, and a number of those discussions are taking place now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One area in which the Standing Orders are silent is in respect of what is to be included in a report of the Committee. I would have thought that it is not unreasonable for the Senate to expect the report when it comes back here to contain at least something that tells the Senate what suggested amendments were put and what were the results of those votes. It could have been done, as I think Senator Crowley will acknowledge, by a dissenting report, but I do not know that that is the most appropriate way to proceed. It seems to me that there should be a brief summary of events that occurred in the Committee, of proposed amendments that were put, information as to which of those amendments were accepted, which of those were defeated and so on. Then when the report comes back into the Committee of the Whole, senators will not have to refer back to the Hansard and to the records to find such elementary information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But I do not think it should be necessary to include a dissenting report in every case where an amendment is defeated. I think that on the face of the report, the Senate should be aware of which proposed amendments were defeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the whole exercise is principally to improve the quality of legislation. If out of that we can have a more expeditious dealing with business before the Senate, that will be to the advantage of everyone here. There has been no suggestion, either in the Standing Orders or in the report of the Committee which recommended this new procedure to the Senate, that there should be any attempt to outlaw the right of a senator to move an amendment in the Committee of the Whole, even if that senator has attempted to do so in the Standing Committee and been unsuccessful. I remind the Committee that the numbers in this place are different from the numbers that appear within each of the legislation committees. It would a be totally unsatisfactory procedure if senators were to lose the capacity to move such an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, Senator Chapman has the option under the Standing Orders as they have been adopted to come into the Committee of the Whole in order to move the amendment that he sought unsuccessfully to move in the Committee. I cannot see why we cannot get on with that business and complete this Bill more expeditiously than the way in which we are dealing with it at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take note of the comments made by Senator Hill. I think he has given a precise and exact description of our report. There seems to be some confusion about what constitutes our report. One is this piece of paper which has just been brought to my attention by Senator Campbell called `Report on the Consideration of the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill 1989-90, with recommended amendments to the Bill'. That is not to be confused with the actual report on which we were voting. Senator Hill's description of the report covers fairly nicely exactly what was said. I draw those comments to the attention of the chamber because Senator Hill has put our case beautifully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important point is that the report on which we are voting was passed unanimously at a private meeting of our Committee after it was drafted and circulated to everybody. Indeed, an amendment was accepted, moved by Senator Crane and seconded by Senator Campbell, that we make note of the Liberal dissent. The points that have been made are in that report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the more engaging characters in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers is the Grand Inquisitor. He sings a song about there being no shadow of doubt about a certain problem. It is a problem about which no-one knows any of the facts. That is what makes the song so memorable. It seems that there are certain things that we do know here and certain things that we do not know. It might be quite a good idea to get some of them out in the open. First, it is quite clear that the Chair has a motion before it. Mr Temporary Chairman, you have ruled to that effect. There is no shadow of doubt about that. Secondly, it is clear that whatever the cause, certain amendments that we wish to proceed with were not in the Chair's possession. Why they were not in the Chair's possession is another argument. But it may test the goodwill of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, it is quite apparent that the procedure we are adopting is taking us into uncharted territory and there are some loose ends, some rubbing points, which become apparent as we proceed. This has happened in the committees. We have had to work out how we will proceed and that has not been easy. We have had to work out the extent to which officers will or will not answer questions and again that has not been easy. However, as Senator Hill has said, the numbers in the Committee are different from the numbers in this chamber and it does not follow that a resolution of the Committee will necessarily reflect what happens in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Temporary Chairman, I put it to you that we have one of three courses open to us. First, I take it that the Minister can always withdraw a motion by leave, which then puts the Committee in a different position, if it were necessary to look at the amendments first. But if the Committee proceeded to vote on the motion and negatived it, does that leave the Committee in a position where it can start de novo with the amendments? It seems to me that that would be the less satisfactory way to go. It may be better to seek an accommodation across the chamber to withdraw the motion and then invite Senator Chapman to proceed as if the amendments had been in the Chair's possession all along. </PARA>
<PARA> What is uncertain to me-it may be certain to other senators-is the point that Senator Michael Baume raised; that is, if we proceed to adopt the motion before the Chair, what are the consequences of that action? That is not clear to me. As the Lord Inquisitor would say, it is a matter which is not free from every doubt. We need to know exactly what the consequence of that would be qua the amendments which are foreshadowed and which we wish to move from this side. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Temporary Chairman, I understand that you have ruled so far in the only way you could in terms of what your position is, but I put it to the Committee that if we wish to proceed reasonably to allow the amendments which are foreshadowed to come forward and be determined, it may be necessary for us to do something more. Just off the top of my head I wonder whether withdrawal of the motion to take note may be one way to proceed. </PARA>

Obviously, Mr Temporary Chairman, at the start you were of the view that they had not been put in properly. We will have to hear whether or not that is true. Again, as with the private meeting, I do not know when Senator Chapman lodged them and to whom he gave them.

We began the new procedure on the basis that they had not been received by the Clerk and were not in front of the Chair. It would appear that because of that misunderstanding at the beginning it would be appropriate to gain the assurance of the Committee that leave will be granted for Senator Chapman to move the two amendments as soon as the motion before the Chair is disposed of-in other words, that the motion before the Chair, which is that the report from the Committee be adopted, be determined by the Committee of the Whole on the basis that leave is granted, when I ask now whether leave is granted, for Senator Chapman to move the two amendments that are now circulated. I should say further that adopting the motion before us now that the report of the Committee be adopted only has the effect of adopting those amendments that have been recommended by the Committee's report.

If this is the manner in which these things are going to be dealt with, I suggest that almost every committee recommendation will end up having amendments moved to it by this place.

Once again, I am not totally au fait with how these things are done, but I found it most unsatisfactory to be called from this chamber in the middle of Question Time to finalise the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I refer you to sessional order 11 (a), which deals with this very matter, because I think we find the solution there. While it is clear from 11 (a) on page 139 of the Standing Orders that it was intended that if a further amendment-either the same amendment or a different amendment-was not tabled before the report was dealt with, the Committee of the Whole would go straight on with the consideration of the Bill without accepting any more amendments. The clause is peculiarly silent on this matter. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a motion may be moved without notice that the report of the standing committee be adopted (if the standing committee has recommended amendments to the bill, this motion shall have the effect of amending the bill accordingly, but may not be moved if other proposed amendments to the bill have been circulated in the Senate by a Senator);</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it envisages the prior circulation. That did not occur in this case, so the procedure would be to adopt the report. That would be the starting position for the next clause which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if a motion under subparagraph (a) is moved, following the disposal of that motion a motion may be moved by a Minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The words are `may be moved'. There is nothing there to say that in between those two events it is not possible for a senator to move an amendment. I would suggest to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that while the intention is clear the words do not say that and it is quite possible for us to proceed to adopt this report and for you to accept Senator Chapman's amendments. That would be the starting point for the debate-that the report has been adopted-and then at some future time, if that is seen as a loophole, that loophole could be closed. </PARA>

It is the advice of the Clerk that leave would be necessary because we have begun that procedure without the amendments being circulated; but, given the debate, I would like it to be confirmed that this Committee is foreshadowing that leave will be granted for Senator Chapman to move those amendments.

<PARA>In moving these amendments, which have been circulated, I am not attempting to bring the new Senate committee system into any disfavour whatsoever. I strongly support the new system and I think the working of the new system in the case of this particular piece of legislation illustrates that it will indeed produce better legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, while the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was sitting there were, of course, a number of other committees sitting and several pieces of legislation were being dealt with simultaneously by those various committees and that clearly is an advantage. Secondly, the working of this particular committee procedure on this Bill allowed the exploration of the principles which I sought to have written into this legislation with the Minister and the Minister's advisers present. That has resulted in the original suggested amendments being rejected by the Minister. But subsequently I wrote different amendments seeking to fulfil the same principle but taking into account the Minister's objections. I believe that the amendments which are now before the Senate are better amendments in the sense they take in a wider range of considerations than the amendments as originally circulated. The procedure which we have adopted, I believe, will result if not in this legislation-but I hope it will in this legislation-then in other legislation being better as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Patents Bill 1990 is an extremely important piece of legislation, otherwise I would not have persisted with this matter. In my second reading speech I dwelt at some length on the ethical questions of the patenting of life and made the point that many people in our community feel very strongly about the undesirable nature of patenting life, life forms or anything to do with life systems, and that for that reason they sought to exclude the patenting of life and life forms from patents legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Walter Gilbert, a Nobel Laureate and Harvard biologist, describes a project currently proceeding in a number of laboratories around the world, the object of which is to obtain the complete sequence of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), which describes the human being, some three billion to five billion bases long over the next 10 to 15 years so that one can completely describe that library of human genetic information. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Obtaining the human genome blueprint is the ultimate answer to the commandment 'Know thyself'. It is the Holy Grail of biology. </PARA>
<PARA>What this legislation is about-unless amended-would allow the Holy Grail to be patented. That is the level at which many people feel about this legislation and the ethics of patenting life. </PARA>
<PARA> Arthur Caplan, Director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, has also said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is going to be one of the key ethical challenges of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>So, there is no doubt that in this area we are treading on extremely dangerous and shifting ground. Many of us believe that the present Bill is inadequate in this very important respect. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Bill has been in gestation since 1979, yet-and I made this point before-it has totally ignored the very important debate that has gone on in the community in relation to the ethics and the principles which should surround the patenting of life and life forms. To that extent, it is a deeply flawed piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This patents legislation is new legislation which should take us forward into the next decade-a decade, in which, as Arthur Caplan has pointed out, will lie the key ethical challenges of bio-ethics, yet in its present form it is silent on that matter. It says that anything is patentable, provided it is sufficiently novel and provided it shows sufficient inventiveness. No question of ethics enters into those decisions whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> This area is one of extremely rapid change-both in the technical area and in the area of social attitudes about biomedical matters, genetic engineering and so forth. Therefore it is vital that this patents legislation contain the necessary checks and balances to reflect these changes in the technology and social attitudes as people become aware of that technology and aware of the consequences which can flow from the application of that technology, particularly the consequences that flow from the patenting, the exclusive ownership and the commercialisation of that technology. As the technology changes and as social attitudes change, it is very important that we build into this legislation a system of checks and balances which is adequate and which is capable of coping with the rapid rate of change. </PARA>
<PARA> Very considerable concern has been expressed about this issue at the very highest levels throughout Australia. The Anglican Church, both at the level of its general synod and and at the level of its social responsibilities committee, has expressed strong opposition to the patenting of life forms. The General Secretary of the Uniting Church of Australia, after a recent meeting of the church synod in Sydney at which this matter was raised and debated, has also written opposing the patenting of life. The Queensland synod of the Uniting Church has also supported the principle embodied in the amendments I have put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The Catholic Church, through the Archbishop of Adelaide, has expressed grave concerns over what the Government is proposing. Indeed, just this afternoon, I received a further letter from a Catholic women's group expressing very considerable concern about the patenting of human life forms. Of course, a number of conservation bodies and consumer groups have also expressed considerable disquiet that the Government should countenance at all the patenting of life. </PARA>
<PARA> These people and organisations are also aware that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is, at this very time, considering a number of matters related to bio-engineering and bio-medical technology. Yet this Government is apparently prepared to proceed with this legislation well before that House of Representatives Committee comes forward with its report. Why is it that the Government is seeking to close off this door before this matter has been considered by the Committee?</PARA>
<PARA> I will outline the present proposals and explain where they differ from my previous proposals. In the previous proposals I sought exclusively to prevent the patenting of everything from genes and modified genes to the animals and plants, viruses, bacteria and higher animals which might come to contain those genes. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee stage, the Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology (Senator Button) objected to that broad proposal on several grounds, one of which did contain some merit; that was, that the patenting of bacterial vaccines, particularly live vaccines, would be prevented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A live polio virus. I have attempted-this relates particularly to clause 18 and I point out to the Committee that the other amendments are consequential upon the amendments to clause 18 being accepted-to write in a set of amendments which would have the effect of not permitting patenting of life and life forms, but in that particular case a committee could review the application. In my explanatory memorandum I have suggested that a suitable committee might comprise people drawn from the areas of technical expertise, bioethics and consumer interests, and that such a committee would review those particular applications. In the light of community standards and in the light of the expert knowledge of the people in these various areas, the committee may then recommend to the Commissioner that this particular application be permitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under those circumstances I have no doubt that, given the present climate of opinion about the patenting of bacterial vaccines and viral vaccines, whether live or dead, developments would be patentable. The effect of the amendment which I am seeking to insert here would merely be that some review process by an appropriate ethical type of committee be an additional criterion which would have to be met before that particular invention involving life as well as novelty and inventiveness could be patented. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the present climate of public opinion, those examples of applications that I mentioned before which come close to imposing considerable environmental problems, ethical problems relating to the patenting of human parts, human genes or collections of human genes or the use of those genes, would probably be recommended against and would not be patentable. </PARA>
<PARA> Doing it in this way, a committee would be able to take into account the changing knowledge of this particular area of bio-engineering and would be able to take into account the changing perceptions of the community, the changing standards of the community. It would provide the appropriate checks and balances with flexibility. This would allow for this very important extra dimension-that is, the ethical dimension-that worries so many people about the patenting of life to be taken into account, as many of us believe it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I merely draw the Committee's attention again to the fact that the substantive part of the amendments lie in the addition of proposed subclauses 18 (2), 18 (3), 18 (4), 18 (5), 18 (6) and 18 (7) to clause 18. The other clauses are consequential upon that. I recommend to the Committee the adoption of these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be opposing the amendments, as indeed I hope the majority of senators will. I am clear on the procedure to be adopted by the chamber. This indeed is my first experience of this new procedure. Even though the Patents Bill is not my Bill, I did listen; I did not watch but certainly listened to this part of the Committee's debate on life forms because it interested me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the report of the Committee is adopted by the Committee of the Whole, all of the Government's amendments and Senator Harradine's amendment-at this point in time I indicate that the Government will be supporting it because it relates to the same issue-will be adopted automatically. The circulation of a single amendment by any senator in the chamber means that that cannot be so and that the Government's amendments-or anyone's amendments-have to be put separately. I mention that because I am grateful for Senator Harradine's indication to me that he is happy to move his amendment but not to once again canvass all the substantive issues that were raised in the Committee. Of course, it is no fault of his that these matters have to be debated in here. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make it clear to the chamber now that the amendments being put by Senator Coulter are substantially the same as the amendments he debated at length in the Committee, with the notable exception of the addition of the proposal to set up a committee to advise the Commissioner of Patents as to when matters that should be patented should be patented. The flaw in Senator Coulter's argument is, as has been pointed out by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on previous occasions, that the Patents Bill as presented and the Patents Act as it currently exists do not allow for the patenting of all life as claimed by Senator Coulter. Having said that-and this was canvassed at considerable length during the Committee debate-I point out that the difficulty with accepting Senator Coulter's additional amendment, which has the effect of making this a new amendment, simply removes that degree of certainty from this Bill that the Government is trying to inject. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the Committee proposal, Senator Coulter wanted to maintain the entire appeal provisions that are currently in place in patent and other law, which would mean that any decision of the Commissioner would still be subject to all of the appeal mechanisms, as would any decision by Senator Coulter's Committee or by the Patent, Trade Marks and Design Office to refer or not to refer a particular patent application to the committee. As I said before-and just a moment's reflection would indicate this-it would make the entire process so uncertain and so unworkable that it will destroy the degree of certainty that the Government is attempting to introduce in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> On the substantive question on which Senator Coulter moves these amendments here, as he did in the Committee and which the Committee rejected, the Government indicates that it will not be supporting those amendments on this particular area although the Government indicates its support for Senator Harradine's amendment. </PARA>

In fact, it makes them more cumbersome and less clear. To add yet another committee with the appointments and operations dealt with by regulation, I find very difficult to accept at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that Senator Coulter's amendments are based on the premise that patenting generally is an undesirable practice and I understand that very clearly. I do not think there is anything in these amendments which would make the Opposition have any more thought than was the case last week. In case it is not clear, or in case any people either in this chamber or outside of it wish to chance their arm to the contrary, I make it absolutely clear that the Opposition totally rejects any notion that there can be any patenting of any human production process for generation in any way, shape or form. I hope that is clear. The implication has been cast by one or two people that we would support such a move or that we would not oppose such a move. Nothing can be further from the truth. I just wish to make that adequately clear. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the earlier discussion and while I am on my feet, I would say that our Committee worked very well. It worked well because the Chairman was skilled enough to totally ignore the ridiculous restrictions which were placed on him and under which we were supposed to work but did not. Also, the Minister was shrewd enough to know that, if we wanted to get this legislation through, it was necessary for us to have discussions with the practitioners face to face. Our Committee worked very well because the rules were operated in a useful and sensible manner. I recommend those to anybody else. We on this side of the chamber believe that medical, animal and plant development is necessary and, as such, we would support them. We do not wish to participate in anything that will extend the restriction in the manner that has been proposed at this time. </PARA>

I can only forgive that sort of action assuming that the speakers concerned are somewhat ignorant of the point that genetic engineering has reached and the possibilities which now lie before us in the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon, just before I came into the chamber, I received a report entitled Global Effort To Map Human Genes: Testing Scientific Cooperation. I have already pointed out that there is a massive human genome project going forward which is an attempt to completely map the total sequence of basis in the human genome over the next 10 to 15 years. The article states that, once scientists have their gene map with all the genes identified and pinpointed, they expect to be able to diagnose and treat thousands of currently incurable genetic diseases such as Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. The report also says that the two-year-old project is beginning to stir some controversy over who will pay for the work and who will benefit from the lucrative patents expected to result from it. </PARA>
<PARA> That report is only brief but one of the May issues of Science has a seven-page series of articles dealing with this very difficult question of the sharing of scientific information when it comes down to the level of the human genome. Senators are unwise not to be very concerned about the prospect of exclusively owning access to these particular genes, to the way in which those genes may be manipulated, put into bacteria or into plants or any other creature for that matter, and then used exclusively under a patents system. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe for a moment that that work will not go ahead under normal scientific endeavour. One can look back at the history of that project and find a number of scientists who are very keen to carry on with that work and to share the information with fellow scientists for the good of humanity and not want exclusively to patent that information, hold it for commercial ends and hold to ransom those with Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis and simply use those people as a source of money making. As I say, it disturbs me greatly that my fellow senators do not share that concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Too frequently we in this chamber feel that it is our duty to harangue the other side or lament about the difficulties that are being faced in this country at the moment, or otherwise bring to the attention of honourable senators tales of woe and despair. I would like to take the opportunity this evening to bring to the attention of the Senate two stories of courage and tribulation of ordinary Queenslanders that I believe are important and ought to be publicly aired and the contributions of the people concerned recorded appropriately. I believe that what the people about whom I am shortly to speak are doing is very important for the future of their communities and for the future of my State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to start by discussing the town of Charleville. As we all know, earlier this year Charleville was struck by the greatest floods in the recorded history of that area of Queensland. In my maiden speech I commended to the Senate the efforts of the people of Charleville to rebuild their town. I said, amongst other things, that we had to ensure that they had the opportunity to rebuild their lives as they were before the floods. Over the past weekend I had the good fortune to visit Charleville, to attend a Chamber of Commerce dinner there and also to attend the opening of the St Vincent de Paul Society centre. Both these stories are very important. I believe that they are stories of hope. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties that I pointed out in my maiden speech in this place was that the business community of Charleville faced grave difficulties because, although credit was available to these business to keep on going, the problem was that eventually the credit would have to be repaid. For a number of weeks we heard stories of how the State Government in Queensland was going to make grants available to get business on the road again in Charleville. Unfortunately, that State Government has not come good with all its promises and many of the grants that people in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia thought would be flowing to the businesses and people of Charleville did not make it. That is a matter for some concern and is a little bit unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Charleville got on with the job of rebuilding their town and rebuilding their Chamber of Commerce. I feel it was a great honour to attend the Chamber of Commerce dinner on Saturday night-a dinner which, I hasten to add, was organised not by the Chamber of Commerce, but by six year 12 students. I think this is a fine example of what young people have to contribute to this country and to their local communities. I think those six year 12 students ought to be commended, as I believe the Chamber of Commerce in Charleville deserves to be commended for giving young Australians an opportunity to make a contribution to their local community. This, I believe, is outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally outstanding was what the business community of Charleville has done in terms of getting back on the road, restocking the shops, fitting out the bakery again, and ensuring that the ordinary things that we take for granted when we walk into the shops are there for the people of Charleville. Unless that exists, then those people undoubtedly will really feel the despair that the flood brought. At least they had a chance to get on with their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The St Vincent de Paul Society is also making a contribution to the recovery of Charleville. On Sunday it opened its new centre at Charleville. That was very pleasing. This is a shop to which people can come and buy items with a sense of dignity. They do not feel that they are just getting hand-me-downs and unwanted clothes. They can go in in the same way that they walk into Coles, Myers or whatever. I think that is very important because these people have self-respect, as we do. It is very important that, on the road to recovery from the flood in Charleville, they should feel that they are not second-class citizens. I believe that the people of Charleville are outstanding citizens and one can judge that by their courage, determination and the contributions they have made to their local community. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty, ultimately, is that Charleville has a closed economy. There is not a lot of outside trade; the only real source of outside income is the wool industry. We all know that the wool industry is going through a very rough time indeed. Many woolgrowers are facing a 44 to 50 per cent drop in their incomes. For the people of Charleville that means a 44 to 50 per cent drop in the value of the local economy and a 44 to 50 per cent drop in the money that is available to rebuild that township. But the people of Charleville are getting on with the job. Although it is a somewhat distressing situation, they at least have tackled the problem head on and I believe that ultimately Charleville will be rebuilt again. </PARA>
<PARA> Another town that has suffered economic downturn and is on the road back is Kenilworth. Prior to coming down to Canberra for this recent session I had the good fortune to visit the town of Kenilworth and to see what the local people have done to rebuild the fortunes of their town as a result of the economic downturn. One of the principal industries in the Kenilworth area is dairying, which means that the local farmers contribute to the production of milk, butter, cream and cheese. For many years the Kenilworth community had a cheese factory that was operated by Kraft Foods Ltd. Approximately 18 months or two years ago Kraft decided to close down the cheese factory and that meant the loss of many local jobs. It also meant a loss of demand for the products that were made in that area. Some of the local people decided that this was not a satisfactory state of affairs. They organised to buy the factory from Kraft and are now producing quality cheese for the Australian market and, hopefully, for the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited Kenilworth Country Foods. I inspected the facility it has there-and it is a very fine facility indeed-and I also tried the cheeses it produces. It is excellent cheese. I commend that product and the endeavours of those people to honourable senators. I hope that one day we may see Kenilworth Country Foods cheeses here in the Senate for the enjoyment of senators and staff in the relevant dining rooms. But maybe that is some way down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the people of Kenilworth, like the people of Charleville, have a commitment to their local community. They have a sense of where their community is going and what they can do to contribute towards it. I believe that this is very important, very heartening and very good to see. As a Queenslander, I am proud of these people. I believe that, as Australians, all honourable senators ought to be proud of them. Accordingly, I commend the efforts of these fine Queenslanders to honourable senators and to the country as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to overseas aid and some disastrous areas of mismanagement that have flowed from the Budget decision of this Government in that regard. This week the Overseas Service Bureau (OSB), a non-government organisation, announced that it was cancelling its 1991 mid-year departure group of Australian Volunteers Abroad. This means that approximately 50 Australian volunteers will not be able to participate in development assistance work in the poor countries of the world. The cutback is directly due to cuts in Australia's overseas aid budget announced by this Labor Government in August. As well as the cancellation of the mid-year group, the size of the January group will be curtailed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly distressed that such cuts are to take place, affecting the most active non-government organisation in the overseas development field. Ten years ago I was asked by the then Foreign Minister to chair a committee of review into the Overseas Service Bureau. As many honourable senators from that time, and some who are here now, would know, the wide-ranging recommendations in the report we brought forward were fully adopted by the Overseas Service Bureau and, indeed, by the Department of Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I still have confidence in this important organisation and in the program Australian Volunteers Abroad (AVA). I am glad to see that there is increasing interest amongst Australians in supporting and being involved in AVA. This decision, which the Overseas Service Bureau has been forced to make for the first time, is particularly saddening to those of us on both sides of the Parliament who have an interest not only in our continuing the existing level of overseas aid and development assistance to countries in our region in particular, but also in seeing that this particularly effective non-government organisation remains undiminished. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive Director, Mr Bill Armstrong, said that it was an indictment that at the time when applications from well qualified and skilled Australians were up by 50 per cent and requests from developing countries seeking assistance were also increasing, Australia's volunteer program was forced to cut back. Developing countries around us in the Pacific and Asia and also in Africa will be affected by the fact that, because of aid cuts, the Overseas Service Bureau is unable to send volunteers to fill requested positions. This funding cut reduces the OSB's opportunities to provide direct development assistance to our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is an extremely short-sighted cutback of our aid program, which is cost effective and has long lasting benefits in terms both of the technical assistance and the enhanced relationships between countries which it provides. The Australian Government has a responsibility to follow the examples set by other developed countries and adequately fund the volunteer program. That is my view and I put it to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget Paper No. 4, which outlines Australia's overseas aid program for 1990-91, says that we are maintaining in real terms the ratio of 0.33 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as the level of our overseas aid this year, but at other points it acknowledges that there is a $100m fudge in that overall statement. For instance, in Budget Paper No.1 at page 3.306, there is this sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>The increase reflects the fact that payments to international development financial institutions in 1989-90 were artificially low as a result of the rescheduling of $94.0m into 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>So to maintain the same level of assistance this year as compared to last financial year, when there was an artificial lowering, the Government has said that $100m less is to provided for development assistance in this year's Budget. That is also referred to on pages 14 and 36 of Budget Paper No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it entirely clear to all those in Australia who are concerned about overseas development aid that we have seen not only a failure by this Government to maintain last year's level of overseas aid but also a lowering every single year of the Hawke Government. On that point, I wish to make a comparison by reiterating the position of the Opposition with regard to overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties have a strong commitment to Australia's foreign aid program. That commitment is based on a moral responsibility to assist those less fortunate than ourselves and a belief that this responsibility transcends national boundaries. We also believe that an effective foreign aid program is an indispensable part of an effective Australian foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Liberal and National parties continue to support as a goal and to work towards the United Nations objective of applying 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product in foreign aid. In the shorter term, however, Australia faces certain realities. The critical and very vulnerable Australian economy is the product of the Labor Government's mismanagement. Australia's role in international affairs and foreign aid in particular can be enhanced in the long term only if we restore strength to our economy. That urgent task calls for some hard and difficult decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is committed to implementing an effective overseas aid program. We believe that Australia's aid program can be better targeted and more effectively implemented than that currently being administered. In achieving better targeting and implementation of Australia's foreign aid program, the criteria which should be applied to country specific aid programs include levels of national income in recipient countries, the ratio of their military expenditure to gross domestic product and their geographic location. Consistent with the broad principles of our aid program, we favour Australian aid-with the exception of humanitarian assistance-being allocated in a way that gives priority to the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that, in addition to being effective and compassionate, Australia's foreign aid program should have clear objectives against which performance can be assessed. With the exception of humanitarian assistance, foreign aid should be allocated on the basis of improving the economic base of the recipient country and promoting sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties take the view that as far as possible Australia's foreign aid programs should be administered on a bilateral basis. We also believe that greater use of non-government organisations should be made in administering our aid program and that direct investment by the Australian private sector in aid recipient countries should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's record on foreign aid when last in government was significantly better than that of the current Labor Government. During the period of the Fraser Government-1975 to 1983-the average ratio of foreign aid to GNP was 0.45 per cent compared to the average ratio of 0.41 per cent under the Labor Government from 1983 to 1990. Furthermore, the aid to GNP ratio of 0.47 per cent in the last year of the Fraser Government contrasts markedly with the current ratio of 0.33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are important humanitarian, economic and strategic reasons why an effective and compassionate foreign aid program will be an important priority for the coalition parties. Our policies will reflect both the generosity that is called for and the economic responsibility that is necessary. I conclude with the observation that before the last election in the Economic Action Plan of the coalition we announced that the criteria I have referred to in my remarks tonight would lead to a temporary cut in foreign aid, and we outlined what that cut would be. We were honest with the electorate and we set out the exact areas that would be affected. We said that aid to the South Pacific and Papua New Guinea, for example, and humanitarian assistance everywhere, would not be diminished. Rather, any cuts would be in the areas that we specifically defined. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast with this, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gladhanded overseas aid community groups and the churches, saying that they would not themselves be cutting. At the time there was a debate in the final weeks of the election campaign in which we said, `You cannot trust this Government. It might say now that it will keep up development assistance. We are being honest with you. To the extent that we will cut it, we have outlined it'. The paradox is that the actual cut in overseas aid by the Hawke Labor Government is the $100m that we had indicated honestly was to have been our approach initially in the first stage of coming to government after March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it entirely clear, honestly in this chamber and to the Australian public, that we in the Liberal and National parties can be taken at our word, and it should not be counted against us that we have defined the cloth to which our suit must be cut for the reasons that we had outlined honestly to the electorate. In contrast, we have a cut of the same dimensions-some argue more-by this Government in office, which before the last election it piously, hypocritically and misleadingly denied would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> My main burden is that we ought to have a continuing need to review our overseas aid to ensure that we achieve the goals that I have referred to tonight and not to see a cynical government reducing the overseas development assistance that we would be calling for from many sides of the chamber and from the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA>They lead to subordination of weaker nations to bigger powers, and often involve the aligned nations in military interventions. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign military bases on our soil are detrimental to Australia's safety. </PARA>

<PARA>To that advertisement was attached the signature of one R. J. Hawke. I must admit that the advertisement does go back a little in time. It was dated 13 September 1976. The National Times was the newspaper. I think the text of the advertisement is very relevant today in relation to the Gulf crisis. But I want to concentrate my comments tonight on how far the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seems to have moved since that advertisement was placed in 1976. I say `seems to have moved' advisedly because perhaps he has not moved at all. </PARA>
<PARA> To fill in some of the earlier background about our Prime Minister: from 1962 to 1964, when the trade union magazine Spotlight was seen to be infiltrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Australia, was the time when Bob Hawke was very heavily involved in the union movement. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy President. When Mr Hawke was involved in the trade union movement, Robert Walkenshaw, who was named in this Parliament by Clyde Cameron as a CIA agent, was one of several labor attaches at the United States embassy who claimed a close friendship with Bob Hawke. Others were Emil Lindahl, Edward McHale and Jerry O'Keefe, who between them went on to bigger and better things in the service of the CIA; but the links were there from the early 1960s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A little later on, by the early 1970s, Mr Hawke had shown himself to be a fervent zionist and anti-communist, and he forged many links with upcoming United States personnel such as George Shultz, who later became Defense Secretary in the United States Government. At the stage when Bob Hawke first met him, he was associated with a company named Bechtel, which has all kinds of dubious connections. Mr Hawke cultivated these ties while he was a union boss and President of the Australia Labor Party. The United States Ambassador to Australia in the 1970s, Marshal Green, found Hawke-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>so amenable to our common cause that Bob gave me his private phone number and said, `If anything ever comes up that desperately needs some attention, this is the number to call'. </PARA>
<PARA>I am indebted for that remark to John Pilger in his book A Secret Country. By 1981, Mr Hawke was a backbencher. I want to quote from a story that was written by John Edwards, a journalist in Washington. I am quoting from an article written by Brian Toohey on 26 August 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Back in the days when he was an Opposition frontbencher Mr Bob Hawke visited Washington where he stayed with a friend, the Australian journalist Mr John Edwards. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Edwards, who had arranged a number of meetings for Mr Hawke with senior US officials advised him to remain non-committal if anyone raised the issue of home porting US nuclear carriers at Cockburn Sound, near Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Hawke could not help himself in his eagerness to give the Americans the answer he assumed they wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> According to one of the officials present at a meeting in the Pentagon, Mr Hawke was barely in the room before he said: `I hear you people want to home port carriers at Perth. That's OK by me.'</PARA>
<PARA> He went on to explain that there might be some opposition within the Labor Party but he'd handle that. </PARA>
<PARA> The only trouble, as the Pentagon official later explained, was that they did not want to base carriers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea had been mooted by the then Australian Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, but this was seen in the Pentagon as motivated as much by a desire to cause trouble in the Labor Party as anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the words from Mr Hawke since then about how we must become a much closer part of our own region, little has changed in his eagerness to please Washington. </PARA>
<PARA>That is really the theme of my remarks this evening-Mr Hawke's eagerness to please Washington. In 1981, a Mr Alan Carroll, an American-trained economist, gave an address to a group of senior executives of 19 corporations gathered for a meeting in Melbourne under the auspices of Business International. This is a worldwide multinational organisation which was expressing concern about Bill Hayden's leadership of the Labor Party-at that stage he was a known republican and a democratic socialist-and it was exploring the corporate risks in the Australian political environment should the Labor Party take office in 1983. It was a bit far off the mark, was it not?</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier, in December 1977, the New York Times had exposed Business International's clandestine links with the CIA. In his speech, Mr Alan Carroll forecast a Labor Party victory in 1983. At this stage, the Labor Party was in opposition under the leadership of Bill Hayden. He talked about the rise of Bob Hawke and predicted that he would be leader by the middle of 1982. He was exactly right, of course. In his speech, Alan Carroll said of the transfer of leadership from Hayden to Hawke:</PARA>
<PARA>It's all under way. The game plan is totally under way. I forecast 3 : 5 on a Hawke Government in '83. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that Business International would be meeting with Mr Hawke every six months from then on and he considered this `terribly important'. I think it is terribly important that Australians know of those very close links that were deliberately cultivated by Mr Hawke before he became Prime Minister. I think that since 1983, when he came into office as Prime Minister, his one main aim has been to stay in power-not to go the way of Whitlam but to stay in power with the blessing of the United States Administration. That is the best way he could figure out to do it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do think it is shocking. There ought to be national interests involved and there ought to be a national agenda for the well-being of the Australian people involved in the prime ministership, not merely the hanging on to power. He was determined not to go the way of Whitlam. He had seen what had happened to Whitlam in 1975. He had seen that an Australian Prime Minister who had dared to question the presence of United States military bases on Australian soil would find himself destabilised, moved over and out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Well before Mr Hawke got the Prime Ministership he had made it very clear to Washington that if he became Prime Minister he would not be such a worry to Washington. That has been his main aim-to stay there with the blessing of the United States administration. He can only do it with the blessing of the Australian administration, when one considers what happened to Whitlam. Of course, I am not saying that the CIA was solely responsible for the removal of Whitlam from office, but it certainly had a hand in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent example of Mr Hawke's grovelling subservience to things American was his very quick--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to give the most recent example of Mr Hawke's very quick response to United States initiatives, and to demonstrate again his willingness to please the Americans before he even consults members of his own Cabinet. Of course, this was the response to the Gulf crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hawke was challenged about this on the ABC Four Corners program on 3 September 1990 by Debra Snow, and he was asked why he had been so quick to commit the Australian warships to the Gulf region. This is an extract from the 7.30 Report on 10 August 1990 when Mr Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . two things to be said about that. Firstly, already the presence of Western European forces there, the British, Italians and the Dutch; and secondly, that NATO is meeting today in Paris where the question of their involvement will be further discussed in detail. So I have no doubt that we will see a significant Western European involvement as well. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Four Corners program on 3 September, Debra Snow said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Dutch, in fact, were not, at that time, in the area. They didn't announce a naval deployment until August 13th, after consultation with other Europeans. And then it was only to support sanctions in a peaceful way. The Italians-ditto. Australia apparently sought a simultaneous announcement with Canada, but Canadian leader, Mulroney, took time to call his Cabinet together and get a report back from NATO. The French were taking their own action, unwilling to come under the umbrella of a US-led force. We were, in effect, third cab off the rank, after the United States and Britain. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke misled the Australian people when he made that comment on the ABC Four Corners program. He should have known very well that the Italians and the Dutch were not already committed to a military presence in the Gulf at that time. It is a very serious matter for the Prime Minister to be misleading the Australian people, and I doubt very much whether he could claim to have been confused or misinformed. After all, he had done all of the negotiating almost single-handed; he had not checked with members of his Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, came the chicken and egg question about which came first, the US request for Australian ships in the Gulf or the Australian offer. It really does not matter very much, the point remains that Mr Hawke was determined to please the Americans and to be seen to be pleasing them very early on in this military posturing that has gone on in the Gulf ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> One must ask what is it that we are actually defending? The hypocrisy in the reasons given for Australia's involvement has been absolutely astonishing. Kuwait is a profitable piece of real estate, owned by a privately owned offshore corporation, and that is how it could best be described. More than half its inhabitants are indentured labourers drawn from non-Arab countries. These are the people who are now the pathetic refugees in their thousands dying in the desert in Jordan and causing an enormous amount of suffering and concern to their home countries-India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and so on, mostly from the Indian subcontinent. They had, as workers in Kuwait, no civil or political rights and no trade unions. It is a capitalist's dream-a blueprint for the future. The United States Government wants to restore the installed-to-suit Emir-the disgustingly wealthy oil lord who makes no attempt to share the benefits of the oil resources, which are a gift from the earth, hardly earned by the royal family of Kuwait. Ordinary Australians are being asked to sacrifice their lives and millions of taxpayers' dollars for that. It is an outrageous situation. Principle, according to Bob Hawke, is about large nations taking over smaller nations. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Hawke has been saying that we cannot stand by and allow large nations to take over small nations. Of course he is very silent about the Indonesian takeover of East Timor. I know it has been mentioned before, but I think it has to be mentioned again. One cannot have such a hypocritical double standard and expect to be respected by the Australian people as the Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest effort that has just come to hand, courtesy of the Sydney Morning Herald today, is the effort over Panama when the Prime Minister, again in his willingness to please the Americans, actually directed the Australian team at the United Nations to change their vote on the question of the United States invasion of Panama last December. I quote from the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia switched from opposing outside interference in Panama to supporting the United States invasion of the country last year after President Bush telephoned Mr Hawke, according to Government documents. </PARA>
<PARA> They show that Australia's position on Panama-outlined in a ministerial brief prepared only two days before the invasion-was changed to accord with the Prime Minister's statements on the day after the attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, Mr Hawke decided to support the invasion without consulting his ministers or advisers, according to officials. </PARA>
<PARA>This is becoming rather a bad habit but we did not know until today that he did this before over the Panama issue. I applaud Paul Grigson of the Sydney Morning Herald for applying for this information under the Freedom of Information Act and for exposing it in a front page story. His article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A ministerial Material brief dated December 18 says the Government supported strongly a ``peaceful and constitutional restoration of democracy'' in Panama.</PARA>
<PARA> The brief note of the shooting of the US off-duty serviceman and called for restraint on the part of the US and Panama. </PARA>
<PARA> The brief was changed on 21 December, the day after the invasion, to support the reasoning behind the US attack, saying Australia understood the action. </PARA>
<PARA> The briefs are included in documents released to the Herald under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has censored the documents heavily, mostly on the ground that disclosure of their contents would damage its relationship with the US. </PARA>
<PARA>That is curious indeed. Because we have to protect our relationship with the United States, the Australian people are not allowed to have information given to them about what our Prime Minister has been up to on our behalf-even under the Freedom of Information Act. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In instructions sent from Canberra, Australia's UN bureau was instructed to support the US in all substantive and procedural proposals on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> They were told: ``Why we would clearly hope to have as much company as possible in the position we adopt . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And that is very interesting if one thinks about what Mr Hawke said about Australia's involvement in Kuwait-we did not need to wait for company. He said, `We would like to get as much company as possible'. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our primary criterion is to give appropriate support to the United States, consistent with the Prime Minister's public statement and his conversation with President Bush. </PARA>
<PARA>At the final count 75 countries voted again the invasion and 40 abstained. Twenty, including Australia, approved. That is how closely we line up with the United States. Even though our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its wisdom decided that we should not support the invasion of Panama by the United States in December last year, the Prime Minister overrode that advice after a call from President Bush and gave him unqualified Australian support. I find it very difficult to make my remarks restrained because this is not behaviour befitting an elected Prime Minister of any country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention another quite recent example where Mr Hawke again supported the Americans, and this time not against the interests of the general international community as was the case in the Panama invasion. In that instance, I might add, I was the only person in this whole Parliament who spoke against the United States invasion of Panama. Everybody else on both sides of this chamber and in the other place was cheering support. I think it is very important that there be a voice raised against the takeover or the invasion of a small country by a large country. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest example that I want to get on to now is the question of the disposal of chemical weapons at Johnston Atoll over which the Prime Minister embarrassed himself greatly at the South Pacific Forum. Mr Hawke was using United States Defense Department documentation and calling it Australian scientific opinion. This is a misrepresentation of the facts. He was doing that in support of the United States plans to incinerate chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll. This certainly dented his credibility in the South Pacific and at that Forum, and these are the people with whom we should be having very close relationships. He keeps espousing it all the time and yet he is prepared to stab them in the back. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the same old theme-back up the United States Administration no matter what, with very little regard for the sensitivities of Pacific Island nations. How dare our Prime Minister serve the United States while ignoring the interests of our own close neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> An update on that story since the South Pacific Forum is very interesting. I am quoting from the Pacific News Bulletin for this update:</PARA>
<PARA>Pacific Island leaders were barely home from the South Pacific Forum Meeting when new information surfaced on the contentious issue of incinerating chemical weapons at Johnson Atoll. The Pentagon confirmed that the controversial Johnston Atoll Chemical Agents Disposal System (JACADS) had been closed since a test burn commenced on June 30th. And U.S. Army documents revealed that Johnston Atoll could be used as a storage base for US weapons into the 21st century, not simply as a short-term facility for their destruction. The first shutdown of JACADS lasted ten days from July 4 to 14. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a certain irony that the second shutdown was from 21 July to 3 August-the very time when Australia's Prime Minister was attempting to persuade forum countries of JACADS' safety, with the help of three scientific assessments commissioned by the Australian Government, shown later to have come directly from the US Defense Department. Later in the bulletin:</PARA>
<PARA> Forum spokesperson PNG Prime Minister Namaliu said at the time that it was very unsatisfactory that Australia had provided the scientific assessment only at the last minute. `They left it too late, in our view deliberately, so that we weren't given the time to make the assessment of information, and then to ask the right sorts of questions'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Namaliu went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>`In the minds of most of us we suspect very strongly that there is some kind of collusion going on between the US and Australia, in making sure that this thing was kept to the last minute, and we don't like it.'</PARA>
<PARA> Such an approach, he added, had created a great deal of suspicion and mistrust. Solomon Islands Deputy Prime Minister Phillips went further suggesting that Mr Hawke had been, `two- faced' and that Australia's performance raised questions about whether it should be a member of the forum.</PARA>
<PARA>That is how strongly people felt about the duplicity of the Australian Prime Minister over this question of the incineration--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the remark. We can only wonder what impact the shutdown information would have had on the final discussion if it had been known at the time. Of course, it was not revealed until a little later. The Pacific News Bulletin said later: about the incineration of the chemicals:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The final Forum communique bristled with phrases like `grave concern', `urgent discussions' and `significant uncertainties and risks'</PARA>
<PARA>The bulletin continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Issued after a protracted and sometimes emotional debate, the communique described the US proposal as `another example of the Pacific being used by the major weapons producers as an experimental area'. </PARA>
<PARA>Following on from that:</PARA>
<PARA>At the post-forum meeting, the United States was to be asked for details about whether in fact the weapons coming from Germany would be destroyed and, if so, with what timetable. New information had come to light during the Forum, suggesting that the U.S. has no binding commitment to destroy the chemical weapons coming from Germany to Johnston Atoll. According to documents which reached the press in the first week of August, a U.S. army general had told a closed meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee in June in Washington that `virtually all the munitions . . . in Germany are maintained in a fully serviceable combat-ready condition'. He added, `This portion of the unitary stock, which is the most modern of our unitary stock, will likely be the last to be demilitarized. Storage at Johnston Island will be required for these munitions . . . partially from the point of view of when the facilities become available for demilitarisation and partially depending on the world situation.'</PARA>
<PARA>So these munitions are to be left there in a ready-to-go phase, until or if required by the United States Government. That is not what had been presented to the Pacific Island nations. I am sure that Mr Hawke, who is so closely aligned with the United States Government, knows that, yet he was trying to present this as quite a safe disposal method and suggesting that the Pacific Island nations were being unduly concerned about their own welfare. It is quite astonishing. </PARA>
<PARA> I could say a lot more. For example, I could mention the 10-year renewal of leases for bases in Australia such as Pine Gap and Nurrungar. I have spoken about those issues before. I think it is a great shame that Australia has as a Prime Minister someone who seems to be more enthusiastic about supporting the United States Government and kowtowing to it rather than to the people of Australia. I long for the day when we have a Prime Minister to stand up for the ideals mentioned at the beginning, that is, for an independent and non-aligned Australia-the very words to which Mr Hawke was prepared to be a signatory back in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> I represent hundreds of thousands, probably millions, of Australians inside and outside the Labor Party who are totally disillusioned with the Prime Minister. They would prefer that he was not Prime Minister of this country, because of his actions in regard to the United States and his appearing to put United States interests ahead of our own and ahead of our neighbours in the Pacific and our neighbours in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that I supported Mr Hawke in 1983. I would have preferred to support Bill Hayden in that election, but I did not know then a lot of what I know now. Now, seven years on, the Labor Party is led by Mr Hawke. I believe that the Labor Party is fast running out of the principles which it has held proud for so long, which is why so many people have voted away from the Labor Party. The Democrats and Greens in Western Australia got 18 per cent of the vote between them in the March 1990 election. Therefore, I believe that we have a right to demand input, not only on environment issues, which are, of course, important to the Greens, but also on foreign affairs and defence issues, which are equally important to the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA> As to cynicism about the Australian Labor Party leadership, senior Government Ministers are now daring to say that the Green vote around the country is no longer important and was not significant in winning the election. I would like members of the Cabinet to ask the six marginal seat holders in Western Australia who retained their seats for the Labor Party-some of whom are in the Cabinet, incidentally, such as Mr Beazley-just how they felt on 24 March about the Greens' preferences generally flowing in their direction. I believe that I have every right to speak as an elected representative of hundreds of thousands and possibly many more people around Australia who are equally fed up with the lack of principled leadership, who see these great changes that have taken place in seven years, and who see the quick support of the American military intervention in the Gulf as just another example of our Prime Minister kowtowing to Washington. We wish that it would stop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 1 June 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What obstacles are delaying the long awaited direct air link between Australia and Taiwan?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does the Australian Government realise the extent to which its negative attitude to Taiwan is resulting in a great loss of economic opportunity for increased trade between our two countries?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2495" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government supports the establishment of direct airlinks with Taiwan. Australia/Asia Airlines, a Qantas subsidiary, has been negotiating with Taiwan interests since early 1989 for the establishment of a direct airlink. Negotiations have had to be conducted within the framework of Australia's recognition of the People's Republic China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China and our acknowledgement that Taiwan is a province of China. Since there are no official relations between Australia and Taiwan, there can be no government-to-government agreement on a direct airlink. Nevertheless, commercial negotiations for a direct Taiwan airlink are continuing, and it is the Government's hope that a workable commercial agreement will soon be reached.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government does not have a negative attitude towards trade with Taiwan and trade has in fact steadily increased. Bilateral trade with Taiwan has grown from $2.9 billion in 1987 to $3.8 billion in 1989, making Taiwan Australia's sixth-largest export market.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian interests are well-represented by the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) in Taipei, which operates under the auspices of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. The ACIO has a vigorous trade and investment promotion program and, in conjunction with the Australian Consulate General in Hong Kong, offers a visa facilitation service which, in 1989, enabled Taiwan to become Australia's second-largest source of business migrants. In March l990,-an Australian Education Centre was established in Taiwan to market Australian education services. In Australia, a Taiwan Market Service was established on 1 November 1988 to assist Australian business to identify and develop opportunities in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1989, the Government introduced legislation designed to reassure investors from unrecognised international entities, including Taiwan, about the security of their investments in Australia. The Government recognises the importance of Taiwan as a trading partner, source of investment, tourism and migration. It has given strong support to the private sector in its efforts to expand commercial relations, including support for the negotiations to establish a direct airlink and for the ongoing efforts of Australian industry to negotiate reduced tariffs on Australian beef exports. The government has made clear its support for Taiwan, as a significant economy in the region, becoming a member of APEC, along with the PRC and Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy of active support for the expansion of Australia's commercial and unofficial links with Taiwan, within the framework of our``one China'' policy, has contributed to the development of a vigorous and productive commercial relationship between Australia and Taiwan.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Is it correct that the Minister, in announcing the increased humanitarian and development assistance of up to $15 million over the next 3 years, stated that the majority of the new funds is to go to the African National Congress (ANC); the only Marxist/Communist group.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Why the ANC was selected ahead of the other groups.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) What other groups received an allocation and what amount.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2496" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The South African Year Book for 1989/90 (page 80) lists 12 major population groups. The South African Government has indicated that it envisages a constitutional settlement that will give legal protection to groups which wish to maintain and practise their own language and culture.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On 17 May, while attending the Fifth Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Meeting on Southern Africa in Abuja, Nigeria, I announced that Australia would increase humanitarian and development assistance to South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid and to representative black groups. The funding of up to $15 million over the next three years will be channelled through the existing Special Assistance Program (SAPSAN) which is administered by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. The majority of the new funds will be earmarked for assistance to ANC-identified humanitarian and educational activities, including the repatriation of South Africans living in exile. It is Government policy that funds will not be given direct to the ANC.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite inaccurate to describe the ANC as a Marxist/Communist group. The ANC is a broadly based liberation movement, bringing together South Africans with widely differing ideological views and opinions, and including within its ranks members of the South African Communist Party.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government has long recognised the ANC as foremost amongst the authentic black leadership of South Africa. My decision to earmark for the ANC the majority of the new funds recognised the pivotal role that the ANC will play during South Africa's difficult process of social and political change. This is a position, I might add, that has also been recognised by the South African Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No funds have been earmarked to other groups, apart from the current commitments detailed below. But, as in the past, viable proposals (as judged by AIDAB) put forward by other South African organisations will be eligible for generous Australian funding.</PARA>
<PARA> A substantial amount of the SAPSAN funds, including some of the amount earmarked for ANC identified activities, is likely to be channelled to non-partisan groups in South Africa, such as church organisations, educational institutions and non-government organisations within South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> An example of this is the recent payment of $187,000 from the $2 million allocated for the resettlement and repatriation of exiles. These funds were channelled through the Australian NGO APHEDA to the South African Council of Churches, a non-denominational and politically neutral church body, to help set up the National Co-ordinating Committee. Non-ANC exiles will be eligible for assistance as well as ANC. The balance of the $2 million for the repatriation assistance is expected to be provided through similar apolitical channels, subject to the findings of the recent AIDAB SAPSAN Review and Programming Mission.</PARA>
<PARA> $2 million of the SAPSAN funds for the period 1990/91 to 1992/93 have not been earmarked for use by specific organisations, but will be used to meet ongoing commitments (set out below) and other activities as approved.</PARA>
<PARA>$,000</PARA>
<PARA>* Training in Australia for continuing students (SWAPO, PAC)</PARA>
<PARA>236</PARA>
<PARA>* Funds channelled through Australian NGOs</PARA>
<PARA>982</PARA>
<PARA>* Ongoing support to Multilateral organisations assisting South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid (Some support can be expected to continue, but the amounts and timing have not yet been determined).</PARA>
<PARA>NA</PARA>
<PARA>* Program administrative support (est.)</PARA>
<PARA>240</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance to South African victims of apartheid that is not``ANC identified'' is provided not only from SAPSAN funds, but also under programs arising from the meetings of the CFMSA. An example of this is support provided to the Southern Africa Advance Training Trust (SAATT). Support to other CFMSA activities such as media training and assistance to the South Africa Financial Links Monitoring Agency will continue in 1990/91.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 1 June 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Since the Child Support Agency was established how many people have applied for and been granted a Supporting Parent's Benefit.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2497" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In March 1989 Supporting Parent's Benefit and Class A Widow's Pension were merged into Sole Parent's Pension. From 1 June 1988 (the commencement date of stage one of the Child Support Scheme) to 30 June 1990, an estimated 221 000 new grants of Supporting Parent's Benefit, Class A Widow's Pension or Sole Parent Pension were made. In addition, an estimated 4000 people transferred into one of these categories from other pension types.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The decision to provide an exemption from the requirement to take action to obtain maintenance in a particular case is a discretionary one, often made on the recommendation of a social worker following an interview with the client. Such an interview usually occurs when a sole parent pensioner has indicated a reluctance to take such action. Because this process does not involve the lodgment of a formal application for exemption, information is not available on the numbers of sole parent pensioners who have sought the exemption.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Details of exemptions granted are held on the Maintenance Action Indicator (MAI), a record included in my Department's Pensions computing system. The MAI was introduced in November 1989. Information on exemptions is available only for current pensioners granted since the commencement of stage two of the Child Support Scheme. At 20 July 1990 there were 62 699 people receiving Sole Parent's Pension granted on or after 1 October 1989 (when stage two of the Scheme started). Of these, 13% (7344) had been granted a permanent exemption. The reasons for exemption were:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) where clients fear that, if they take action for maintenance, the non-custodial parent will react violently toward them or their family (1083 cases);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) where clients do not know the identity of the fathers of the children (2085 cases);</PARA>
<PARA> (c) where circumstances exist in which it would be a harmful or unreasonable imposition to expect clients to seek maintenance-for example, where the child was born as a result of rape or incest (3126 cases);</PARA>
<PARA> (d) where a non-custodial parent is deceased (2001 cases).</PARA>
<PARA>There are also exemptions of a temporary kind available to take account of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) situations where the sole parent pensioner cannot take maintenance action at a particular time but where the circumstances may change and the case, therefore, is subject to periodic review- for example, where the non-custodial parent (NCP) is in gaol or overseas (990 cases) and stage one cases where the NCP's income is too low or the NCP's whereabouts are unknown (4492 cases); and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a range of circumstances where the sole parent pensioner is taking action to obtain child support but this process is not yet completed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The normal business hours of Regional Offices of the Department of Social Security in Queensland are 8.30am to 4.30pm Monday to Friday. However, public contact areas may be closed from 1.30pm each Tuesday.</PARA>
<PARA>The switchboard remains open during these closures. Any case considered to be an emergency is passed to the appropriate officer for immediate action.
