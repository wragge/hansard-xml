<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer the Minister to the Prime Minister's statement reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 27 June 1987 that, `I am very, very confident that Australia has gone through the worst, that the crisis has bottomed and that we are not going to have the repetition of that loss of national income'. I also refer the Minister to the Prime Minister's statement on the AM program this morning that, `Our view is that we are approaching the bottom of the downturn'. I ask the Minister: When will we reach the bottom of the downturn? Are we in a recession? What confidence can the Australian people have in these statements given the Prime Minister's consistent failure to deliver in the past?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In June 1987 when the Prime Minister made those remarks, which Senator Short has quoted, he was no doubt referring to the very difficult circumstance which the economy had been through in 1986 as a result of the precipitate fall of the dollar. When he was speaking this morning he was not just expressing a view which the Government has but, I think, a view which is pretty widely held at least in large sections of the business community. For example, a number of sectors of the Australian economy-for instance, those companies associated with the production of building supplies and so on-take the view that the current downturn has bottomed. There are differences of opinion about that and so on within the business community, but that is a view, as I say, which is shared by more people outside this Parliament than the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short asked me whether the economy was in recession or not. There are all sorts of technical answers to that question. I think the technical answer is probably no. When we last had circumstances of the current kind it was in 1982 and at that time, as I recall it, the economy was in negative growth for four quarters-four quarters in a row. Unemployment rose very rapidly to a figure exceeding 10 per cent and wages rose very rapidly. There was a whole range of circumstances in 1982 which are different from the circumstances at the current time. One can debate whether or not there is a technical recession. That is a pretty esoteric argument, I think. Nobody would shrink from the view that the economy is in a period of significant downturn.</PARA>

It is not a matter about which I am particularly expert-any more than Senator Short or a number of economists who have different views about this matter are; it is not a matter about which I can speculate. I think the Prime Minister's view, expressed this morning, is that we are approaching the bottom of the downturn, and there is no reason for disbelieving that view.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the Government's current assessment of the likelihood of conflict in the Gulf? Has the Government's policy position altered in any way on the question of the Gulf crisis? What is the Government's attitude to certain private initiatives being organised in Australia and elsewhere to secure the release of hostages being held by Iraq?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3469" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the immense media focus of the last few days, there has been no basic change in the Gulf outlook, in our assessment, since I last described that outlook in this chamber. Nor has there been any change in Australian Government policy. It remains our strong hope that the objectives enshrined in the United Nations (UN) resolutions-that is, the complete withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait and the freeing of all hostages-will be able to be achieved peacefully. It remains our belief that these objectives are capable of being achieved peacefully through the sustained and effective application of economic sanctions by the international community. It is quite premature to make the judgment at this stage that that strategy has failed or will fail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It also remains the case that the military strike option must remain available in the event that the UN objectives do prove to be unachievable by other means. We hope against hope that war will not be necessary but the stakes are such-not just for the West, not just for the Gulf states, but for the whole future peace of the world-that war simply cannot be ruled out.</PARA>
<PARA> On the hostage question, we and every other country with hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait have striven constantly and assiduously through every available diplomatic means to secure the release of all our hostages. In common with every other government with hostages there, we have taken the view that the strength of the international reaction against Iraq and Saddam Hussein is its solidarity, and that that solidarity is compromised by unilateral attempts to negotiate the release of a particular country's hostages. If what is involved is not so much an attempt to negotiate separate terms but simply to plead, on humanitarian or related grounds, for the release of particular people or categories of hostage, the issues are a little bit more finely balanced.</PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the release of any persons from the awful situation in which they and their families presently find themselves, and again we have indicated we will not put any obstacles in the way of those who in good faith believe that they have something to contribute to bring this about. But it still, unhappily, remains the case that efforts of this kind tend to compromise the larger objectives we all share-in particular, getting Iraq out of Kuwait and getting all the hostages released. Every release generates some degree of favourable publicity for Saddam Hussein, diverting attention from the crime he continues to commit by keeping anyone there at all. Every release contributes thereby an extra layer of division and confusion to a situation about whose basic moral simplicity we must remain absolutely clear. Every release in that way prolongs the advantage for Saddam Hussein in continuing to play the hostage card and in that way, in turn, makes the situation worse for the great majority of hostages who remain.</PARA>
<PARA> There are basic problems, then, in any official or unofficial envoy effort of the kind which has been proliferating. The European Council at its meeting in late October made clear the objections that were held to government negotiated initiatives of that kind. A further meeting of the Community Foreign Ministers is being held today at which the issue will be revisited. It is for all these reasons that the Australian Government and, we believe, other governments are simply not in the position of officially sponsoring or encouraging exercises of this kind, however well motivated they may be.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, our reluctance is all the greater when the person in question has adopted a posture of opposition to Australian or to other international involvement in the Gulf crisis and, indeed, a posture of overt sympathy and understanding for Iraq. Whatever propaganda advantage there is for Iraq generally in these situations is multiplied dramatically when the person being rewarded, as it were, by some hostage release is someone who is perceived-for better or worse, whatever his intentions-as an apologist for Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA> We will continue to do everything we possibly can in conjunction with the international community to get all our people out as soon as we can. The best way to do this, in our judgment, is to do nothing that will increase Iraq's confidence, nothing that will prolong Iraq's resistance to the mass of world opinion for any day longer than needs to be the case.</PARA>

<TITLE>SALE OF MIRAGE AIRCRAFT TO PAKISTAN</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="3471" SPEAKER="Hill Sen R.M." NAMEID="BH4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to assurances he gave to the Estimates Committee meeting of 11 September when he said that the Government of India acknowledges that the sale of Australian Mirages to Pakistan would not represent a net addition of any significance to Pakistan's actual military capability; that delivery was not likely to occur before the new year; and that the Indian Government was at ease, publicly and privately, in relation to the sale of Mirages. I refer the Minister to statements by the Indian High Commission that India expresses its dismay and unhappiness about the sale; that the decision to go ahead with the sale is contrary to assurances given by the Foreign Minister during his talks with the External Affairs Minister in New Delhi in August 1990; and that the manner in which the sale was announced and the lack of sensitivity in its timing and to India's expressed concerns, overlooking understandings given at the highest levels, led India to doubt the Australian Government's appreciation of India's commitment to peace in the subcontinent. Can the Minister explain the divergence between what he says is the position of the Indian Government and the public statements of the Indian High Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3471" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot explain what goes on in the minds of Indian High Commissioners who get things as fundamentally wrong as this particular gentleman did on this occasion. All I can say for the record is that what was said in that exchange in Melbourne by the Indian High Commissioner-and, indeed, in any earlier statement to similar effect coming out of the Foreign Ministry in Delhi-was fundamentally wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is, as I have said to this chamber on numerous occasions, that the matter was satisfactorily resolved in Delhi on the basis that Australia made clear that we would not review the Mirage sale, whatever its merits-it was history-other than in a situation where hostilities broke out between Pakistan and India or such hostilities were imminent. By hostilities, as I said in answer to Senator Durack in this chamber some weeks ago, we clearly meant a situation of full scale war between the two countries. We wanted to avoid a situation where there would be ambiguity or some subsequent recrimination by taking a literalist position in an environment where clearly the situation was dramatically headed downhill and war was imminent within a matter perhaps of a week or two weeks by relying on some legalistic interpretation of there not being hostilities where obviously the situation was such as to demand a review so, for that reason, I used the expression `where hostilities were imminent'. That was, I believe, well understood and I used similar terminology in public and in private in both India and Pakistan. I am not saying that there was universal ecstasy about that particular outcome, but it was accepted and on that basis difficulties we have been having in the bilateral relationship were overcome, meetings were resumed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the timing of the delivery?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. I want to make it absolutely clear that that was the agreed-in the sense I have described it-formula. I believe there is no basis for revisiting that formula or seeking to argue that in some sense currently hostilities are imminent in a way that was not the case at the time that I had the discussions in India. Indeed, I do not believe that is the nub of the issue so far as the Indian spokesmen were concerned. What appears to be the nub of the issue is a further comment I made-again, both privately in direct exchanges with the Minister and officials, and also publicly in almost identical terms-to the effect that in any event it appeared unlikely that the Mirages would be delivered until the new year. I explained why I made that judgment. A period until the end of October was allowed under the defence contract for the sorting out of the transport arrangements. At the time of my visit to Delhi, which I think was in August, no arrangements had been made. It was a reasonable assumption, as I said to my interlocutors, that the lead time on these deliveries would necessarily be of some months. It certainly appeared that the Pakistan Government was in no rush to secure a delivery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Against the background of that explanation as to why I used the language I did, I certainly said-and I quite frankly acknowledge it-that it did not seem likely that there would be such a delivery until early in the new year. What subsequently happened was that a few weeks ago the Pakistan Government, before the end of the October deadline, not only set in train arrangements for transport, but in fact despatched a ship almost simultaneously from Pakistan which led to a delivery schedule around about now for at least the first batch of the aircraft in question.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no question of any assurance being given of a deferral until early in the new year; it was simply an explanation of the circumstances. I believe that was very well understood in India by the Minister and by the Government, and I am very surprised and disappointed as a result that the matter was aired in the way that it was by the High Commissioner. It seemed to me to be an excursion without justification.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Administrative Services whether he would inform the Senate of the outcome, if any, of the meeting of the Australian Council of Service Ministers in Perth last week. Also, can he inform the Senate, in light of the positive response of all States to the Special Premiers Conference, whether a cooperative approach to government purchasing is likely to be adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3472" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; He is right; service Ministers met in Perth at the end of October and discussed basically two major issues. One was the question of government purchasing and the other was the Federal Government's highly successful Purchase Australia campaign. I am pleased to announce that by the end of the meeting all State and Territory governments endorsed our strategy-a strategy aimed at increasing the impact of the combined $30 billion government annual purchasing bill on the nation's industry. This endorsement will build on the Federal Government's Purchase Australia campaign and the national preference agreement which was implemented in 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, I ask the Senate to note that the New South Wales Government has supported the campaign and endorsed the strategy. This stands very starkly in contrast to the carping, whingeing Opposition attitude expressed not only by Senator Parer but also by Mr Prosser. Their responses and attitudes have been such that Senator Parer, I think, called this a `communist plot'. He made no endeavour to find out what the Government's campaign is about.</PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to see, however, that all State governments, as I said, including New South Wales, have seen value in the approach we are taking. It is a responsible approach. It is one that is good for Australian business. It is one that has been recognised by business as being such.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Ministers agreed to form a national supply group to recommend ways in which the concept of value for money can be targeted towards stimulating Australian industry. That group, we anticipate, will develop a strategy plan and that plan will be discussed and endorsed, I hope, at the next meeting of the Ministerial Council. It should be recognised that we are talking about big bikkies when we are talking about government purchasing. Thirty billion dollars is the combined purchasing vote of State and Federal governments. The more of that money that we can direct towards local, competitive Australian products, the better it is for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> I instance the fact that every $1m that is spent to replace imports creates approximately 35 jobs and returns a net benefit of over $440,000 to governments and about $260,000 to consumers. State governments recognise the importance of it; it is a pity that the Opposition does not.</PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I also say that the campaign is based on a very simple principle-a principle of adopting a value for money concept rather than adhering to the traditional lowest price attitude. By doing so, government programs can enhance the capabilities of industry, can increase the potential of domestic industry to have access to government purchasing and, as a consequence, can increase the potential for a fair go for Australian businesses.</PARA>

<PARA> As to the question of Australia's likely military response in the event that hostilities do break out in the way that I indicated earlier, we cannot exclude such a response from the realm of possibility.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made the point that we hope against hope that war will not be necessary in this situation. I think it is acknowledged that, if full-scale ground war does break out in the area of Kuwait, there is a very real danger indeed that the infrastructure of that city-state will be very largely destroyed. That is an outcome that nobody prefers. But we are faced with a situation where there has been naked exercise of aggression in circumstances which are not only of significance for the country of Kuwait, or, as I have said earlier today, for the Gulf, or simply for the developed and developing world because of its implications for the future of the Gulf region and oil supplies, but also of immense significance for the future peace of the world in the post-war era. It is crucially important that this particular act of aggression not be allowed to succeed. We all want to achieve that through the application of sanctions policy and associated diplomacy; none of us wants to see a war becoming necessary. But beyond that I cannot say anything more than that, if a war is necessary, if at the end of the day the military strike option is the only one that will bring that situation about, then it is a result that we have to be prepared to contemplate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to start by saying that mum and dad and the kids are entitled to their holidays this year, and they are entitled to their holidays with a full leave loading. The reason they are is that they have practised wage restraint during the course of the year, and they have practised wage restraint under the accord during the period of this Government. The leave loading is significant because it enables Mr and Mrs Australia to afford to have a holiday. Therefore, since it was first awarded in 1972 it is entitled still to be observed now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been a couple of peculiar interjections. One was about rising unemployment and restraint generally. I will take those interjections. I think the question of restraint and who should exercise it is a very good argument. Several times in this chamber I have talked about high executive and professional salaries in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that what Clyde Cameron was talking about?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to Clyde Cameron next. The interjections can queue up. Their salaries were ripping well ahead of ordinary wage and salary earners' wage incomes. If anyone wants to exercise restraint and call for it, then restraint should be equitable. It should be across the board. It should be fair to all. No one should break out and everyone should observe it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go to the record of who has been observing it and who has not been observing it. Taking figures on salary movements in Australia in 1984-85, the salaries of senior managers went up 10 per cent, with wage earners' salaries rising 6.8 per cent. In 1985-86 senior managers received an 11.5 per cent increase, wage earners 6.4 per cent; in 1986-87, senior managers 11.9 and wage earners 6.9; in 1987-88, senior managers 11.4 and wage earners 5.9; in 1988-89, senior managers 11.4 and wage earners 7.4; and last year, senior managers received 10.5 and wage earners 7.2. There is an example of inequitable restraint.</PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Mr Howard has done nothing to call upon senior executives in this country to exercise the same restraint as ordinary wage and salary earners. I repeat that mum and dad and the kids are entitled to their holiday this year and they are not entitled to have it ripped off them by stunts such as that which Mr Howard is pulling because the Opposition does not have a wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the second interjection, relating to Clyde Cameron. Clyde Cameron is just plain wrong. It may be that his memory is totally defective. He seems to be donning some sort of theoretical hair shirt today, saying that he is responsible for introducing the leave loading. He is not. The leave loading was first achieved within the Commission in November 1972, before the election of the Labor Government. Mr Cameron, who was Minister for Labour after the election of the Whitlam Government, did not preside over its introduction into the Australian Public Service until December 1973. The industry in which it was introduced in 1972 was the metal trades industry which, as everyone knows, is a benchmark for other industries. It flowed substantially through the economy before Mr Cameron came on the scene. So Mr Cameron is just wrong and the record should be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA> While I am correcting the record, another statement was made in this silly stunt style of debate yesterday by Dr Hewson, who said that Australia is the only country where people receive more money when they are on holidays than at work. That statement is inherently wrong in itself because it is not true to say that most Australians receive more money when on holidays than at work because at work they receive a whole host of other award provisions and they work overtime. I have only taken the opportunity to look at Europe, but I can identify Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and West Germany as all having similar, and in most cases much more beneficial, leave loadings than apply in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In West Germany it is usual for a person to receive pay plus a bonus of up to an additional month's salary when going on leave; in Norway a person can receive normal pay plus an 11.2 per cent loading which is built into pay during the whole of the year as a holiday bonus; and so on through this list. Mr Hewson, who has bought into this debate as well is, just like Mr Cameron, wrong. Before one starts to talk about restraint and who should exercise it, one ought to look at equitability.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that if one does not have a wages policy-and the Opposition does not-one cannot govern in this country and one cannot run the economy. We have a wages policy, we can govern in this country and we have governed because of it. At the last election it was said, `If you don't control wages you can't govern'. The electors recognised that and rejected the Opposition. There is no basis for the Opposition, in the absence of any policy on wages at all, simply to trot out a stunt to gyp ordinary Australians out of their holiday at the end of the year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations whether the recent reports that a nationwide investigation has found that nearly 3,000 employers have been in breach of Federal awards are correct? If they are correct, can the Minister provide details of the investigation and its findings? Can he also advise the Senate what measures are in train or are planned to make sure that employers do not continue to escape their legal obligations to pay their workers their full award entitlements?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must preface this answer by saying that of course most employers are honest and seek to pay the correct rate of pay. But there are occasions on which mistakes are made owing to lack of information, and I would counsel employers generally, particularly small employers, to join employer organisations that provide an award service to them so that they can make sure that the remuneration which they are giving to their employees is in accordance with the legal minimum rate set out in awards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I should also say that the service that the Commonwealth provides through the Awards Management Unit is a service that inspects for underpayment of wages or non-observance of working conditions. Obviously, this service, where it detects breaches, benefits workers in ensuring that their due entitlement is properly paid. It is also a service that advantages employers, in my view, for the reason, as I have said, that employers are basically and largely honest and do not cheat on the legal entitlements of their employees, but those who do-and there are occasions when it happens-ought to be brought to book lest they obtain a competitive advantage over honest employers simply by dudding workers on their wages.</PARA>
<PARA>So the service we provide is of benefit to workers, as it is also of advantage to all employers to know that their competitors are observing the right rates of pay.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I point out that my Department inspected more than 8,067 firms in the last financial year and found that 2,795 employers were in breach of proper award rates of pay provisions for 15,486 workers. In total, the Department recovered about $4m in back pay for workers who had been underpaid.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of that result, we are now taking a further look at how we handle this area of industrial inspection. I am providing further staff to the award management unit to upgrade its activities. Its activities will be concentrated on increasingly providing information and education about what awards are, what the legal requirements under them shall be, how employers should observe them, and what the rights and obligations of employees are. That increasingly will be the focus, as we hope to eradicate these breaches. But we will of course continue always to prosecute employers who are trenchantly opposed to meeting their legal requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that another problem we have encountered in our survey is that a large number of employers have not met their award obligations to pay superannuation. Since superannuation is a major social advantage to the community, as well as an obligation on employers and a benefit for employees in retirement, we will be concentrating on that aspect in the future. I have written to all superannuation funds, all employer organisations and all unions with members entitled to superannuation cover, drawing their attention to their obligations, and we will now inspect to ensure that there is full observance of superannuation coverage as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business and Customs to an article which appeared in The Australian magazine on 2 June this year entitled `The Bird Snatchers', in which it was alleged that Australian fauna is being smuggled to Californian dealers aboard some of the many Australian Customs exempt military flights emanating from the United States base at Pine Gap. According to the article, two separate dealers referred to what they called the `Pine Gap racket', while aviculturalists said that Customs and wildlife officials knew all about the racket but `can't touch it'. Is the Minister's Department aware of these claims by its officials at Alice Springs and is it true that they cannot deal with this issue? If this is true, why is it so, given that Australian Customs have in the past claimed the right to check the regular United States Military Air Command flights coming through Richmond and Alice Springs? Finally, is the Minister aware that we are talking about an illegal trade worth millions of dollars a year, with some birds fetching up to $30,000 a pair? Is he prepared to thoroughly investigate these claims and report back to the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article in the Australian magazine of 2 June has been drawn to my attention. The subject of that article is what Senator Vallentine refers to as the Pine Gap racket. The question of Customs searches of United States military aircraft operating in Australia has been raised on a number of occasions. The answer that I am going to give Senator Vallentine repeats the answer which has been given, as I say, on a number of occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, United States military aircraft landing in Australia are subject to Customs, health and quarantine controls. Secondly, Customs officers can and do conduct searches of those aircraft in accordance with the risk assessed, just as they do with any other suspect vessel or aircraft. The searches extend to goods and persons arriving or leaving on these United States military aircraft flights.</PARA>
<PARA> Much of the information in that particular article in the Australian magazine is very old and first appeared in the media in about 1983. Allegations that Australian birds were smuggled out of Pine Gap aboard United States aircraft were certainly published in newspaper articles in September 1979 and, perhaps, first appeared even earlier than that. Australian and United States authorities reacted to the allegations during the early 1980s by conducting a series of search operations and so on, but nothing was found to indicate that there was any substance to them.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that this is such a long answer but as Senator Vallentine and I are the only two people interested in it I do not think it particularly matters. I have obligations imposed on me and I am going to give a very long answer. Australia and the United States of America are member parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna. Under this Convention the trade in parrots is subject to stringent international control. The illegal export of any Australian parrot to the United States constitutes breaches of both the United States Endangered Species Act and the US Lacey Act, as well as being an offence under the Australian Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has, for many years, maintained close liaison with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on such matters as combating the illegal traffic in fauna. United States military flights have received attention in the course of that liaison but still no suggestion of smuggling has been uncovered. Stringent security controls over these flights and over the Pine Gap installation provide a strong deterrent against their use as a smuggling conduit.</PARA>
<PARA> That is a long answer. To recapitulate on a couple of the main points in my answer: this very old allegation, which was probably first raised in the media late in the 1970s, first emerged as a serious allegation in 1983 and has been recycled in this article in the Australian magazine on 2 June.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the somewhat stroppy-if I can use that word, because I cannot think of another-substance of Senator Vallentine's question, Customs has the authority to conduct searches and it does conduct searches from time to time on the same random sample basis as it does for other vessels which may or may not be bringing contraband into Australia or taking wildlife out of Australia. Nothing has been found in the course of those searches and a lot of the information which is alleged in Senator Vallentine's question is very old and totally unsubstantiated by the circumstances. I thank the Senate for its indulgence in respect of this somewhat lengthy answer.</PARA>

Does the Minister agree that the ATSIC elections on Saturday for the Torres Strait Regional Council elected a body whose method of constitution has never been publicly notified, whose potential membership has not been notified, and whose method of election and terms of office have not been notified?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some press reports, I think today, about the cooperative research centres, and may I say that the Government is very pleased with the response to the announced program. A total of 120 applications have been received in the first round and the program will address a major weakness in Australian science by forging closer links between research institutions and industry and other users. I think those administering the program have to be very careful to see that the industry links are strongly established and that the research centres program is not in any major sense captured by academic scientists-a note of personal warning, if I might say so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The applications which have been received embrace many fields of science and technology, including areas such as agriculture, mineral processing, computing and robotics, new materials, waste management, the environment, and medicine and health. It is a requirement of the program to have at least one higher education institution involved, but a number of the applications in fact bring several universities together and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is a participant in more than half the applications. I should say that the extent of the end user involvement is also encouraging with private industry, State Government departments and Federal agencies being involved in the majority of proposed centres with a good geographical spread.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government now has the task of selecting from the 120 applications a maximum of 15 centres to be set up in the first round and the results of that will be announced in March 1991. The assessment will be carried out by the cooperative research centres committee chaired by the chief scientist, Professor Ralph Slatyer, with the assistance of two expert panels.</PARA>

Quite clearly, that is in Australia's domestic interests, as it is in the interests of growers in other countries, so that there is not subsidised production resulting in huge surpluses being built up that cannot be sold and are therefore released onto the world market, depressing prices for growers of commodities who in fact would be competitive were those subsidies not to be in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 October, Senator Knowles asked a question without notice of Senator Cook which was referred to me as it was an economic question. I seek leave to have that answer incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 17 October 1990 (Hansard, page 3244) Senator Knowles asked the following question without notice to Senator Cook:</PARA>
<PARA>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. In light of the earlier comments by Senator Button that major projects have been stalled on economic grounds, does the Minister share the concern of the Executive Director of the Business Council of Australia that 35 per cent of new projects have been so affected at a cost to Australia of $9 billion? If so, what will the Government do to prevent this trend continuing to Australia's great detriment?</PARA>
<PARA>While I do not fully agree on the specific numbers quoted and the reasons given, the Government is aware that many potential projects in resource processing sectors do not become actual developments. The Government has identified several reasons for this, including the relatively high cost of capital, micro-economic reform issues in areas such as rail transport, power pricing, generation and distribution, multi-tiered and complicated planning and approval processes and complex environmental and resource access/security issues.</PARA>
<PARA>While each of these impediments individually may impose only a minor cost penalty upon processors, taken together they can represent a barrier to investment in such activity in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to take a strategic view of these complex issues and convey to Australian and international investors that we are serious about developing world scale resource processing projects.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why the Special Premiers' Conference has agreed that action be taken to simplify processes and provide consistency of approach in environmental regulations and procedures; standards and planning issues; to approval processes; to implement a more efficient national transport system; and to identify and act on areas for increasing efficiency in the power generation and distribution sectors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 October, Senator Kernot asked me a question relating to the status of the Cape York land use study. Again, as the answer is somewhat long, I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 11 October 1990 (Hansard, pages 2916-2917) Senator Kernot asked me the following question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the Federal Government's view of the present status of the (Cape York) land use study;</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Minister support the action of the Queensland Premier in breaking yet another promise-that is, the Queensland Australian Labor Party's promise of a moratorium on development in the Cape York area while the study was under way;</PARA>
<PARA>What is the point of a jointly funded study whose outcome is pre-empted by the Queensland Premier?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Last December the Government decided that support for the spaceport was to be subject to the results of a joint Land Use Study for Cape York to be conducted by the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government, of which the Environmental Impact Statement for the spaceport was to be an integral part.</PARA>
<PARA>Arrangements for the Land Use Study have commenced. In August the Government agreed to the conduct of the study and endorsed a set of objectives and a plan. The Government also agreed to the establishment of a Commonwealth/Queensland Steering Committee to develop agreed terms of reference for the study and to monitor its implementation and development. Commonwealth and Queensland Government officials are continuing with their examination of suitable administrative arrangements for the jointly funded study and study guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the Government's decision last December on the need for a spaceport Environmental Impact Assessment, guidelines for the assessment were developed jointly by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments. These were issued to the proponent, Cape York Space Agency Pty Ltd, on 11 October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>The intention of the Government is that the Environmental Impact Assessment and the Land Use Study will run in parallel.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Land Use Study will take a number of years to complete, it is the expectation of both Governments that a sufficient part of the study will be completed, on a priority basis, within approximately two years to enable integrated decision making on currently identified land use issues, such as the Cape York spaceport, without causing undue delay to these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Premier's statement is consistent with this agreed approach.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add to an answer that I gave on 17 October to Senator Reid on a question that she had asked about powerlifting. My response on that occasion was based on advice prepared by the Australian Sports Commission, and I tabled that advice for the information of honourable senators. Since receiving that advice, I have been informed that it contains a minor inaccuracy which I now seek to correct. The information provided to me indicated that the Australian Sports Drug Agency endorses the Australian Powerlifting Federation as the recognised powerlifting body. The Agency, of course, has no such role, which is the responsibility of the Australian Sports Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position of the Australian Sports Drug Agency with respect to powerlifting is that it supports an amalgamated powerlifting organisation with an independent drug testing program conducted by the Australian Sports Drug Agency which will monitor the resolve of that organisation to eliminate drug use amongst its members. It has no position on which organisation is recognised by the Commonwealth as the controlling body for the sport of powerlifting in this country. As I indicated in my response on 17 October, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, has asked the Commission to review the matter and report back to her.</PARA>

I have had the Hansard examined as quickly as possible and it has confirmed my knowledge; that is, I have never referred to Ambassador Burke, the Ambassador to Ireland, during his appointment in either an unflattering or an unkind way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During his period as Premier of Western Australia, I referred to him on 11 occasions, none of which was in an unflattering light, except that I referred to him once as `that socialist Labor Premier from Western Australia'. That is the most hurtful thing I have ever said about the present Ambassador to Ireland. The question I asked related to a court case in Western Australia wherein a Mr Smith was found guilty of illegal bugging. He was contracted by the Burke Labor Government for $6,500 a month. He was described in his running sheets as being Premier Burke's street level adviser in the Western Australian Police Department during the British loan affair. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To rub salt into it, the report of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation makes the point that sherry production in this country has plummeted. I first draw attention to the wine industry in this country. The exports of wine in 1989-90 were some 41 million litres. That represents a small increase of some 0.6 of one per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a very strong recovery in key markets in the past six months, particularly in the United Kingdom; in the United States of America where, in 1989, there was a severe slump; and in Canada where there was an increase of some 20 per cent. Regrettably, however, in Japan there was a decline of some 33 per cent in Australian wine sales. This was in part brought about by imports from competitors, particularly France. I shall refer to the reasons for that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> The major factor that resulted in the fairly low increase in wine exports was the high value of the Australian dollar. Domestically, there was a 2.8 per cent decline in wine sales. Amongst other things, the factors here were the increase in grape prices and also the cut in beer excise, particularly low alcohol beer, in the 1988 Budget. Personally, I am not sure that that is a good thing. Also the labour integrity program has met with a very favourable response, particularly on the international level. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brandy industry, regrettably, the continuing decline in Australian brandy production has continued. Some five years ago Australia produced approximately 2,100 kilolitres of brandy, which declined to 856 kilolitres last year. That has largely been brought about by imports, particularly from France. France makes up 95 per cent of imports of brandy into this country. In the past three years French imports have almost doubled. In 1987-88 the figure was 641,000 litres; in 1988-89, 1,069,000 litres; and in 1989-90 there was a small decline to 1,041,000 litres. The main reason for this is that the French, as usual, have been engaged in their rural protectionist policies and have been dumping brandy in Australia at subsidised prices. It became so dramatic that in 1989 the Australian Customs Service had to impose a provisional countervailing duty. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I referred to the decline in our wine sales to Japan. On this issue the French are at it yet again. They have been roaming the world objecting to countries using terminology such as champagne, chardonnay and various other names of particular wines, claiming that champagne, chardonnay and suchlike can only be produced and bottled in France. That is yet another example of blatant protectionism by the French in order to try to protect their product from overseas competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the report to which I draw the Senate's attention is the fact that it touches on the wine industry in Tasmania. Of course, the Senate would be all too familiar with the famous Tasmanian climate which, combined with a number of progressive and far-sighted entrepreneurs who have established vineyards in the last five or 10 years, has allowed the production of wine in Tasmania to double from 499 tonnes to 944 tonnes last year. Whilst talking about alcohol, I want to give a plug to Tasmanian beer. Tasmanian beer-Cascade and Boags-is now world renowned and a leading Tasmanian export industry. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I read with interest the accounts of the Commercial Activities Trust Account, whose shortened reference is CATAC, and its financial statements for 1988-89. I cannot help wondering what is the point of producing such an account in the way in which it has been done. On looking at the several pages which are coupled together, the first thing that struck me was that the document is presented in a way which leads one to read and interpret it that the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) has made a profit for the year. There is a statement that the closing balance at 30 June 1989 totalled $804,315. The Auditor-General says that the accounts are based on a partial accrual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when one turns to note 7 at page 5, which deals with liabilities, one sees that charged against DSTO for the income it has earned are a range of costs that cover prime labour, all direct salaries of personnel associated with commercial activities, other direct costs and overheads. For the combined years of 1987-88 and 1988-89 these total some $959,584. It is stated that the total liability represents services from DSTO and includes amounts relating to work in progress as well as cost of sales, but it does not say how much. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to say in a different section that the DSTO is obliged to make a repayment of the $959,584 to Consolidated Revenue, and indeed most of that was repaid after 30 June 1989. Although one picks up the accounts and sees that as at 30 June 1989 there was $804,000-odd in the bank, one reads at page 5 that there was a liability of $959,584, most of which has been repaid to Consolidated Revenue, which would either leave the bank balance in the red or at best in a very marginal state. </PARA>
<PARA> There could be very good things to say about the way in which some of the agencies within DSTO have conducted their commercialisation process, but I put it to the Senate that this document does not add anything to the overall knowledge of how well or how badly they are operating. I suggest that there needs to be a rethink in the manner in which the information is presented. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) report confirms what many of us know but do not always acknowledge. The fact is that Australia has a large body of distinguished researchers undertaking work of world class. To see that we need to look no further than the pages of this report, which details the work of recipients of Commonwealth funds made available through the National Health and Medical Research Council. For instance, we read of research into anti-inflammatory treatment which provides real hope for asthma sufferers; we read of ways of preventing bone loss with consequent benefits for sufferers from osteoporosis, and that particularly includes many Australian women; we read of research into Alzheimer's disease, research into cancer, and research into multiple sclerosis; we read of a tendon reconstruction method that results in patients using fingers or toes within a week of operation rather than within a six-week period as presently occurs; and we read of new understanding of factors contributing to emotional problems of children and to the question of depression which occurs during pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA> These are research projects undertaken as part of Australia's research effort. There are many other examples, each of them with the potential to improve the quality of life of many Australians and to improve the quality of life of people beyond our shores, because the application of research is international. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Government has supported 948 researchers with project grants; it has provided support to 23 research teams with 23 program unit and block grants; and it has provided more than 250 training fellowships and undergraduate and post-graduate scholarships, all of which have helped young researchers. In addition, there have been 21 research fellowships awarded or renewed for top flight career and medical researchers, bringing the total number of such researchers supported by NHMRC to more than 130. </PARA>
<PARA> This report offers us one other opportunity. This will be the last report from the NHMRC under the chairmanship of Professor John Chalmers, a resident of your city, I believe, Madam Acting Deputy President, but a former colleague of mine. One might say that he has the best of both worlds. Professor Chalmers has been a distinguished member of the research community and his tenure of the post of chair of the NHMRC has been a distinguished tenure. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to place on record our welcome to his successor, Dr Diana Horvath, who has taken over as Chairman of the NHMRC. She brings an impressive portfolio of achievement already to the position she has taken. I am sure I join all honourable senators in wishing her well in her tenure of this important post. If under her chairmanship the NHMRC can continue to achieve in the ways which I have set out and which are contained in this report, it will indeed be serving Australia well. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation on its annual report and on the research work it has done into major areas affecting the industry in both the on-farm and the off-farm sectors. As I read the report, I noted that the Corporation commissioned a number of research programs to service urgent industry needs. A number of them were designed to address the following objectives: to maximise the benefit for Australian producers and processors from the expanding Asian beef markets; to increase the volume of land going into the higher value domestic and export markets; to increase the demand and price for Australian sheepskins; and to increase the productivity of cattle and sheep by genetic engineering or rumen microbes. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell honourable senators that, however fine and commendable these objectives are, I doubt that there has been much success with them in the past year. That, as we all know, is because there has been a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of anyone associated with the Australian rural sector. Already honourable senators would know that the nation's greatest single export earner-the wool industry-has had its confidence shattered by this Government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a beef industry which is struggling for survival. Although it has been receiving high prices, which regrettably are now falling fairly dramatically, it is being smothered by escalating costs and government charges. It does not matter whether we produce the goods: factors outside the farm such as disastrous government decisions on rural issues, in addition to the Government's economic policies, mean that being on the land is just not profitable. I can speak from experience as one who lives on the land and knows of the bills that have to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly noted that the Chairman said that the decade we have just entered will be a testing one for our sheepmeat and beef industries. He is certainly right about that. He also stated that our markets and consumers' needs are changing significantly and that both sectors must change with them. Producers will have to produce to market specifications which best suit their enterprise and processors will have to reduce the cost of processing and lower the two to three times difference in costs which exists between Australia and its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> Failure to do so will relegate the Australian meat industry to producers of manufacturing meats only and will force us to forgo the premiums associated with quality. In order to lower this difference in cost between Australia and its competitors we should also be looking at the imposts placed on small rural businesses and farming families by bureaucracy and big business. An estimated 30,000 farmers are currently suffering a cost price squeeze which will force many from the industry in the 1990s to join the 30,000 farmers who have already left the industry over the past 30 years. That statistic will surely add weight to the Chairman's predictions for the 1990s. Currently, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates that the real net value of farm production will fall 51 per cent in 1990-91 to $1.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a golden opportunity to become the world's greatest agricultural exporter with its pollution-free food. We are on the doorstep of rapidly emerging Asian markets, the demand from which is expected to lift commodity prices in real terms for the first time this century. But, in congratulating the Corporation on the report, we note that there is no doubt about the importance of the Corporation and its work. I certainly commend it for the tremendous job it is doing-with what I might add is little support from the Labor Party and its union-controlled Government-to identify, and help find the solutions to, many of the problems that face the Australian meat and livestock industry. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that I do not find that the Department of Defence Annual Report 1989-90 is a particularly satisfactory annual report. I am sorry to have to say that. I think that, a little like the explanatory notes in the Budget documents, there was not sufficient detailed information. Unfortunately, what is provided in the report is not consistent with what was provided in previous years, so it is very difficult to make comparisons. It is a much smaller report than last year's report and the material in the appendices contains very much less statistical information than we have had previously. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer briefly to five areas which were previously covered in the appendices and which do not appear in this report. These include a list of the Australia Defence Force units and establishments. This was a very valuable appendix. It gave the facility name of the Army, Royal Australian Navy or Royal Australian Air Force-of all Defence establishments across Australia-and it listed the formational unit and the equipment held at the location. The information was broken down into categories such as land command, logistic command, operational command, et cetera, depending on the service. It was really a very useful ready reckoner for knowing exactly what was where and when. That information has now been excised from the annual report. I hope that it reappears next year because it will be missed by many people who are concerned with defence matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The second appendix which did not appear this year is the financial statistics appendix. This information was also formerly contained in this appendix and was extremely valuable. It included statistics such as defence function expenditure and revenue and outlay as a percentage of gross domestic product. It included comparisons of the Commonwealth departmental budget sector outlays and comparisons of expenditure on the defence function in Australia, the United States and other countries. It included production establishments revenue and costs and included Garden Island Dockyard production and work values. Some of the information that was formerly included in the appendix does appear in this year's annual report, but it is not in the same form and that, in itself, is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly concerned that a personnel statistics appendix does not appear in this year's Defence annual report, and that is absolutely unbelievable. I suppose one could understand why-the Government would be wanting to try to hide the Defence personnel facts. But I would have expected the Department to put them on the record. The situation is the worst it has been for 10 years and the Australian people have a right to know that from the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there is personnel information, it is largely inconsistent with that of previous years. It is difficult to make comparisons in respect of the distribution of service personnel and civilian staff; the separations in the Defence Force over the last five years; the enlistments over the last five years; the geographic distribution of reserve personnel with training obligations over the last five years; and defence civilian targets. Another appendix which is missing is information on training and staff development. That means we no longer have information on cadet, trainee and apprenticeship schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, as I said earlier, some of these things have been subsumed into the body of the annual report but they are not in the same form and they cannot be accurately compared with earlier years. Honourable senators will recall that guidelines require annual reports to be as consistent as possible year after year just so that everybody can see the development that has taken place over the years. This year's information, in many cases, has an extra bit added or something has been left off that which was provided last year. That alters the end result and makes it near impossible to compare figures from year to year. </PARA>
<PARA> This is becoming a bit of a trend with Defence. We see a similar situation with explanatory notes and even questions taken on notice. Senator Vallentine asked a question on 16 August this year regarding military bases. She wanted an update on information that had previously been asked for by John Spender. She got, really, a refusal to answer the question. Yet Gordon Scholes, when Minister, had answered John Spender in considerable detail. Scholes, himself, had been answered on the same question in great detail by Minister Killen. In other words, Ministers have been asked to update an answer that was given all those years ago. However, gradually those updates are becoming restricted and members of parliament are being prevented from doing their job. This refusal of the Department of Defence-with or without the Government's knowledge, I cannot say-is unacceptable. The Department should recognise that it is open to scrutiny like every other department of state in this country and that this Parliament will not accept that information be restricted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin with a positive comment on the 1989-90 annual report of the Department of Defence. Under the heading `The Labours of Hercules: Defence Assistance to the Civil Community' the report covers an area in which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) often is an unsung hero-and, of course, that includes heroines these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, I want to commend the defence forces for their incredible services to the community in relation to the aftermath of the earthquake which struck Newcastle on 28 December 1989 and the bushfires which raged around Albury soon after that time. Later in the year, of course, many areas of Queensland and north-west New South Wales were flooded and the ADF did a sterling job in assisting the community. It is this aspect of the ADF's program that I heartily endorse and recommend. I suggest that it should do an even better public relations job on those positive aspects of its role in the community than it has been able to do to date. It is this kind of role that the ADF should be doing in between its military exercises about which, of course, I am often critical. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention the defence cooperation program which is set out in program 4. Again, there are some commendable aspects to the defence cooperation program, particularly the handing over of Pacific patrol boats to the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. Another one took place in Perth last weekend. The provision of patrol boats to the island states of the Pacific-fishing is their major resource and they really need these boats to guard that resource-is a very considerable and positive step that the Australian defence cooperation program funds. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on the other hand, it is also very worrying that at the request of Papua New Guinea four Iroquois helicopters were provided for Papua New Guinea defence force use on Bougainville. This has created quite a lot of ill-feeling amongst the Papua New Guinea community, mostly, of course, from the Bougainvillean point of view. Bougainvilleans do not like to see Australia being part of the militarisation which is used to deny the legitimate course of self-determination on Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Australian Government has to look carefully at how it spends its defence cooperation budget. In fact, there was a 22.4 per cent increase in the defence cooperation program this year-some of this, as I have said, is well spent; other dollars I think are very unwisely spent and can create problems in our region instead of creating goodwill among our neighbours-whereas the overseas aid budget is at the lowest point it has been at for 20 years; it is down to 0.33 per cent of the gross domestic product. This is the area where we could create much more goodwill among our neighbours. It is very worrying that defence is still getting 9.3 per cent of the Budget while other programs are being cut, and it is obvious that with the peace dividend which some other nations are beginning to enjoy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. With the peace dividend actually becoming a reality in some countries, we should also be getting in on the peace dividend and strengthening our foreign affairs budget in relation to our defence budget. Of course, the crisis in the Gulf has cut through a lot of that and obviously a call for a reduction in the defence budget would not be popular at the moment, but it should be because I think we should be negotiating our way out of that difficulty and not preparing for armed combat. A small cut in defence of, say, one per cent would mean a 5 per cent increase in the foreign affairs budget because they are so unequal to start with. We need to place the emphasis on diplomacy and negotiation skills such as those displayed by Michael Costello over the Cambodia issue. We also need an increase in funding for language skills training and this should become a part of the foreign affairs budget, an increasingly important affair. There should be increased funding for the United Nations peacekeeping forces as well. This would mean a cut in the defence budget. I think we must constantly weigh up these two Budget claims on behalf of the Australian community. There are many people in the Australian community who would like to see that imbalance evened up considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>It is important to bring this matter up today because, after the election on Saturday for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), the Government is now bringing in the regulations that it should have tabled before the election was held. I believe that is a dereliction of duty by the Government, and it does not allow the elected members of this Senate to scrutinise the proposal that the election was based on. We had an election for ATSIC on Saturday whereby the Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait people have gone to vote for a regional council that has never been in existence. None of the regulations made under the Act have been allowed to come before this Parliament for scrutiny, and the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) is denying me leave to make a contribution on that aspect of the Torres Strait Islander Act. </PARA>

That is why I believe it is absolutely urgent that this matter be debated today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, through its incompetence, has not tabled two regulations that would give the Act the power for there to be an election. Last Saturday, we had an election which could have cost $5m and of which the results have been put in doubt. They are subject to a court challenge. Yet the Government is not prepared to debate this very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not have to remind you that two years ago the ATSIC proposal started as a fiasco when the Government sacked all the members of the Aboriginal Development Commission Board because they would not agree that ATSIC was in the best interests of the black people of Australia. It has now finished in a fiasco with an election held last Saturday without any regulations having been laid before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Every honourable senator in this chamber has been insulted because we have not been able to do our duty under the Act. We have not been allowed to scrutinise the regulations. We have not had an opportunity to move a disallowance motion. The Senate has been bypassed. The Parliament of Australia has been bypassed. We now find that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) will not give me leave to make a statement or give leave to the Senate to debate this most important matter. I believe that it is absolutely crucial that we debate the non-tabling of two regulations that should have been placed before the Parliament of Australia before an election took place. </PARA>

That section states:</PARA>
<PARA>The notice shall also set out particulars of how the Torres Strait Regional Council is to be constituted . . . </PARA>

If it was tabled, it has no effect because, under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, if the tabling is done outside the time limit, the regulations and the notice that have been filed have no effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion to suspend Standing Orders, I point out that there are a number of very urgent reasons as to why this matter should be properly addressed today.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found both of those comments intimidatory because of their very essential nature in dealing with this matter and, as Senator Macdonald has said today, in taking note of the issue because of the important implications with regard to the dating of the regulations. The issue stands on its own. What worries me is that we are again seeing a cunning sleight of hand in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio which is against the interests of Aboriginal Australians. What has the Government got to hide anyway with regard to these regulations? We do not want a repeat of the cover-ups evident in the debates a couple of years ago in so many of these areas leading to the very establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Now, at the initial establishment of that commission in a very important election, we find that because of an administrative or ministerial muck-up we are to be denied the right to speak and to properly debate the papers that should be before this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion of which I gave notice earlier today is quite different. It calls only for the documents relating to the making of these rules. It was a requirement to table information. There is no indication from the Government as to whether or not it will accept that motion tomorrow as a formal matter. If it accepts it as formal, there would be no debate in this chamber; it would proceed straight through tomorrow morning. If the Government does not want to make it formal tomorrow, then of course there will be debate. But it will be a matter again of shovelling and fiddling around with the agenda and the timetable of the Senate. I find it insulting to all Aboriginal constituents and Torres Strait Islanders who find this matter of great importance. Again the government is trying to hide behind the skirts of its own ineptitude. It is most important that this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders be carried. It should not have been necessary to move it in the first place. It is purely a matter that would be procedural in any other normal course of events. We now find that because of the embarrassment of the Minister, who obviously is inheriting similar problems, this is an issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Australian Democrats can see the importance of this issue, and that there are very important constituents for whom they have to act. Last year Senator Coulter, when the debate on the ATSIC Bill was proceeding, took note of these issues. My motion tomorrow will address a number of those issues further down the track. But it is most important that on this day this Senate takes note of this paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I believe that the suspension of standing orders for the due consideration of these matters is of most particular importance. This matter needs to be discussed by the Senate today. There is no good reason that the Government can provide as to why the suspension of standing orders should not take place, notwithstanding its reluctance to have this matter aired in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking to the urgency of this matter, I hasten to remind the Senate of the fact that the Government by its actions to date has treated the Senate and its procedures with utter contempt. I am very concerned that what we will see if we allow the Government to obfuscate, to put this issue off any further, is further contempt not only for the Senate but also for all the Aboriginal electors who actually bothered to go to the poll over the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important things to remember in considering the substance of this matter-and this gets back again to the question of urgency-is that these people have cast their votes in an election which many of them believed to have been duly constituted. The failure of the Minister to table or ensure the tabling of those documents in the Senate casts in doubt whether that election was duly constituted and whether the result was indeed valid. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we come to the question of the urgency which is required when we deal with people's freedom to vote, their freedom of expression and their freedom of association. I do not believe that it does the Senate, the Government or the institution of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), whether one agrees with it or otherwise, any good for this matter to be put off any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government may have some sort of embarrassment over the way in which it has behaved and, frankly, I would not be surprised if that were the case. But the important thing is that the Government has an obligation to those people who cast their votes for the matter to be heard and debated as promptly and as quickly as possible. The Government now has this opportunity and it has refused leave. Therefore, it is very important that the standing orders are suspended so that the matter can be properly debated. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Tambling has so ably said, his notice of motion covers somewhat different matters from those that Senator Boswell wishes to raise. There is no evidence that the Government will necessarily allow the motion to be considered as formal. We may go through further delays from the Government again tomorrow. Frankly, I do not believe that we should be required to take the undertakings given from that side. Normally I am quite happy to accept what Minister Tate says. However, in this particular case I know that we are talking about Minister Tate dancing to the tune called by a Minister in the other House, and in particular a Minister who has failed dismally to understand the requirements either of the Act or of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I take a very dim view of the Government's failure to meet the procedural and administrative requirements in respect of the Act. I take a very dim view of the high-handed attitude displayed by the Government in considering this matter. If these regulations had been properly tabled, they would have been in a position to have been considered by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee well before the election took place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very good argument to be put that perhaps not only should they have been tabled before the election but that the period during which they could have been disallowed should also have expired before the election. This is a matter about which the Government is also embarrassed. I think it is absolutely critical that this matter be debated today, irrespective of the Government's complaints, because the Government has an obligation to this Senate, the electors and ATSIC itself to have these matters cleared up or aired as soon as possible. I do not believe any further delays by the Government are warranted at all. </PARA>

<PARA> Although the Government obviously regrets, as does the Minister, the administrative oversight that led to this problem, as all honourable senators know full well, particularly those with the experience of Senator Baume, Ministers are not personally responsible for tabling such documents in the Parliament, nor have they ever been and nor are they ever likely to be. In fact, the Minister himself-the correspondence shows it-will have to make that judgment. I personally would have no difficulty in acceding to Senator Tambling's notice of motion and tabling the documentation that I have read, because what it demonstrates is that the Minister was assiduous in his pursuit of whether the correct procedures had been adopted. In fact, he received written advice on 19 September. I have the document in front of me now--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I am glad that, after wasting 15 minutes of the Senate's time, we can now address the real issue which is that on 23 August the Minister signed a regulation. Precedent suggests that when a Minister signs a regulation the regulation is deemed to have been made on that date. If that was the case, the regulation could not be tabled in the House because the 15 sitting days would have passed. The regulation was gazetted on 24 August and this is the last day that the regulation can be tabled in this House under the 15-sitting day rule. As I understand it, it has never happened before that the date of gazettal is the date that the regulation has been deemed to have been made. So there is a question about that. It is a substantial question that no doubt will be taken up in the courts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The real point of the issue is that there has been an election which I believe has had very little support among the Aboriginal community in Australia. In my home area in Brisbane there are 7,000 Aboriginals and about 1,200 voted in the election. Aboriginals have called into my office over the last two days and overwhelmingly have told me that there was no interest in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSIC) election and that people did not want it anyhow. The issue goes back to when we, as members of a Senate select committee, including Senator Collins and Senator Coulter, went around Australia and found that the Aboriginal community and the Islander community did not want to have a bar of ATSIC. </PARA>

<PARA> Today we are facing a serious precedent where the Parliament of Australia has been bypassed. This institution, which is the most precious institution we have in Australia, has been bypassed. We have just had a regulation tabled after an election that was held on Saturday at a cost of $5m. If that is not a serious matter for this Parliament to be debating, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of the Torres Strait Regional Council, the Torres Strait Islanders went to an election to vote for people on a regional council that has not even been constituted. The number of people on it has not been established. The terms of the election that was held have not been established. The people have voted for nothing. I hope that we never again in this Parliament of Australia see this Government, through its incompetence, ineptitude or deceit-I do not know which-trying to bypass the Australian people. The bypassing of parliamentary representation is one of the most serious accusations that can be levelled at a government. It is an insult to not only every senator and member of this place but also every Aboriginal community and person. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the greatest incompetence in regard to ATSIC by the Minister and his Department. I want to take the Minister up. He is captain of his Department. When the regulation was not tabled, did he take it like a man? Did he say, `I am responsible for my Department'? He blamed some little class 3 clerk-probably an Aboriginal person-in his Department. He would not take the blame himself; he tried to pass the blame onto some clerk in his Department. Instead of saying, `I am responsible; I am the Minister of my Department and I administer that Department', he tried to flick pass the blame to someone else.</PARA>
<PARA> Two regulations have not been tabled. The first is subject to a court challenge, and I do not want to mention that. The other regulation was discovered on Friday before the court had a chance to consider it. No doubt the judges of the full Federal Court will take this matter into consideration. This Parliament is facing a serious threat when a government tries to bypass the tabling of regulations and then tables them three days after an election. That is a worry and is a matter for debate in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know where we will go from here and whether we will move a motion to disallow those regulations. I suppose that will be subject to decisions of the various parties in this chamber. We are now faced with an election that has been held and a regulation that has been tabled after the election. I believe that every person in the Torres Strait would have voted for his or her representatives. It is not unlikely that the election will be declared invalid so that those people will have to vote again. That is the responsibility of the Ministers of the Government. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said that everyone has to lift his game. If this is the best that the Hawke Ministry can do, no wonder the Prime Minister is getting desperate and telling his Ministers that they will have to go out and do a better job. This incompetence is driving down the polls for the Australian Labor Party to where they stand at present-around 30 per cent of the electorate supporting the Government. If a government has not the ability to table regulations before an election, one wonders why anyone could support it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we have today seen one of the most serious things that have ever happened to a parliament; that is, the dereliction by a government to honour its commitments and to bring forth in a proper way the regulations that are prescribed under an Act of Parliament. Section 116 (6) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act quite clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 applies in relation to a notice under subsection (1), other than any notice published before the beginning of the first Regional Council election period, as if paragraph (1) (b) of that section were omitted and the following paragraph were substituted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That tells me very clearly that the election for the Torres Strait Regional Council could not take place unless section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act and section 116 (1) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act prescribing the regulations were tabled. This is a very serious situation facing the Australian Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just symptomatic of the Government's inaction and inability to do anything for Australia and, as Senator Michael Baume says, it cannot even run this chamber correctly. As I have mentioned, the whole thing is a complete fiasco and should never have occurred. The result is something of very grave consequence to this nation; that is, something like $5m and more could have been wasted because this Government has embarked upon an election which it should not have got involved in. Even if the question we are debating today is resolved in a way favourable to the Government, it still does not alter the fact that when the rules are discussed within the next 15 sitting days this Senate may decide to throw out the rules, alter them or throw them away. That could well mean-and this could still happen, regardless of what occurs in this debate-that all the money has been irretrievably wasted by this Government. At a time when children are living in poverty, when there is a rural crisis around us, and when the nation stumbles from problems to extra problems, from crisis to extra crisis, this Government is gambling with $5m and leaving in place a situation where it could simply throw away the money that has been spent on this election and the money that it will continue to spend while the arguments go through the court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As succinctly as I can, I will point out to the Government where it is wrong in this matter and where it has completely fouled it up. As Senator Boswell has mentioned, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) takes the easy escape of blaming some clerk in his Department. It seems to me that the Minister does not have a terrible lot to do. He apparently administers no department and does not seem to have a lot of legislation to look after. One wonders what the Minister is around for. If this is an example of his competence, then he should do the country a favour by resigning and letting in some Minister who might be able to administer Aboriginal affairs and the affairs of Torres Strait Islanders in a much better way. Section 116 (1) of the Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Minister is satisfied that the Torres Strait Regional Council would best be able to represent Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginals living in the Torres Strait region if it consisted of, or included, persons elected to represent particular communities in the Torres Strait region under the Queensland Act, the Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, declare that he or she is so satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The notice shall also set out particulars of how the Torres Strait Regional Council is to be constituted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the notice is the Constitution of this Regional Council. Subsection (2) goes on to say what the rules of election will be and how the Council will operate. Subsection 5 of the Act-that is, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act-provides that the notice which the Minister has to sign saying he is satisfied and also setting up the Constitution is a disallowable instrument under the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act talks about instruments declared to be disallowable instruments. Section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act relates any references to instruments to references to regulations. That is just to tie the notice in with being a regulation under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 48(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act states that, where the Act confers power to make regulations, certain things have to happen. One of the things that have to happen-this is quite separate from making the regulations-is that the made regulation `shall be notified in the Gazette'. Having been made, it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within fifteen sitting days of that House after the making of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>This regulation was signed-I hold it in front of me-on 23 August 1990. If one counts 15 sitting days from that date, one finds that it is too late today to be tabling that document. The time has expired. If that is the case-and I suggest that it is-I challenge the Government to show me wherever else the signing of a regulation has not been taken as being the making of the regulation. That being the case, section 48 (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA>If any regulations are not laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) . . . they shall be void and of no effect. </PARA>
<PARA>I have told the Senate that the regulation was made on 23 August. If one adds 15 sitting days, the time in which regulations have to be tabled, one comes up with yesterday's date. Section 48 (3) states that regulations not tabled within 15 days cease to have effect. </PARA>
<PARA> So the notice that the Government is trying to table today has no effect because it ceased to have effect yesterday. If that ceased to have effect yesterday, not only were there no rules for the election which supposedly occurred on Saturday, but also there was nothing for those standing for election to be elected to: there is no such thing as a Torres Strait Regional Council because the regulation to set it up and set up the constitution ceased to have effect yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Why we went through the ridiculous situation of having a $5m election last Saturday for a body that does not exist is completely beyond me. It shows how completely incapable this Government is of running this country. I do not need to tell you that, Madam Acting Deputy President, nor do I need to tell the Senate. One has only to look at the opinion polls to see that if the people of Australia had gone to an election yesterday this Government would have been tossed out on its you-know-what because it is incompetent and is not capable of addressing the real problems that confront Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Last weekend the Northern Territory voters showed their displeasure at the sort of mismanagement that this Federal Government has embarked upon by giving the thumbs-down to the Labor Party in that constituency. Despite many things happening in the Territory, the Territory Government has been there for a long time. The wise men say that when a party is in power for a long time there is an election swing against it. But not only did the swing not go to the Labor Party; the Liberal Party in the Northern Territory achieved a massive swing in its direction. The voters know the complete mess that the Federal Labor Party has made and they certainly did not want to give the State Labor Party the chance of messing up completely the Northern Territory economy. That is what this is all about-the incapacity of this Government to govern this country properly. </PARA>

<PARA> On the subject of the Government's mismanagement of this House, there was a definite commitment by Senator Tate that these rules would be brought before the Senate and discussed by it-submitted to the scrutiny of this Parliament and this Senate-well before they were used. On page 1818 of the 6 October 1989 Hansard Senator Tate is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of the electoral rules themselves, senators are expressing some dismay and concern that they have not got those rules before them. They have not yet been drafted, as I am advised. With the priorities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate went on to give an excuse for that. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, these rules will come back to the Senate, and no doubt they will be subject to very close scrutiny by Senator Coulter, Senator Peter Baume, Senator Boswell and others. It is at that stage that the way in which the rules are proposed by the Minister can meet with the approval or disapproval of this chamber . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The rules were put into effect two days ago or a week ago, or whenever it was. They have not even got to the chamber yet. In fact, in my submission, they never will, because they ceased to have effect yesterday. But Senator Tate was saying that they will be brought here so that the rules proposed by the Minister can meet with the approval or disapproval of the chamber and therefore be allowed to operate or in fact be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate was quite rightly pointing out what will happen in the next couple of weeks-that those rules will be disallowed, and not only those rules but the whole constitution of the Council attempted to be set up by this notice, which I consider to be invalid because it is wrongly tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate went on to say, as recorded in the passage that I am quoting from Hansard of 6 October:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very powerful position for this chamber to be in. I say `this chamber'; the House of Representatives shares the power in theory but we know that it is only in this chamber that it would actually be exercised. I think that this is a major safeguard which can allay some of the worries and concerns of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate was saying to us that if we had worries about the rules we would be able to talk about them when he tabled these rules before the election. If we did not like some parts of them we could have our say. He said that it is a very powerful position for this House to be in because we can disallow or amend them. We might not like them. We might want to provide extra benefits or extra abilities. We might want to make available some extra grants to the Aboriginals and give them some extra powers in holding this election. </PARA>
<PARA> Have we had that opportunity that Senator Tate spoke about? Has this Senate been able to exercise that very powerful position? We have not. The elections have been held; they are over and finished. The ballot boxes are finalised and sealed up. Yet all of that may well be in vain because we have not seen the regulations and the constitution under which the Council was formed and the election held may well be found to be invalid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very true. I would suggest that this Government has never done anything to help too many people at all-except some of its mates and people in privileged positions. That is what is really wrong with this whole matter. I might draw the attention of the Senate to another aspect. Section 104 subsection (3) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The polling day, or the last of the polling days, for the first round of Regional Council elections shall be no later than 8 months after the commencement of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This Act, I point out for the benefit of honourable senators who do not recall it, came into effect on 5 March 1990. The eight months was therefore up on 5 November 1990-yesterday. So whichever way this matter is looked at, it is a case of complete mismanagement. The rules can well be disallowed. It is no use the Government then bringing in other rules or amending the rules, or someone else bringing in rules because any further polling days under this particular piece of legislation are barred. If the regulations are disallowed, the Act will be a complete waste of time and it will have to be reintroduced; or the Act will have to be substantially amended to allow for a polling day in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only think that the Government was possibly hoping that the election that was going to be declared void was the election that was held for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly last weekend. Maybe that is the election that it would very much like to have disappear from its memory because it was a slap in the face for the Australia Labor Party (ALP) from the people of the Northern Territory because they do not understand, accept or see the point in the way that the ALP has run this country, the Victorian economy, the Western Australian economy or the Tasmanian economy. The ALP has proved itself completely incapable of running any economies at all. That is what was said in the Northern Territory election and that is symptomatic of the ALP's complete mismanagement of this very simple matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned before, the Minister does not seem to have a great workload; he does not even have a department to administer and he seems to have very little legislation to put through the Parliament, yet he cannot get this right. The Government has not been able to get interest rates right; it has not been able to get the employment figures right; it has not been able to get the exchange rate or inflation right and it has not been able to administer this Act, which I would have thought was a pretty simple task. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the mismanagement of this legislation, which is symptomatic of the Government's mismanagement generally. I draw the attention of the people of Australia to the fact that yet another $5m of their hard won money-of taxpayers' money- may well be thrown away through the incompetence of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are addressing the failure of the Government and, in particular, the failure of the relevant Minister to ensure that the necessary procedural steps were properly followed in order for these regulations to take effect. I believe this question raises grave doubts as to the validity of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) elections that occurred over the weekend. I think the action-or rather the inaction of the Government because it should have tabled this disallowable instrument within 15 days of its creation-has brought the ATSIC election into disrepute amongst the Aboriginal community. Also, I believe it has created a set of circumstances under which the ATSIC election which occurred over the weekend was technically invalid and void.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will firstly address the effect that the Government's inaction and its failure to table the disallowable instrument within the necessary period have had on the perception of the election amongst the eligible voters themselves. I was in Townsville over the weekend and I read a comment in the Townsville Daily Bulletin on Saturday by one of the candidates for the election on, I believe, Palm Island. She had been asked about the uncertainty created by the Government's failure to table the instrument within the necessary period, and she was not impressed. She said that many of the electors had come to her and were of the belief that it was `a little black fella's election' and that no-one was interested. This is what one of the candidates had to say about the manner in which the election was conducted as a result of the Government failing to table the instrument within the necessary period. How can we have any confidence that ATSIC truly represents the Aboriginal people when there was such a cloud over the election at the time at which it occurred and when there was such uncertainty as to whether the election had been properly called? I believe that comment by one of the candidates standing for election shows that the Government, as a result of its inaction, has brought the election and ATSIC into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are certain technical issues that are also very important when we consider this particular disallowable instrument. I want to analyse in detail whether the instrument was in fact tabled within the necessary timeframe. This goes to the creation of the instrument. In making these and other comments I shall be making liberal reference to the foremost text book on this subject, which is entitled Delegated Legislation, by Mr D.C. Pearce, who was formerly the acting legal counsel to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Mr Pearce makes it very clear in paragraphs 18, 19 and 20 of his text that an instrument is created on the day on which it is signed and that an instrument is not created on the day on which it is gazetted. The argument that the Government, I assume, wishes to make in favour of the fact that this instrument was properly tabled today is that the instrument was not created until the date of notification under section 116 of the Act-but that is the date on which it comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> If I am correct, the Act prescribes that if the Minister is satisfied that the people of the Torres Strait region can be properly represented he shall make his views known in a notice published in the Gazette. That is clearly part of the notification process and it is not, in itself, the Act which actually causes the regulation to take effect. In other words, the Minister failed to understand the process by which he gave effect to and created the disallowable instrument. I believe it is very clear in there and it is also a very clearly understood practice on both sides of the chamber that a disallowable instrument is created on the day on which it is signed; it takes effect from the day on which it is notified. There are four types of disallowable instruments but, on my understanding, this is a disallowable instrument which has effect from the date of notification until such time as the Senate disallows the instrument or the instrument is deemed to have been disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come to the question of whether it was, indeed, tabled within the necessary period of time. The answer is: very clearly, it was not. It is a requirement under the Acts Interpretation Act for the disallowable instrument to be tabled within 15 sitting days of creation-not of notification but of creation. As we have already seen, this instrument was created through the signature of the Minister on 23 August, not 24 August. Therefore, the Government is one sitting day late in tabling this regulation in the Senate. For that reason, this piece of delegated legislation is void and is of no effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Pearce very ably points out that it is not possible to backdate the effect of a piece of delegated legislation. In paragraph 70 he says:</PARA>
<PARA>In all jurisdictions, except Victoria and New Zealand, regulations cannot be back-dated in a manner disadvantageous to members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Very clearly, if they cannot be backdated they cannot be tabled after the date on which they are supposed to take effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This is for a very simple reason. We, in the Senate, must have the opportunity to vote to disallow the regulations or otherwise. Whether we were going to disallow it or not is another matter. But the Senate, through the Government's failure to table the disallowable instrument within the necessary period of time, deprived members of this chamber of their rights to disallow the instrument and to have the instrument properly scrutinised. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is very important. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has, I understand, recommended in a previous report that there be changes so that it is not possible for the Government perpetually to create delegated legislation by tabling regulations the day after the day on which they were disallowed. Quite clearly, there is a possibility--</PARA>

<PARA> The reason why the Standing Committee recommended that there be changes so that legislation could not be tabled after it had been disallowed was that the effect would be to create rolling delegated legislation which would have no end. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the very pertinent point that I believe that not only should this legislation have been tabled prior to the ATSIC elections taking place but also the period during which the delegated legislation could have been disallowed should have elapsed prior to the date on which the ATSIC elections took place. While the possibility exists that the delegated legislation could have been disallowed, I believe there is a very good case that that election was not validly held because there was the possibility that the election could be invalidated at a subsequent date. </PARA>
<PARA> The best argument that the Government could come up with against this proposition would be that the election was validly held until the date on which the disallowable instrument was, in fact, disallowed by the Senate. Suppose we had the situation where the election took place-and I am being hypothetical here-five days before the time period during which disallowance could occur. The very best argument the Government could put forward would be that the election, and the result of the election, was valid for five sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has the Government failed to table the instrument within the necessary period of time but also it failed to allow a sufficient period of time prior to the election to enable those of us in this chamber to have the opportunity of disallowing the delegated legislation so that, if it was not disallowed, those who bothered to turn out at the weekend would have known with total and absolute certainty that their vote was a valid one. </PARA>
<PARA> What confidence does the Government instil in electors when it creates an election which, I believe, was invalid and when it asks people to vote with the possibility not only that the election was invalid but also that the result could be invalidated at a later date? It does absolutely no good for the confidence of electors and it does absolutely no good for their confidence in ATSIC itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if the Government were truly concerned about representation for Aboriginal persons, it would have carried on in a manner wholly different from the manner in which it has acted in respect of this matter. That is what is of concern to me. I do not intend to take issue on whether ATSIC is right or wrong. What I am concerned about is the contempt in which this Government has held not only this Senate but also all of the people who made the effort to vote and, in fact, ATSIC which was itself a child of this Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final matter that is of very great concern to me. Because the instrument was not tabled until today, and was not tabled before the date of the election, those members of this chamber who serve on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances-a committee which Senator Collins once chaired, and his contribution to it is much valued-did not have the opportunity to carry out their role. In case Senator Collins has forgotten, the role of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is to scrutinise delegated legislation to ascertain, firstly, that it is in accordance with the statutes; secondly, that it does not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties; thirdly, that it does not unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative and not judicial decisions; and, fourthly, that it is concerned with administrative detail and does not amount to substantive legislation which could be a matter of parliamentary enactment. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there is a well recognised obligation upon the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to ensure that the disallowable instruments that are tabled in this place are not of a nature which is unacceptable in administrative law. Of course, the Committee looks at the consequences of the disallowable instruments that have been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I have grave concerns and reservations as a member of that Committee-not as a senator with a parliamentary hat on, or as a senator with an axe to grind-when the Government does not table a delegated instrument that affects people's rights and their supposed representation. I believe that the Government's failure, firstly, to table the instrument within the necessary time period and, secondly, to allow sufficient time for the delegated instrument perhaps to be disallowed prior to the election has, in fact, breached the rule of law. One of the principles of the rule of law is that laws must be certain and that rights must be certain. Unfortunately, what we have seen through the Government's shameful conduct is a flouting of legal certainty and a flouting of the certainty of the rights of electors under ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the four reasons-the effect it has had upon the confidence of electors; the failure for the instrument to be properly tabled within the necessary period of time after its creation; the enormous possibilities created for the delegated legislation to be disallowed after the election; and, finally, the contempt that the Government has shown for the Senate and for the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances-which compel me to have grave concerns about the manner in which the Government is carrying on and the manner in which the Minister has handled his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I know for a fact that there will be many people outside this chamber and outside Canberra-be they electors in ATSIC or just concerned citizens-who want to know how the Government could have bungled this so incredibly. They want to know how the Government could have failed even to bother to table the disallowable instrument within the necessary time, or before the election, or to have the election within a sufficient period of time for the possible disallowance of the delegated legislation prior to the election taking place. All of these are matters of grave concern, and matters which the Government has failed to answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the declamatory tripe we have just heard, I intend to assist the Senate by being brief. In order to assist the Senate by being brief, and as we are into the subject of tabling things, I intend to provide that assistance to the Senate-of being brief-by tabling two documents here today. They are a comprehensive report from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) provided to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) at his request on 5 November, after this came to his attention, and written advice he received from ATSIC on 19 September which indicates clearly that all the charges made against the Government and the Minister fall in a heap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I talked about declamatory tripe, I was referring to the tedious nonsense about ministerial responsibility that I have heard so many times in the 14 years I have been a member of parliament. The so-called Westminster system of responsible government has never existed in this country, neither should it have, nor will it in the future. The reasonable and proper interpretation of ministerial responsibility I have always clung to, and will continue to cling to, is that where a Minister does or does not do something that he should or should not have done, or should have reasonably known-in other words, a test of competence-that it should have been done or should not have been done, he is responsible for it. But this so-called nonsensical Westminster tradition of ministerial responsibility that we hear such pontificating tripe about, always from the members of the Opposition, and I have delivered it enough against Ministers in my time as Leader of the Opposition to know what I am talking about, is just that-tripe.</PARA>
<PARA> The Westminster system-and it has happened in Great Britain on many occasions-has resulted in highly competent Ministers being expected to conclude successful contributions to public life because of a mistake that they in fact were not responsible for in every sense of the word; in other words, one they were not aware of, nor could they have reasonably been aware of it. That is arrant nonsense. I have no doubt that the people who have delivered this tripe this afternoon-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not bother to respond to that idiotic interjection, but I will respond to something else that Senator Macdonald said in his contribution to the debate. We are talking about Aboriginal affairs. What the honourable senator said about the comprehensive rejection of the Australian Labor Party at the recent election in the Northern Territory, deserves some comment. I believe that in many ways it was a sad result for the Northern Territory, not because the Labor Party did not win government-frankly I thought that was an inevitable result-but in terms of the gains the Labor Party made in that election and the reasons for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald would do well, before talking about the lessons delivered by the election in the Northern Territory, to look more closely at the result. The Labor Party has always done very well in the Northern Territory in electorates substantially comprising Aboriginal voters. That has been a consistent feature of elections in the Northern Territory, but in the last election the Labor Party did spectacularly better in that regard than it had ever done in gaining two additional seats in addition to the seven seats it already had. In addition to the seats it held formerly, the Labor Party now holds the seats of Victoria River and Barkly. The Labor Party now holds in the Northern Territory, for the information of Senator Macdonald, every seat which has a substantial Aboriginal component. That has not happened since self-government came to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason for that has been the non-stop, very public and very concentrated campaign of one Country Liberal Party (CLP) senator who so far has devoted his entire political career-until he got his recent promotion-to attacking Aboriginals and Aboriginal issues on every occasion available to him in this Parliament and, honourable senators will be amazed to hear, this has not gone unnoticed. Aboriginal people vote on issues. There is a myth that Aboriginal people do not understand the electoral process and do not understand how to vote in elections. That myth was dispelled in the Northern Territory many years past; Aboriginal people vote more closely on issues that affect their lives than anyone I know. It is because the Labor Party has been so closely identified in the Northern Territory with issues which are to the advantage of the Aboriginal community there, and because the Country Liberal Party has been so aggressively and publicly identified with any issues which oppose Aboriginal interests, that I believe the Labor Party got the result it did. </PARA>
<PARA> When I said `regrettable' I did not mean that I regretted the good sense of voters in the bush to deliver nine seats; I regret that the election has been so polarised on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal issues. That is entirely the fault of a Government that insists on going to the polls, as it did again on day one, with its Chief Minister announcing that the major plank in its election campaign would be attacking land rights and ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> With great respect to Senator Macdonald, although the creation of ATSIC unquestionably is by design of this Government to be mainly to the benefit of the Aboriginal community-that is why it was designed; that is why it is here-and in respect of the fact that the Chief Minister announced when he called the election that the major reason for calling it was to call for a vote against ATSIC, which is what he said, the fact is that the Aboriginal community of the Northern Territory overwhelmingly rejected the CLP principally because of that. In respect of this issue-and I confine it to this issue-quite apart from having endorsed the policies of the CLP in the Northern Territory at the recent election the people most directly affected by this organisation unanimously rejected them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fully a third of them-nearly 40,000 voted out of a potential 114,000. That was an extraordinarily good turnout and I was pleasantly surprised at the substantial turnout. But why launch such an onslaught on the validity of local government elections around Australia? It is a fact that it is not compulsory to vote in local government elections in the States of South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. But why is it-and honourable senators opposite give themselves away every time they do this-that they can set up one standard for blacks and another one for whites, which the conservatives do all the time?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an issue that I have raised again and again in the Senate in the time that I have been here. In terms of giving proper consideration to women, who are the other group very often discriminated against consciously and unconsciously in this country, one of the slogans that I have always liked-and one used to see it on coffee mugs and bumper stickers-is that, in order for a woman to compete effectively with a man, it is not good enough for her to be as good: she has to be better. Fortunately, as the slogan used to say, that is not very hard. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing applies-unconsciously, of course-to people like Senator Macdonald. He has just revealed it again: there has to be a higher standard somehow, as unconsciously there always has to be for women. They have to do better than men to be equal to them apparently, according to people like Senator Macdonald-and the same applies to Aboriginals. Somehow or other the validity of the ATSIC elections-and Senator Boswell actually said it specifically-is totally discounted because only a third of the potential vote turned out and voted in a non-compulsory and voluntary election. </PARA>
<PARA> For Senator Macdonald's information, the most recent results that I could obtain from equivalent elections-that is, non-compulsory elections for politicians, such as the local government elections in Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia-are as follows: the turnout for local government elections in South Australia has ranged from 14.8 per cent to a peak of 20.1 per cent in 1989; in Tasmania, the turnout in local government elections is around 18 per cent; and in Western Australia in 1989 it was 15.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Are Senator Macdonald and Senator Boswell now saying that the results of all of those local government elections should be invalidated because of that turnout? Of course they are not. But what they have absolutely no compunction in saying is that, when a third of the entire eligible vote turns out to vote, somehow or other a higher standard has to be achieved if they are Aboriginal than if they are non-Aboriginal, and the vote is invalidated. </PARA>

The Minister and, of course, the Government deeply regret that this happened, but the constant claims that somehow the Minister was derelict fall to the ground in respect of the evidence that is available.

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Customs (Rainforest Timber) Amendment Bill 1990 is to selectively ban the importation of tropical rainforest timbers into Australia. The Bill is a response to the alarming rate of destruction of the world's tropical rainforests. It is one element of a comprehensive strategy by which Australia could and should make a positive contribution to arresting this destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for a comprehensive strategy can not be overemphasised; import restrictions alone are not enough. Aid, technical assistance and campaigning for international action to protect rainforests and develop sustainable economic alternatives to the logging of primary forests are essential adjuncts to a ban. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals to ban tropical timber imports have been before the Government for some time. Last year, the then Environment Minister, Senator Graham Richardson, responded by commissioning Coopers and Lybrand Consultants, in conjunction with Forestry Technical Services Pty Ltd, to evaluate a range of policy options for the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coopers and Lybrand main report, dated April 1990, recently surfaced in the public domain. It recommends against any form of import restriction, favouring instead some modest aid measures and the encouragement of substitutes for tropical timbers, in order to reduce demand in Australia `in [the] medium to long term'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my hope that this Bill will provoke Cabinet to reject the Coopers and Lybrand report, and to take concerted action which reflects the seriousness of the problem. Cabinet must understand that the report is woefully inadequate, and fails to seriously address Australia's global environmental responsibilities. One of the central weaknesses of Coopers and Lybrand's analysis is that it fails to face up to the scale of the ecological, social and economic damage now being wreaked in the world's tropical rainforests. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), some 142,200 square kilometres of rainforest was destroyed in 1989-a 90 per cent increase in the deforestation rate in only 10 years. The United States-based World Resources Institute (WRI) puts the annual loss at nearly 200,000 square kilometres, resulting in the average loss, conservatively estimated, of one hundred species per day, a rate unprecedented in natural history. In a communication of 2 August last year, the European Commission (EC) estimated that `at present rates of forest loss, all but a few of the remotest forest regions, mostly in the Amazon and Congo basins, could have disappeared by the early 21st Century (2010-2025)'. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, global deforestation could be largely complete in twenty years time. Half-hearted measures to take effect in the `medium to long term', as proposed by Coopers and Lybrand, would simply be too little, too late. A report to the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) has concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of tropical moist forest which is being deliberately managed at an operational scale for the sustainable production of timber is, on a world scale, negligible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sunday Herald recently reported that a leaked Indonesian Government report found that only 22 of the country's 527 logging operations follow government guidelines. Those guidelines are themselves inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The indigenous people of the Malaysian state of Sarawak, three of whom recently visited Australia, are engaged in a desperate struggle to arrest the destruction of the forests which are essential to their livelihood-forests which will disappear in eleven years if present logging practices continue, according to the International Tropical Timber Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The social and economic impact of this plunder, which is almost completely ignored by Coopers and Lybrand, is horrendous. As WRI notes:</PARA>
<PARA> Escalating human populations, deforestation, disruptions of watersheds, soil loss, and land degradation are all linked in a vicious cycle that perpetuates and deepens poverty, and often creates ecological refugees. </PARA>
<PARA>The EC states that:</PARA>
<PARA> The most important causes of tropical forest destruction are extreme poverty and over-population. Their impact is accentuated by patterns of land control and ownership which multiply the phenomenon of landlessness and hence acute land hunger. Two more immediate pressures producing this crisis link developing countries to developed via demand for hardwood timber, or cheap beef. </PARA>
<PARA> But the industrialised world's gain of cheap timber and beef is also its loss, through the political and economic impact of Third World poverty, the contribution of deforestation to the build-up of greenhouse gases, and the loss of genetic material available for future use in medicine, agriculture and other vital fields. A 1989 study published in the journal Nature, estimates that the economic value of `minor' forest products from Peruvian rainforests-including fruits, resins, and medicines actually being marketed-exceeded the economic value of using the forest for timber by almost 10 to one. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the destruction of tropical rainforests is a prime example of unsustainable practices which, as ACFOA observes, are the result of `the inequitable distribution of resources, both between and within countries'. For example, the tribes of Sarawak are pitted against Western importers and corrupt local politicians, almost every one of whom-along with friends and relatives-owns extensive logging licences. </PARA>
<PARA> As Australian rainforest activist Patrick Anderson notes, it is essential to view the crisis of rainforest destruction in its historical, cultural and ecological context. He quotes leading rainforest ecologist Marius Jacobs:</PARA>
<PARA> If we review present-day tropical rainforest exploitation we see a strong fixation on timber. This is a recent and curious development. Until well into the 19th century, the prevalent forest use was not for the extraction of timber, but of minor forest products . . . Conscious efforts by tropical foresters to extract timber and to change the forest composition are scarcely older than a century, while mechanical logging, which has so markedly speeded up this process, is even more recent. </PARA>
<PARA> These recent developments seem anomalous because the rainforests are so evidently unsuited to timber extraction ... It is hard to think of a manner of utilization more wasteful for the present and more destructive for the future. A finely tuned, slow-motion ecosystem, a `factory capable of yielding hundreds of exquisite products, some of which are highly valued in international trade, is ripped open by bulldozers that pull down the very pillars supporting its roof, while quantities of scarce minerals that the ecosystem might convert into fruits, latex, medicine, spices, stimulants and other precious articles, are lost in the process. To obtain a few useful species, all others are left to their fate. It seems almost too clumsy an approach to spend any more words on . . . </PARA>
<PARA> If the present type of utilization is continued, in at most half a century's time the remaining `pillars', too, will have been extracted, the roof of our living factory will have caved in and the factory itself demolished altogether over certain areas. How is it possible that people have invoked `economic need' to justify such stupidity?</PARA>
<PARA>In the face of this crisis, the Australian Democrats support the comprehensive strategy adopted by ACFOA, which calls for:</PARA>
<PARA>* international debt relief for the poorest countries, including through `debt-for-nature' swaps;</PARA>
<PARA>* large increases in overseas aid, redirected towards the alleviation of poverty, and with a particular emphasis on developing alternative, sustainable economic strategies in tropical countries;</PARA>
<PARA>* world trade arrangements which do not discriminate against developing countries;</PARA>
<PARA>* wide-ranging technical assistance to developing countries in areas of forest management, and environmental planning and impact assessment;</PARA>
<PARA>* a ban on the importation of tropical timbers cut from primary rainforests, measures to ensure that timber plantations established by Australian firms overseas have acceptable social and environmental impacts; and</PARA>
<PARA>* international lobbying to widen the adoption of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>The import ban is of course the focus of this Bill, but the other measures are equally important. They must be implemented together if they are to be just and effective. For example, it is essential that Australian aid and capital does not contribute to deforestation. Patrick Anderson has evidence that Bunnings Brothers, a Western Australian firm, has had a devastating impact on the forests in the West Sepik region of Papua New Guinea. Another Western Australian firm, Asmus McLean, is apparently involved in a 600,000 hectare forest concession in West Irian, where the rights of local people have been ignored in the push to establish a huge logging operation. And BHP Trading is reported to trade in timber from Sarawak, to the detriment of the local indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Anderson, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), has funded `Forest Enrichment' programs in Fiji which have destroyed native forests and polluted waterways with powerful herbicides. Other aid has funded massive sawmills, to the detriment of local communities. And AIDAB is planning a $2.3m forest resource inventory for the Solomon Islands which will map the areas of remaining forests for the benefit of largely multinational logging companies. Concerted action to end such malpractices is as important as the import ban. </PARA>
<PARA> The ban is implemented as an amendment to section 50 of the Customs Act 1901, which provides for the selective or absolute banning of specified imports by regulation. A new section 50A would empower the Minister to issue licences to import logs, sawn timber, veneers and plywoods made from rainforest timbers only if he or she is satisfied that the timber is to be cut from plantations, or that:</PARA>
<PARA>* the forest from which the timber is to be cut is secondary or regrowth forest;</PARA>
<PARA>* substantial areas of the forest from which the timber is to be cut is adequately protected in secure parks and reserves;</PARA>
<PARA>* the operation is carried out at the instigation of, or with approval of the owners and inhabitants of the land concerned; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the logging operations do not threaten the area's integrity as a natural rain forest or its ability to support any traditional inhabitants thereof. </PARA>
<PARA>Each licence would specify the maximum quantity of timber to be imported, the area from which it is to be cut and an expiry date. The Comptroller-General of Customs would be empowered to require importers to produce records of the origin of timber or timber products imported under licence. Where licence conditions had been violated, licences could be cancelled and fines of up to $10,000 imposed. The granting, refusing or revoking of a licence would be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a transitional provision under which imports resulting from sales or contracts struck from today would be blocked after proclamation. This is to prevent attempts to avoid the intent of the Bill by concluding long term contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> The import restrictions have been limited to logs, sawn timber, veneers and plywoods because they comprise a majority of Australian imports-about 70 per cent by volume-and because imports of those products are already categorised by timber species by the Australian Customs Service for the purposes of levying tariffs. This makes administration of the ban a relatively straightforward extension of existing Customs activities. Other wood products, such as mouldings and furniture, are not categorised by timber species, thus complicating the administration of a ban. Furthermore, further processing makes it more difficult to identify the area from which the timber is cut. </PARA>
<PARA> While efforts should be made to increase the range of products covered by the ban, it may be just as cost-effective to use lobbying and aid measures to assist producer countries to change their practices, and to convince other importing countries to follow Australia's lead. There can be no more important target for such lobbying than Japan. It is obscene that Japanese car parts enter Australia in casing made from tropical timbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The conditions in the Bill relating to the rights of indigenous peoples are particularly important, as they are affected more adversely by tropical deforestation than most. A 1987 report commissioned by the Sarawak State Government on the plight of the Penan forest dwellers concluded that logging had reduced the Penan's food resources and raw materials for handicrafts, had polluted their rivers and streams, and had disrupted their normal activities-yet the Penan had no voice in policy formulation. That report, incidentally, has been suppressed and came to me via a leak in Denmark. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill places the onus on intending importers to demonstrate that they should be given licences. Where doubt exists because insufficient information is available, then licences should not be issued. It is essential that bilateral and multilateral processes be established to identify environmentally responsible timber producing operations. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of arguments advanced against an import ban, most of which are discussed in the Coopers and Lybrand report. One argument is that the major cause of tropical deforestation is not logging, but shifting agriculture. Therefore, a ban on timber imports will have little effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The EC cites estimates that 4 per cent of rainforest removals are for timber exports. But it warns that the large equipment used for export timber extraction causes disproportionate damage, with the removal of three to five trees from a hectare in Borneo resulting in the destruction of up to 55 per cent of the forest. Furthermore, export logging opens up remote areas for unsustainable slash and burn agriculture and displaces indigenous people who are then forced to practice such agriculture. The various forms of destruction are interrelated, which demonstrates the need for the comprehensive approach I am proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, Australia's major source of tropical timber imports is Malaysia, where the contribution of slash and burn agriculture to deforestation is much lower than in, for example, South America and where the contribution of export logging is correspondingly higher. As Dr Kenneth Baldwin of the Australian National University has written, most of the shifting agriculture in Sarawak occurs in previously logged secondary forest and is estimated to be responsible for the loss of only 4,000 hectares of primary rainforest, compared to the 200,000 hectares devoured by logging. </PARA>
<PARA> Another objection is that a logging ban, particularly if widely adopted, would cause economic hardship in tropical countries. It must be re-emphasised that the unsustainability of current practices is certain to cause such hardship in the medium term, and that restructuring will avoid that the provision of significant levels of aid should help prevent much short term damage. The Democrats have shown, in our alternative Budget proposals for 1990-91, that Australia could afford to provide $60m of aid for that purpose. This compares to the $280m which we now spend on tropical timber imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Conversely, it has also been claimed that an Australian ban would have very little impact and would be a meaningless symbolic gesture. This is wrong on several counts. Firstly, a comparatively modest aid investment in Pacific island countries, notably Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, coupled with a ban, would have a large impact in these countries. Secondly, the impact on Malaysia would be significant enough to be noticed, even though Japan is the major destination of Malaysian tropical timbers. Thirdly, there is evidence of sufficient international concern for an Australian ban to have a significant demonstration effect. Austria has already moved to ban such imports. Sweden is reported to have followed suit, although detailed information has yet to come to hand. As international efforts to reduce the rate of species loss and greenhouse gas emissions gather momentum, tropical deforestation will increasingly be a focus of attention. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia abides by its international responsibilities and implements a selective ban, it is in a strong position to lobby other Western nations to follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been claims that Australia's international legal obligations to free trade, enshrined in the faltering General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would be inconsistent with a ban. However, GATT allows for general exceptions to free trade principles where `necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health' or `relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption'. A ban would help achieve these goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a good record of protecting its remaining rainforests, consistent with the terms of the import restrictions specified in this Bill and hence with the GATT exceptions. But a moral, if not legal, question mark hangs over Government policy on our non-tropical native forests, which continue to be logged unsustainably. It is worth pointing out that the development of a plantation based forestry industry in Australia would be accelerated by a domestic ban on logging of old-growth forests, coupled with tropical timber import restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Coopers and Lybrand, in their report, devote considerable attention and anxiety to the problem of finding substitutes for imported tropical timbers in the domestic economy. The pessimism they express completely ignores the union-led advances that have already been made in this area. It is instructive to read a hysterical headline from the Australian of 17 October 1989: `Union ban on imported wood threatens building industry'. This followed a ban by the Victorian branch of the Building Workers' Industrial Union on the use of imported rainforest timbers on building sites, particularly plywood for concrete formwork. In the twelve months since then, substitutes have been found, and, quite clearly, the building industry in Victoria has not collapsed as a result. This development is ignored by Coopers and Lybrand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wilderness Society's Keith Tarlo has noted that imported rainforest timbers comprise a mere 6 per cent of our total timber usage. Woodworker and furniture maker Michael Gill told ABC Radio's AM program on 10 October that:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole of the Australian building industry could stop using imported rainforest timber tomorrow without any ill effects being felt whatsoever. It will cost a little bit more to use alternatives, and that's about all we'll feel. It could be done tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>Until now, the Australian Government has placed its faith in international institutions such as the ITTO, and the Tropical Forestry Action Plan prepared by the WRI, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. However, this is not enough. Urgent action is needed, and international consensus has yet to produce a strategy which is equal to the task at hand. Catalysts are required, and Australia can and should take the lead. </PARA>
<PARA> A precise analogy can be found in the case of Antarctica. International efforts have yielded a convention which would allow mining in the world's last remaining continental wilderness. The Federal Government, against what seemed to be overwhelming odds, began a campaign for the Antarctic to comprehensively protect it. Important gains have been made as a result of the courageous lead that has been taken. The same commitment is required to save the world's rainforests, for the sake of humanity. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1990 represents a further stage in the Government's strategy to deal effectively with the illicit trade in drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> As all Honourable Senators are aware, this illicit trade has no regard to national boundaries; it is by its nature international. Effective, co-ordinated international action is, therefore, an essential element in combating this evil. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Government has over the past seven years placed the highest priority on providing and securing international co-operation in the fight against the illicit trade in drugs and organised crime which is dependent on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past seven years the Government has modernised Australia's extradition laws and negotiated and secured 28 modern extradition treaties. In this period, Australia has led the rest of the world in the development of modern arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters, thereby securing treaty backed obligations to assist in criminal investigations, prosecutions, the pursuit of the international criminal money trail and the confiscation of criminally obtained assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, in the international arena Australian model extradition and mutual assistance treaties form the basis of model bilateral treaties developed by the United Nations Crime Prevention Committee for adoption by the 8th UN Crime Congress being held in Havana. </PARA>
<PARA> On the domestic legal front the Government's Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 comprise one of the most comprehensive legislative packages for following the money trail in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's achievements have been recognised in the international community, most recently by our inclusion in the Financial Action Task Force established by the Group of Seven major economic nations to advise on the prevention of money laundering. As the International Enforcement Law Reporter stated in its September 1989 edition``Australia's participation-in the taskforce-is significant because it has taken a leadership role in international criminal co-operation''. </PARA>
<PARA>BACKGROUND TO THE BILL</PARA>
<PARA> It was because of our commitment to international law enforcement co-operation that Australia played a prominent role in the development of a new United Nations convention whose purpose is to ensure that the international community co-operates in the adoption of a wide range of measures aimed at stemming the illicit drug trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's ratification of this convention will achieve one of the aims of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which has the support of all governments in Australia. The States have been aware of the proposed Convention and of the Commonwealth's wish to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process in 1985, and their views were sought at each stage of the negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation represents the first step in the process of Australia's ratification of that Convention-the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which was signed by Australia in Vienna in February 1989. It is the culmination of almost four years' work by member countries of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise, however, that this Convention represents only one strand in the international drug strategy, which, as the international community recognises, requires a multidisciplinary approach. Thus, the Declaration of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna in June 1987 designated four areas for future action:</PARA>
<PARA>- prevention and reduction of demand;</PARA>
<PARA>- control of supply (including programs for rural development involving crop eradication and substitution);</PARA>
<PARA>- suppression of illicit trafficking; and</PARA>
<PARA>- treatment and rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Convention is, of course, directed at the illicit drug trade, it also touches upon these other important aspects of the problem of drug abuse. This, too, is consistent with the approach adopted in the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse. This Campaign also takes a multidisciplinary approach with a strong emphasis on education and prevention directed at vulnerable groups, and treatment and rehabilitation of regular users. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a degree of misunderstanding about the effect which ratification of the Convention will have on policy in the drugs area. Contrary to some views which have been expressed, this Convention does not preclude the re-examination of policy in relation to personal use of prohibited drugs. It is open to Governments, within the context of this convention, to provide that possession which would otherwise be an offence will not be subject to criminal penalties where the possession is clearly for personal use only. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the Convention specifically states that Parties may, as an alternative to conviction or punishment in such cases, provide measures for the treatment, education, aftercare, rehabilitation or social reintegration of the offender. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, section 17A of the Crimes Act 1914, which provides that imprisonment should be imposed as a last resort, will apply to offences created under this Bill. As a result, when the courts are considering sentences to be imposed on persons convicted of offences in relation to cultivation or production for personal use, they will be required to give preference to alternative forms of sentences which could lawfully be imposed. Such alternatives could include programs of rehabilitation, treatment and education and the court would need to be satisfied that none of these options is appropriate before they impose a sentence of imprisonment. Thus, sentencing options already available in the case of Commonwealth offenders enable us to take full advantage of the alternatives to sentencing proposed in Article 3 of the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the obligations created under the Convention which fall within areas of Commonwealth legislative responsibility are already covered by Commonwealth legislation such as the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988, and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Other obligations fall within areas of State responsibility, and consultations are under way with the States on action to be taken by them to ensure their laws are in accord with the terms of the Convention. The Commonwealth has been very much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in this field and fully supports the continuation of the co-operative approach to drug law enforcement with the State and Territory Governments and their law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLINE OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA> The principal area requiring legislation in the Commonwealth sphere relates to the need to create extra-territorial jurisdiction under Article 4 of the Convention. The purpose of the jurisdictional changes envisaged by Article 4 is to ensure that drug traffickers cannot escape justice by moving from one jurisdiction to another e.g. to a jurisdiction which for a valid reason is not prepared to surrender the person to the country whose laws were infringed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now outline the ways in which this Bill will extend Australia's extra-territorial jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The first extension relates to Australian nationals who have engaged in conduct, outside the reach of existing jurisdiction, which would constitute an Article 3 offence if it had occurred in Australia and where extradition of such persons from Australia is not sought or, if sought, is not granted for reasons outside the scope of section 45 of the Extradition Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also establishes a second area of jurisdiction where a person who is not an Australian national has engaged in drug-related conduct outside Australia which would constitute an offence against the law of the country where it occurred and also against the law in force in an Australian State or Territory; the person is subsequently present in Australia, and Australia declines to extradite that person. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Bill creates jurisdiction over persons who, outside Australia, engage in conduct with the view to the commission of a drug-related offence in Australia-for example, knowingly growing a crop for subsequent marketing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also creates offences arising out of drug-related conduct on Australian aircraft and provides for the exercise of Commonwealth jurisdiction on Australian ships in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Another provision creates a federal offence which has the effect of applying, outside Australia, State and Territory offences of conspiring or attempting, aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the carrying out of drug-related conduct which is an offence against the law of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT</PARA>
<PARA> I do not anticipate that the proposals put forward in this Bill will have a significant impact on Government expenditure in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first step in the process of ratification of this most important United Nations Convention. Further action will be required by the States before ratification can take place. The Convention seeks to achieve concerted international action against those who, for their own gain and at great cost to the community, engage in illicit trafficking in drugs. The co-operative multidisciplinary approach of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse recognises the need to address the problems of addiction with compassion and to offer treatment and rehabilitation to those suffering under all forms of drug addiction. In no way can it be argued that ratification will prevent a reasoned and complete debate on the merits of the present national approach to drug abuse. The Government welcomes such a debate but remains committed, along with our State and Territory counterparts, to the type of tough and thorough measures prescribed by the Convention in respect of illicit drug trafficking. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill I am introducing today is to set the legislative framework in place for Australia to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. </PARA>
<PARA>BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA> The Convention provides a mechanism for settlement, by means of conciliation and arbitration, of investment disputes between a State Party to the Convention (or any constituent subdivision or agency of that State) and investors from other States Party. To this end the Convention established the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, better known as ICSID. Hence the Convention is often referred to as the ICSID Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention, which is the outcome of the work of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (`the World Bank'), was opened for signature on 18 March 1966 and entered into force on 14 October 1966. There are currently 91 parties to the Convention including nearly all Australia's major trading partners. Australia signed the Convention on 24 March 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The ratification of the Convention by Australia will be a further important step in advancing the Government's objective of developing Australia's role in international commercial dispute resolution. Honourable Senators will recall that in 1989 this Government introduced legislation to implement the Model Law on Commercial Arbitration which had been developed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The adoption of the Model Law was a major step towards enhancing Australia's position as a centre for international commercial arbitration. Ratification of the ICSID Convention will further enhance this position. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia already has 2 centres for international arbitration in Sydney and Melbourne which have been operating for some time, and ratification of the ICSID Convention will enable Australia to build on the expertise developed in those 2 centres. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also significant advantages which flow from ratifying the Convention from which Australian investors could benefit. In particular, the facilities provided under the Convention for conciliation and arbitration are an appropriate means for settlement of claims by investors arising out of expropriation of private assets in overseas countries. Ratification may also help to promote foreign investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>CONTENT OF THE BILL</PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to some of the more salient features of the Bill. The Bill will implement the ICSID Convention by amending the International Arbitration Act 1974 and the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. The International Arbitration Act currently gives effect to the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the so-called `New York Convention') which establishes rules governing the recognition and enforcement in Australia of international arbitral awards and agreements. The Act also implements the UNCITRAL Model Law. The Bill will amend that Act by inserting a new Part and a new Schedule to that Act. Thus all Commonwealth legislation relating to international arbitration will be contained in the one Act. The Bill will amend the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act to enable effect to be given to certain privileges and immunities provisions of the Convention by extending the regulation-making power under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives the force of law to the key provisions of the Convention. It also provides that arbitral awards will be binding and enforceable in the Supreme Courts of the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>THE ICSID CONVENTION</PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the principal features of the Convention. The Convention established the Centre which incorporates an Administrative Council, a Secretariat, a Panel of Arbitrators and a Panel of Conciliators. The Administrative Council comprises a representative from each Contracting State. The President of the World Bank is ex officio Chairman of the Council. The Panels of Conciliators and of Arbitrators are made up of persons designated by the Contracting States and by the Chairman of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The jurisdiction of the Centre under the Convention extends to any legal dispute, arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. No proceedings can be initiated under the Convention unless both the State and the investor have specifically agreed to accept the Centre's jurisdiction. However, once the parties have given their consent, it cannot be withdrawn unilaterally. This will enable investment disputes between a State and a foreign investor to be dealt with under the ICSID Convention if the parties agree. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision to designate constituent subdivisions of a State Party and, in the case of Australia, it is proposed to designate those Australian States that agree to such designation. The effect of designation is that a State Government involved in an investment dispute with a foreign national will be able, if the parties so agree, to avail itself of the facilities offered by the Convention. All States except Western Australia have indicated their agreement to be designated. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute is to be settled in accordance with the rules of law chosen by the parties or, if they fail to agree, the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and any applicable rules of international law. </PARA>
<PARA> Every Contracting State is required to recognise arbitral awards as binding and to enforce such awards as if they were final decisions of a domestic court. </PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA> The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development provides the Centre with accommodation and basic services free of charge in Washington DC. Under the Convention, parties making use of the ICSID's facilities are required to bear the expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with conciliation and arbitration proceedings. Only in the event that the expenditure of the Centre cannot be met out of charges for the use of its facilities, or out of other receipts, will Contracting States be required to contribute towards any excess. It is accordingly anticipated that any impact on Commonwealth expenditure will be minimal. </PARA>

The amount sought is $117.8m, which is for the operating expenses and capital expenditures of the parliamentary departments for the year ending 30 June 1991. Of this amount of $117.8m, $47.6m was authorised by the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act and the balance of $70.2m is being sought in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the levels of appropriation being sought in these Bills are inconsistent with the economic needs of this nation, with the need for fiscal restraint. Quite clearly, the Government has lost control of one major arm of economic policy, namely fiscal policy. It is a matter of considerable concern that the expenditure control by the States-they are never noted for great expenditure control-has been greater this year than that by the Commonwealth. A 6.1 per cent increase is budgeted for the States of Australia this financial year compared to a staggering 11.9 per cent increase for Commonwealth own purpose spending, net of public debt interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's latest monthly transaction statement shows that we are more than on track with the reckless expenditure course set by the Government at Budget time. The Government has obviously lost all serious intent in meaningful control of its spending. This year, at a time when we should be exercising the greatest possible expenditure restraint, the Government has gone back to the profligate ways of the first two or three years of the Hawke Government when the spending and fiscal policies set in train most of the problems that have occurred in our economy in the ensuing period. </PARA>
<PARA> So profligate has the Government been this year that it could find only a paltry $350m reduction in expenditure against the Forward Estimates-less than one half of one per cent. No government serious in its intent to govern responsibly would suggest that a reduction less than onehalf of one per cent in its Forward Estimates of expenditure represents a meaningful reduction in expenditure. </PARA>

Had the Minister been following this debate at all-which it is quite clear from his performance in the Parliament and elsewhere he has not-he would know that 12 months ago the Opposition released an Economic Action Plan which detailed most carefully a $3 billion expenditure reduction which has never been challenged by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1990 Budget was introduced only 10 weeks ago. Already that Budget is outdated; already it is obsolete. It is obsolete because the whole framework surrounding the Budget has been blown apart. Even the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said on television on Sunday that the key parameters guiding the Budget estimates are now incorrect. He has admitted that both inflation and unemployment will be higher than predicted at Budget time and that the downturn may be more drawn out than the Government was banking on with consequent impacts on outlays and revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, in response to a question of mine, almost admitted that this economy was in recession. He said that it is not in a technical recession, but he did admit that we were in a major downturn and that it follows from that that the problems facing this economy are very deep seated and intractable. The mechanisms and policies that the Government is pursuing to attempt to deal with those intractable problems are patently out of line with real needs. What this fiscal laxity on the Government's part means is that even greater weight has to be put on other policy arms to address our problems. That has not been the case. There has been a substantial easing in monetary policy. Micro-economic reform has stalled before even getting into first gear. The Government is hamstrung on its wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to focus on inflation, since the Government, and especially the Treasurer (Mr Keating), have thrown the towel in on attacking inflation. The Minister for Finance has already admitted that the Budget time forecast of 6.5 per cent inflation will be exceeded. That comes on top of the 7.3 per cent and 8 per cent increases in the previous two financial years. It is almost a cliche now to say that under this Government we have seen our inflation rate consistently around twice the average of that of our major trading partners. That is a problem of fundamental magnitude. What should be done about it?</PARA>
<PARA> The first thing that needs to be done is to establish an anti-inflationary culture. That was recently recognised by the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Monetary policy needs to be directed at attacking inflation. The Government itself must be committed to that goal. It must make that commitment clear to all concerned over the medium and the longer term. That is what is so damaging about the policies of this Government-there is no commitment at all to reduce inflation. In fact, the accord has institutionalised inflationary expectations. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank has acknowledged, this has set a dangerously high floor under inflation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That is also why the continued reliance on monetary policy has been so damaging for Australia. It has been directed at essentially the wrong prime target-the current account of the balance of payments, as the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank was honest enough to point out before he was, of course, publicly berated by the Treasurer, who was unwilling to admit the error in his whole policy targeting and direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be hard to find an economist today who would not acknowledge that the thing monetary policy does best is control inflation. Also, there has never been any commitment on the Government's part to reduce inflation. The next cut in interest rates was always around the corner, even if no headway was made on inflation. No headway could be expected, given the damage and the institutionalisation of that high inflation rate by the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to replace the inflationary expectations now entrenched in our system with an anti-inflation culture. I quote the Governor of the Reserve Bank in New Zealand because it is a very important statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The objective of eliminating inflation can be accomplished provided the authorities remain committed to that objective . . . if those who set prices and wages could be convinced that inflation could be eliminated over the next two years, the social costs of achieving this would in turn be eliminated. This emphasises the need for the Reserve Bank (and indeed politicians) to say nothing which might reduce the credibility of that objective. Every time credibility is reduced, the social costs of reducing inflation are increased. </PARA>
<PARA>To do this the Government needs to better articulate the major costs of inflation. They are not always well recognised or easily identified, but they are of major concern. Major social and economic costs are involved with inflation. The redistributive effects on income and wealth are unpredictable and undesirable. There is a bias to short term, speculative investment rather than to long term, productive investment. Volatile high rates of inflation make planning difficult. Interaction with the tax system is a major problem. Under high inflation there is a strong incentive for acquisition of real estate rather than productive investment and discouragement for financial savings. This is the very opposite of what the country needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation provides an incentive for the Government to see it continue through the revenue gains from bracket creep. Indeed, it has been calculated by the firm, Access Economics Pty Ltd, that since 1983-84 the Government has received $22 billion from taxpayers in bracket creep alone. Inflation adds to the foreign debt problem by eroding competitiveness, eroding incentives to save and invest, and also by attacking stability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should give an unequivocal commitment that inflation is a prime concern which will be consistently addressed. There is only one way to bring down inflation on a sustainable basis and that is to convince savers that the Government and the Reserve Bank are irrevocably committed to long term price stability. This is especially difficult when there is a history of caving in when the short term social and political costs of achieving it begin to mount. There is now an obvious parallel with the excessive easing of monetary policy back in 1987-88. The then outgoing Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bob Johnston, said in May 1989 that the excessive easing in policy due to the bank's miscalculations meant that interest rates would remain high for quite a while. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was believed then (ie around May 88) that the course of monetary policy would be a good deal easier. Now . . . the major miscalculation that we made, including myself, was to underestimate the power in the economy, the pressure of growth, the exuberant spirit and the animal spirits that were at large and we have gone on underestimating for a very long time how strong the economy is-so that we were not able to get a switch of policies, pressure from monetary policy on to fiscal policy, and we find now that we need them both. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the point that I was making earlier. With every premature easing of monetary policy which is not accompanied by accommodating changes in other arms of policy, the task is that much more painful next time around. The inflationary expectations become further entrenched and the problem becomes that much more intractable. </PARA>
<PARA> We need decisive action on inflation. We should have had it when this Government started to let the inflationary situation run out of control years ago. The Government lacked the courage then and the resolve to make the necessary changes to turn our disastrous inflationary situation around. It is still refusing to do that and we are living bitterly with the consequences of that lack of courage. Instead, the Treasurer is quite obviously preparing the ground for a further cut in interest rates at a time when the wheels are falling off the Government's policy cart particularly, as I said earlier, so far as fiscal policy is concerned. As Max Walsh said only yesterday in the Melbourne Age-and I commend his article to senators:</PARA>
<PARA>A further cut in domestic interest rates would signal that Australia is prepared to risk the inflationary consequences of capital flight, a collapsing exchange rate and accelerating inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that we are on the precipice of another major hike in our inflation rate compared with the rest of the world. If that is the case, then that indeed is a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Many exporters and local manufacturers who face competition from imports understandably complain about the impact of high interest rates on the exchange rate. High interest rates cause the exchange rate for the Australian dollar to be higher than it otherwise would be. As a result, at least in the short term, exports are dearer and imports are cheaper. The issue is very complex, but a number of points can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it is absolutely beyond dispute that monetary policy-any monetary policy-will have an effect on the exchange rate. It is also generally acknowledged that monetary policy has a major impact on inflation but has only limited effect on the real economy-that is, output and employment-other than in the short term. If we were to accept the need for a devaluation of the currency, there would be a direct and quite immediate effect on inflation. This would come through increased prices of imports and for those goods which are sold domestically but also exported. </PARA>
<PARA> Movements in the exchange rate are also likely to have a major impact on inflationary expectations-expectations already so entrenched in Australia. Exchange rate changes also tend to reflect capital flows rather than underlying trade and competitiveness conditions. Therefore, any depreciation in the exchange rate tends to increase inflation both directly and indirectly and tends to push up long term interest rates, and often short term interest rates as well, as local and foreign savers demand increased compensation for the eroding capital value of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings us to the critical issue of whether a fall in the nominal exchange rate can actually help our exporters and import-competing industries in the longer term. The value of a depreciation is soon eroded if inflation continues to run ahead of our major trading partners because this undermines our competitiveness. I have just outlined the reasons why a nominal depreciation creates a number of pressures to build inflation into the system. Two of the world's most successful export countries in the past few decades have been Japan and West Germany-indeed, they are not only successful export countries but they are probably the two most successful countries in the world in terms of growth and lifting the living standards of their people. The currencies of each of these nations have been steadily appreciating over time.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been various economic modelling done by various institutions in recent times-and, indeed, over a lengthy period-to look at the question of the gains or otherwise from continued easing of monetary policy. A very interesting article in today's Australian comments on some recent economic model simulations by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA). That IPA modelling showed that there would be little to gain and something to lose from continued easing of monetary policy. Any cuts in interest rates would be unlikely to be sustained, according to the outcome of the study, and there would be no improvement in unemployment or growth. The only lasting impact of looser monetary policy would be to lift the inflation rate significantly above its current trajectory. </PARA>
<PARA> The IPA simulations did show, however, that long term gains could be delivered with a tighter fiscal policy. With a substantial tightening of fiscal policy there would be beneficial effects on the current account deficit and a sustained fall in interest rates and the exchange rate. This is what makes these Appropriation Bills so irresponsible. The inadequacy of the Budget in effectively restraining outlays means that the Opposition's continued call for a rebalancing of policy appears not possible with this Government. It is impossible to deliver sustained falls in interest rates unless looser monetary policy is backed up by tighter wages and fiscal policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The failings of this Budget were also evident in a number of issues that were raised by me and by many other members in the Senate Estimates committees. In the area of the Department of Finance, major bungling was revealed over the sale of assets which are supposed to contribute up to $1 billion to the Government coffers this year. The sale of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline has run into trouble, involving Supreme Court action, possible breach of business contracts, and a repeat tender process after changing the rules of the game midstream. I would also refer to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation sale which saw journalists being raided. I must say that the obstructionist line at Estimates hearings from asset sales task force members was a matter of concern to the Senate. We will be returning to that in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw evidence of abuse of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. We discovered delays in the payments made from the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office. We found continued tensions between the Government and the Australian Audit Office over its role and resourcing. In the Treasury evidence to an Estimates committee we saw massive stonewalling on the question of the Treasury involvement and the knowledge of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of developments in the Pyramid collapse in Victoria. Then there was the question of the sale of the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank and the role that the Treasurer played in that. The Treasury, remarkably, is still sticking to its Budget forecasts even though both the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Treasurer have admitted in recent days that two of the central parameters, namely inflation and unemployment, are understated. The possible compensation for oil companies after the Treasurer's inappropriate interference in the setting of oil prices was also a matter for considerable debate in Estimates committees, and it is a matter that I hope the Senate will pursue in consideration of these Bills in Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and most importantly, in mentioning matters relevant to the Senate Estimates procedures, I foreshadow that, when Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is being considered in the Committee of the Whole, the coalition will be moving the following request for amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That the House of Representatives be requested to amend the Bill by reducing the vote for the Department of Administrative Services by $1,028,596 because of the decision to write off as irrecoverable money unlawfully paid out as postage entitlement for certain members of the Parliament. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell the Minister the reason. The reason for the request to reduce the appropriations for the Department of Administrative Services is that postal entitlements totalling over $1m were paid out through Australia Post to certain members of parliament even though such a sum was never ever legally appropriated. The Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services made the decision to write off the $1m as irrecoverable on the recommendation of the departmental officer in charge of the matter. There was never any attempt made to recover those moneys.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition has opposed the payment of this additional postage entitlement from the beginning. As a result, there has been a disallowance of the payments by the High Court of Australia following the intervention of and approach by the Hon. Neil Brown. The Parliament has already rejected the Government's attempts to validate the payments. The illegal spending of these moneys undermines one of the basic tenets of our parliamentary and constitutional system. Let me quote the High Court decision on this matter--</PARA>

<PARA> This is not a course of action that the coalition has taken lightly. Senator Durack in particular and others, including me, will be pursuing this matter further in committee. To seek to amend Appropriation Bills is not a decision that any opposition takes lightly. However, a major point of principle is at stake here. The matter cannot be left to one side just because the Government has done all it can to sweep its own illegal actions under the carpet. It is simply untenable that no attempt of any sort has been made to recover the overpayments. The whole situation is absolutely ludicrous. This Government-the Minister in the chamber, Senator Bolkus, is responsible for the matter I am raising-holds the normal and proper processes of this Parliament in contempt. Such contempt must not be permitted to occur without every effort being made to prevent it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of minutes available to me, let me go back to the overall thrust of the Budget. I have outlined the problems that the coalition sees with the Budget. I now want to outline briefly the alternative strategy that we would adopt in government to start tackling the problems which have beset Australia very importantly as a result of the actions of this Government. There are several major areas of difference between the two parties and never has the electorate had a clearer choice than now exists between the two major parties in the Federal Parliament. First of all, on expenditure we are committed to a much greater degree of restraint than has occurred under Labor. Unless there is much greater expenditure restraint, anything else that we do to tackle the underlying problems in this country will go for nought. </PARA>
<PARA> In taxation, we are committed to a fundamental overhaul of the taxation structure in Australia. We have already announced some of the details of that, but in particular we will abolish the unfair and inefficient wholesale sales tax and introduce a single rate goods and services tax at a level that will permit compensation to low income earners and pensioners as well as providing substantial income cuts to all workers. On monetary policy, we will also do as I have suggested today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest not only to Senator Short's speech but also to previous speeches by Opposition members and the leaders. In them I sought to find their alternatives. Unfortunately, they were a bit like Senator Short's speech with plenty of attack, rhetoric and high powered words but, when we get down to what the alternatives are, we are left with about one minute out of 30 minutes. We have not been able to find out what the Opposition would do differently. All it says is that there would be greater restraint. I ask: In what areas would there be greater restraint? Until people can outline very carefully the areas of greater restraint they are asking us to make, they are not credible. Opposition members talk about a goods and services tax and say that there will be no exemptions to such a tax. Therefore, they fail to tell us what will happen to organisations such as charitable organisations which are currently exempted from a number of things such as sales tax. What would be the impact on such organisations? Opposition members talk about reducing the level of income tax. That is fine rhetoric, but until we have the actual hard details there is not much that one can say about it, except that it is very broad brush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I wish to look at several areas concerning individuals and groups of individuals that are affected by the Budget, governments and the community. Mainly those are rural people, and people who are mobile. I include Australian Defence Force (ADF) families. There is a lot to commend in the initiatives that have been taken recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), with the support of the States, on new federalism. I will continue to support those actions fully and will bring to the attention of both the Prime Minister and the State Premiers instances and areas that they need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Although a lot has been done through the new federalism discussions, let me highlight some of the problems facing mobile families in terms of education. It is only in the last two years that education has moved forward and we have recognised that we are Australia and not six States and two Territories. People do move between the six States and the two Territories. They do not require visas or passports to do so. However, with the education system that exists between the six States and the two Territories sometimes they would have greater ease of movement if they were moving overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not yet have a common starting age for people commencing formal education. We have managed to overcome the problem, but on previous occasions it has meant that children commencing formal education at the beginning of the year in one State may not have been able to continue their schooling if, for instance, their family moved to another State in the May school holidays. For example, a family may have moved from Victoria to Queensland for employment reasons but, because the starting age in Queensland was different, that family's children were not able to continue their schooling. The States have been amenable and very cooperative in overcoming that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a problem with handwriting in that States would not accept another State's handwriting style. For the life of me I cannot understand why, in this single country called Australia, one handwriting style is not the sensible way to go. However, the States have now agreed to accept the different handwriting styles within the country. That is a very good move forward on the part of the States and I thank them for it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for some portability of subjects because what might be called economics in one State may not be at all like the economics taught in another State. There may be problems with teaching languages. If the family of a child being taught Italian in a school transfers that child may find that at the new school he cannot continue his option of Italian but has to learn Indonesian, Japanese, German or perhaps French. That discriminates against the child. Usually languages are taught at the senior level, so that person who is preparing himself for future education and employment is being discriminated against, causing him problems when he tries to get a decent high school certificate score or tertiary entrance score, depending on which State it is. In addition, conditions of entry into high school are not the same throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am promoting some portability so that students can move between States in Australia without harming their education to a great degree. I recognise that moving around Australia has some positive benefits, but we have to be very conscious of the problems that that can cause. A lot has been done by the States and the Commonwealth Government to overcome these problems. I call upon them to continue that work and to move towards overcoming the problems even further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Education Council has a working party on the problems of mobility. In 1987, 70,000 students moved interstate. I am not talking about a small or insignificant number. I was told by a senior person within a State education department that it was only about 3 per cent and, therefore, it did not warrant any special programs or any special assistance. However, the bright children within the school system make up about one to 2 per cent of the school population and they do have special programs. I think that that dispels the dismissal by that particular educationalist on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The working party looked at the introduction of a number of things. One that strikes me as very worth while is a student information portfolio. It is a booklet that outlines for parents-there is also one for schools and teachers-the types of material that students should take with them when moving schools so that the teachers at the incoming school will have a very clear understanding of the level of attainment they have reached, the type of subject, and what was being taught. This is very important. The Australian Defence Force initiated a lot of this work to improve and overcome these problems. To the people I had the opportunity of working with last year I say: congratulations on your hard work and the benefit that has come. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that has caused problems for people who move is professional qualifications and registrations. Until now there has not been portability or transferability. Registration is required within each State for each profession. A number of professions do not require registration within all the States, so a person who is moving around has to know which States require registration and which States do not. Some States maintain that their course is the best and, therefore, nobody else comes up to it and only they will recognise their trained people. That is also a problem. I understand from media reports that some of these problems have been overcome in the federalism talks that took place this week. I commend the States and the Prime Minister for that. I will keep watching that matter with a great deal of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> To highlight some of the problems, let me talk about Broken Hill. Broken Hill is a city in New South Wales with a population of 25,000 to 35,000. It is close to the South Australian border. It takes five hours to drive from Broken Hill to Adelaide in South Australia and three or four hours to drive down to Mildura in Victoria. It is about a seven- or eight-hour drive to Dubbo, the nearest major centre in New South Wales, and a nine-, 10- or maybe a 12-hour drive through to Orange. To Sydney it is a day and a bit. The people in Broken Hill naturally relate either to Victoria or South Australia for many of their things. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems were highlighted to me by a group in Broken Hill called MEDSAC. They highlighted the problems they were having getting medical people to come to their community. If they wanted a specialist to come from South Australia, I am advised that that person requires registration in South Australia and New South Wales. If they wanted someone to come from Mildura, he required registration in Mildura. This highlights the problems that the psychiatrically ill face with that particular State border. If someone is psychiatrically ill in Broken Hill, Tibooburra or somewhere such as that and requires a schedule 2, that is covered by State law. As I understand it, that requires a doctor who is registered in New South Wales to fill out the necessary documentation. He is then transported to the nearest psychiatric institution, which in New South Wales happens to be Bloomfield, Orange. That can be a nine- to 10-hour journey. The patient may require restraint or may refuse to take fluids during that trip and the people of Bloomfield end up in the middle of summer with someone who is not only psychiatrically ill, but also physically ill. That is a problem that I will keep bringing to people's attention until we overcome these problems. I am prepared to recognise that people are keen on States rights. I am also prepared to say that we do have to overcome a number of the problems that are thrown up by these barriers. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to say thank you to defence families. The members of the Australian Defence Force fulfil many roles. They fulfil the defence role. Last year in New South Wales they also went out fighting bushfires for us at very short notice. Last year they went out and repaired a bridge that a bulldozer on the back of a low-loader had knocked down. After the fires had been put out, they then went to help the communities that had problems with floods. Some of them must have spent several weeks, and maybe months, working in particular areas. They were given short notice and have been separated from their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The communities have sent their thanks to members of the ADF, who have done their job above and beyond the call of duty, as they always do. We also need to say thanks to the families, because they are the ones who are left to support the children; and the partners are alone on many occasions when their spouses go off to deal with these disasters and emergencies. Our thanks must go out to them. On behalf of honourable senators in the chamber, I thank them for the support they give to their Defence Force spouses. Not all Defence Force spouses are female. A number of women within the Defence Force are married and have spouses who are not members of the Defence Force. To them all, I send a big thank you. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the initiatives of the Labor Government has been to introduce FIND; that is, family information network for defence. That was introduced in March 1989. Some people were sceptical about this. This is a 008 number, which enables defence people and their families to ring up and seek information on policy matters. Since its inception 18 months ago, it has received in excess of 9,000 calls, which works out at 500 calls a month, which is well over 100 calls a week. That indicates to me that it has been fulfilling its aim of being a source of information and improving communications for families. </PARA>
<PARA> One topic that has been very popular for people to ring about is housing. In the last couple of years many improvements have been made in defence housing. Certainly it is not all fixed or finished and there is a lot of work to do, but the Defence Housing Authority has come up with some very good initiatives, housing proposals and plans. It is doing simple things that have not been done before in some areas and, for some time now, has provided security doors and fly screens for houses. When we bear in mind that a number of the defence houses and establishments are in very hot, dry and remote areas, this is most welcome. It has also improved the procedures for the repairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer again to health. This is an area which I have a great deal of concern about and which, because of my nursing background, I will continue to watch and work very closely with. I have visited these rural areas and I know the problems that these rural communities are having in attracting doctors to practise there. I do not have all the answers and perhaps I will have to have a talk with Senator Peter Baume, particularly after he has moved to his new capacity as a professor, to see what we can do to encourage medical practitioners to do some country work. It has been put to me by some doctors that perhaps their training is lacking. They train in the cities, do most of their practical work in teaching hospitals and get a very good understanding of the drug regime that is needed for cardiac and renal transplants and the high-powered technology stuff, but they do not feel confident in the knowledge they have gained about the more simple, generalist areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted. Those are the sorts of moves that we have to encourage. We are also setting up a rural and remote health unit. I note that some of the States are doing the same thing. So this problem is being recognised. We must continue to work on it. I thank Senator Peter Baume for that piece of information. It heartens me greatly. There is someone, going into the practice of teaching, who has the practical experience as well as the theory. This will be very good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are problems in getting locum relief. I have mentioned the training. But there is difficulty in attracting not only doctors to rural areas but also the full range of health professions. It is important that we do not just say, `We can't get doctors to go to country areas'. There are also shortages of nurses. There are certainly gross shortages of occupational therapists, speech therapists and physio- therapists, just to name three other paramedical professionals. We will have to continue to address these problems. Maybe we will have to address them with the professional bodies themselves. I know that the College of Nursing takes postgraduate and post-basic training courses to the rural areas. They do not necessarily go to the remote areas, but I know that the New South Wales college takes out a number of its courses to places such as Tamworth and Dubbo. I think on occasions it has been out to Broken Hill too. This is beneficial to those of us who have practised and worked in those areas because we do not have to travel down to the big city. That is important. It is not that we do not like the big city; it is just that it is much easier for us to move around within the country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to move on to areas specifically related to country people. In this year's Budget there was an allocation of $900,000 over the next two years to expand Countrylink. Many honourable senators may not know what the Countrylink program is. It is a very important source of communication and information to country people on what the Federal Government has available to them. The telephone number is 008 026 222. It is toll free. This service has an annual usage of about 20,000 calls. That indicates that it is a needed service. It is able to provide people with information on the services available and refer people to the appropriate areas. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has increased the usage of 008 numbers within many of the Commonwealth departments. This is only to be lauded and applauded. This service is of great benefit to those people who have high enough telephone bills without the prospect of having any greater burden placed on them when trying to contact government departments. When people ring government departments they often get a response telling them which department it is and asking them to hold the line. The callers can quite literally hear the cents ticking over. The availability of 008 numbers stops this from happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Countrylink also has shopfront displays, community information stands which it takes around to shows in small country centres, a database and the Rural Book. The Rural Book has to be one of the Commonwealth's most popular publications. I am currently sweating on the latest edition coming out. It provides in hard copy lists and phone numbers of Commonwealth departments and services. It has been most beneficial to country people. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in the Budget we saw the announcement of an allocation of $128.3m to the Weather Bureau. Of that, $2.6m will be devoted to aspects of upgrading severe weather and flood warning services. When I first saw this and thought it was very important, everybody asked why. They failed to recognise that, west of the mountains, half of New South Wales has this year been just about under water. We are looking to help those people on the upper reaches of the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers to receive earlier flood warnings with the installation of various equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Meteorology has two types of equipment for collecting the data, one of which is a telephone telemeter. This is a gauge to record rainfall and rises in river levels. It simply involves the Bureau ringing an automatic gauge to collect the data on the telephone. In the old days, a person had to measure these things manually. In areas where there are sudden rises in rivers and streams-sudden floods and gushes-the people who have to go out and physically collect the data are put at some risk. This gives an added element of safety. The telemeters can be so placed that people's lives will not be endangered and they can perhaps even give quicker and more accurate information. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the radio telemeter. This gauge performs the same function, but every time there is any rainfall or the river rises one centimetre this information can be sent to a local point. The gauge itself is primed to ring in to, say, the local town clerk's office, as this may be the centre for the State emergency services and this type of organisation if there is a lot of rain. These local points will receive recordings, information and alarms when there is a certain increase in the rain level and river height. </PARA>
<PARA> These facilities are very beneficial. For instance, in the floods of April, May, June, July and August, in Wellington three rivers rose together. It was known that there would be a big flood but there were difficulties in getting the precise details of how big that flood would be. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted to see in the Budget that the Government is moving to introduce some of these systems. Most of them are more applicable to the coastal rivers because they rise much more quickly. Of course, they abate more speedily as well. They would not be needed in places such as Bourke or Brewarrina because it is often known several months in advance when the flood is coming. As a result of the floods earlier this year, communities on the downstream end of the Lachlan River and the Darling River will be flooded at Christmas time. It is a very strange country, but the flood warnings will help those of us who live closer to the mountain ranges. </PARA>
<PARA> Also on health, I am pleased to note that the Government is making a contribution to the secretariat of Farmsafe. This organisation has been set up in conjunction with WorkSafe as well as in conjunction with the Rural Training Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Rural Development Centre at the University of New England and the Moree Hospital Agricultural Health Unit to look at ways to reduce farm accidents. Farming is a very dangerous occupation. After mining-coal mining in particular-farming is the most dangerous occupation. Farmsafe is setting up small organisations right across the country and it is having a very beneficial effect. It is raising the level of awareness and knowledge of the danger within country communities and is to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that this is a very good Government. It has introduced a number of initiatives to help and to look after people. There have been a number of attacks on the Budget by the Opposition but we have not seen any clear-cut alternatives. We do not need comments about greater restraint; we need to have outlined very carefully how these initiatives will hurt the individual. It is fine to talk about economic modelling situations, but these economic modelling situations have to be reduced to just what the implications are for the individual. When those opposite talk about greater fiscal restraint, just where do they intend it to take place? In pensions? In defence? In Farmsafe? In Countrylink? I pose those questions to the Opposition. I will be interested to hear of any alternatives that those opposite may wish to put up, but I am sure that they cannot do better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those of us who dislike, have concerns about or who see inequity in the present health and welfare provisions have been challenged to come up with alternatives. That is a fair enough challenge-put up or shut up-and this is an appropriate debate in which to put up some alternative policy approaches and say how one would approach either welfare or health. But before doing that it is worth while turning to the Budget which is the basis of the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 which are now before us. Others may care to look at details of that Budget, but it is most useful to look at one of the central propositions in it. That proposition is the announced priority of the Government to deliver personal income tax cuts to all of those people who pay income tax and, at the same time, to make life harder for the poor and the battlers. Just imagine the morality of that, Madam Acting Deputy President-in order that you and I can have cuts in our personal income tax, this Government has announced a number of measures which will impact upon the poorer and needier members of society. There is no morality in that and if that is a central proposition in the Budget, it is one to which we should give some attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will outline some of the ways in which life will be made more difficult for the poor and needy. Those people who agree with that approach or who say that it should have gone further actually become partners to the proposition that we should deliver personal income tax cuts and at the same time pay for some of them by making life harder. How are we going to make life harder? It was announced in the Budget that effect would be given in this Appropriation Bills package and in associated Bills to a number of measures to withdraw some benefits from battlers-for example, the ending of the first home owners grant, which was useful to battlers of a young age, and the announcement by the Government that it would make more demands on the elderly. Witness the new rules with which elderly people will have to comply in relation to the deemed interest on their cash deposits. That is a part of this Budget package which will make life harder for the eld- erly. Witness the new pensioner payments for pharmaceuticals. Whether one takes mark 1, mark 2, mark 3 or mark whatever is finally decided on, it will mean that elderly people will be paying more for their pharmaceuticals and that is in direct repudiation of a specific election promise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Budget that will make life harder by tightening access to income support for the ill and unemployed, and requiring more form filling and more documentation; a Budget which will make life harder by reducing payments for the younger unemployed-all so that Senator Bolkus and I can have cuts in our personal income tax. This is absolutely immoral. If that is the level of government thinking, from whatever side of parliament, it is quite immoral. This is a Budget which reduces government expenditure on certain program components of the campaign against drug abuse, even while the problems continue to increase. It is a government whose Budget program, as announced, withdraws half a million dollars from the previously agreed upon funding for the better health program-so that we can get our income tax cuts. It cuts $140,000 from Commonwealth funding of methadone maintenance programs while the number of people needing those programs continues to increase. It is a program which cuts by up to $3 previously agreed to rates of funding for AIDS even while the number of people suffering from HIV infection continues to increase markedly. All of this hardship is so that we taxpayers can have cuts in our personal income tax delivered to us. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said in his Budget Speech, included in the Commonwealth spending policies are:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the personal tax cuts announced during the election to be paid from January 1 next year costing the Budget $1 1/4 billion,</PARA>
<PARA>I propose that if $1 1/4 billion is to be spent-that is $1,250m to be spent-it could be better spent on the poorer and needier members of society. There is absolutely no morality in delivering to Ministers of State, on salary packages of $122,000, or to senators and members on salary packages of $80,000-and we are among the body of taxpayers-cuts in our personal income tax. That is not where the priority should be. The priority should be with those who are needy and poor. Yet, as I have said, they are bearing the brunt of much of what is going on in this Budget and in the associated Bills. It is immoral. There is no justification for that kind of priority. Whether it comes from a laissez-faire government of one persuasion or whether it is included in the programs of an alternative laissez-faire government, it is still unacceptable. Our priorities should be first to the poor and needy and if there is money to be saved it is to those people to whom the resources should be applied first and it is the taxpayers like us-like you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and like everyone else in this chamber-who should be prepared to stand back and forgo tax cuts if it means that some people in real need might benefit. The proposal to give personal income tax cuts and to put into effect the kinds of Budget cuts I have mentioned is, in fact, a quite regressive proposal. It is a transfer of income from the poorer to the wealthier and I am ashamed, at this stage of my career in this Parliament, that it is a Labor government that has introduced a Budget like that. But enough of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to my views on policies in the social welfare area. The rhetoric which we hear from Senator Richardson is the correct rhetoric. It is the rhetoric which says, `Let us respond first to need. Let's agree that the first thing we have to do is try to identify need, try to measure need in society and try to identify unmet need wherever we can, recognising that that is a value determined matter'. I might think that a certain matter is of high need and you, Madam Acting Deputy President, might think it is of higher or lesser need, but that does not matter. Once we identify need and unmet need, let us respond first to those matters in the welfare area. I suggest to the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, that tax cuts for him and me do not qualify as highest need, and that the delivery of those personal income tax cuts, in light of the kind of rhetoric which Senator Richardson has put forward in this place, is unsupport- able. </PARA>
<PARA> Our welfare programs should respond to that need and to unmet need and they should do it adequately. I am proud to be a philosophical Liberal. I am proud to be from the Liberal tradition. It is communal obligation and action to give effect to communal obligation which have characterised many of the most glorious achievements of Liberal democrats in the last 150 years. The introduction of the age pension has meant that many senior Australians-many Australians over the age of 60 or 65 years-can now enjoy their retirement with some dignity and security. Perhaps those people who are concerned to see cuts delivered in personal income tax would like to do away with the age pension. After all, in one step they could release $8,000m. The zealots seeking smaller government might tell us that the payment of the pension is expensive anyhow and, if they are looking to redistribute income to themselves, that is perhaps one way to do it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was asking rhetorically whether, in the interests of smaller government, we might seek to abolish the age pension. After all, it does require the collection of tax, it does require an administrative structure, it does require a bureaucracy and it does involve disbursements of large amounts of tax revenue taken from the pockets of taxpayers. Perhaps those seeking to introduce minimal government to serve the agenda of the better-off might like to cut back the age pension. After all, there might be savings to be made and perhaps millionaires, senators and Ministers could get greater tax cuts as a consequence. Well, that is not my agenda and I hope it is not the overt or covert agenda of anyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Liberals are proud as well of some of the other programs to help the needy with which we have been associated over a century-programs of sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, the invalid pension, the sole parent benefit, disability allowances and widows' pensions. We are proud of the roles which philosophical liberals have played in the introduction or enhancement of each of those programs. Each of them seeks to respond to some area of deprivation and need, and yet each of them, over recent years, has been subject to erosion or attack, or attempts to remove the legitimacy of the payment, mostly by those who support a philosophy of minimalist government, those who do not feel or display overt sympathy and those who seek to redirect the resources so freed to the non-needy majority, including themselves. I find it disgusting and this Budget seems to be doing the same kind of thing. We seem to be taking from the needy to give more to ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would do first and differently in welfare policy is concentrate on the assessment and measurement of need and then respond to need first and to the better off only later, if at all. There is plenty of need and there is plenty of unmet need. Professor Bettina Cass undertook a needs assessment exercise for the present Government. We could determine to act on more of her recommendations or, if we do not like them, we could set out to do another assessment of need. </PARA>
<PARA> There is plenty of need around. Consider sole parents for one moment. They have been the subject of enormous vilification and abuse-I have to say that too often this has happened at meetings of my own political party. More lies have been told about sole parents and more punitive measures have been proposed than for almost any other benefit. What judgmental, punitive people seem to forget so conveniently is that only 4 per cent of sole parent beneficiaries are teenagers. They seem to forget that less than 20 per cent of the beneficiaries have never been in a marriage or a marriage-like relationship. They seem to forget that most of the beneficiaries are women. They seem to forget that almost half the beneficiaries live below the poverty line or some decent living level. </PARA>
<PARA> What the sole parent benefit responds to is desperate financial need due, in most instances, to the breakdown of a marriage or a marriage-like relationship in which a woman-it is almost always a woman-is left with no money and with dependent children. The support of those mothers and children is within our capacity and if it is within our capacity it is our duty and privilege to be able to respond. That is the point. It is not something we do as charity; it is part of our communal obligation as citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly I support the enforcement of rules associated with the benefit. I support the active search for non-supporting or non-custodial parents to make sure that they contribute towards the support of their children. I support efforts like that which has been made by Senator Durack to have the parents of children contribute financially to their upbringing. But saving money is not of itself-and never has been-a sufficient or justifiable social goal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a judgment upon a society that would make the saving of money the social goal which is being pursued. It is not an adequate social goal. A social goal has to be what one gets by way of outcomes. It is certainly not an admirable social goal if one of the consequences is a tougher life, more misery and more difficulties in responding to significant need. </PARA>
<PARA> I would target my welfare policies to those in need. We can argue about how we define it, but I would extend programs first to those areas of unmet need. I support any government, including this Government, to the extent that it will do that. It follows that I would withdraw the benefits by one mechanism or another from those not in need, as I defined it. The only caveat I offer, and I do commend it to the Government, is that if one decides to withdraw benefits, spare the aged aged-those who are very elderly. They cope very badly with changed conditions. If they are receiving benefits on an understanding, do not change the rules half way as was done with some of the pension rules in the last year. It causes a great misery for the older aged Australians. The changes, if we want to make them, should apply to younger Australians and to new entrants to any benefit or welfare scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one other comment to make on welfare. I would direct my benefits by way of welfare payments; I would not direct them by way of the tax system. I do not approve of welfare being made available through the tax system. Senator McMullan is nodding. Welfare paid via the tax mechanism is regressive; it often does not target those for whom it is intended; it is not a good way to direct benefit to those for whom the benefit is intended. The other thing I would do is work towards direct provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk now about health policy. Such a notion is really quaint in Australia because we do not have a health policy. I do not think we have ever had a health policy in Australia. What we discuss in this country is some financing policy. That may be valid. We spend a lot of time arguing about who pays what by way of which levy. That is merely a taxing measure. I want to say something about health policy. Let us suggest something quite outrageous: we might need to have health goals for a health policy; we might actually have to have some goals which relate to the health of society; we might actually want to have a health policy which has as its program goals the achievement of certain better health outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> In that kind of system, health insurance is a means and not an end in itself. Getting the health insurance arrangements right does not give one a policy. It is a sideshow. At the end of the day it may be important how things are financed but it does not guarantee the delivery of any useful health outcomes at all except one, perhaps, and that is that the promise of the right to access to medical services might be important. This is-and I say this with some diffidence in the presence of a learned surgeon-assuming that the provision of health services has any significant effect on health outcomes. We can argue that at some other time. </PARA>
<PARA> A concentration on health insurance is disastrous when it is joined with an absolutely mindless desire to save money as the primary purpose of the entire policy approach of a party. If someone says, `We don't care what you do, just save $600m out of the health portfolio', that cannot be done without cost, and the cost might be a cost that is borne in terms of the health of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say a little about health insurance. I will not say much because as a member of a Senate select committee which is studying this matter I do not wish to breach privilege. But I can say a little; that is simply that I am not impressed by the acceptance by all major political parties of community rating, as it is understood, as the basis for health insurance. It simply does not make sense. It would make sense if it were concerned with some insurance scheme to which all members of society contributed, but private health insurance at the moment involves only about half the Australian population. The older funds involve particularly those Australians with the worst health experience in terms of usage of services. Community rating is merely a means of taxing the well to pay the insurance costs of the less well. Whatever we do in this country, if we are to get health insurance right-we will just take a look at that for a moment-we will have to fix up the great fallacy of community rating because it does not work. I will not say anything more about health insurance. The Senate Committee will say something about it in due course, and I will be a part of that report. </PARA>
<PARA> If health policy starts with health goals, what kind of health goals do we want? Australia traditionally has not had health goals; we do now have some health goals. This change came about in 1984 with the report of the Health Targets and Implementation (Health for All) Committee, and some health targets have now been accepted and adopted by some Ministers around Australia. For the first time we have some goals in health. I have not heard those goals referred to much in debate in this chamber. If we want a health policy, why not direct it towards the achievement of these goals?</PARA>
<PARA> I will read some of the goals out to see whether honourable senators think they are worth trying to achieve. They have nothing to do with money. They include: reducing significantly the gap in the health and well-being of Australian women; improving the overall health and well-being of Australian women; reducing the prevalence of smokers from 33.5 per cent in 1983 to 28 per cent or less by the year 1990 and to 15 per cent or less by the year 2000; reducing the proportion of adults who persistently have a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 millimetres of mercury to 5 per cent or less by the year 2000; increasing participation in breast cancer screening to 70 per cent or more of eligible women by the year 1995; and increasing triennial participation in pap smear screening to 50 per cent or more of women aged 20-69 years by the year 1990, to 75 per cent or more by the year 1995 and to all but a negligible number by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> Further goals include: ensuring that evidence of a completed immunisation schedule is used as a condition of primary school enrolment, with exemptions being granted for defined medical, personal or religious reasons by the year 1992; eradicating indigenous measles by the year 1991-I might add here that any medical person whose child gets measles ought to be ashamed of himself because it can be prevented by immunisation; ensuring the use of combined measles/mumps/rubella vaccine in all immunisation programs for children by the year 1990; ensuring that hepatitis B immunoglobulin and a complete course of vaccination is given to all newborn infants of women identified as carriers by the year 1992; establishing a national database to record the incidence of diabetes and its complications by the year 1990; and increasing participation in sufficient activity to achieve and maintain physical fitness and health to 40 per cent or more of adults by the year 1990 and to 60 per cent or more by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> Those goals may not be accepted by everyone, but they were presented to the health Ministers of this country and as far as I know they were generally supported by all Australian Ministers for health. I certainly support them. They are goals with which I hope the Liberal Party would have no difficulty agreeing. They do not say a thing about money; they are actually about the health of people and the health of communities. They will actually provide a better basis for a health policy than much of what has gone before. Of course what flows from that is that our policies would then be directed towards saying how we would give effect to achieving those goals by the dates and in the outcome figures which are provided. The question then ceases to be one of funding and becomes one actually of trying to achieve health for Australia. I see very little in this Budget and very little in the activity around this country being dir- ected towards goals such as the ones to which I have referred. That is what is so disappointing. </PARA>

He said, `Speak for England'. The outcome of that debate is now history. Amery was asking that someone speak for the many English people who felt unrepresented, forgotten or ignored by what the nation's political leaders at the time were saying, thinking and doing. Today in the Senate I feel the same about the direction of economic policy, budgeting and appropriations as they are presented to us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate today we have the opportunity and the duty to speak for many otherwise unrepresented people, the people who are suffering at the sharp end of these Appropriation Bills and the associated Bills which will come through as part of the Budget package. We are required to do so in the name of fairness and compassion. We must speak for the old and the weak; we must speak for the battlers and the needy; we must speak for the young hoping to own their own homes; we must speak for the bewildered unemployed who do not know what this Budget has done to them; we must speak for pensioners who have been hit several ways; and we must speak for the ill.

In addressing myself to the goals which I believe this country should pursue, but woefully I feel is not, I very much regret that in the not too distant future we will not have Senator Baume in our midst. I think it will be a great loss to the Senate when that day occurs. The goals I want to talk about are somewhat different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me begin by saying that I believe this Government is attempting to build an economy, to change Australian society and to embark upon a number of projects without-and here I reflect the general theme of Senator Baume's remarks-clearly identifying the social and environmental imperatives which must guide our approach to the future. The facile and uncritical acceptance that economies must continue to grow and that environmental considerations must be made to conform with economic runs rather than the other way around and the contention that that is both desirable and inevitable so that we in the rest of the industrial world must become more competitive-these are the issues that I want to address. </PARA>
<PARA> It is into this deregulated free market economy that this Government seems to believe it can throw some high technology and that then Australia will once again become the lotus land-the lucky country, as it was described in the 1960s and 1970s. The social and economic models of this Government and its models of the future are remarkably similar to the models of those years of the 1960s and 1970s: the future will be like the past but only more so; where it will differ will be in the application of so-called high technology. It is a mechanical and a deterministic view of the future which this Government seems to see lying before all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak this evening about an alternative view which I find exciting and creative and which will be satisfying to all Australians, both now and in the future. It is one which will include both some high technology and some low technology, but it is one in which all the technology will be selected because it is appropriate to a happy society in balance with the ability of the Australian environment to sustain it indefinitely into the future; a society which will lead the world towards sustainability; and a world sustainable both socially and environmentally. This is the vision that I have for our future and this is the great destiny that I would have this country fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who would frustrate this sustainable future led by an enlightened Australia concerned above all with the protection of life on this mere speck of rock in the universe-the only speck of rock in our corner of the universe that we believe is able to support life. These selfish vandals-and they are all around us-would sell us short with the sci-fi mirage view of the future, with multifunction polises, with very fast trains, with spaceports and, above all, with greed-led cargo cultism of foreign investment and endless consumerism. </PARA>
<PARA> We are the inheritors of the plans and aspirations of yesterday. The plans that we make today shall be the inheritance of our children and of our descendants. It is certainly not putting it too strongly to say that in practically every aspect of social and national life we are not coping very well; nor are we addressing satisfactorily or comprehensively the many very pressing problems which beset us. It should be plain to all, other than the wilfully blind, that our approach to the future must then be very different from the way our forebears planned for us. </PARA>
<PARA> Rapid technological change throughout most of the years of this century, together with the adherence to an economic model predicated on growth, on competition and on exploitation of the natural world, has produced a society in which the worship of and submission to technological change have become the religion and purpose of society. Technological innovation is now acting as the principal agent of profound social and environmental change. Technological change is no longer serving human needs determined by an open democratic process informed by an understanding of human and environmental needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed multifunction polis (MFP) is but one example of this phenomenon. The multifunction polis much beloved by Senator Button, should it be built, will be the most expensive-and this is where I link back to the Appropriation Bills-and the most disastrous development ever undertaken in this country. The multifunction polis is based on this now outdated and inappropriate utopian vision of technology drawn from science fiction imagery. Honourable senators will remember the term `post-industrial age' used in the late 1960s. The vision then was of a future served by robots in the workplace, in transport, and in the home; videophones; three-dimensional television; information retrieval at the touch of a wristwatch computer, et cetera. This sci-fi view of the world was once thought to be a sufficient description of the future. Environment and human or social factors were never considered to impose pre-conditions; nor were human and environmental factors conceived as the end to which technology should be directed. </PARA>
<PARA> The MFP and the other proposed developments I have mentioned are the playgrounds of those who have not grown up. It is a Disneyland of gee whiz gadgetry. I would remind the Senate that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry in 1987, in its basic MFP concept document, included a proposal to build a mountain 2.1 kilometres high with a runway to launch linear rocket vehicles into orbit. This proposal was withdrawn from the English language translation. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the planning of these projects has always been from the top down, and it remains from the top down. It has certainly not been democratic. From 1987 to the present, the project has been promoted through high level think-tanks comprising the top people in Government and the industry sector, and this remains true today. I would remind the Senate of the Sydney conference which was held on Monday and Tuesday last week, addressed by Senator Button and Premier Bannon and attended by the well-heeled and the wealthy and by business and government leaders. It cost $995 for the two days. Even now, while this period of public consultation over the MFP is in progress in South Australia, the Bannon Government has retained a public relations firm, at a cost of $150,000, to convince the public that the MFP is good for it. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach to our future really does not even fulfil the immediate and most obvious needs. A number of proposals for the MFP were evaluated by consultants McKinsey and Co. Ten of these were reduced to a short list of three which the consultants thought were commercially viable. These were: `Hollywood of the South Pacific'; `Home Betting'; and `Home Shopping for SE Asians'. Of these, Ken Davidson, the economics writer of the Age, perceptively asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Why would the Hong Kong Government allow its TAB business to be leached away by the MFP? The Japanese are the world's most sophisticated consumers who demand personal service. Why would they buy superseded goods from a TV presenter from Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, the Bureau of Industry Economics' study of the economic viability of the MFP found that on the most optimistic assumptions-and that needs to be stressed-the project would yield a trade deficit of $800m for each of the first 13 years. Infrastructure alone is expected to cost taxpayers some $2.6 billion at a time when Government seems unable or unwilling to find the money for essential infrastructure elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, there is a great irony in the call for corporations to invest in a world university in the MFP in the same year that an independent study finds that Adelaide University is both overcrowded and run down with a shortage of funds to maintain its present facilities. The plight of the University of Adelaide is no different from that of universities elsewhere, or indeed from Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) divisions around Australia. Nor does the MFP proposal meet the perceived longer term objectives and needs of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A huge blind spot in the MFP vision is the failure to recognise environmental and resource constraints except in so far as they give rise to market opportunities-for example, in waste management. The emphasis again is on profit maximisation, which underlies one think-tank's promotion of nuclear power as the preferred solution to the problem of global warming. One must ask rhetorically: why opt for solar power and energy efficiency when the fuel cannot be sold and the need for waste disposal technology is reduced?</PARA>
<PARA> Last week in Geneva scientists from around the world met to discuss solutions to the quickening problem of global warming. They have already identified that the world must cut its emissions of greenhouse gases by 60 to 80 per cent as rapidly as possible just to stabilise the rapidly increasing levels of these gases in the global atmosphere. I stress that that is not to return the levels to their pre-industrial level. For instance, with respect to carbon dioxide, where the pre-industrial level was 270 parts per million, the expected levelling, even with the most stringent restrictions imposed as rapidly as possible, would occur at some 400 parts per million. Without doubt, this is the most serious environmental problem humankind has ever faced. It is global. Its solution will require unprecedented leadership and cooperation and will impact on the basis upon which hitherto we have built our industrial growth oriented civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has paid lip service to the seriousness of greenhouse and has issued a discussion paper on ecologically sustainable development. While it has done that, the actions of the Hawke and Bannon governments belie their words. In today's Australian Financial Review Dr Maurice la Riviere, a professor of environmental biology and the head of the International Council of Scientific Unions, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>We are at an interesting edge between science and policy now. </PARA>
<PARA>We hope governments and policymakers will understand what scientists mean. </PARA>
<PARA>Where we go from here is up to them but given what we know, there is absolutely no excuse for governments not to save on energy. </PARA>
<PARA>Harmuth Grassl, a German professor of meteorology, is reported as saying at the same conference:</PARA>
<PARA>Change on Earth is now so fast there is no analogy during the last 10,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA>While the submission on the multifunction polis in Adelaide gives greater weight to environmental management industries than previous MFP studies, it neither attempts to design its proposals or the project as a whole in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable developments nor even outlines what those principles might be. This is simply a symptom of the way in which this Government and State governments around Australia are and have been behaving. Instead, it is based on an outdated economic model aimed at indefinite growth in gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that I have asked Senator Button a long series of questions in recent weeks about the importance the Government places on greenhouse and how the MFP and its other high-tech developments are to mesh with an attack on this problem. The questions, without exception, have been dealt with with derision by Senator Button and, I am disappointed to have to say, most of the Labor and coalition senators present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has set a heavily qualified target of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emission by 2005. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that CO2 emissions will have to fall from the present global average of 1.45 tonnes per person to 0.35 tonnes, a drop of 76 per cent, in order simply to stabilise-and I stress that word-atmospheric concentrations. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation for Australia is indeed much more precarious than that. Australian emissions amount to approximately 4.5 tonnes per person. Thus, we would have to reduce our emissions to less than 8 per cent of current levels to meet the IPCC global average. Anything less than that drastic reduction of 92 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions implies an indefinite continuation of the existing global inequity in access to energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that sort of reduction, let us consider what has been happening during the term of this Government. A recent report found that Federal Government funding for renewable energy resources has fallen 88 per cent in real terms since 1978. In December 1987, in response to Democrat pressure, the Government undertook to spend $5m over five years through a renewable energy research trust account. That was to be funded out of oil tax revenues. That commitment has been broken in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> One eminent solar energy researcher has told me that he could get funding for only 30 per cent of his applications and that lack of funds had caused a real drop in development work in his area. Another leading researcher of world class has obtained funding from the United States Department of Energy yet has not obtained funding for projects from the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. We adopted a report from that organisation this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA> Another world class researcher in this very city, Professor Stephen Kaneff of the Australian National University, has developed an advanced solar collector but has had to use money left over from other grants to carry on that development work. Research on the hydrogen or gas-fuelled zirconia fuel cell which was being carried out in the CSIRO Division of Materials Science and Technology in Melbourne has had to be suspended because that development could not be made to yield immediate economic returns. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country we have world leaders in the very technologies which specifically attack the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and which provide useable energy in non-polluting ways, yet this Government is withdrawing funds from these researchers and these developments and alternatively is pinning our future to the importation of outdated technologies which are part of the problem but not part of the solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Martin Green's work is outstanding. He is working at the University of New South Wales. He has produced the most efficient photovoltaic cells in the world and has built the facilities to produce these in commercial quantities. While detractors point to the per watt cost of these cells and compare them unfavourably with coal fired electricity, the comparison takes no account of the cost of greenhouse damage resulting from coal burning or of the very large reductions in energy use which could be achieved through efficiency improvements now attainable with existing technology and which would reduce the per unit costs of end services. </PARA>
<PARA> The solar thermal technology of Dr David Mills, who works at the University of Sydney, which has already been sold to India for solar cooking and is used by one hospital in New South Wales for its sterile and hot water supply, is another technology which would allow very large and economic reductions in CO2 emitting fossil fuel use. Yet his work has essentially been on hold for the past 10 years through lack of government support. </PARA>
<PARA> On Wednesday last I travelled to the New South Wales Parliament House from North Sydney in an electric car-the townobile, manufactured in Sydney by an engineer, Mr Roy Leembruggen. He is an internationally respected authority on transport engineering. If we take that technology together with the research into more efficient control on motor technology progressing at Sydney University, we could have a total solar transport driven system in this country. But Australian governments have ignored Mr Leembruggen's work. Unless the Government rapidly changes its approach to this area of research and development and its belief in Australia's scientific inferiority, we shall be importing similar technology from other countries in the years to come. I draw the Senate's attention to considerable work which is now going on in other countries on electric vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats suggest that in this country we have the talent and, moreover, a better sense of direction amongst some of our scientists, conservation groups and within the Australian Democrats than is found expressing itself in the official policies of most other countries. So we do not need to become a clever country; we need to become a wise country with wiser leadership in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the appropriations, it is very appropriate to ask where the money for alternative energy research and development comes from. We would argue strongly that the money is already here but is being misspent. Indeed, Senator Button has identified one:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . fundamental element of policy environment conducive to the development of a robust . . . manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to ensure that the maximum benefits are obtained from the Government's considerable purchasing power. He instanced the development and building of frigates in Australia, the submarines and the partnerships for development program. For example, the $4.6 billion submarine contract and the $4 billion frigate program are just part of military equipment programs and, of those amounts, $3.5 billion will be spent in 1990-91. As a result of this spending by government, shipbuilding has been revived and a large military electronics industry has sprung up based very substantially in South Australia where some 25 per cent of companies at Technology Park are involved in military electronics technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Paul Dibb, amongst others who wrote the report on Australia's defence needs several years ago, has identified Australia as one of the most secure countries on earth. Moreover, the low level attacks which we may suffer are not to be countered by the possession of submarines; they are part of a global, predominantly United States based, defence strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with the vague and unlikely threat of military invasion, the threat of global warming and the urgent need to address it are serious, massive and immediate. We urge the Government to use the same strategy of government-led purchases to stimulate the development of the alternative, but nascent, energy efficient and renewable energy technologies now languishing for want of research and development funds. We urge the Government to look to spending some $500m a year in this area through directed government purchasing. This would make us, we believe, once again the lucky country but, just as importantly, a wise country and one that could then help lead other countries down the road to their own pattern of sustainability. In that way, we would suggest, we will become a world leader-not a leader in the role of competitive economic exploiter, but rather a leader in the role of cooperative guide to survival. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991 and related Bills. Together these Bills, which are being debated jointly, constitute the Government's Budget for the 1990-91 financial year. As a member of the Government I support this legislation and the broad thrust of the Government's Budget. It is the eighth Budget we have brought down since we gained the Treasury benches. This one continues the focus on restructuring the economy and making the Australian industrial structure more competitive internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget, which is basically the centrepiece of the Government's fiscal policy, is working with incomes policy and monetary policy through interest rates to synchronise total levels of spending in the community with total levels of production. That has been the biggest problem facing Australia in the last couple of years. That is, spending and aggregate demand, in the jargon of the economists, have far outstripped total productive capacity in Australia. As a result, there has been an enormous spill over to imported products. The aim of policy has been to synchronise those levels of spending and levels of production. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget, on my analysis, is a very tight one. Fiscal policy, as exercised by this instrument, is extremely tight. One of the objectives is to help relax monetary policy-broadly speaking, the use of interest rates to regulate spending on assets in the community. I am pleased to note that since the Budget was brought down some two months ago there has already been one major reduction in interest rates. So part of the objective of the tight fiscal policy being exercised through the Budget has been to already reduce interest rates as part of another round of reductions. That brings in the calendar year 1990 the total number of reductions in interest rates to five. For example, official cash rates have now come down 5 percentage points during 1990. There is a long way to go yet, but certainly the trend of interest is down. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government there has been a shift from Budget deficits. We had many decades of Budget deficits, that is, government spending far outstripping revenue collections. Under the Hawke Labor Government we have moved from Budget deficits to Budget surpluses. Last financial year the surplus was $8,000m. If we could add to the surplus within the Australian community the deficit in government spending overseas, where we spent more than we raised, the actual domestic surplus would be far in excess of the $8 billion; it would be $10.9 billion or, roughly speaking, about 3 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That is a very large proportion indeed for the outcome of one particular Budget and confirms how tight fiscal policy has been in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of key policy decisions were made by the Government before the Budget was brought down. For example, through the instrument of incomes policy, better known as the accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), there was an agreement before the Budget that there would be a tax and wage trade off package for employees. Part of that package is to provide for personal income tax reductions from 1 January. Of course that is less than two months from now. So in some eight weeks time Australian employees will be getting substantial personal income tax reductions as part of policy decisions made this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the Government's policy in the incomes policy area is to boost the disposable income of Australian workers-the take home pay, if you like-by focusing on reductions in income tax rather than have employees demanding higher wage and salary increases in the economy. In the final event it is the employers who have to pay those high wage and salary increases. We take the view that it is better, in terms of helping Australia's international competitiveness, to focus on the bottom line-the take home pay or the personal disposal income-by providing personal income tax reductions. They will be coming into effect on 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA> Another part of the Government's income policy is for controlled money wage rises. For example, the agreement with the ACTU is to maintain the real incomes of workers in the September quarter-that is in the months July, August and September this year-by providing for an indexation of wages, I would imagine, probably within the next few weeks following the release of the consumer price index for the September quarter which is due to be published tomorrow. So we will have our first reversion to wage indexation in Australia for some four and a quarter years. The last time wages and salaries were adjusted for inflation was in July 1986, so we will have a wage indexation rise based on the consumer price index when it is published, which I believe will be tomorrow. For example, most of the estimates appear to be that the consumer price index will rise by between 1.5 and 2 percentage points for the September quarter. Whatever the figure is, that will be the amount of the wage rise paid to Australian wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that percentage increase-we all know that percentage increases reward those on very high salaries more than those on lower salaries and wages; High Court judges receive much more from a 1.5 per cent wage rise than does the average worker-and to compensate partly for that effect, we shall be providing for a flat $12 a week wage rise early in the new year, probably around March or April. That sum of $12 will go to all wage and salary earners across the board. Those two measures-the indexation wage rise and the flat wage rise-are designed, through the incomes policy, to help family living standards. The Government is very well aware that family budgets have been constrained and confined in recent times. These measures are designed to take the pressure off family budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Budget was being formulated, the economy was showing some slowing. It had been growing at an annual rate of about 6 per cent; it had been cut back to a 3 per cent growth rate. That, of course, was a deliberate result of government policy. We have not taken the decision lightly to slow down economic growth. In fact, the measure was designed to slow down the spillover, the excess demand, into imported products. As a result, growth had slowed from 6 per cent to 3 per cent up to June on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Budget was brought down there was still significant growth in the jobs markets. The number of people in jobs compared with the same time last year had grown by 2 per cent-quite a respectable figure. There had been some rise in unemployment with a 6.9 per cent unemployment rate recorded for June this year. At the same time that those things were happening in the labour market, there had been a trend down in the monetary variables. I have mentioned the reductions in interest rates. Prices had been trending down; the consumer price index in the 12 months to June had risen by 7.5 per cent. That was still far too high but it was a refreshing reduction from the levels of earlier years. Certainly it was nowhere near the double digit levels of inflation that were recorded under the Liberal Government earlier in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> If the consumer price index that will be published tomorrow is less than 2.3 percentage points, we shall see a reduction in the annual rate of inflation in Australia from the figure of 7.5 per cent up to June. If the consumer price index is below 2.3 per cent, that will mean that the annual rate of inflation and of price rises will decline below the 7.5 per cent figure. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Budget was brought down we continued to have a significant deficit on the current account element of the Budget. There had been that very large deficit but there were some signs of improvement-with imports, for example, falling by 8 per cent in the period to June this year. That was certainly a very welcome reduction, partly reflecting the slowdown in economic growth in the Australian economy. Also at the time of the Budget we saw a trend downwards in fixed business investment. But despite all the doom and gloom about investment, that decline was from an extraordinarily high base. The share of business fixed investment in Australia's gross domestic product had been very high before it started to decline. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the broad outline of this year's Budget. We are certainly anticipating that total government spending in the Budget will be growing faster than it did last year. We are anticipating that spending in real terms ahead of price rises will grow by 0.6 per cent. Last year there was not spending growth of a positive nature; there were in fact real spending cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the features of this Budget is the analysis which relates total government spending to the size of Australia's gross domestic product. We estimate that in this financial year that ratio will fall to 23.5 per cent. So, in total terms government spending will be less than a quarter of our gross domestic product. That is part of a continuing downward trend-a trend which has been evident under the administration of the Hawke Government. It compares very well with the figure in the 1982-83 financial year when government spending constituted 28.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Comparing the figure of 23.5 per cent-a reduction of over five percentage points-in a share of gross domestic product accounted for by government spending, we can clearly see that the Hawke Labor Government is not a high spending government. Despite all the rhetoric from some sections of the community about government spending, the record is very clear. Under this administration the share of government spending in gross domestic product has shown a very steady and substantial decline. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the revenue side of the Budget. We anticipate somewhat slower growth in revenue collections this year than in the last financial year. We estimate that we will get growth of about 6.5 per cent in revenue this year compared with almost 8 per cent in the last financial year. The reason for that is very obvious. I have already pointed out that the Government has had a deliberate policy of slowing down the total demand in the economy, slowing down the level of activity in Australia. As that happens, so do revenue collections decline, as revenue is based substantially on income flows in the Australian community, whether they be of a personal or company nature. Last year there was real growth in government revenues-that is, revenues outstripped inflationary figures. This year there is hardly any real revenue growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very illuminating and instructive to look at the ratio of tax to gross domestic product. I looked at the other side of the ledger a moment ago-the ratio of government spending to gross domestic product. In regard to tax, the ratio will be of the order of 24.3 per cent this year-a figure which is very close to the figures obtained in the early 1980s. It is certainly not a figure that gives any support to the argument in some quarters that this is a high taxing administration. When it can be seen that tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product is of the order of 24.3 per cent, it is very hard to sustain the argument that Labor is a high-tax party. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result of the activity on the spending and the revenue side of the Budget is that there will be a surplus this year of $8.1 billion, which is a substantial sum. It is only the fourth Budget surplus at Commonwealth level in 40 years. It is the fourth surplus in a row. In that period of 40 years there were many years of conservative administration in Canberra and in none of the years of the previous Liberal administration was a Budget surplus recorded. </PARA>
<PARA> That surplus has been put to very good use. Specifically it is being used to help to pay off government debt. That provides ongoing benefits which do not relate just to this financial year but to future financial years. We estimate that there will be a saving of the order of $3,000m in interest payments annually simply because debt has been paid off over the last three financial years, and more will be paid off in the current financial year. In fact, in the three years before this year the Commonwealth paid off $18,000m in total in domestic and overseas public debt. The estimate for this financial year is that it will pay off another $7,000m. They are substantial amounts of money. Cumulatively over four financial years $25,000m in debt is being paid off. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that within that total we have already paid off $4,000m of overseas debt. When we hear all the hype and hysteria about Australia's overseas debt, it is very important to remember that the Commonwealth Government alone has already paid off $4,000m of debt in recent times. It is very instructive to note that the Commonwealth Government is now a net creditor overseas; it is not a debtor. The Commonwealth Government has more in overseas deposits, overseas bank accounts and overseas reserves than it owes overseas. Therefore, it is a net lender overseas; it is not a net borrower as some sections of the electorate believe. This year the Budget is very contractionary and puts in place a tight fiscal policy, and that is partly reflected by the big domestic surplus. The Budget is probably taking 3 per cent or more from the economy in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the specifics, on the spending side of the Budget it is useful to look at some of the major spending areas to try to gauge where the Government's priorities are in reality. In money terms, total Government outlays are up 6.9 per cent. It is very interesting to note that in the science and research area that figure of 6.9 per cent is far exceeded. The total allocations for science and research in this Budget are to grow by 19 per cent. So 2 1/2 times the average growth in total outlays will be the rate of growth in outlays in the science and research area. In Question Time today a question was asked about the status of the cooperative research centres program which the Government is operating. Part of the funding for that will of course be within that 19 per cent growth for science and research. </PARA>
<PARA> Education outlays are up 14 per cent. A significant part of that is to focus on the need to restructure Australia's economy, to make it more competitive, to make Australia the clever country, to upgrade our work skills and to retrain our people. Within that allocation, for example, there is a 25 per cent increase in outlays-a massive increase in spending; equivalent to over $200m-to improve training and opportunities for disadvantaged job seekers in the Australian labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the outlays that reflects levels of activity in Government policy is funding for unemployment benefit. Certainly there will be forecasts of an increase because we are slowing down the economy as a deliberate policy to reduce imports. We estimate that while on average 385,000 people received unemployment benefit last financial year, this year the average monthly figure will be 475,000. So there will be an increase there. Unfortunately, that is a direct result of having to slow down the economy to stop the level of imports being sustained as it has been. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on the other side of the ledger there will be substantial increases in family payments. The family allowance, which goes to most Australian mothers, and the family allowance supplement, which is focused on low income working families whose head is in the work force, will see their payments increased in line with the cost of living from January next. It has taken the Hawke Government to be the first government in Australia to index family payments in order to protect purchasing power, to protect those payments against price rises. In January next there will be a further increase in both the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, taxation cuts come into effect on 1 January. Only two months from now there will be substantial personal income tax reductions. These will be given effect to by both changes in income tax rates and an increase in the amount of tax exempt income. The tax threshold will be increased from the present level of $5,100 to $5,400-a significant rise in the amount of tax exempt income. But over and above that the individual tax bracket rates will be reduced. For example, the present 29c in the dollar tax rate will go down to 21c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I am pleased to say that early in the new year there will be adjustment of the various tax rebates for cost of living rises. For example, the dependent spouse rebate and other rebates will be increased by 8 per cent in line with inflationary trends. Where there are dependent children, the dependent spouse rebate at the moment is $1,200. In the new year that will be increased by 8 per cent to $1,296. I know, from talking to people in my State, that that will be of significant benefit to single income families in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Hawke Government's performance is summed up in one particular area, one highlight has to be its record in extending superannuation through the Australian work force. Ten years ago only very privileged people, usually those in white collar jobs and usually male, had access to superannuation. When we came to power in 1983 the estimate is that only 44 per cent of Australian employees had some form of superannuation cover, some form of cover for their retirement when they ceased working. The figure now is not 44 per cent, 55 per cent or 66 per cent; it is 77 per cent. Seventy-seven per cent of Australian employees now have some sort of superannuation cover, some protection against costs in their retirement, a guaranteed income stream for their retirement years. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the aspects of this Budget which will stimulate superannuation contributions more is the fact that we are restoring tax deductions for many workers. This year, for low paid employees whose employers' contributions to superannuation are relatively small, below the equivalent of 4 per cent of wages and salaries, we are going to provide full personal income tax deductions for superannuation contributions made by those employees, the workers themselves. Those first $3,000 of contributions will be fully deductable against personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of retired members of the community are single pensioners. This Budget relaxes the taxation treatment of single pensioners by allowing them to have $40 a week over and above the basic pension before they are liable for income tax. That standardises the tax treatment of all pensioners with the income tests of the Department of Social Security for pensioners and it is a long overdue move. It is high time that both the taxation system and the social security system worked together and had consistent thresholds and income tests. This will finally apply in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 January we begin the brave new world of the so-called gold tax. It is not really a gold tax. In fact, it puts the goldmining industry on the same footing as every other industry in Australia. One of the biggest rorts that ever existed in this country started in the 1930s when the goldmining industry was given privileged status. No company tax was levied on the goldmining industry. Perhaps it received investment it should not have received because of that tax distortion. From 1 January the goldmining industry will pay company tax on the same basis as income producing industries in the rest of the economy. </PARA>

<PARA> With those few remarks, I would like to turn very briefly to the impact of the Budget on my State of South Australia. I am pleased to note that $4m has been allocated in the Budget for feasibility studies for the multifunction polis site in the Gillman area in the Port Adelaide district. Those studies are very important and will help us look at the site in some detail for the multifunction polis to be built eventually in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget allocates some $529m this financial year for the Collins-class submarine project to replace Australia's Oberon submarines. My estimate is that, of that $529m spent nationally, possibly over $200m will be spent in South Australia. That certainly will be an important boost to the local economy and will also help smooth out the business cycle as it operates in South Australia. In these trendy times of privatisation and deregulation it is important to have significant public projects with ongoing work because they can stabilise local economies as the income stream from those projects goes out into the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined a number of items in the Budget, I have focused on the broad outlines, and I have looked at some of the expenditure detail in the Budget. I think that overall this Budget shifts the Australian economy in the correct direction, continuing our process of economic restructuring and reform. It certainly slows growth. That was an unfortunate event that had to occur. It is due entirely to the fact that Australians were spending too much on imported products. We had to slow growth in demand for products produced overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget continues on the path of getting the economic fundamentals right in Australia. However, it is tempered, very importantly, with a strong dose of social justice through the indexation of family payments; through the adjustment for inflation of the various tax rebates; through personal income tax reductions which begin on 1 January next; and through wage rises, through the accord with the Australian trade union movement, which the community can afford. Despite the difficult economic times, I am sure that all those measures in this Budget will help take pressure off family budgets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening the Senate is debating the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91 and related Bills. In speaking to these Bills, I would say that Australians today should be questioning how much longer they are prepared to live with a Federal government that is increasingly putting Australia deeper into debt. We have just listened to Senator Maguire trying to justify some of the actions of the present Government and not doing very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policies of this Government are putting Australia deeper and deeper into debt, something which affects every man, woman and child in the country. Since this Government was elected in 1983 there has been a dramatic change in Australia's fortunes-not that it was not coming; it is just that many commentators Australia-wide failed to note what the average Australian could have told them, namely, that it is getting increasingly harder out there in middle Australia to make ends meet. And unfortunately there is no let up in sight. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has deserted middle Australia. It has deserted the men and women it relies on to produce the goods, to buy the goods and to keep on paying the taxes so that this Government can continue its high-spending policies. Millions of average Australians have known for the last three or four years that this Government has been a failure as an economic manager of this country. When is this Government going to say that we have to make some policy changes and that we would like the cooperation of the Australian nation to bring those policy changes about?</PARA>
<PARA> I will tell honourable senators this evening that millions of Australian families know more about the reality of economic life in Australia than do members of the Government and the Government's advisers. They have living proof of it. They know about this Government's housing policies-policies this Government so loves that the Australian dream of home ownership has been put beyond the reach of ordinary Australians. Home ownership is now getting steadily beyond the reach of all but the relatively affluent people who are entering the home market for the first time. That fact is not only an economic disgrace; it is a social and family disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> Just two years ago the Treasurer (Mr Keating) promised a Budget to bring home the bacon. Today there is not a housewife in Australia who could not put the Treasurer out of a job and budget better. Today the bacon he has brought home is reflected in crippling high interest rates, a crisis in the rural sector-the likes of which cannot be recalled for many years-declining living standards, increasing unemployment, higher inflation, higher foreign debt and a business sector under considerable pressure. We are much closer to that banana republic which Mr Keating warned us we were heading towards a number of years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget brought down by the Treasurer showed just how out of touch the Hawke-Keating Government has become. It clearly has no idea of the extent of the recession in the private sector in Australia, nor of the hardship being experienced by the great bulk of Australians. The hardship is felt by some of the thousands of people who have lost their jobs even in the last year or the thousands more who are about to lose them- regrettably, I must say; by the record number of small business people who have gone broke as a result of high interest rates, people whose life savings have been lost and who will take years to repay their debts; by those who are struggling to buy a home with a 16 per cent mortgage interest rate, or those who are forced to sell their house in a falling market; by spouses who have been forced to go to work just to pay the mortgage and supermarket bills; by the workers who had thought that a Labor government would look after their interests, only to find their wages squeezed and more than clawed back by higher inflation, interest rates and the Treasurer's bracket creep-a famous phrase that former Senator John Stone always used to talk about; and, finally, by a particular section of the Australian community which is bearing an undue amount of that hardship, that is, our great and previously profitable rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The headlines say it all. Senator Panizza will be interested in this: `$1.80 will buy one beer-or 18 sheep'. That is a figure that the headlines tell us about. Perhaps honourable senators prefer this headline: `A pair of Reeboks costs as much as 36 bags of wheat'. That is a very sad state of affairs for rural Australia as far as I am concerned. In simple terms, this means that the heartland of Australia is being devastated by high costs, inflation and general taxes. Small rural businesses and farming families in many cases can no longer keep up with the imposts of bureaucracy and big business. </PARA>
<PARA> An estimated 30,000 farmers are suffering a cost-price squeeze which will force many from the industry in the 1990s, to join the 30,000 who have left in the past 30 years, ironically when, for all its shortcomings, agriculture will earn a near record $15.5 billion in export income in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> Country businesses are also in rapid decline. The Australian Small Business Association estimates that 15,000 businesses closed last financial year. The flow-on effect means that towns are dying. Communities with populations of fewer than 2,000 people are likely to lose schools, hospitals, police stations, post offices and banks in the next decade. Good houses lie vacant. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of the rural crisis is shown by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, which estimates that the real net value of farm production will fall 51 per cent in 1990-91 to $1.6 billion. There is no doubt about it: the expenses incurred by the farmers are having a devastating effect. According to the June issue of the Bureau's quarterly, farm production will be only 29 per cent of the level in 1980, down from $4 billion in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural Australia's agony is all too evident. Witness the need to shoot millions of aged sheep and the state of the wool market. One farmer in Queensland got in touch with the St Vincent de Paul Society. He suggested that something be done about the fact that he had to shoot many of his sheep. One of the Catholic hierarchy got in touch with various people. Instead of the sheep being shot, destroyed and buried by the farmer, people cooperated to have them collected, killed and cut up. I believe that even Woolworths Ltd got into the act. The sheep were then delivered to people in very poor circumstances who were able to enjoy the mutton. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the farmer who had that idea in the first place, the priest who organised it and all the people who cooperated with the transport, the killing and the cutting up of the sheep. Many people in Queensland would be very pleased indeed with the farmer who had the bright idea. It is a very sad state of affairs when these farmers have to shoot these sheep. It certainly does not help their income. </PARA>
<PARA> We then have the state of the wool market, the falling beef and wheat prices, the floods that occurred in Western Queensland and New South Wales earlier in the year and the plight of the farmers in the navy bean, pig meat, peanut, sugar, pineapple, canned fruits and dried vines industries. Booms and busts have been the nature of primary production for the past 202 years, but even after a good run agriculture has become less viable for a large number of farmers. Various forecasters see their ranks diminishing further from 175,000 to 100,000 in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that Australia has 130,000 primary producers who grow more than $20,000 worth of commodities a year and 45,000 who produce between $5,000 and $20,000 worth. Despite our rich natural resources, we spend more than $7 billion a year on importing food, beverages, tobacco, wood and paper products and textiles. While this is a relatively minor component of the current account problem, the sheer value and volume point to structural problems in the economy. The situation is particularly worrying in the citrus, dairy, pork, dried fruit and oilseed industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a golden opportunity to become the world's greatest agricultural exporter with its pollution-free food. Indeed, we are on the doorstep of rapidly emerging Asian markets, the demand from which is expected to lift commodity prices in real terms for the first time this century. Yet, because vital industries are not being nurtured and preserved, the nation stands in grave danger of failing a rich and proud rural heritage. The nation should be concentrating on primary production because a 100 per cent increase in income from a manufacturing industry will be minor compared with any increase in the much larger rural industry. We need to put the financial incentives there to encourage people to produce more so that we will eventually claw our way out of the current economic mess. </PARA>
<PARA> The severe financial crunch the industry is facing is illustrated by the interest component of farm costs, rising from 9 per cent in 1985 to 13 per cent this year. That is an increase of 50 per cent in five years. Rick Farley of the National Farmers Federation suggests that Australia is neglecting agriculture to the nation's cost, partly because too few people understand the industry. This is caused by our being one of the most urbanised countries in the world and by the Great Dividing Range. These barriers are the reason why 12 million of 17 million people live in the largest 14 cities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Farley says that the most serious dilemma is the cost-price squeeze, in which farmers have to take world prices for their goods but are saddled with domestic costs that are not exposed to world forces. He sites government monetary policy as the second reason for falling farm returns. High interest rates are no solution to the current account deficit. The exchange rate is of tremendous consequence to us. Every move upwards of one cent costs the rural sector $150m. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all that rural producers are indeed suffering. They are hit by fuel pricing policies which might make a great deal of sense in bureaucratic-compact Canberra but which add intolerably to the cost of living in remote parts of the country. These fuel pricing policies mean that the Federal Government Treasury coffers and the exchequers of States which impose fuel taxes are garnering rich profits from the crisis in the global oil market. </PARA>
<PARA> Today farmers are also being made to face financial risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. The farm is failing in Australia because as a nation we have ignored our greatest resource, yet it offers solutions to our economic problems. We cannot afford simply to sit back and wait for the farm sector to be virtually depopulated. It is in everyone's interest to control the process, to ameliorate its worst effects and to approach the whole issue with a balance of sympathy and energy. South Australian farmer John Ayliffe recently told the Bulletin magazine:</PARA>
<PARA>When you buy a property, you make allowance for floods, droughts and bushfires but no-one can allow for the level of financial stupidity that has gone on in Australia. If we hadn't been hit by this monetary policy, we would probably have been paying tax at a higher rate now and employing one or two people. You know, we could live a lot more comfortably by selling the farm, investing the money and retiring. </PARA>
<PARA>I have said that at our home on quite a number of occasions. But it is not the nature of man to be a quitter. Another farmer from Victoria said:</PARA>
<PARA>Farming has a bright future because it is one of the few things Australia is good at. All we need is for the Government to change its interest rate structure which is carrying the can for mismanagement by State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Wherever one goes in Australia the message is the same. My home district of Kingaroy and the Burnett is no exception. The south Burnett region in which I live normally produces 90 per cent of Australia's navy beans and it also produces 70 per cent of Australia's peanuts. Crops are down to 25 per cent of normal levels this year owing to either drought or wet harvests. It is very difficult to realise that in a short space of time there can be a change from everything being very dry and the farmers wondering whether they will get a crop because of drought to there being so much rain when the poor farmers are in the middle of harvesting their peanut or navy bean crops that they cannot get them in. The run of bad seasons has sapped farmers' confidence in what was regarded as one of the nation's safest climatic regions. What was among the most expensive farming country in the State in 1982 at $2,640 per hectare is now valued at $1,350 per hectare. </PARA>
<PARA> The equity crunch is expected to drive at least 200 of the region's 1,000 peanut and navy bean farmers out of business this year, according to the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. The slow reduction in peanut and navy bean crops has also turned the nation away from being an exporter of these commodities, thus adding to trade deficit problems. This situation has been compounded by growers in developing countries exporting to Australia at rock bottom prices because of preferential tariff treatment for the Third World. A farmer from the area, Ian MacFarlane, told the Bulletin:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a common comment up here that people could have handled bad seasons, low prices or high interest rates but to get them all at once is too much. It is devastating to see the erosion of farmers' financial positions. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr MacFarlane continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The problem we are facing is that the costs of growing these crops have quadrupled since 1983 while the price received hasn't altered. Combine that with high interest rates and the high value of the Australian dollar and it is a serious situation . . . The same applies to the wheat industry. A number of farmers around the Millmerran area have said to me that this will be their last year unless they get a good crop. </PARA>
<PARA>Urban Australians-the great majority of this country's people-have very little grasp of the realities of making a living in the bush. To them, the country is a place to drive through on the way to a holiday. Where it has not already fallen prey to agribusiness, the farm sector is a family affair. Yet such farms rarely make enough profit to pay each productive family member a living wage. I speak from experience when I say this. To that extent, farms are small businesses and should be seen as such by the tax man and the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> They are given that recognition in Japan-a country so often held up by this Government as one which we should try to emulate. In Japan the Government recognises the need to maintain its rural sector and, as such, 72 per cent of a farmer's income is provided by the Japanese Government. Goodness me, if our farmers could get 72 per cent in that way to help them along they would be in clover instead of my telling this sad and sorry story here this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. But I certainly suggest that a little recognition and help would relieve the high burdens farming families and communities are now carrying. It is small wonder that in these circumstances farmers are getting restive. This Government and many of its members representing rural areas in my State of Queensland have not even recognised that there is a crisis in rural Australia. Indeed, only a few weeks ago the Chairman of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Caucus primary industries committee, the honourable member for Hinkler, Mr Brian Courtice, told the Australian Rural Times:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I certainly do not believe or agree rural Australia is in crisis or about to collapse, but there is no doubt wool and wheat have difficulties to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rob Hulls, the honourable member for Kennedy and a man who should know better than most ALP members about the plight of those in rural Australia as his electorate covers most of north-west Queensland, rejected suggestions that rural Australia was at crisis point. Instead he maintained that present economic policies were working. Goodness gracious me; he is very much out of touch. Only last Friday I heard him on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio once again denying that a crisis existed in the bush. Mr Lavarch, the honourable member for Fisher-our next door neighbour, federally speaking, as his electorate is near the south Burnett-said the suggestion that the rural economy was going to collapse as a result of high interest rates was `an over-simplification'. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond doubt, the farm sector must live with the strictures that apply to all components of Australian society. However, we must recognise the need to regulate the effects of fast moving change on sectors of the economy which impinge most heavily on individual lives. There is not much point in producing something if it cannot be sold profitably. I am sure that any industry would feel exactly that way. So it is not much use rationalising our rural sector if we eventually see the demise of the family farmer-the person who spends unrecognised hours and effort producing that end product. This Government has often made much of the fact that its major endeavours were to encourage the growth of an adaptable and efficient primary industries and energy sector. It is often when assessing the rural industries that we talk only in terms of how much they have contributed to Australia's growth and not the effort made to achieve those exports. It is here that I would like to point out that in striving to achieve the goal of low cost, internationally competitive industries, the Government has to be aware that it could be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. If in the process of achieving cost efficient industries we push the small family farm off the land, in the long run we are serving no really good purpose for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently we have started to see the tragic nature of this crisis. Although suicides and mass family murders are the extreme end of the spectrum they do illustrate the utter hopelessness felt by many in the country. But there has also been an increase in the need for more emotional counselling, increased reliance on anti-depressant drugs, increased illness as a result of higher stress and increased family breakdowns. There are many rural women who will wake up tomorrow to face such crises once again. They are the women who spend many hours of loneliness and are required to do back-breaking work; the women who have stood side by side with their husbands clearing the land, tending the animals, fighting the elements and then returning to their homes to make them a nurturing hearth for their families. </PARA>
<PARA> They and their families are being penalised today. They are suffering because governments fail to recognise the contribution given to society by those in the outback. They should not be penalised by what is sometimes called the tyranny of distance. I want, once again, to ask this Government to reconsider the position of rural Australia. These people do not have the opportunity to send their children to conveniently located neighbourhood schools, to enjoy good roads and to have access to modern conveniences that are not provided to isolated families. </PARA>
<PARA> When will this Government recognise that by the very nature of farming, liquidity is a major problem and that many farmers do not have the means to afford the cost of schooling? They have been given no help and, regrettably, no hope. The Government has failed to recognise when it asset tests the family farm that capital invested in farming earns a very low return. Discrimination now exists for the geographically isolated. We should be ever vigilant that we do not allow ideology on economic issues and crass politics to displace the needs of people. This is what is happening in many industries today and it is at the expense of one of the most important sections of our community-the economic survival of the small family farmer. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to read from a letter written recently to the Courier-Mail in Brisbane. It contains the comments of an ordinary Australian fed up with what is happening to his country and a plea to the Government to finally recognise the mess we are in. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>I have had enough of watching the Australian Treasurer Paul Keating telling us his economic policies are working. </PARA>
<PARA>We have:</PARA>
<PARA>Record current account deficits. </PARA>
<PARA>The highest continuous interest rates historically, which are doing irreparable damage not only to small business, but to grazing and farming industries as well as the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>The greatest number of small business collapses in our history outside the great depression. </PARA>
<PARA>An Australian dollar so high it has priced the export industries off world markets and dramatically reduced our opportunities to trade. </PARA>
<PARA>A national debt which has, in only a few years, escalated out of all proportion to $140 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>The nation's greatest single export earner-the wool industry-with it confidence shattered . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A wheat industry about to receive the lowest first payment for many years. </PARA>

<PARA>A desperate sell-off of the Commonwealth Bank to prop up the incompetent financial performance of the Victorian Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA> We are debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 and other allied complementary monetary Bills. I will briefly address the problems that I perceive in the changes to Austudy, as it pertains to remote and rural areas, and to the aerodrome local ownership plan (ALOP). Also I will give a brief resume of how the Budget has treated primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> One could probably say that this is the non-Budget of all the Budgets that have been brought down by this Government. It is probably the biggest non-Budget brought down by any government in our time. In this 1990-91 Budget the Government has discriminated against rural families and their student children-more so against student children than families. This is happening at a time when rural families are facing a very difficult time, not necessarily of their own making. </PARA>
<PARA> I will let the Government off to some extent at this stage because I do not think it fully realised when it framed the Budget some time before August what the position was going to be by the end of this fiscal year. Not only have the Government's monetary policies made it difficult for business people and farmers and their families in rural areas but also the Government has struck another blow which has put the boot into the same families. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular decision is the change in the asset test used for assessing eligibility for Austudy allowances. The Government has decided to reduce the asset level from about $320,000 to $200,000. This is a severe reduction. Then, of course, there is an allowance of 50 per cent when it comes to rural holdings. So we are looking at a case where the asset test on rural properties cuts in at $400,000. Where assets, whether business or farm, are used to generate income, 50 per cent, as I have already said, is taken into consideration. For people outside of rural areas we have virtually cut the asset test basis from about $750,000 to $400,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say at this stage that I support the asset test. I do not believe in subsidising people who have assets. But in certain cases, in certain regions and in certain industries at certain times it is not possible to stay with that idea all the time. Student children from rural areas are now excluded from any Austudy and family allowance if their families have assets over a certain figure. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in the Australian on 22 August 1990 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to boost schools funding and expand the higher education system mainly at the expense of student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>The same article quotes Mr Dawkins as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The better targeting of student assistance under Austudy would save $23.4 million in 1990/91. The differences, effective from January 1 next year, include changes to the parental assets tests. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not decry Mr Dawkins's effort to improve the education system. I totally agree with it and I will applaud him if he eventually carries this out. But the problem is that in this case the Government is, or seems to be, improving the education system at the expense of some rural based children. As I have said already, asset testing of rural people in times of downturn can severely affect their children's education. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Government suggesting that rural families take up the Senator Walsh option? We have heard Senator Walsh say many times in this place that if one is not producing income from assets one should sell them. One could probably say that that would be a fair enough assumption in normal times. But when there is a general downturn in agriculture all over Australia, it is very hard to accept his idea. Furthermore, if someone wants to sell those assets at this stage of the game, who is going to buy them?</PARA>
<PARA> Taking the $400,000 that the Government has now set, in these times I do not know what sort of figure the Government deems those assets should produce. However, if one takes the average return from rural investments at between 5 per cent and 6 per cent over the normal run in reasonable times, $400,000 worth of assets should produce between $20,000 and $25,000, or something like that. That is far less than the figure above which a wage earner is eliminated from getting Austudy or the family allowance for his children. On that basis alone I believe this system is unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course one might ask why 1991 was picked as the year in which these measures would be brought into action. Mr Dawkins's statement about better targeting students to boost funding for schools and expand the higher education system certainly has a hollow ring. But once again I will give Mr Dawkins the benefit of the doubt. When he drew up this part of the education budget, he may not have known the extent to which this crisis was going to develop but, knowing the state of the economy, as it was in July 1990 I think he must have had a fair idea. I know he probably could not have forecast the real decline in wheat and wool but he should have been able to forecast the big rise in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is meeting its basic commitment to expand student numbers in both secondary and tertiary sectors at the expense, at least in part, of those Australian families who in the past were eligible for, and able to depend on, Austudy to help meet the cost of placing their children in hostels, boarding schools or tertiary colleges. The ability to depend on such an allowance is even more critical with the rural downturn I have been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, from what I have been told very little information has gone out to schools to date. I suppose one could quite justifiably argue that there is a good while to go until the next school year, but nonetheless, along with the other problems I have dealt with, schools, parents and students themselves are asking questions and are becoming very worried. Of course, there is evidence-and I know the Government's claims and its figures-that more children are staying at school than when this Government came to office, but I suggest that a lot of that has come about because of the evolution of this country. Countries should improve their educational systems and a lot of other things, and by natural uprise this should be occurring in Australia. However, to give credit to the Government, it has done something towards increasing the retention rate in schools, although I think there could be a turnaround. When parents learn about the changes to the assets test, I expect that downward pressures on children remaining at school will be greater. </PARA>
<PARA> I also know that some hostels for students in country areas in Western Australia are under threat of closure for existing financial reasons of their own. These are deficit funded hostels in the government system. My guess is that there are at least five such hostels around Western Australia. Prior to the threat to cut out Austudy as well as other threats, the State Government was under pressure to keep a couple of them going. The staff at the Merredin hostel, for example, volunteered to work for a week without pay pending finance coming through. That finance should have come through much more quickly from the State Government; fortunately, as a result of pressure from around the area it came through and they were able to keep the hostel going. Parents had already been put on notice that they might have to find alternative accommodation for their children. These children came from areas upwards of 150 kilometres from Merredin. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, you were in Merredin on another inquiry last year so you know of the remoteness of that town. Parents were told they probably would have to look for alternative accommodation for their children. That was back in August. The Government was then able to come forward with enough money to keep the hostel going but it took it out of the maintenance and repair fund for the school. The school buildings themselves have nothing to do with the hostel. By this means, however, the hostel was able to keep going. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind the monetary problems of Western Australia, one must realise that other State governments will be under similar pressures. Even more pressure will be placed on some country hostels and I think a few of them will collapse. Of course, more pressure will then be put on boarding positions, probably in private schools in the city. It will also place more pressure on some parents to remove their children from school altogether. Of course, everyone knows what happens when a child misses out on going to school. In respect of university students who take a year off, the wastage rate is around 80 per cent; they never go back again. For high school students the figure is probably near 100 per cent, unless the children pick it up through adult education. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are some of the fears I have about cutting out Austudy for a lot of people. I have contacted some boarding schools in Perth, not the big private schools but the schools at the lower end of the scale, that is, the lower end of the church boarding schools. I have been advised that for a boarding school to remain viable, it needs roughly 100 boarders. A number of years ago I was on the board of a girls' boarding school in Perth. During the year this school decided to close its boarding facilities. Pressure from parents meant that the school board was able to keep the school going by looking for overseas students. The pressure will be on these places even more if they start losing more students. Hopefully one day-and not in the too distant future-the economy will turn around. That would be best for all sides of politics. But if boarding schools or hostels are closed down, it will be hard to get them going again. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Western Australian Government is also implementing a rationalisation of schools, not only country schools but also city schools. In that case children will have to travel further where they can travel, but many of them will have to look for boarding facilities. The Government, having decided to coincide its harder assets test with the measures I have already discussed, has certainly been a drag on the education system. As I said, the Government may not have known at the time what was going to happen, but the problem is here now and it must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have gone some three or four months down the track from the Budget. We know what the problem is out there and it is not too late for the Government to do something about it. I will just give the Senate a few more figures on Austudy for 16- and 17-year-olds, which, as I understand it, is not subject to the means test. The Government in this Budget has increased the allowance on Austudy for 16- and 17-year-olds from $900 to about $1,300 per annum, and this is not means tested. </PARA>
<PARA> At the lower end of the boarding school system it costs $5,300 a year for the boarding fee and in the deficit funded country hostels the cost is $4,800. So for people who are struggling to make ends meet and for rural producers who are not going to make any profit whatsoever in the next 12 months, finding the $3,300 in between is going to be very difficult, especially if they have two or three children in the education system. I have already said that those children from those remote areas must board away. It is not a question of sending them to a snobby private school; they must board to have an education.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare the city and the country asset testing now. Everyone has a limited asset testing of $400,000. This still discriminates against the rural areas, because in the rural areas it is the producing assets that are taken into consideration-whether one makes a profit or not. But in the city one can have $2m worth of assets and still qualify for Austudy. Before the Minister has a heart attack, I will tell the Senate why. The Minister obviously knows himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the case of a family in the city living within walking distance of a school or a university. Anyone in this place with children will know that it is much cheaper and easier to maintain them in a home than at a distance. Someone could be living in a house worth $1m and within walking distance of a school and if his income is below that threshold then he still qualifies for Austudy. What I am calling on the Government at this stage to do is to look at some suspension of the assets test in the crisis areas of our remote and pastoral areas. I might just quickly mention that even a member of the Government in the other House, Mr O'Neil, took up that very point in his speech to the House of Representatives on 12 September 1990, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>After many years of working to assist average families to obtain the best future for their children, my personal opinion is that the away rate Austudy allowance does not adequately cover the basic needs of the student. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on to mention a bit more:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the decisions handed down in the August Budget that I believe will put unnecessary strain on rural families is the assets test placed on family allowance payments. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to mention Austudy as well. Obviously, there is someone in the Government with much the same ideas who can see what the problem is. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to briefly mention a couple of other items in the Budget. The first is the ALOP-the aerodrome local ownership plan-which is being phased out. This was a measure that was well hidden away in the Budget. I certainly did not find it for quite a while and I found it only when the Airport Owners Association rang me. The plan was formed quite a number of years ago to enable local governments to share in their airports and maintain them on a fifty-fifty basis with the Federal Government. About 270 local governments around Australia took up the offer on this fifty-fifty basis. There was no consultation whatsoever between local governments and the Government, to my knowledge, about the fact that this was going to be eliminated. The arrangements are mostly under contract, although there are some word of mouth arrangements that have been going for quite a time. But the Government has still decided, even with the written contracts, to phase them out. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the contracts seem to me to be the same, judging from what the local governments I spoke to have said. I was involved with my local government at the time when we took over our airport. Some of the contracts are very loose and one can drive a bus between the conditions. The Government can get out of them very easily. I questioned the Minister concerned, Senator Collins, during the Estimates committee hearings, and he said that he would deal with each local government on a one to one basis, depending on how they stood. I urged all the local governments in Western Australia that may have had airports under this scheme to contact the Minister. I do not mind admitting, and he obviously knows, that no-one seems to have got a very satisfactory answer. They have got answers but they are not satisfactory to the local governments that want to know whether they are going to keep their airports. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there will be three categories of assistance: 25 per cent, 50 per cent and 100 per cent-I hope I am not wrong with these figures-all depending on the needs of the community. No-one really understands how the criteria work and how a local government is eligible on a social need basis. One of the conditions to qualify is that the airport must be over 100 kilometres by sealed road from a major town. But then there is the case of Mullewa in Western Australia, which lies about 100 kilometres east of Geraldton on a sealed road. That town is on the system but is not going to qualify. What is forgotten is that, going in an easterly direction from Geraldton, the next major set of hospitals is probably in Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> If patients were taken to somewhere near the State borders or to a point from where they could be taken to Kalgoorlie, there are another 300 or 400 kilometres in which vehicles may come in or light aircraft may land to take them to the small hospital or to transfer them to another airplane. I cannot see that that is a very good way to go about it. There are other airports that may be able to be closed or phased out, but those strategic ones in those outer rim areas have got to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that there are some viable airports around and, of course, there will be. Probably Perth will always remain viable, as will Karratha and Port Hedland. But there are no others in Western Australia that can remain viable, except maybe Kalgoorlie and Geraldton, but I doubt it. I believe this is something that the Government has to look at again-especially where there are contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to speak briefly on rural marketing matters. I see that inspection fees have been raised from 60 per cent to 100 per cent. Our side of politics believes that the inspection charges at fifty-fifty was a good way to go because the rural producer certainly had an interest on inspection to make sure that the best produce left Australia and that we would not have a pesticide in beef fiasco or a kangaroo meat scandal again. We believe that rural production benefits not only rural producers and that the other half should be picked up by the rest of Australia because of the export income we earn. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take the Budget at face value, spending on primary industries has increased, but that comes mostly from the increased wool tax, which goes into a revolving fund of money taken from farmers and used as a back-up when wool does not reach the reserve price. I could speak for another half an hour on the rural industry but my time is drawing to an end. I would like to put on the record-if Senator Bjelke-Petersen has not already done so-the position in the bush concerning wheat and wool. We will have much more debate concerning wool before this session is over. </PARA>
<PARA> As all honourable senators know, the wheat industry is experiencing a great downturn. I believe that the Government should be doing more than it is, by talking to the United States Government and to the European Community in the hope that they will bring sense into their export enhancement programs, by which they are subsidising their export sales by up to $A70 a tonne. The Government could also do much more to hold down the price of fuel, not by pegging the price of oil but by passing back a certain amount of the windfall gains it is making as a result of the Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I can tell the Senate that the country is hurting. Having attended four rural crisis meetings, I can tell honourable senators that our concern is with the way in which small businesses are hurting. Rural producers probably have another three or four months before they really hurt. There is the genuine complaint that the banks are not passing on the total interest rates cuts. Finally, the biggest concern amongst the women and children relates to higher education and the cut-off point for eligibility for Austudy, with which they badly need help. We will talk more about these issues when the crisis hits the rural sector, probably in March. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91, the Appropriation Bill ( No. 1) 1990-91 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1990-91, I wish to pursue a matter that I have been pursuing for about two years in this place through Estimates committees and the Appropriation debates. I refer to our presence in Antarctica and what I see as some of the inadequacies that have been experienced over the past couple of years. While some people see this as a criticism of the Director and senior members of the staff of the Antarctic Division, that is not the case. The pressures that have been placed upon them by the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and senior bureaucrats in Canberra have made their position quite untenable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first became interested in this matter during the construction of the Aurora Australis. On many occasions I raised the problems that I saw with the construction of that ship. I asked questions about the costings but the then Minister and the departmental officers consistently declined to provide an answer concerning the extent of the Commonwealth's financial liability for Aurora Australis immediately prior to the signing of the charter contract. When the contract was signed in October 1988, the ship had already been under construction for 10 months and it was launched only 11 months later. This happened because the then Minister, in his exuberance to promote what he thought was a re-election of the Labor Government in New South Wales, put out press releases and instructed a letter of intent to be signed. In the end, there was no choice for the Commonwealth but to sign whatever contract the tenderers, P and O, wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> The contract that was entered into was certainly not weighted in favour of the Australian Government. Let me list some of the concerns that I had at the time and still have. The accepted bid was $10.1m for the first season, or $124m at present value for 10 seasons. After the tenders were let, the Commonwealth entered into a contract with P and O to pay the company $12m for the first full season and more than $150m for 10 seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned about the requirements that were necessary for the safety of the crew as well as their experience level. In fact, this is my major concern about the Antarctic Division and the way in which it is going. In the contract that was signed, for the first time ever the Commonwealth agreed to meet all non-Antarctic season lay-ups, which amounted to $0.5m per year. The lay-up port was not specified. That meant that P and O could decide to lay the ship up in any port without regard to the extent of costs which the Commonwealth was to bear. The ship was taken on charter at Newcastle, not Hobart, which incurred significant additional cost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth paid an additional $460,000 for the provision of scientific equipment by P and O. Crew numbers and pay conditions that were negotiated by P and O with the unions were simply passed on to the Commonwealth. There was no reduction in the charter rate given for extended besetment in ice during the Antarctic season, which was a standard condition in previous contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> If an ice pilot was needed to meet the requirements of the Antarctic experience for this particular vessel, the Commonwealth paid for the pilot. That was the first time that had been included in a contract. The list goes on and on. The Commonwealth credited the owner with one full day's charter, more than $50,000 per Antarctic season, which had not happened before. </PARA>
<PARA> During the construction of the ship no proper monitoring by technically qualified people was carried out on behalf of the Commonwealth. In the finish, not only was P and O unable to deliver the ship in October 1989 for the start of the 1989-90 season but the ship was unable to be delivered until 15 February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also raised matters of concern about the operation in the Antarctic. There was a large leakage of 90,000 litres of oil at Casey. On 27 June I called for an independent inquiry into this incident but that did not happen. Antarctic officials claimed that 50,000 to 55,000 litres of fuel had been recovered, but I noticed in the Adelaide Advertiser that the Station Leader, Joan Russell, stated that 32,000 litres were recovered. This still leaves unaccounted for, debatably anyway, 58,000 litres, 290 drums or 58 tonnes-whichever measure one wants to use. This oil is possibly under the winter snow. The expeditions at Casey did a marvellous job in trying to clean up the mess, but the environment there is of concern to me and I do not believe that we were given the answers we should have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern I had about safety related to the ice runway. Were Senator Richardson here tonight he would probably remember the number of questions I asked him about this project. Unfortunately, this has been somewhat of a fiasco. Over 15 years the Antarctic Division has spent millions of dollars on air transport studies for an experimental airstrip at Casey. No doubt, were it feasible, acceptable and possible, it would be something that everybody would welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in 1985, the then director of the Antarctic Division, Mr Bleasel, was concerned by the apparent waste, so he commissioned a review into the air transport options. That review concluded that Casey was not operationally feasible and he cancelled the project. However, just this year we have seen the present director, immediately on taking over the job, reopening the whole project. So far the failed efforts to try to establish a runway there have cost this Commonwealth Government another $1.1m. By the way, they did not even carry out an environmental impact study for that airstrip. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the question of the ice pilot was raised by my colleague Senator Archer during Estimates. I was not present. In previous questions that I had asked during Estimates I was told that there were no problems with--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was with the senator's colleague, Duncan Kerr, in the Soviet Union. I will get around to that later. I was led to believe that there were no problems with the qualifications of the crew members. It was set down in the charter contract that the experienced captain of the Aurora Australis would be four years in Antarctica in a vessel the size of the Aurora Australis or any others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We find now that in the original contract the ice captain had to satisfy four years Antarctic ice strategy experience and also that the first officer and two deck officers had to comply with similar experiences. We find out in answers to questions given in Estimates this year, and I have to read my notes, that the director said:</PARA>
<PARA> My view is that he has the equivalent with the training program he did in the north of three. </PARA>
<PARA>The upshot of it is that in the first year we have to employ an ice pilot, which will cost the Commonwealth Government another $28,000. I have raised the question before about this problem. I was told that everything was okay and that the experienced crew and captains were no problems. These were promised when the charter was filled, but now we find that it is all starting to fall apart again. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier to Senator Tate across the chamber, I have been recently on part of a parliamentary delegation to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mongolia and Japan. Whilst I was in the Soviet Union I took the opportunity to discuss with our Russian counterparts Australia's possible use of an Antarctic vessel for our own purposes in the sub-continent. I pursued this matter on previous occasions. Most recently, my colleagues Senator Archer and Senator Baume also mentioned this matter during Estimates. The reason I bring this forward at this stage is that the Antarctic Division is currently considering arrangements which will set in place the chartering of a vessel for the next three Antarctic seasons. It is my belief that perhaps not sufficient consideration is being given to the use of a Russian vessel. I would therefore like to relay some of my concerns and also some of the details of my discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of background, Anderson Hughes, who is the current chartering contractor for the Antarctic Division, arranged for the charter of the Icebird for the 1991 season. That is a back-up to the Aurora Australis, the second ship, the Aurora Australis already being in Antarctica and having one or two problems. This decision was made by a selection committee made up of Anderson Hughes, the Antarctic Division and the Department of Administrative Services with the Department of Transport and Communications acting as a technical adviser. </PARA>
<PARA> The final choice of a vessel was narrowed down to the Icebird and an offer by the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute which was for the vessel Akademik Federov. Indeed, the offer by the Russians was prompted by encouragement from the Australian Government during a visit to the Soviet Union by Senator Richardson and Mr Blunn from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It also should be pointed out that the Akademik Federov is a state of the art research ice breaker and, as such, the use of the Akademik Federov would have provided our own scientists with a unique opportunity to work with the Russians. I might add that that vessel was only built in 1987. It is my understanding that the price of the Akademik Federov, which included bunker fuel, helicopter and crew overtime, was $2.9m whilst the Icebird's price is estimated to have been around $3.6m including bunkers and overtime. It is easy to see from the comparison that the difference between the Akademik Federov and the Icebird was somewhere around $0.8m and $1.1m. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the obvious financial advantages the Akademik Federov offered a number of other features which should have made it attractive. The fuel tanks are inside a double skin hull, a similar design future to that of the Aurora Australis. This provides much greater protection for the Antarctic environment from oil spills should the vessel ever become involved in an accident. The Antarctic Division's strategic transport plan makes reference to possible problems with the Icebird by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The potential exists for environmental problems as fuel is carried in tanks again its outer hull. </PARA>
<PARA>The Akademik Federov also has on board long range, heavy lift helicopters which would have enabled access to the stations earlier in the season and, therefore, an opportunity has been lost for Australia to trial larger ship based helicopters at no cost. This is very puzzling, particularly when the Antarctic Division had previously wished to try larger helicopters in the 1989-90 season, but they proved too expensive to charter for such a short time. It is easy to consider the value of such helicopters because the Aurora Australis has already been fitted at considerable expense with a special hangar and helideck to cater for such large helicopters, at the recommendation of the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the benefits which would have flowed from our scientists working with the Russians in the spirit of the Antarctic treaty. I know from my personal experience that there is a ready willingness by the Russians to become involved in assisting Australia's Antarctic efforts. When the Russian Premier, Mr Ryzhkov, visited our country recently there was a joint announcement with Mr Hawke of a special series of stamps to depict Australian-Soviet cooperation in Antarctic marine research. The Russians must certainly be questioning how serious to that commitment are our intentions in light of some previous decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, as a representative of Tasmania, like my colleagues Senator Tate and Mr Duncan Kerr, who accompanied me on this trip I had discussions with representatives of Russian fishing fleets in Vladivostok and Nakhodka. We spoke with many of the Russian politicians in the Soviet far east. I do not know about Mr Kerr, but I am concerned because the chartering of the Akademik Federov would have provided Hobart with an ideal opportunity to demonstrate its willingness and capacity to service Soviet Antarctic and southern ocean ships. There is no doubt that this would have provided a considerable financial boost for local businesses and could have served as an important preliminary to the use by the Russians of the port of Hobart for their fishing fleet. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also remember that this will be the first season in which the Aurora Australis with its relatively new crew will be working in the Antarctic and that the Akademik Federov would have provided valuable icebreaker back-up for our own vessel. When these and other issues were raised by me on previous occasions, the Antarctic Division has responded that the Akademik Federov was far too large to enter Mawson Harbour. However, I believe that the Russians were prepared to offer the Division every assurance that the Akademik Federov was quite capable of entering Mawson Harbour, and even if conditions prevented entry, cargo could easily be transferred by the large helicopters from outside the harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also concerns raised regarding the possible logistics in a voyage charter. However, I believe that these should be weighed against, firstly, the financial advantages, and, secondly, the willingness of the Russians to amend their own plans to suit our needs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the decision which was made to charter the Icebird over the Akademik Federov for the 1990-91 season cannot be changed regardless of the circumstances. However, there have been more developments in relation to further chartering requirements and I believe it is imperative that the Antarctic Division and those responsible for decision making should be prepared to give much more detailed consideration to the use of a Russian vessel. On 14 August 1990 Anderson Hughes invited expressions of interest in and firm proposals for providing a ship to the Antarctic Division for three seasons from 1991 to 1992. </PARA>

Before speaking further on this matter, I seek leave to table the following documents: a meeting format sheet; a copy of resolutions tabled at the meeting; and a press release that was issued by the Millmerran Shire Council following the rural crisis rally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A quick perusal of the documents I have tabled shows that there was a great deal of concern in Pittsworth that day. The press release issued after the meeting suggests that some 2,000 people were in attendance at the meeting. While it was difficult to estimate the number of people actually present from the speaking position because they extended on one side way beyond my field of vision, I would point out that the organisers of the rural crisis meeting had at the meeting attendance registers, and I can only assume that the figure of 2,000 people is roughly correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the population of Pittsworth and Millmerran Shires is not substantially large, a turnout of 2,000 people is quite remarkable. I believe that it shows the depth of the rural crisis that is being experienced all across Queensland as it is being experienced in other areas of Australia. The people who were there were not hotheads or rednecks-or whatever phrase some people like to apply to them. They were fairly conservative, quiet people from provincial Queensland. They were people who would not even dream of having a protest rally, let alone saying some of the things that were said. There was justifiable anger at the Federal Government's inaction and at what they considered to be a neglect by the Federal Government of their particular plight. </PARA>
<PARA> A perusal of the resolutions that were carried is very interesting. Although we had what some people may consider to be, shall we say, more inflammatory resolutions-I am not particularly in favour of one resolution which recommends a blockading of food to Canberra as it would not be survival of the fittest but survival of the fattest, and I fear that I may be one of the first to go-I believe that the resolutions show the depth of feeling. A lot of other resolutions were passed-ones that we would all consider much more reasonable and ones that I would hope the Government would be willing to take on board. In particular, there was grave concern over the imposition of assets tests and the reduced values of assets tests for such things as family allowance, family allowance supplement and Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also concern about the quarantine standards that are currently being imposed by the Federal Government on agricultural produce imported from overseas. There was a concern in these areas-and areas that are not particularly threatened-that if we impose very lax quarantine standards we run a very grave risk of losing the natural protections that we enjoy as an island. Certainly the people of Pittsworth and Millmerran have an interest in intensive production of pork and, therefore, are concerned about the importation of Canadian pork. But they are also concerned about issues that do not touch their area. I refer, for example, to the potential importation of bananas from Ecuador with the diseases of black sigatoka and moko. </PARA>
<PARA> The people at this meeting were not thinking just of themselves. They were also thinking of people throughout provincial Queensland, as indeed they were thinking of people throughout provincial Australia. One of the things that I found personally disturbing was that at the end of the meeting the people who were assembled there produced effigies of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Those effigies were strung up on a pole and roasted on a bonfire. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sherry might find this amusing, although I caution him that if he wishes to make it to the front bench he should not laugh at such matters. Although some people may find these matters amusing, I think the meeting showed that there are people throughout provincial Australia who are suffering very greatly from this Government's policy. There are people who are at their wit's end. The message is very clear that this country cannot afford to lose further farmers from the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Suggestions that all we have to do is to improve farm efficiency are way off the mark. This underlines the fact that if we continue to neglect our agricultural sector, any hope of improvement in agricultural efficiency is absolutely ridiculous. It is not the bad farmers that we are losing at the moment but the good farmers. We are losing people who may have been on the land for 20 or 30 years. If we lose those farmers, we lose the very core of our agricultural efficiency. We lose what drives our rural economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to look at the figures that were produced by various speakers at the meeting. It was suggested that up to $16m or $17m of agricultural income alone may be lost from the Pittsworth and Millmerran Shires during this financial year-$16m to $17m of agricultural earnings. When one applies the multiplier effect, the actual loss of earnings, the loss of product in those two shires in southeast Queensland alone, is frightening. That shows the truth of the fact that we desperately need a drop in interest rates to return income to the agricultural sector, not just in Queensland but throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an oft-touted figure and a figure that I believe is correct that for every 1c drop in the Australian dollar we will give to our agricultural sector earnings in excess of $150m during the course of the next year. In Queensland alone a 1c drop in the dollar will add another $18m to the cattle industry-and $40m to the cattle industry across Australia. We must start to recognise that the pain that currently exists in rural Australia cannot go on indefinitely. One cannot keep starving the body, otherwise the patient will die. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we face a very real crisis. Although members on the Government benches might not believe that there is a crisis or might not wish to talk about it, ostensibly because they are afraid that they will talk down the rural economy, the very clear fact is that a crisis is upon us now. The time has come for government to implement action which will save some of those thousands of people who turned out in Pittsworth. It is time that the Government took the opportunity to take a bold step to ensure that we do not lose more farmers from the land, not just in Queensland but in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The sorts of things that this Government must consider as a matter of urgency are a reduction in fuel taxes and substantial reductions in interest rates to bring the dollar below 70c. It must consider-and I hope that the Senate will accept this during its deliberations tomorrow-the very real need to examine our policy with respect to dumping and countervailing. I believe that we should consider the possibility of introducing as a matter of urgency penalty rates of duty on subsidised goods from overseas. We cannot continue to allow our farm sector to die, to allow it to be strangled and suffocated by cheap imports that flood in from overseas, bringing with them, as they do, the very real risk of disease which could destroy our home-grown agricultural industry.</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot allow those cheap, subsidised groups to be brought in from countries such as the United States of America, China, Ecuador or from wherever, and destroy the livelihoods of Australian farm families. There is a very real crisis-a crisis which will continue while the people of provincial Australia lack any confidence in the Government that is supposed to look after them and represent them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another rural crisis meeting taking place this Saturday in Emerald, a meeting that I believe is particularly significant. I shall be there. I hope that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), or at least one of his representatives, will be willing to turn up, talk to the people, listen to their problems and explain the Government's strategy, because quite frankly it is just insufficient and wholly inaccurate for the Government to continue to ignore the very legitimate concerns of these fine Australians who are struggling to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with a plea to the Minister and to those on the Government benches to pay heed to what the people of provincial Australia are saying and hopefully to take on board some of their suggestions and take some real steps to restore some sort of productivity and opportunity once more to provincial Australia because it is an area that is suffering dreadfully at the moment and an area whose suffering will continue whilst the Government continues its inaction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party (ALP) has its centenary celebrations next year and there will be many events to mark this occasion. However, another centenary which I believe is worth noting and one intimately linked with the formation of the Labor Party has passed this week. The date 5 November 1890 marked the end of the great maritime strike. This strike ended with the total defeat of the striking workers, but this very defeat became the catalyst for the formation of the greatest political party Australia has known-the Australian Labor Party; a party with a history and a background which make the others seem ephemeral and insignificant. The ALP is the oldest democratic socialist party in the English speaking world and its formation provided a model and an impetus for the establishment of democratic socialist parties in other countries which were emerging from colonial rule. I know that even some who sit on the Opposition benches acknowledge the great and seminal role of the Australian Labor Party both inside and outside Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is now 150 years since trade unions began in one form or another in Australia. The trade union movement in Australia was not an imported one. It grew in response to the way the Australian colonies grew. It was probably the gold rushes of the 1850s which created a working class for the first time and these workers soon began to form trade unions to defend their political and economic rights. However, it was really the 1880s before there began to be any real coordination of trade union activities. The first intercolonial trade union congress was held in Sydney in 1879 and this began a network that brought the various trade unions throughout the different colonies into closer connection. During the 1880s Australia saw a huge period of growth, and such periods have traditionally seen a growth in industrial activity and gains in workers' pay and conditions. This was certainly the case during that decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1880s bore an uncanny resemblance to the 1980s in that it was a period of unbridled capitalist greed: a boom based on an illusion-the same illusion that we became very familiar with in the 1980s. Huge amounts of foreign capital poured into Australia and land prices soared. Some individuals became enormously rich but little of lasting benefit remained when the bubble burst at the end of 1880s. The bursting of the bubble saw widespread poverty and hardship and the rapid erosion of the rights so recently gained by workers. In fact new, harsh industrial laws against striking, picketing and even the publication of material were enacted-particularly in New South Wales and Queensland-which made the conditions of workers worse than ever. Up to this time, members of the colonial legislatures had not been paid, so it is obvious that they would have come almost entirely from the wealthy and landed classes and would represent the interests of their kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The general attitude of these ruling class legislators was one of total belief in the workings of the capitalist economy and a belief that these workings should on no account be impeded. In addition to this, most of them believed that the poor had only themselves to blame for their situation. There was very little by way of a social welfare safety net. This had not mattered quite so much during the boom years of the 1880s, but the economic disaster of the 1890s fully exposed the sink or swim nature of Australian society. As far as the rights and conditions of workers were concerned, the parliamentary representatives of the time had no doubt on which side they stood. They believed that the workers would have been happy under the benevolent guidance of their employers if they had not been stirred up by a few agitators. Apparently many of these men believed that these agitators even caused the depression of the 1890s by scaring off foreign investors. </PARA>
<PARA> The great maritime strike of 1890 was, as I said earlier, squashed within a few months and the workers were totally defeated. Nevertheless, it has established an important place in Australian history alongside the shearers strike of 1891. In fact, the two strikes were very much linked. The maritime strike began in Melbourne, with a dispute between shipowners and ships officers over the right of the officers to an industrial organisation linked with the Trades Hall Council. The shipowners were horrified by this. They regarded the officers as class traitors for their failure to identify with their employers. For a long time officers' pay and conditions had stagnated, or even gone backwards, whilst those of the ordinary seamen had improved, even to the extent in some cases that they received more money at the end of a voyage than did the officers. The supposed sweetener for the officers was that they had a higher status-they were gentlemen-whereas the sailors were workers. Eventually the officers realised that the right to feelings of superiority did not put dinner on the table and they began to take industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though the industrial problems in the maritime industry began in this way, the focus soon moved to New South Wales. The strike became a contest between capital and labour in its purist form. Many of the people who had come to Australia, be they bosses or workers, were adventurous and free spirited-the qualities required to move to a new and largely unknown country on the other side of the world. With the hardships endured in the establishment of the colonies, and the arrival of many people for the gold rush, an uneasy equilibrium had been maintained in colonial life. The rampant capitalism of the 1880s followed by the depression of the 1890s destroyed that equilibrium.  The trade unions realised that the time had come to try to ameliorate the worst aspects of the society and to press the claims of those who had no access to other vehicles for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The employers for their part were equally busy. The pastoralists were fighting a battle to have their wool shorn by non-union labour in order that they could avoid improvements in pay and conditions for workers in one of the hardest jobs in the colonies. Their battle included collaboration and joint planning with the shipowners to ensure that their wool reached its markets unimpeded. The shearers, in their turn, appealed to the maritime workers not to handle or ship non-union shorn wool and the maritime workers responded. The strike started in New South Wales on 16 August 1890, involving 10 unions. At its peak, when the shearers came out also from 24 September to 2 October, it involved some 15,000 workers-by far the largest industrial action ever seen in the colonies. </PARA>
<PARA> The strike was finally called off on 5 November. The pastoralists, fired by this victory, launched the famous confrontation with the shearers in 1891 in which they won another crushing victory. In this climate the capitalist classes had the unions at their mercy, or thought they did. The unions had been beaten and humiliated in a series of disputes. High unemployment meant that they had little bargaining power on behalf of their members. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in many ways these so-called victories prepared the way for a huge reordering of Australian society which was to the ultimate benefit of the workers. For one thing, the maritime strike revealed that, although the workers were defeated, the labour movement was well regarded in the general community. This attitude was to be the most important in subsequent events. Secondly, these industrial defeats caused trade union leaders to look, for the first time, to the political sphere to achieve their goals. They made the decision that trade union endorsed candidates should contest the 1891 New South Wales election. And so, out of apparent defeat, grew a new party and a more mature and diverse political climate in Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the Trades and Labour Council had made the decision to contest the 1891 election, matters got under way with amazing speed. The timing of the election gave it only three months to organise, so it straightaway called on unions to form Labor Electoral Leagues. The actual beginning of our Party was marked by the formation of the first Labor Electoral League at Balmain on 4 April 1891. This was quickly followed by many more in the suburbs, and country branches were established in provincial centres and mining towns. </PARA>
<PARA> Even 100 years ago the Labor Party showed the superior organising skills that still benefit our Party today. Even though the new Party contested the election with less than three months to organise and with very little money left after the recent industrial disputation, it contested all 42 seats in the metropolitan area of Sydney, of which it won 15. In the country areas another 20 were elected under the Labor Party banner, as well as several independents who were sympathetic to Labor's cause. </PARA>
<PARA> All this was achieved against a background of doomsaying from the establishment. Its leaders thundered in parliament, in churches and in the press that the new Party would bring into parliament people who were not suitable to be there-and, of course, that meant workers. It is certainly true that the new Party brought into parliament people who would have had no hope of getting there through the existing parties. But although the catalyst for the formation of our Party was the union movement and the recent industrial confrontation, even 100 years ago the Labor Party represented so much more than this. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I used the phrase `democratic socialist' to describe the Labor Party. But even within the Party, and certainly outside it, there are those who find this term anathema. They prefer the description `social democratic', which is apparently a less threatening term. Even historians argue about whether the Labor Party was established with socialist ideals or whether it was formed to represent a different set of petit bourgeois interests and, indeed, that even the workers it represented did not have a real class consciousness because of the nature of Australian society. To my mind that is really a non-argument. Then, as now, the Labor Party represented a broad range of people with different political beliefs and objectives-all those whose interests and aspirations had not been represented by the existing conservative parties. To some of its supporters it was a `socialist' party; to others it was not. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who flocked to it included social reformers and radicals, many from the union movement and from the middle class; many intellectuals; and a good number of rural workers, small farmers and small businessmen. This wide range was reflected in the newly elected members of parliament. It was reported at the time that the new members included several miners, three or four printers, a boilermaker, three sailors, a plasterer, a journalist, a draper, a suburban mayor, two engineers, a carrier, a few shearers, a tailor, a mine owner, a squatter and an MD-truly the party of the people in the widest sense. Mr Deputy President, I am sure that you approve of the latter. I believe that, on the whole, the disparate elements represented by the Labor Party created, and continue to create, within the Party a dynamic tension which is creative and beneficial. Problems are caused not by this conflict but when one tendency obtains a stranglehold within the Party and genuine debate is stultified. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that it is a very productive exercise for the Labor Party to continue to reflect on its roots and to remember whom and what it was created to represent and to continue to represent; to accommodate both the battlers and the idealists of our society; and to continue to represent a genuine intellectual and ideological tradition. This is the strength of the Australian Labor Party and it is our unique place within Australian society. </PARA>
