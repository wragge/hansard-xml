<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA> To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 May I reported to the Senate on the concerns of the Committee with this legislation, which related to a form of search warrant expressed in a permissive rather than a mandatory form, even though such warrants may be issued not only by a judicial officer but also by a justice of the peace, a reversal of the normal onus of proof in a criminal offence to rest with the accused rather than with the prosecution, and an instrument of delegated legislation which contained more than 100 handwritten alterations with no initials or other authentication. The first two of these concerns related to personal liberties and the third to parliamentary proprieties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has received replies from Ministers which have satisfied these concerns to the extent that the protective notices may be removed. The Committee thanks the Ministers for their cooperation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence of the Committee on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The correspondence read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>...21 May 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Hon John Kerin MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Primary Industries and</PARA>
<PARA> Energy</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 386, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 17 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that regulation 9 provided that</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of section 12 of the Act, a warrant may be in the Form in Schedule 2 (emphasis added). </PARA>
<PARA> Under s.12 of the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Act 1989 a search warrant may be issued by either a magistrate or a justice of the peace. In respect of this provision the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills expressed its view that the practice of having search warrants issued by justices of the peace was inappropriate. Search warrants should be issued only by a judge or magistrate, except where a warrant may be required in a very remote country area. In response to this view, the Minister advised that goat production occurs widely and in some remote locations it may not be possible to contact a magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that remote locations may be involved and the possibility that search warrants may be issued by non-judicial officers, the Committee asks whether the discretionary ``may'' for the form of a warrant could not be replaced by the mandatory ``must''. This is an additional safeguard which would partly make up for the use of the undesirable, although necessary, issue of search warrants by justices of the peace. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 21 May 1990 concerning the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No 386. In your letter the Committee asks whether the discretionary ``may'' for the form of a warrant could not be replaced by the mandatory ``must'' in Regulation 9 of those Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue was carefully considered at the time the Regulations were originally prepared. In the event, the word ``may'' was selected to allow those persons authorised to issue a warrant some discretion in the exact form of the warrant to cater for the particular circumstances of each case and it was not intended to be entirely prescriptive in how those persons should conduct their business. Also, I do not believe that the possibility of a Justice of the Peace issuing a search warrant in a remote location justifies the proposed mandatory constraint on the form of the warrant for other legal officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background, I do not believe it is necessary to alter the wording of the Regulation, unless your Committee has further difficulty with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours fraternally</PARA>

<PARA> Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Juries (Amendment) Ordinances 1989, A.C.T. Ordinance No. 61 of 1989, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 17 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that new s.44AA(2) provides for a clear reversal of the usual onus of proof in a criminal matter. The Committee regards such provisions as a breach of personal liberties and accepts them only in exceptional cases. Your advice would be appreciated on the reasons for this provision. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Mal Colston</PARA>
<PARA>Chairman</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>...27 July 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 21 May 1990 concerning new subsection 44AA(2) which was inserted in the ACT Juries Ordinance 1967 by the Juries (Amendment) Ordinance 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 44AA makes it an offence for an employer to dismiss or injure an employee, or alter an employee's position to the prejudice of the employee, because the employee is summoned to serve as a juror. The section goes on to provide that if all elements of the offence other than the reason for the employer's action are proved, the onus of proving that the dismissal, injury or alteration was not because the employee was summoned to serve as a juror is on the employer. </PARA>
<PARA> While I appreciate the Committee's concern with criminal offence provisions that reverse the onus of proof I believe that such a provision is justified in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Jury trials are an essential element in our criminal justice system and members of the community who serve as jurors perform a vital public duty. They should not be subject to any danger of victimisation or prejudice in employment by being required to serve (in some cases for an extended period) as a juror. </PARA>
<PARA> Under section 44AA of the Ordinance the prosecution must prove all elements of the offence except the reason for the employer's detrimental action in respect of the employee. The reason the action was taken is peculiarly within the knowledge of the employer and in the absence of a provision along the lines of section 44AA(2), it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the action was motivated by the requirement to undertake jury service. It should be a relatively straightforward task for the employer to discharge this onus if there are reasons, other than jury service, for the action that was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> In cases like this where it is clear that the offence provision would be ineffective were the onus not reversed in relation to an aspect of the offence, it is contrary to the public interest in law enforcement to deny such a reversal. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 44AA(2) of the Ordinance is in similar terms to section 69(2) of the Juries Act 1977 of NSW. It is also consistent with section 334(6) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Section 334 makes it an offence to dismiss or injure an employee or alter an employee's position to the prejudice of the employee because of membership of an organisation registered under the Act or of the other matters listed in the section. Offence provisions relating to prejudice to employees who appear as witnesses which contain reversal of onus provisions to similar affect are also to be found in a number of Commonwealth Acts including the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Act 1988 (s49) and the Biological Control Act 1984 (s51). </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, and particularly having regard to the important public policy considerations involved, I consider section 44AA falls within the very limited category of exceptions to the general rule that there should not be a reversal of the onus of proof in respect of criminal offences. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Overseas Defence Determination 1990/36 considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 17 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that its copies of the instrument had a substantial number of hand written alterations to Item numbers, Part 1 of Attachment 1, Items 40-46 and 170-268, with no initials or other form of authentication. The Committee believes that the reproduction and presentation of delegated legislation should be of a standard not less than that of Acts of Parliament. Any lesser standard may be a breach of parliamentary propriety. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letters 21, 28, and 3 May 1990 about aspects of various determinations made by the relevant delegates in my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I attach a report provided to me by my Department which addresses the points you have raised about each determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps it would be useful if the Secretary of your Committee could speak to the First Assistant Secretary of the Remuneration and Conditions Division of my Department so we can make sure that these problems can be avoided in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> One of your letters of 21 May 1990 also raises an issue in relation to Public Service Determination 1990/l on arrangements for classifying SES officers. I will write to you separately on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours fraternally</PARA>
<PARA>Peter Cook</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas Defence Determination 1990/36</PARA>
<PARA> - The Committee has drawn attention to a number of unauthenticated handwritten alterations and the reduction in the quality of the document. </PARA>
<PARA> - The delegate who signed the 293-page determination has confirmed that all the handwritten alterations were made before the determination was signed in order to meet a tight deadline. </PARA>
<PARA> - Only the item number in an Attachment were affected; these numbers are included only for convenience of future reference, and the entitlements of Defence Force members do not rely on them. </PARA>
<PARA> - Arrangements have been made to ensure that in future there is appropriate evidence associated with the original of the determination to authenticate any essential handwritten determination alterations of determinations and that tabling copies of determinations accurately reflect the substance of the determination. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges-Whether evidence to Estimates Committee B in May 1990 in relation to asbestos in Royal Australian Navy ships was misleading, having regard to information which was available to the Navy concerning dangers associated with asbestos, and, if so, whether any contempt was committed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, at the Estimates Committee hearing on 14 May 1990, I submitted a written question directed to the Department of Defence and to the various Services. My question was answered approximately two weeks later in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I asked dealt with a matter of great importance, and it was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Department or any of the Services done or are doing any studies into asbestos? Have the studies concluded how many are expected to die from asbestos-related diseases? What is the short-term and the long-term plan for asbestos-related diseases and the like in Army, Navy and RAAF?</PARA>
<PARA>That question was answered, as I said, a couple of weeks later. When the response came back from the Department of Defence, it was headed up with a restatement of my question. The restatement, in fact, contained two areas where the meaning of the question had been changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Part A of the question was changed from `studies into asbestos'' to ``studies into asbestos-related diseases', and part C was changed so that it no was longer grammatically correct. It read:</PARA>

<PARA>A) Navy has undertaken a number of studies over the last six years quantifying the asbestos hazards existing in RAN ships and establishments so that appropriate action, if any, could be undertaken. Navy maintains a register of asbestos workers currently serving. Navy has not undertaken any epidemiological or clinical studies into asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA>B) No such studies projecting expected mortality have been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>Passing over some details of the current Defence Instructions, the answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . asbestos workers are subject to medical surveillance in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>The paragraphs that follow form the crux of my complaint. The Navy response continued:</PARA>
<PARA>In the mid-1960s, the UK research in the Royal Dockyards pointed out the relationship between asbestos work in the dockyard and asbestos related disease. When this became known, the RAN adopted protective measures against asbestos from 1966. </PARA>
<PARA>Because most HMA Ships contained asbestos, and large numbers of RAN personnel have served in those ships, any attempt to identify all who might have been exposed would require massive resource allocation. Because of the assessed low risk, and likely low yield from such a process, it has not been pursued. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead individuals make their claims for compensation in the normal manner. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, to give the Navy its due, it at least covered about half a page of typewritten answer. The Army managed to spit its answer out in two short sentences, and the Air Force appears to me to have taken the question in a more serious and detailed manner. Nevertheless, at the time I got that answer from the Department, I believed that to be the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> I was convinced that, as a result of research in the Royal Dockyards in the mid-1960s, the Royal Navy had informed the Royal Australian Navy that there was a relationship between asbestos-related work in the Dockyards and asbestos-related disease and that from that time on-1966-and because of that information, the Australian Navy adopted protective measures. That, Mr President, was my understanding of the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when I sent some of those answers out to other people, a Mr Ben Hills of the Sydney Morning Herald contacted me and said that he was in possession of some letters which made it quite clear that that answer was misleading. I would like to draw to the attention of honourable senators the first of the letters which Mr Hills sent to me for attention. </PARA>
<PARA> This letter is dated 19 October 1943-I repeat, 1943-20 odd years before the Navy claims to have put protective measures in place as a result of the United Kingdom research. This letter is signed by the Secretary of the Victorian Public Health Department and is addressed to the General Manager, HMA Naval Dockyard, Williamstown, Victoria. The reference is asbestos panelling. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to read the whole letter. It refers to work being done in the dockyard fitting asbestos panelling into naval ships and the question of the possible harm to the health of people engaged in that occupation. The Secretary of the Department, whose signature is not decipherable said this:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the inhalation of asbestos dust may produce damage to the lungs, the condition being known as ``asbestosis''. This condition, which may be incapacitating, may take years to develop, the time required depending, among other factors, on the concentration of dust in the air breathed. Usually in industry a period of about 7-12 years more or less continuous daily exposure is required to produce the condition. A case has occurred with as little as one and a half years of exposure. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter talks about `confined spaces', `the processes of sawing and hammering', `quantities of dust' and `lack of ventilation'. It adds that `the concentration of dust in the air breathed may become considerable'. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The use of dust respirators may be advisable. The decision as to this would depend on determinations of the dust concentration and the degree of continuity of the work. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>This Department would be agreeable to carrying out these determinations. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Navy accepted that offer and I have a letter, dated 9 February 1944, from a Mr Mackie, the general manager at the dockyard at Williamstown, writing to the Secretary of the Public Health Department in Victoria, acknowledging receipt of the letter of 5 February 1944 and enclosing the report of tests taken on the use of asbestos panelling. That reporttold the Navy the number of dust countsit--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I will leave honourable senators to decide whether they are going to accept the legalistic view of the Government in order to try to defend people who were given a question, took it on notice and very carefully gave an answer to the Parliament. I do not intend to quote continually from this report. However, I will quote just two or three paragraphs. The first couple of paragraphs state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A number of dust counts of the air in the breathing zone of men engaged on different activities in the Table Room and the Cinema Room of a ship being refilled were made on January 5th. </PARA>
<PARA> The results showed that the concentration of asbestos dust in the air in certain cases was above that which is regarded as a safe limit for continuous exposure. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of parts of the report which then talk about the effect on lungs and questions as to the period of exposure. The report then refers to a study of 1,512 workers conducted by the British Silicosis and Asbestos Medical Board and the results of that study. The report then goes on to talk about an elaborate investigation by the United States Public Health Service carried out in the asbestos textile industry. As a result of these investigations, the authors suggest that 5 million particles per cubic foot may be regarded as a tentative standard. The report then goes on to table the dust counts found in the investigation at the dockyards on 5 January 1944, all of which were above the acceptable limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report wound up saying that, on the basis of the American report, one might expect that a small percentage would show signs of asbestos after working continuously in such atmosphere for two or three years, and it gave recommendations for how the problems might be avoided, such as: open air where practicable and ensuring that all port holes are open. It recognised that some work in confined cabin spaces would be necessary and that, in those cases, dust concentrations might be such as to require the use of respirators, even though the work lasted only a short period, and that dust respirators would help to prevent further exposure. That material was available to the Navy. It was very detailed material, and I find it extraordinary that the Government would apparently seek to suggest that it was not relevant to the answer which was asked of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> We then move to the 1970s and, obviously, the Navy still remembered that it had those studies and had presumably taken some action as a result of those studies since 1943. I do not have evidence as to what measures it took. It certainly knew what measures it was supposed to take. It knew what were dangerous dust levels. It knew that there were ways of protecting people from that dust. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to an undated letter, from the Navy Office to the Secretary of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia in Balmain, which starts:</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 20th July 1971. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, one presumes it was some relatively short period after 20 July 1971. In paragraph 3 of that letter, the Navy Office said to the Union:</PARA>
<PARA>It is agreed that there is a health risk in handling asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been recognised in dealings between various Unions and this Department since at least 1943 when exhaustive tests on dust concentrations during certain processes were conducted by the Victorian Public Health Department. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. The letter continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The present safety instructions on the handling of asbestos which had their beginnings in these tests have been constantly under review and are considered satisfactory:</PARA>
<PARA>One wonders: does the Minister for Defence consider that the tests, which have been constantly under review since the 1943-44 correspondence, can be classified as studies? Obviously, there is a very careful use of language there, and I am surprised at the Minister being prepared to defend that. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The department is in any case doing its best to phase out the use of materials containing asbestos and considers that within the near future exposure to asbestos hazards will be reduced to a minimum. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that that was not even true because at the end of the 1970s when HMAS Brisbane was refitted a black ban was imposed by the workers in the Garden Island dockyard. So naval personnel were being required to remove asbestos, in my view, without adequate protection. That, however, is another matter which can be dealt with at another time, or would be dealt with at another time if the inquiry which was announced yesterday by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) was intended to go back into history. However, the Government is very keen only to inquire into current matters and not look back into history. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, as I said to the President in my letter dated 15 August, when looking at these answers and the background material that has now come into my hands, we have to have regard also to the fifteenth report of the Committee of Privileges and the comments made by the Committee concerning misleading evidence. I remind honourable senators that that related to a complaint by Senator MacGibbon over answers given by departmental officers from the Department of Defence in relation to the Project Parakeet development. </PARA>
<PARA> In that report it was in fact found that there had not been a deliberate misleading of the Senate. However, the Committee pointed out that all witnesses giving evidence to Senate committees should be aware of the need to avoid giving evidence which could be misleading. I believe that the answer to the question was misleading in that, by failing to refer to the Navy's pre-1966 knowledge of the dangers of asbestos, the answer tended to leave a false impression in the minds of the recipients that the Navy had become aware of the dangers of asbestos only in the mid-1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> As the President said yesterday, while he made no judgment on the matter, he agreed that it was a serious matter, not a trivial one, and he agreed it was a proper matter for giving precedence of referral to the Privileges Committee. There is no other remedy reasonably available to deal with this situation. We are talking here about a department which had a Privileges Committee inquiry on its answers not very long ago. The Department would be well aware of the fact that it is not to give misleading answers. </PARA>
<PARA> On many occasions I have found in the past that when people who are knowledgeable about defence matters have seen some of the answers which the Department of Defence has given in the Estimates Committee, they have been concerned at the failure of officials to give open and full and frank answers. Instead they use legalistic responses, such as the Minister is now attempting to put to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The first test in 1943 was done for the Navy by the Victorian Department which acknowledged by letter that it was prepared to undertake the test. The understanding from the letter of 1971 is that those were studies which were held by the Navy and done on its behalf. Consequently, I have moved this motion so that the matter can be resolved by the Privileges Committee. This Parliament cannot operate if officials are able to so word considered written answers to questions taken on notice after weeks have passed. </PARA>
<PARA> If we cannot rely on full and frank answers to questions of national importance, such as those about the health of our soldiers, sailors and airmen, then what sort of a job can a senator do in the exercise of his or her public responsibility? We cannot accept and be seen to accept officials attempting to hold information back from honourable senators in the exercise of their duty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reference of any issue to the Privileges Committee is very serious. It is absolutely essential to establish a proper prima facie case before this chamber refers an issue on. It is not a party matter, so today I am not just addressing the Opposition and the Australian Democrats; I am also addressing people on my own side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I thought there was any case to answer at all I would want this matter referred to the Privileges Committee for full investigation. But today Senator Newman has not put up one aspect of a prima facie case for the misleading of the Senate. That is what she is arguing about-that the Senate has been misled, implying that it is deliberate, but even saying it could be inadvertent. I say to this Senate that not only has it not been misled deliberately but also it has not been misled even inadvertently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume has already made up his mind, on a conscience vote, without listening to both sides-he has made that quite clear-so he should not interrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What this is about-and what people should try to resolve in their own minds-is process; it is not about content or the morality of asbestosis and the use of asbestos. It is an entirely different issue. It is about whether an officer in the Department of Defence has set out, inadvertently or deliberately, to mislead the Senate in an answer. I want to go through carefully and analyse the question and the answer to show that that is not the case, and that there is not even a prima facie case. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key paragraphs in the answer that Senator Newman relies on reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In the mid-1960s, the UK research in the Royal Dockyards pointed out the relationship between asbestos work in the dockyard and asbestos related disease. When this became known, the RAN adopted protective measures against asbestos from 1966. </PARA>
<PARA>That simply happens to be a statement of fact: when the report became known, the Royal Australian Navy adopted protective measures. It does not imply that there was not pre-knowledge, or other knowledge, about problems with asbestos prior to 1966. That part of the answer is absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA> What this debate comes down to is not that anything in the answer is wrong-not one thing is wrong, there is not one act of commission in the answer that happens to be wrong-but that, as Senator Newman has said, by an act of omission the question has not been fully answered. One of the keys to that is in her own question. I hope I have the right question here-I am subject to correction, as I would hate to think that I am reading out the wrong question. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Department or any of the Services done or are doing any studies</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key to it-`has the Department done', not whether the Victorian Health Department, or someone else, did, but `has the Department done'. The answer given here is truthful; it lists when the studies have been done by the Services or by the Department. It does not list whether someone else overseas, or some other Victorian department-which, I must say, on reading the documents, showed enormous prescience on this issue, and one wonders what happened to this Victorian department's work for 20 or 30 years-carried out a study. Senator Newman has quoted from a letter to the Williamstown dockyard in 1943. Apparently, any officer answering a question on an issue has to have knowledge of what happened in 1943, but I will come back to that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go to the timing of the answers. Senator Newman said there were weeks in which to provide answers. Most honourable senators who were here will recall there was a very restricted time between the Estimates Committee B meeting and reporting to this chamber. The sequence of events is as follows: A question was received on the fifteenth, the financial planning area sent it on to the Royal Australian Navy on the sixteenth, the Navy received the question on the seventeenth and replied on the same day. It was cleared by my office, having waited for the more tardy Army and Royal Australian Air Force responses, on 22 May and sent on to the Estimates Committee on 23 May. </PARA>
<PARA> I have interviewed the officer responsible for preparing this answer, and he did what was proper. He went to the existing files in the Department. He went right through the existing files and based his answer on what was in them. I admit, he did not go to archives and spend six months going back to Federation, but nor would I or this chamber expect an officer to do that. Had he done so, he still may have found nothing because the other interesting thing is that the sort of document Senator Newman is talking about today-that is, a letter to a dockyard manager-comes from the Victorian archives file, not from the Commonwealth file. We have no record of it that we can find with the Navy. We do not even know whether the manager of that dockyard ever sent the letter on properly to the Navy, or binned it or anything else. We have no knowledge in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Newman is really doing is asking the question: has the Navy done a study? Because the Victorian Health Department in 1943 did a study-not commissioned by the Navy-that is not on our files, Senator Newman accuses an officer of deliberately misleading this Senate. What nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, of misleading this Senate. What absolute nonsense. I know that to some extent Senator Newman has been misled by Ben Hill's approach, because what he says is that he asked for all the individual files, he alleged a report exists and when we do not release the files he says we are sitting on a document which we have never acknowledged and cannot find. Senator Newman has been a victim of that sort of clever journalism, and that is a pity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to go on and look at the actual position of privileges because, obviously, this particular one would relate to Privileges Resolution 12C that was carried by this chamber about two years ago. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>A witness shall not give any evidence which the witness knows to be false or misleading in a material particular, or which the witness does not believe, on reasonable grounds, to be true or substantially true in every material particular. </PARA>
<PARA>The key phrases are `knows to be false' or `does not believe, on reasonable grounds, to be true'. I want to go quickly back over this question. The question was asked: has the Navy done any studies? The answer comes in, and is accurate, listing the Navy's studies. But because a study is done in 1943 or, more to the point, a letter is produced, and we have the letter here, it is hardly a study-and I think Senator Newman would acknowledge that-some officer producing an answer in 1990 is supposed to have the corporate knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical thing is that this letter was lost to the corporate knowledge of the Navy, otherwise, one would have to ask oneself why it did not do anything in particular about it. Of course, one of the reasons is that this occurred in the middle of World War II. But to come into this chamber and say that there is a misleading answer, based on the fact that some officer has not gone back through the archives for six months to find this letter-if it exists, because it came out of the Victorian health archives-is an absolutely ridiculous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people may say, `Look, the problem has been raised, it is a bit hard to determine who is right and who is wrong in this chamber so why don't we send it off to the Committee, and it can sort it out'. That is an easy thing for us to do, but Senator Newman should remember that the serving officers who she wants to drag before this Committee will not regard it as some minor thing to be shoved off the agenda because it is too hard to make an intellectual decision today. That is a career-breaking opportunity for them if they have to appear before the Privileges Committee. One which will not affect their careers--</PARA>

I have no doubt that the Privileges Committee would make that finding. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have one supporting piece of evidence for a prima facie case. If no prima facie case has been established, then this should not go to the Privileges Committee because of the unnecessary strain and stress it places on people. That is absolutely the case. The reference to the previous reference of the Privileges Committee was quite strange. That had a much stronger base and yet it was dismissed by the Privileges Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am astonished at the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). It seems that he is suggesting to the Senate that there is no corporate knowledge within the Royal Australian Navy; that everything known is within the knowledge of only one of the more recent entrants to the Navy. Some personnel have served in the Navy for 35 or more years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation. It is quite clear that theNavy's corporate knowledge extends back to the mid-1960s. It could recall that it got the information from the United Kingdom. It could tell us that it instituted measures in 1966. That was quite a precise date. But it seemed to be unable to remember that it had any sort of dealings on asbestos and hazards. </PARA>

They are available and will be made available to the Committee. I am not trying to hide anything. It is a detailed report giving measurements which I chose not to read out to the Senate but which are available for honourable senators to peruse. There are detailed studies of the total fibre count and the total dust count in the various parts of the ship studied on 5 January 1944. If the Navy has a problem with filing, that is the Minister's problem, not mine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was, and had been, available to the Navy. One presumes that it has not also lost the letter of 1971 that refers to the studies of1943-44. The Navy has also done tests since then based on the 1943 material. It seems as though the corporate knowledge of the Navy is rather selective. I am astonished that the Minister would use that as a basis of an attempt to divert the Senate from the real purpose of this, that is, when questions are asked of officers of departments, honourable senators are entitled to expect full and frank answers. In this case the answer given was clearly intended to assure honourable senators that the Navy became aware of the hazards of asbestos dust in the 1960s and that, when it became aware of the problem, it instituted health measures.</PARA></TALK.START>

Havingchosen how it will answer the question it is then expected to answer it in a manner which is not misleading. It chose exactly how it would put its words. I did not put those words into the Navy's mouth. Having put those words down on paper an honourable senator is entitled to expect that they are the full facts of the matter. The use of the words which the Navy gave to honourable senators gave a clear understanding that that was when it became aware of the hazards of asbestos and that that was when it introduced measures. The clear evidence is that it became aware of it in the 1940s. It was told then what measures to introduce. It subsequently conducted tests. We do not know whether it put measures in place. After all, there are 300 applications before the Department of Veterans' Affairs in regard to asbestos related diseases from people who have war entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an important matter. It is not just a question of semantics. The Minister has tried to run this debate on semantics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this reply to the Budget Speech I want to address how the Government's policies have destroyed the capacity of Australian business to be internationally competitive, with dire consequences for all Australians. There is a growing recognition that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, who seems to so dominate this Government, is taking Australia down a path to disaster. The longer it continues, the worse will be the result, the harder will be the recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has lost all credibility. No-one believes him any more. Unemployment is now rising, with 100,000extra job losses since last October, bankruptcies soaring and small businesses failing in ever increasing numbers. Yet we live in a region of great opportunity. The opening up of economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand offers new and exciting opportunities for Australian investment and trade. But we have to be competitive. The Japanese, Taiwanese, Americans and Europeans, just to name a few, are all in the same markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for Australian business, the economic parameters set by this Government produce almost impossible obstacles. Australian business must compete in the face of economic liabilities such as an overvalued dollar, forced up by interest rates often double that of our competitors; higher rates of inflation; inflexible labour conditions bearing little relationship to productivity or profitability; expensive and sometimes inefficient transport; an uncompetitive waterfront; exorbitantly costly coastal transport; stifling government regulation; and so on. All these factors are beyond the control of business but within the capacity of government to vary. </PARA>
<PARA> These obstacles to business efficiency, as I said at the outset, have destroyed much of our competitive export capacity and our import replacement potential. So month after month we see the mind-boggling figures of our current account failure as we plummet further and further into debt. We have a debt of $150 billion and rising-an incomprehensible figure. It is not all government debt; that is true. The accumulated debt of the Commonwealth and the States is about one-half of that figure, but it is debt because Australia cannot produce competitively the higher value goods and services which we demand to maintain a higher living standard with the added burden placed on our business as compared with our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Those neighbours are, at best, bemused. I remind the Senate of the comments of Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, on the Lateline television program recently. When he was asked what he thought of Australia 25 years ago, he said that 25 years ago he had thought of Australia as a wealthy, advanced nation as compared to its neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. `Now,' he said, rather politely, `you are not so advanced'. He is right. Our neighbours have moved ahead. They, on the one hand, have industrialised, upgraded and poured energy and determination into designs, innovations, advanced technological research and strategy. We, on the other hand, have failed to take advantage of the running start that our generous natural endowments have given us. We still find ourselves excessively dependent on primary commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> Others seek to seize potential advantage from our relative decline. I refer, for example, to Taiwan demanding the political price of Australia allowing China Airlines to land in our country in return for direct flights to Taiwan, which we now need more than it does. The irony is that, 25 years ago, if Australia was an advanced nation, Taiwan was an aid recipient. Today, as I said, Australia has an enormous foreign debt of $150 billion-on some indices the third highest in the world-whilst Taiwan, with virtually no natural resources, has a foreign reserve of some $US75 billion, the second highest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Other countries further to our north look at us with disdain. On the other side of the ledger, those with funds to invest, such as Japan, Taiwan and the countries of western Europe, are discouraged from doing so in Australian industry for the same reasons as are crushing our capacity to export. They run into exactly the same obstacles and choose to invest elsewhere. We are a small market, so what is produced here must be produced at an internationally competitive price and must be of internationally competitive quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Again looking at the example of Taiwan, over the next five years it will invest between $US5 billion and $US10 billion overseas; but on Australia's current economic path most of that investment will go to the United States or South East Asia. We will not attract our share. We have just seen the recent example of the China Steel Corporation, which has rejected the opportunity to invest in a new steel mill in Australia, notwithstanding the protective legislation passed by this Government. This simply demonstrates the point that I am making. It seems that the Corporation is now more likely to go to Malaysia because of its better economic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequences will flow from this economic decline. As we become economically weaker we become vulnerable in so many ways. In the area of defence we will lose the technological edge that we have over so many in the region because we will not be able to keep up. Our capacity to support the elderly, the sick and the disadvantaged will be reduced. Unless this economic decline is arrested, it will change the very nature of our society. We will become less secure in so many ways. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of this dire predicament the Opposition seeks to be constructive. Dr Hewson last night set out a new direction for Australia in order that we might again become a major economic force in the region. I remind the Senate of the program he set out-a program to boost our production, our productivity and our exports; to reduce the overall tax burden by real cuts in government spending; to simplify the personal tax system at lower rates to restore incentive; and to shift the burden of taxation away from income towards consumption in order to encourage savings and to provide scope for the elimination of various taxes on exports and business inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> It seeks to free up the labour market in order that we might get internationally competitive wages outcomes which tie wages to performance and genuinely protect the interests of workers; to implement industry reform which will cut protection which is simply adding costs to those industries which are not protected; to privatise government enterprises in order to produce competition and real efficiency gains; and to provide a new efficient infrastructure through reform of telecommunications, road and rail transport, aviation, shipping and the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Through this package the pressure on interest rates can be reduced and Australia can return to the track of eradicating inflation. We can then start to give our producers a fair chance. The fact that it is so critical that we remove the government-imposed or maintained obstacles to internationally competitive production was expressed with great clarity by Dr Hewson last night when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If we are to stabilise our foreign debt by say, 1995, we need to shift nearly 4 per cent of our production into exports . . . even if we matched the best performance of the post-war period we would not see our debt stabilise this decade. </PARA>
<PARA>That is only a question of stabilising the debt, let alone starting to reduce it. In the same way as Dr Hewson has sought to be constructive in the Opposition's overall program, coalition senators in this place, within their areas of special interest and responsibility, will set out how things might be different and better with the objective of restoring Australia's prosperity and properly meeting government responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In that spirit, I want to look at the desirability of better locking Australia into our regional opportunities. Our share of the trade among the Association of South East Asian Nations is still only 2 per cent, so there is a great deal of room for improvement even in our near region. I suggest that the Government should put much more effort into bilateral trade relations. So many eggs have been put into the basket of multinational negotiation. Whilst there is no doubt about the laudable economic objectives of that strategy and the higher political profile gained from such international fora, bilateral opportunities have gone begging. I will look at two case studies which I put to the Senate for its consideration: that of Indonesia and, the one that I mentioned earlier, Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that Indonesia provides a good case study in the process of neglect. In a program of major structural adjustment, necessitated by overdependence on oil export earnings, combined with falls in the prices of oil and other commodities, Indonesia undertook a series of major reforms to remove an anti-export bias in economic regulation and to encourage investment. The result has been rapid economic growth, based on expanding export industries in a range of manufactured and semi-processed goods. This process has been taking place over the last five years, but Australia has done little to prepare to take advantage of the new opportunities being created. </PARA>
<PARA> A trade and commercial development program booklet from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) published in June 1990 at last recognises that the opportunities presented by Indonesian growth warrant a higher priority in Australia's trade and commercial policy and market development efforts, but the measures proposed are meagre and the suggestion that `foreign competition in Indonesia is starting to intensify' is laughable. Our competitors have been putting years of arduous effort into joint venture development backed by billions of dollars in government support. </PARA>
<PARA> The booklet suggests that Austrade should develop a market development strategy for Indonesia. It is surprising and deplorable that there is not already a fully developed long-term market development strategy in a country which is one of our nearest neighbours with a market of 180 million people, an economy with significant resource development potential, and where there have been signals for at least three years that reforms and structural adjustment would lead to rapidly expanding opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the proposed measures, it is suggested that we should `explore with Indonesia the early inclusion of a double taxation agreement' to foster trade and investment and, in particular, joint ventures. This implies that in June 1990 we had not even begun to explore a fundamental prerequisite for joint venture development. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989-90 budget for DFAT shows clearly the priority attached to such objectives. The corporate plan of the Department said that we would seek `to improve investment and trade flows through closer liaison and assistance to the private sector to the extent that resources permit'. The rider is, of course, bureaucratese for an intention to do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Australian privatesector has not waited for the Government to discover the expanding opportunities in Indonesia. Exports to Indonesia in the financial year just ended are expected to reach $1 billion, having almost doubled from three years ago. Australian mining companies have also been active in joint venture developments in the minerals and energy sectors in Indonesia. Opportunities won for participation in joint ventures in mining are expected to add $350m to Australian investment in Indonesia by 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to note that this significant share of joint venture opportunities was said by DFAT to have been greatlyassisted by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau funded Indonesia-Australia geological mapping project which commenced in 1976 under the Fraser Government. It concluded last financial year. It is less pleasing to note that no steps have been taken to develop new project activity in that sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Mining is a sector in which Australia has considerable comparative advantage and is, therefore, an efficient supplier and where Indonesia has considerable potential for growth which, given Indonesia's good record in income distribution, can be expected to alleviate poverty. It is, therefore, good aid and, at the same time, it is good trade. It is often the case that good aid makes for good trade. Economic rationality dictates that we should not give away goods and services that we cannot sell competitively in a free market. </PARA>
<PARA> The other case study I mentioned and to which I wish to refer is Taiwan. Here also Australian business is to beapplauded for its efforts, despite the Australian Government. With negligible support, the Australian-Taiwan commercial relationship reached nearly $4 billion last year. It is interesting to note that that is almost double that of our relationship with the People's Republic of China, into which this Australian Government has poured enormous resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has demonstrated itself to be incredibly naive. A year ago, in this chamber, honourable senators might recall Senator GarethEvans describing the trading relationship-I stress trading relationship and not political relationship-with Taiwan as something we have to `tread carefully and sensitively' on. At the same time, trade between Taiwan and China was rapidly building. That is the naivety. Last year it almost reached $3.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas Airways Ltd does not fly to Taipei, but Cathay Pacific does. As honourable senators will know, Cathay Pacific is part owned by the People's Republic of China. As a matter of interest, so do another 19 international airlines fly to Taipei, and China Airlines flies to 18 international destinations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is believed by the Australian Chamber of Commerce that that direct air link would lift tourists from Taiwan to Australia from some 20,000 to over 130,000 a year. It has been a saga of poor negotiation and lost opportunity of which this Government should not be proud. Two billion dollars is the extra value put on the direct link by the Australian Chamber of Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole relationship is a sad story of Australian companies hindered by lack of information regarding commercial opportunities and contacts, lack of Government assisted promotion, clumsy visa facilitation and, as I said, an absence of direct flights. I have used these two examples to make a point, but there are many others that one could choose. Even if the domestic economics were put right, this Government is still far from maximising Australian business opportunity in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, for some reason, seems to have a mindset against the role business can play in restoring our competitive productivity. When Australia played a pivotal role last year in the setting up of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, which had its first ministerial meeting in this city, no role for business input was built into it. Government and its bureaucrats know better. That body-now the most important regional economic body-has had itssecond ministerial meeting. Despite the protests of the Pacific Basin Economic Council and others, there is still no role for business. How can effective regional economic cooperation happen in isolation from commercial realities?</PARA>
<PARA> John Hewson said last night in his address:</PARA>
<PARA>What we need now is to harness all the energy and determination of the Australian people to reach our objective of making Australia once again a significant force in our region of the world-a strong Australia that can hold its head high. </PARA>
<PARA>We have slipped back so far. If the Labor Government is not going to acknowledge its failures and make the necessary policy changes, at least the coalition is committed to giving the Australian people a fair chance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes before lunch yesterday devoted to the second reading debate on the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill I was highlighting, amongst other things, the way in which the national maritime museum project demonstrates the incompetence not only of this Federal Government but also the previous Wran Labor Government in New South Wales. To recapitulate on some of the points I made, this Bill provides for the establishment of the AustralianNational Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour in Sydney. The Bill also outlines the functions and powers of the museum and provides for the establishment of the Museum Council to replace the interim council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The establishment of this museum will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the people of Australia. It will be a repository for a very important part of Australia's history, namely our maritime history. As an island continent, seafaring and maritime history has been of great importance to the development of this country; and shipping continues to be of great importance to our economy-something that this Government does not recognise, as demonstrated by its continued failure to do anything about reforming the waterfront and coastal shipping. But, of course, that is a matter for another day. </PARA>
<PARA> This project largely began as a creature of politics. It was created as a ploy in the 1984 New South Wales State election. From the outset, it has been manipulated to further political ends. The decision to establish this project was taken when the Wran Labor Government was facing that election. It wanted to develop a significant project as part of its Darling Harbour baby. An agreement was reached with the Hawke Labor Government, in time for Mr Wran to go to the polls in March 1984, to the effect that the Federal Government promised to provide some $30m to construct the maritime museum. That figure was based virtually on conceptual plans which had not been developed in great detail. Many people involved in the project have acknowledged that the $30m was nothing more than a guesstimate of the cost of constructing the museum. As a result of agreeing that the Commonwealth contribution would be $30m, the Wran Government and Laurie Brereton, the then State Minister responsible for Darling Harbour, virtually signed an open cheque to get the project off the ground. Their fast- tracking of the Darling Harbour development in total led them to sign that open cheque. </PARA>
<PARA> The $30m was not only based on conceptual plans but also related only to the cost of the building. One can question the competence of the people who reached the agreement but ignored the fact that further money would be required to establish the museum once the building had been constructed. Right from the start, this project has been fraught with controversy and difficulties as a result of the combined administrative incompetence of two Labor governments-the former New South Wales Labor Government and the Hawke Government, which continues in office. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of industrial disputes and the design being developed in more detail, over the years the cost has blown out to about $70m-$40m above the original estimate. In no way can that blow-out be sheeted home to the New South Wales Greiner Government. It is the combined product of industrial disputation and the need to carry out detailed design work which had not been done when the original Commonwealth contribution and estimated cost of $30m was agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> The project was originally due to be completed in time to be opened in October 1988 as part of our bicentennial celebrations. However, it was not ready then because of delays in construction, partly due to industrial disputation. It was then due to be opened in September 1989, but it was not ready then. More recently, we were told that it would be opened in December this year, but we have been further advised that it will not be opened until the latter half of 1991. Again, we see the difficulties that have been associated with this project. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason for the continuing delay has been the blow-out in costs from $30m to $70m, resulting in a dispute between the New South Wales Greiner Government and the Federal Government about who is to meet the additional costs. The fact that the Federal Government has not agreed to contribute additional significant funds to meet that cost is, in our view, a severe dereliction of duty. Under the spirit of the agreement reached in 1986, the Commonwealth was to provide the funds for the project. The Federal Government agreed to provide $30m which was to be the full cost of the project. Clearly, in terms of principle, the present cost of $70m ought to be met by the Federal Government because it is no fault of the State Government that the cost has blown out to $70m. Despite protracted negotiations, the Federal Government refuses to meet that responsibility and, until recently, the New South Wales Government refused-rightly-to hand over to the Commonwealth Government for use as a museum a building which it was responsible for constructing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government refused point blank to continue negotiations on the additional $40m cost. It was interested in litigation rather than negotiation. It threatened the New South Wales Government that if it took the matter to litigation, won its case and the Commonwealth was required to provide the additional $40m, the Federal Government would simply knock $40m off the annual Commonwealth grants to the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of blackmailing and standover tactics to which the Commonwealth Government has resorted in its dealings with the States-so much for the promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to renegotiate the compact with the States later this year to give a better division of responsibility. This Commonwealth Government treats the States with absolute disdain. We have seen that again in the Budget which was presented this week. Yet again, this Government refuses to cut its spending on its programs but it squeezes the States, local government and statutory authorities, trying to present a facade of a Budget in which spending is cut. The States continually suffer at the hands of the Federal Government. The Australian National Maritime Museum is yet another example of the way in which the Commonwealth Government treats the States with complete disdain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government refuses to negotiate. Finally, under the threat of a reduction in funding, the New South Wales Government has acquiesced and agreed to hand over the building to the Commonwealth Government so that the museum can commence operating. The New South Wales Government believes that it is in the interests of the people of New South Wales and Australia to get the museum up and running. This has been a sorry story of the attitude of the Federal Government and the incompetence of the Federal Government and previous State Labor Government in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been controversy about not only funding but also members of the museum Council. Early in 1988, the Federal Government sacked three key members of the Maritime Museum Council, leaving it without a Chairman or Deputy Chairman. The three people sacked had particular expertise in maritime history-the Chairman, Mr Alex Dix, who was also Chairman of the National Museum of Australia; the Deputy Chairman, Rear Admiral Andrew Robertson, who convinced the Government of the efficacy of establishing a maritime museum; and Miss Kristine Klugman, who had spent eight years on the trust of the Australian Museum in Sydney. They were sacked by the then Minister, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), and were replaced by lackeys of the Federal Government, including Mr Peter Doyle, who is a mate of the Prime Minister; and Trish Kavanagh, the wife of Laurie Brereton, the former State Minister responsible for Darling Harbour and the museum project. The potential independence of the Council was thereby compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> Other members of the Council strongly protested about those sackings at the time and sent a telex of protest to the Government about them. Those who signed that telex were Professor Geoffrey Boulton, Professor of History at Murdoch University; yachting journalist, Mr Bruce Stannard; and merchant mariner, Mr John Evans-the three other members of the Council at that time. Obviously, they recognised the way in which the Government was seeking to undermine the effectiveness of this Council through the appointments that it made. That has been a further matter of controversy as far as this project is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also difficulties with the legislation as it was first presented to this Parliament. Its provisions relating to the destruction of items regarded as no longer required by the museum were inadequate. The previous Opposition shadow Minister responsible for this area highlighted that particular shortcoming and was able to negotiate with the Government amendments to the legislation. We certainly welcome those amendments taken at the initiative of the Opposition which will tighten up those terms with regard to the destruction of items. </PARA>
<PARA> The second inadequacy originally with the legislation was that there was no requirement for directions which the Minister might give to the Council to be tabled in the Parliament. Again, the Opposition sought to have the legislation amended to ensure that ministerial directions had to be tabled within six days of being given, if they were to remain valid. Again, we welcome the Government's agreement to that amendment, which will certainly improve the legislation. It is important that parliamentary scrutiny be maintained with regard to directions that a Minister might give to a council, particularly when, as I have said, the Government has put some of its lackeys on that council. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Opposition has a further difficulty with this legislation. Subclause 30 (2) provides that a person who has reached the age of 65 cannot be appointed as a director of the museum; nor can anyone who is appointed director have the term of that appointment continue beyond the time when he will turn 65 years. This is a clear example of age discrimination which is completely unacceptable to the Opposition. In this day and age, I find such a reference to age grossly offensive; more than that, the nation simply cannot stand by and watch age used as a barrier to employment. With the ageing of Australia's population, we need people to remain in the work force and to remain productive as long as possible. Therefore, the Opposition wants to see clause 30 struck out of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from advice we have had from the Government that that in turn creates difficulties with regard to the Comcare legislation, in terms of the capacity of Comcare to cover staff of statutory authorities beyond the age of 65. The Comcare legislation will therefore require amendment to take account of that. That is why, rather than seek to move this amendment in the Committee of the Whole, we will seek the reference of this Bill to the legislative and general purpose standing committee that is relevant for its consideration. I understand that the Government has agreed to that. We hope that from that committee consideration appropriate decisions will be taken which will allow this clause to be removed from the legislation so that age does not remain a barrier to appointment to the position of director of the museum. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has a very firm policy with regard to age discrimination and indicated in our policy on aged people at the last election that we would in fact legislate to prevent age alone being a bar to employment. It is a very important issue to us, and we hope that the legislation will be appropriately amended and that any consequential amendments to other legislation will be initiated. </PARA>
<PARA> When the museum does finally open, the problems that I have already detailed with regard to its establishment will continue in other forms. We have had difficulties with funding not only the construction of the project but also its continuing operation because the initial funds that it was expected would be provided for the continuing operation of the museum have been severely cut.</PARA>
<PARA> That has resulted in there being no facilities for staff or for storage, no library and no room available in the museum for volunteer attendants. It also means that space that was to have been used originally as the education area has had to be given over to house the United States-Australia Gallery as a result of what one must say is certainly a very welcome gift from the United States-a bicentennial gift of $6.25m to establish this gallery of the history of Australia-United States maritime links. Certainly that will be of benefit to the museum, but it should not have been done at the expense of education facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It also needs to be recognised that while we do have some historical maritime links with the United States, we have perhaps more important maritime links with Britain, the Netherlands or even with France. Yet, in the objectives of the museum, only the link with the United States is mentioned. It appears that only that link will receive attention in the museum's exhibits-certainly in terms of any special treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people who are experienced in this area believe that when the museum does open, in many respects it will be in an almost unworkable situation. The Government has determined it is going to be an exhibition-oriented institution rather than a national collecting institution, and one can question the validity of that decision. However, the major crisis facing the museum is one of staffing. Most visitors to museums only see the attendants, but the effectiveness of museums is determined by the backroom staff, by the curators, by the education officers, by the conservators, and by the administration staff. </PARA>
<PARA> A letter from the former Minister, Mr Punch, confirms that staffing for this museum, originally expected to be 110, will in fact be cut back to something like 75. That will create extreme difficulties for the operation of this museum particularly with regard to collection management. It means that some conservation activities on the part of the museum will have to be contracted out, which in the long term could well prove to be more expensive than retaining staff. It is, as I understand it, proposed to reduce curatorial staff from 16 to just four, and that underlines the mismanagement of the development of this project. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue of controversy has been the relationship between this national maritime museum and the Sydney Maritime Museum. On the one hand, it seems that even despite these cuts in funding we have the national maritime museum with still some considerable funding but no ships. On the other hand, we have the Sydney Maritime Museum, which is a community based museum, with a significant number of historic ships but very little in the way of funds. Negotiations between these two bodies have been conducted over the last few years without any successful agreement being reached in terms of either the capacity of the national maritime museum to take over the exhibits of the Sydney Maritime Museum by paying a reasonable price for those ships which the Sydney Maritime Museum holds, or leasing those exhibits so that all of the maritime history of Australia could be collected in one central location. I believe that is also certainly a shortcoming with regard to the development of this museum. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, the development of this project has been a very sorry saga indeed. Let us hope that after the passage of this legislation that sorry saga will not continue, that this museum will develop on a very positive basis henceforth and provide the benefit to the Australian community of which such a project is capable. The issue raises very serious questions about the competence of both this Government and the Wran Labor Government in New South Wales. It raises very serious questions about the bona fides of this Government in terms of its relationship with State governments. Those are questions that really need to be addressed. Let us hope that with the passage of this legislation the museum can develop on a much more positive basis than has been the case up to now. It is on that basis that the coalition will support the legislation with the reservation that we will have it referred to the relevant legislative and general purpose standing committee for consideration of the age discrimination issue. Let us hope that when the legislation comes back for further consideration in this chamber that factor has been properly dealt with and that will no longer be a barrier to our support to the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Bourne for allowing me to speak ahead of her on the speakers list. I want to support Senator Chapman on this matter concerning the Australian National Maritime Museum. It is a matter of great regret that such an outstanding project should be such a political creature. It was generated in a political environment to serve the requirements, both of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran. Having been born out of political expediency it has suffered through its life the turmoil that one would expect of such an illegitimate child. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 October 1988 said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian National Maritime Museum is a creature of politics. It was created as an election ploy and was from the outset manipulated to further political ends. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt about that. When Neville Wran went to the polls in March 1984, before this specific proposal came up, the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, had promised him $30m for a maritime museum. What a remarkable coincidence that that happened to be the amount that was eventually agreed to with the State of New South Wales a couple of years later when this particular project came up. It is an amount which is totally and grossly inadequate and which was based on some sketches in an agreement between Mr Laurie Brereton, the then Labor Minister for Public Works in New South Wales, and Mr Barry Cohen, the then Minister for the Arts. </PARA>
<PARA> That agreement was an appallingly bad one between two parts of one Party-the Labor Government of New South Wales and the Labor Government in Canberra. That hopelessly bad deal bore no relation to practicality, no relation to the likely costs and no relation to anything except the politics and the political benefits that would come from doing something that was sensible and which should have been done properly, decently and honourably, not with the taint and smear of political expediency associated with this project. We even had, as its first director, Mr Barry Cohen's senior private secretary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, another job for the boys. The matter proceeded without any legislative backing. The Advance to the Minister for Finance was the basis from which this thing got under way before there was even any legislative support for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This whole project has been a political creature and as a result it has suffered. The sacking of key members of the board was in my view indefensible. I do not want to personally criticise Peter Doyle. While it is true that he is a mate of the Prime Minister, he is also a mate of mine, a good bloke. I cannot justify in any way the sacking of the previous people on that board who, as Senator Chapman said, had particular skills or particular involvement in the whole concept. The sacking ofAndrew Robertson in particular, the retired Rear Admiral, was appalling. I also have the highest regard for Alex Dix, who was sacked. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the replacement of those people, particularly with Trish Kavanagh, to be an unfortunate decision. I have a high regard for her personally. But she is Mr Laurie Brereton's wife. To think that the man who was specifically responsible for this political stunt, who created the open cheque that the New South Wales Government had to meet without the support of the Federal Government, should have his influence maintained in that place indirectly, and perhaps modestly, by the capacity at least to talk to his wife about these matters, seems to me to be a disgrace. Laurie Brereton has cost the New South Wales State Government $40m for a Commonwealth project for which the Commonwealth claims the credit and which the Commonwealth will run as a Commonwealth operation. The State Government puts in $40m, provides all the land for $1 a year rent, and the Federal Government, having put in $30m, claims the project. The taxpayers of New South Wales have every right to say, `Thank you, Mr Brereton'. His influence-that monumentally incompetent influence-is maintained in that project, at least at one remove, by having his wife on the board. It is an extraordinary situation. </PARA>
<PARA> While politics triumphs, what happens to the museum itself? I think that that is one of the scandalous things that has happened. It might seem curious to raise this matter, but our standing in New York among donors to projects and among people who are sympathetic to Australia, has suffered severely as a result of the fiasco of this museum. It was supposed to open during the Bicentenary. Two years later we are still mucking around. It will not open until next year. The handover from the State Government to the Federal Government, which will enable it to formally get under way, will not take place until September or so of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> This delay has been basically as a result of this dispute between the State and Federal governments about who should pick up the bill. Honourable senators have heard from Senator Chapman about the blackmail, standover tactics and dishonourable behaviour of the Federal Government in this matter-the Federal Government which keeps calling on the States to exercise financial discipline. The Hawke Government pats itself on the back saying how restrained it is and how profligate and disgraceful the State governments are. By having a look at this deal, we can find out why the State governments have to hit the can, have to pay the bills that quite properly belong to the Federal Government anyway. The sort of hypocrisy involved in the Federal Government's approach to this matter is, I believe, disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Liberal State Government and the taxpayers of New South Wales have been left carrying the can for this Federal project because, firstly, Laurie Brereton did not give a damn about the terms of the deal--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Brereton did not give a damn what the details were when he signed this deal; all he wanted, and all Mr Wran wanted, was the pre-election political benefit of having this very good project proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of that recklessness, we now have had this major delay, this major problem. There were other factors in the delay-for example, industrial disputes-even though we understand that at the time Mr Brereton and the other members of the New South Wales Government did a deal with those very honourable people, the Builders Labourers Federation, to ensure that the matter went ahead, even though at that stage, as I understand it, the Builders Labourers Federation was supposed to have been deregistered by the Federal authorities. They were prepared to lie down with the devil to get this matter to proceed in a chaotic way. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that the New South Wales Government has been forced by circumstance to have to pay the $40m bill that the Federal Government morally, if not legally, should have paid because of the incompetence of Mr Laurie Brereton. In America our standing among the Friends of Australia is very poor. My comment about that comes from first hand experience. The week before last I spoke about this matter to American people in New York who had contributed millions of dollars to this project because it includes a specific gallery relating to the maritime relationships between the United States and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are two years after the time when the museum was supposed to open-and by the time it does open it will be three years-and we still do not have this bicentennial project, which was much touted by the Prime Minister himself when he went to New York. The project is now being seen to have been a child of politics and an item of chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> I only hope that the fact that New South Wales now feels that it must proceed with the matter and pick up the Bill means that people realise that the Federal Government's blackmail and impropriety in dealing with that State has triumphed. I think that the actual words that were used by such gentle, friendly people as the previous Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, in his threatening conversation with the New South Wales Minister, Mr Hay, are well known to this chamber. As Senator Chapman said, the threat clearly was that if New South Wales were to win this battle then the Commonwealth would find other ways of getting its money back. This is just a disgrace. I do not want to pursue this any more because, as I say, I now hope that this maritime museum will proceed and will be the sort of exciting and important part of our heritage that it should always have been instead of, regrettably, having been clouded so far with politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by wishing the museum luck and hoping that out of this mess we will end up with something that Australia will be proud of and that our American colleagues, who have contributed considerable sums to this museum, will be pleased to come and visit. But I do not think the Commonwealth at any stage in the history of this museum has come out with credit. As a taxpayer in New South Wales and as a senator for New South Wales I understand why the State Government had to give way on this matter, pay the $40m and also meet, I think, half of the $3.5m cost relating to defects and completion costs which are to be shared by the Commonwealth and the State. The Commonwealth will meet about, I think, $1.7m of costs of variations. It is not a happy story but let us hope that finally we will have a museum of which we can all be proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the establishment of the Australian National Maritime Museum, of course. The history of this museum, though, has been controversial, and we consider that it will probably continue to be. We, too, suspect that one of the motivations for establishing it has been political but the fact remains that the creation of a national maritime museum is a worthwhile exercise. Australia's maritime heritage is abundant and far-reaching and deserves the recognition that such a museum will provide. If the museum evolves as the legislation describes it, it will be a living, innovative establishment with special provision for children and with its own diverse fleet of ships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is some evidence that the ancient Phoenicians and the Vikings may have visited our shores-and, no doubt, many others-before Dirk Hartog recorded his ship's visit to Shark Bay in Western Australia in the seventeenth century. While we welcome the very generous American bicentennial gift of a gallery of Australia-United States maritime links, we have far stronger maritime links with other countries. They would perhaps be more appropriately displayed in a national maritime museum. </PARA>
<PARA> There has long been a need to preserve maritime artefacts in the national interest. Obviously any museum must have a home, and Sydney Harbour is a most appropriate place for a maritime museum, but we are concerned that proposed section 6 (b) of the Act should be used extensively and that exhibitions from the museum should travel throughout the country so that all Australians should have the benefit of experiencing our maritime heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that the Government's rather ad hoc attitude to the funding of this museum should not mean that the museum does not realise its full potential. We hope the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) will take these concerns on board. Basically, though, we believe that the acquisition, restoration, preservation and display of artefacts and documents related to our maritime heritage is most worth while, and we wish the Bill a speedy passage.

The Bill has already been discussed here by previous speakers who have laid out very clearly the position of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, as this is the first time I have spoken when you have been in the chair, I congratulate you on your appointment. We look forward to this whole chamber and particularly the Committee of the Whole being excellently chaired by you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the Bill that is before us and strongly support the creation of the Australian National Maritime Museum. It will be a valuable acquisition to Australia and to all Australians. Indeed, it will be a very important acquisition internationally. It is a first-class investment by Australia, both in capital terms and in recurrent terms. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues have already referred to political machinations and inefficiencies and overbidding in contracts. I do not wish to place any blessing on those deficiencies when I talk about this being a good investment, but I do not wish to be distracted by the mistakes of the Labor Government in New South Wales, or indeed the present Federal Government, in the conduct of this matter from looking at the broader picture, which is that, fundamentally and money matters aside, this is a very sound investment by Australia. It is one that I very much welcome, as, I am sure, do all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important not only for this generation in this decade but, I believe, for many generations to come. It is to be placed, quite rightly, in the most accessible and enhanced part of Sydney Harbour-Darling Harbour. I still hold the vision in my mind of going to the celebrations in Sydney Harbour on Australia Day 1988. As a South Australian, I freely acknowledge the excitement that I shared with so many thousands from all over this nation at the proper re-enactment of all that we can rightly be proud of in 200 years-Sydney Harbour being the first place of European landing and settlement in Australia-of the use of that excellent port and magnificent city. It is in this place that the national maritime museum is rightly situated. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that, having experience of the South Australian Maritime Museum in my own city of Port Adelaide. Prior to the establishment of this national museum, the South Australian Maritime Museum was established, with good foresight and bipartisan support on the part of the State Parliament. Indeed, the foundation Director of that excellent facility, Dr Kevin Fewster, has already been appointed as Interim Director of the national maritime museum. I have no doubt that, when the Interim Council becomes the full Council by this legislation, he will be endorsed as the continuing Director under the terms set out for the Director of this national maritime museum. Kevin Fewster has a particular personal contribution to make, given his experience in South Australia, his particular accumulation of skills and his knowledge of this whole field, to which I wish to refer in terms of its various parts. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, then, undoubted value in this maritime museum. Let me say why I think that. At least half a dozen themes can rightly be included in a museum of this kind. The first is Aboriginal involvement with the sea. A second is the European voyages of discovery to this country. A third is immigration. Many Australians, until very recently, came here by ship. The transition from their original place of birth to their eventual destiny was by the sea. A fourth theme is commerce and trade. We cannot use the word `trade' without it conjuring notions of ships and of going down to the sea. We have also the theme of the Australian fishing industry, a still underdeveloped but important industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we have the naval defence of this country and all that comes to mind when we think about the long history of the Royal Australian Navy. It is important to understand the role of the Navy in terms of the defence of this country, not only in repelling any future invasion-hopefully, we will not have any such experience-but also in protecting Australian and allied interests on the basis of international law and justice, exemplified in the three ships that are now in the Persian Gulf. We have the traditions of the Navy, but I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA> Another theme is leisure and sport. I know that athletics, football, tennis and hobbies, such as art and photography, have been enthusiastically pursued by many generations of Australians. Other popular leisure activities include water sports, such as sailing, swimming, surfing, surf lifesaving and even the completely aimless activity of mucking about in boats. There ought to be a place such as the national museum in which Australians can record and celebrate their involvement in such activities. These themes will be incorporated into this national maritime museum. </PARA>
<PARA> Tens of millions of dollars have been invested in the museum. The museum will be constantly available to the public. It will be, of course, a major tourist attraction for international visitors as well. I have a vision of this museum being not only a great national asset but one that will rival any other such institution in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this museum, which is being created in formal terms by this legislation, has the prospect of being the best maritime museum in the world. It will be located in one of the finest harbours in the world-Sydney Harbour. I note that already a great deal of planning has gone into this museum which, I trust, will be opened before the end of this year. But before this can happen, this legislation has to be adopted by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues who have spoken before me have already talked about the most unfortunate political situation that has delayed the start of this building and the acquisition of exhibits for display. I do not need to repeat the summaries that Senator Chapman and Senator Michael Baume have already given. Rather, I will concentrate on the positives of the present and the positives of the future. I want to ensure that in this debate we do not overlook the really fundamental perspective-that by passing this legislation we will be establishing a major national asset. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to recognise the fact that Dr Kevin Fewster, the deputy directors, Gavin Fry and Quentin Howarth, and all of the staff of the museum, have, on an interim basis, made very careful plans not only for what will be exhibited and where it will be placed in the many spaces that will be available in the building but also for the design detail of these displays and how they will be sold to the public. I wish them every success in putting those well-made plans into place. As we see these plans taking shape there will be considerable excitement for them and for all of us who have an interest in this museum. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly outlined earlier some of the themes that will be exhibited in this museum. We cannot do enough to excite Australians-not just Australian school children but adults of all ages as well-about the original Aboriginal involvement with the sea. I refer here to Aboriginal craft and fishing as well as maritime food sources, knowledge and language. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot excite Australians enough about the history of the discovery of Australia-the voyages across the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean; the voyages from various European points of departure to Indonesia which instead reached our coast. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians need to know more about the voyages that were undertaken to India, South East Asia and the Far East. They need to know why some of the Polynesian and Melanesian islands were given such religious and exotic names. The museum will help us understand more about navigation and ship design. We will be able to learn about the actual sequence of events that led to Australia's discovery and settlement in the context of all the other nations in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, at the pinnacle of this aspect of our history is Captain James Cook. Although Cook is well known to all school children and indeed, every Australian, he is still little understood. My good friend, Sir Geoffrey Badger, a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, quite recently wrote an excellent book about the discovery of islands in the Pacific. The core chapters in this book are about Cook. I am proud that the museum will concentrate on this area of our history in terms of European voyages of discovery. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to immigration, we ought to see exhibits on the theme of convict transportation to Australia, as well as the free settlers who pioneered this country. What was their experience as they travelled to Australia by sea? What about sponsored immigrants, particularly following the Second World War? What were their hopes and aspirations for a new land, for a new discovery and for new prosperity? Even more recently, the tragedy of Indo-China has led many, at the risk of their lives, to flee communism and other evils as boat people and come to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not say more about commerce and trade or the Australian fishing industry. But I wish to make one further reference to the Royal Australian Navy. It has already been acknowledged that a major impetus to the establishment of this Museum has come from the Australian Navy itself. The Royal Australian Navy, which has a proud tradition, has, over many decades, kept many items of historic significance. </PARA>
<PARA> A great proportion-I believe the heart-of this collection is being given for safekeeping to the maritime museum. I am sure that in the decades ahead every serving seaman and officer in the Australian Navy will be frequent visitors to this museum. The museum will provide a link between their current experiences in serving this country and the past and this will reinforce the traditions which are proudly held by the Navy and by all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to leisure and sport, those of us who find pleasure in sailing competitively, such as my wife, my children and many of my friends-whether it be in mirrors, sharpies, herons or one of the other 50 classes of competitive yachts sailing on our bays, inland waterways and lakes-will be able to use the museum as a point of reference to see historic yachts exhibited. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the most famous competitive yacht that brought considerable fame and glory to this country in the America's Cup 12-metre class, about which we were all so excited in 1983, will be exhibited in the museum at Darling Harbour. I note that the United States, as its major gift to us in celebrating our Bicentenary in 1988, gave us many items of significance that illustrate the naval or marine connections between our two countries. The United States' gift will be, I understand, a permanent gallery in the maritime museum. </PARA>
<PARA> Also New Zealand gave to us a gift of a yacht, the Akarana. I have been happy to inspect this yacht. It is beautiful to look at. It is built in the old style and, moreover, it was rigged in 1888-exactly 100 years before our Bicentenary. It has been completely refitted, is in total working order and sails on a monthly basis at least on Sydney Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may express one small personal aspiration, I hope I might be amongst the crew on Akarana one day. It is certainly a bicentennial gift from New Zealand that we treasure, and it is one that I am sure the National Maritime Museum will look after most carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a wider number of items in the fleet. This is not just a static museum; it is a fleet which includes a destroyer, Vampire; it includes a patrol boat, Advance; it includes the very important World War II commando raider, Krait, which was working behind Japanese lines near Singapore in the 1940s. I have been happy to see these vessels and to know that they are in the keeping of the National Maritime Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a traditional Indonesian sailing boat, the Sekar Aman; we have a refugee-carrying fishing boat, the Hong Hai; and I have already referred to the 12-metre yacht, Australia II, and to the New Zealand 1888 gaff-rigged racing cutter Akarana. I will refer to just one more boat and that is literally the world's fastest boat. It happens to have been made by an Australian and driven by an Australian. It is, of course, the jet-powered Spirit of Australia. This boat is not only the fastest boat in the world, but was built by the individual hard work of an Australian in his backyard. I think that it is a point of inspiration for all Australians to be able to come to such a collection of items that relate to the sea, and then to find that there is virtually a whole harbour full of actual boats of particular significance. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in the tenth edition of the interim Maritime Museum's quarterly newsletter Signals, No. 9, the Director, Kevin Fewster, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Museum has many programs being developed on what has always been a very tight schedule, but people here are working very hard towards that great day when we open our doors to the public. Everyone has in mind the key objective, and I know we will get there with a product of which we all are very proud. </PARA>
<PARA>I might appear to be a publicist for what is one of the great acquisitions for all Australians, the national maritime museum, and I accept the charge. I am enthusiastic about this centre, and I note that the enthusiasm is shared by all those that I know who are connected with any of the seven or eight themes relating to maritime matters to which I have already referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear that in respect of the Director, deputy directors and staff of the interim museum there has been no involvement in the political machinations that have gone on about the building or in the financial disputes between the Australian Government and especially the former Labor Government of New South Wales. I wish to free them from any of the taints and accusations that have so much stalled the beginning of this very important venture. I also want to place very clearly in this debate a record of their personal and professional enthusiasm for getting this museum as quickly as possible into a completed state. They just need the key to open the front door and they will be, I believe, serving us all very well in a professional capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In my remaining few remarks I wish to have it noted that the legislation that is before us provides sensible flexibility with regard to the museum's commercial arrangements. There are powers set out for the museum, that are in the hands of the Council, to make contracts, to determine all manner of direct commercial arrangements for the operation of the museum with standard formulae. But I note that there is flexibility for the museum itself to contract research and for the museum, through having an acquisition annual budget, to recover items of significance to our maritime history. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish it to be seen that, as long as there is full accountability and as long as there is full sensible subscription to a three-year plan and to annual working plans, there ought not to be any sense of bureaucracy impeding the entrepreneurial initiatives that the Director and others on the staff and Council of this museum can take up on behalf of all Australians. I, of course, highlight the provision in the legislation-not as some administrative order-for a three-year strategic plan and for annual operational plans that will be approved by the Minister, tabled in parliament and subject to continuing monitoring and comment by elected members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I also foresee an involvement with private sector partners. I believe that it is in the very spirit of Sydney that entrepreneurs can work in tandem with the maritime museum. For example, harbour tours might leave from the museum waterfront and visit parts of the harbour, traverse under the Sydney Harbour Bridge and visit even at least some small part of Kirribilli-at least some small part of Kirribilli that they may have access to-and the museum's cross-harbour moorings near North Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I encourage the museum, right from the outset, to call for bids of interest and to explore possible contracts with independent operators who could take up this advantage, so that visitors to the museum could spend their time looking at the various shapes and sizes of exhibits. They could then board a collateral entrepreneur's boat at regular times for a valuable additional insight into the harbour and items of significance on the harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that this is not to be a static museum, but hands-on-participatory. It is to be dynamic, in the best tradition of anything that has begun in the area of museums in the 1990s. I wish to encourage this participatory collection. Wherever possible, visitors-especially young Australians, school children-when they go to the museum should not just to be told, `Don't touch. Walk only on this line. This is only for you to see'. We should maximise what visitors can actually handle and participate in, and so gain all the more enrichment, enjoyment and involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore conclude most happily by commending this legislation, of course with the Committee reference and the amendments that my colleagues have referred to that would improve the legislation. I believe this will result in a magnificent new acquisition for all Australians. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the speeches in this second reading debate to some extent in reverse order. First of all, I thank and congratulate Senator Teague for his very positive contribution to the debate. It was a welcome contribution and I make only one particular comment on it, which is to share his views about the Akarana. I had the great pleasure of welcoming it to Canberra on behalf of the Australian Government, and it looked great on the lake. I was upset that it was taken away and put back on that other lake in Sydney. That disappointed me because it would have been a substantial contribution. I welcome the things which Senator Teague had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chapman and Senator Michael Baume raised a number of other matters, most of which are on the record. They have spoken about them and their rhetorical flourishes are recorded for posterity. But there are some matters of substance to which I think I should respond in the reasonable manner in which they raised them. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the finances of the building, I should say for the record that settlement has now been reached on funding the completion of the building. The sum of $2.04m was provided in the current Budget as the Commonwealth's contribution for completion and rectification of the building. That is now a settled question. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chapman raised some concerns about the potential problem with storage facilities in the new building. Perhaps I should advise him that the Australian National Maritime Museum's administrative headquarters is only 100 metres away from the new building. That will be housing staff, the library and conservation and storage of the collection, so there is a separate and adequate arrangement for that. </PARA>
<PARA> He made some points about staffing. I should simply point out for the information of the Senate that the curatorial staff is, in fact, 10 and not four. With the number and quality of those people there will be a strong intellectual core. While continuing to meet the Government's priority, it has been made clear by the Government that it will be primarily an exhibiting institution and will have a substantial exhibition role. </PARA>
<PARA> I also would not want an impression to be left that there is some spirit of conflict between the Sydney Maritime Museum and the new Australian National Maritime Museum. The current relationship, as I am advised, is harmonious. In fact, negotiations are very well advanced on agreement on display arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I was concerned about one of Senator Michael Baume's remarks not about the project itself but about problems in the United States (US) of America in terms of attitude to the project. I am assured that cooperation continues to be excellent with the United States. United States institutions have been willing to contribute display items for the United States gallery. There is a consultative committee on which the US Consul-General is represented and, through this, the US Government is being kept informed of developments regarding the Museum. There are also close and direct links already established with the US Information Agency Exhibits Service, which is providing valuable support. While I am sure that Senator Michael Baume has met with some individuals who have expressed concern-I am sure he would not raise that matter lightly-broadly, I think the level of relationship remains positive and good. </PARA>
<PARA> I endorse the remarks that Senator Michael Baume made about the challenges which have been met by the staff in developing this museum and, like him and all other senators, I thank those staff for their excellent contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also say something about Senator Bourne's contribution. She might have set an example for other senators. She worked out what she wanted to say, she said it and then she finished. It may have taken some of her colleagues by surprise because it is not something which is common. I hope it is not a habit she loses through experience. I hope that she does not learn some of the less precise and concise habits of some of her colleagues, and certainly not some of her erstwhile colleagues from the Australian Democrats who might have been renowned for going on a little longer. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also make a comment about an important matter. Although it is not important in the second reading debate, it is the one outstanding area of amendment about the problem of the age limit. I note that that is a matter that will properly be discussed in the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. It will be interesting for me to be associated, for the first time, with a Bill about to go through that process, and I hope it proves to be very worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply comment that I note the views expressed by Senator Chapman. The legislative and general purposes committee is the appropriate place to deal with the substance but, having noted his views, I simply want to say on behalf of the Government that, as he raises a very important issue about age discrimination, I do not want to deal with it lightly. We also do not wish to deal with it in an ad hoc way. It is not a matter that is unique to this Bill. It is a very broad question of government policy. It has been a policy of all governments of both political persuasions for a long time. That does not mean it should not be changed; it simply means that the change needs to be studied and planned and the implications considered before changes are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> There are reasonable arguments for the point of view which Senator Chapman put. The Government would not like to see changes made in a short term, ad hoc manner simply by an amendment to the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill. Rather, there should be a more broad and comprehensive approach. I thank honourable senators for their contributions and for their support for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Budget that was brought down by the Government this week I wish to make a few comments about how I believe it was wrongly formulated and has a poor basis for its calculation. It may sound rather trite to be stating that this Budget is being received at a time of grave difficulty and uncertainty for Australia, but it is the truth and simply cannot be emphasised enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is equally important to recognise that the fallout from the Middle East crisis worsens, but in no way causes, the underlying problems that we are experiencing today. The central economic fact facing Australia today is the failure of the policies of the Hawke Labor Government. The runs are simply not on the board, and the predictions are not coming right. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the eighth Budget that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, has put down for the Hawke Labor Government and it will be the eighth time that he has got the figures wrong. He has got the figures wrong for the last seven consecutive Budgets, and there is no indication whatsoever in this Budget that he will be right on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking back to a current account debt of $21 billion for 1989-90, predicted by the Treasurer 12 months ago to be $18 billion. A combined external debt of $156 billion, five times that of 1983, requires 29 per cent of our export returns simply to service it. That also translates as a payment of $25 per month from each Australian family. </PARA>
<PARA> We all well know that Australian families can afford no more under this Government; they are stretched to the limit. Businesses and private individuals are going to the wall at unprecedented rates. Australians can simply have no confidence that this tired Government is displaying the political will, let alone the track record, to shift more national effort into exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The only tool of economic management that the Treasurer seems to understand is manipulation of interest rates. Even now, when interest rates have been pegged back, the real interest rate against inflation has not fallen one jot. This Labor Government has never seemed to appreciate the importance of getting down inflation to make Australia more competitive. A rate of 7.7 per cent in the June quarter of 1990 has to be compared with 2.3 per cent in Germany, 2.5 per cent in Japan and 4.4 per cent in the United States of America. By any comparison we are performing badly. </PARA>
<PARA> As we digest the latest predictions of the Treasurer, we should remember that two years ago he was confident of a 3 to 4 per cent inflation rate by 1990. Our current rate of 7.7 per cent is no better than that for the same time last year and a 6 per cent rate is all we can dare hope for under this Government. That is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want grim proof of what is happening to the Australian economy, we need refer only to the bankruptcy statistics for the past financial year. With 9,131 bankruptcies, we are suffering an 11 per cent increase on 1988-89. There were 1,195 bankruptcies in Western Australia-a rise of 34 per cent on the last year. And the Treasurer has the audacity to tell us that they are a lovely set of figures and that Australia is on track. As I have said before, Labor's policies work even better in the west! The June quarter showed a 26 per cent rise in bankruptcies over the previous 12 months with a 56 per cent rise in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures speak for themselves. This is not a case of an Opposition criticising for the sake of criticising; these are the figures and they cannot be disputed. </PARA>
<PARA> The same evidence of failure emerges from the decline over the past 12 months of 8 per cent in total private investment and a decline of 13 per cent in investment in plant and equipment. When investment levels drop over four successive quarters we have a major problem, but one that this Government has not been anxious to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes back to the central problem of the need for export productivity. Levels of investment in tradeable commodities are below 50 per cent, compared with 58 per cent when this Government took office in 1983. Whereas in the years from 1963 to 1983 the level of investment in export and export competing industries was 60 per cent, it has held at 51 per cent under the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government cannot evade the criticism made by such former senior advisers as Mr David Charles and Mr David Morgan. On 2 July Mr Charles stated that unless Australia moved away from its mistaken macro-economic policy of high interest rates, any micro-economic reforms would be negated. Mr Morgan also has flatly contradicted the Treasurer's excuse that the flood of imports is being caused by massive industry re-equipment. That is simply not true. The figures I have cited in regard to declining investment also make that fact obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of a Treasurer who is prepared to be unpopular through taking hard decisions, we simply have a Prime Minister-in-waiting who uses VIP aircraft to sustain a new-found interest in Australian Rules football and who centralises the pre-Budget lockup in Canberra so that the media are subject to the maximum of personalised disinformation. </PARA>
<PARA> In these tough economic times, the Treasurer should not be flaunting his entitlement to take a plane load of journalists to a football match. Many people in this country are going bankrupt. Many people are losing their jobs because of this Government's economic policies. Yet the Treasurer has the audacity to take a VIP aircraft from Canberra to Melbourne and back so that he can watch a game of football. </PARA>
<PARA> With the drift of Labor policy and leadership, it is significant that on 14 August one of Australia's greatest experts on public opinion, Mr Gary Morgan, called for an end to the `government by public opinion' that has contributed to economic difficulties. But no, this Government will continue to govern by the polls. </PARA>
<PARA> What the public expects from the Federal Government is action on its major concerns. As measured last June, seven of the 10 nominated areas were economic. It is in the hands of the Treasurer to take the tough decisions, but sadly he will not. Australians want their representatives to take the hard decisions but that is not what they are getting from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government has come to this Budget with a recent track record of cynical populist decisions that had everything to do with winning votes and nothing to do with economic consequences. They had everything to do with making sure that preferences were transferred from the Greens. Yet, what is happening as a consequence? The Greens have been jettisoned, too. There has been the ducking and diving over Coronation Hill, where yet another inquiry was called thus preventing any possible mineral exploitation. Study after study has been undertaken not so much to protect the environment but to gather those Green preferences that got this Government so surprisingly into office in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The refusal to allow the merger of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd was a convenient exercise in business bashing to reassure the Labor faithful, but the effect will have been to hamper our national effort to achieve competitiveness in finance on the world stage. Australia invariably loses from this cynical, ad hoc process. Australians do not need to be told; they now know that. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest Keating Budget is very much the product of a Prime Minister-in-waiting, who may pose as being tough and responsible-he tries hard at that but fails-but who neglects to take action against the real problems that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the action that will encourage business investment, that will provide Australians with the incentive to save, and that will lead to smaller and cheaper government? Underneath the rhetoric of self-congratulation, this is simply a do-nothing Budget of a Government running out of coverage, shocked to the bootstraps that it is back in office. It has run out of any vision. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), when asked on radio the other morning what his vision for Australia was, had to admit that he did not really know. He has lost any vision for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; it is a shocking admission. That is the reality and that is what we are seeing in this Budget-a government absolutely paralysed. It has been well said that if there are many bouts to fight to solve Australia's economic problems, the Hawke Labor Government is still cowering in the dressing-room.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are no real prospects of lasting relief from interest rates with a 6 per cent inflation rate. The saving to revenue that may be achieved by forcing pensioners off low interest bearing bank accounts may well prevent bank interest rates from falling through the loss of bank profits. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has always welcomed a Budget surplus, but we recognise that last year's prediction was trimmed back by $1 billion and the actual surplus was $8,045m. This shortfall was caused by an additional $500m in outlays and $400m in lost revenue through failure to ensure the proper drafting of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. We constantly see problems flowing from poor drafting of legislation and this is but another example. We can have no confidence that mistakes and pressures similar to those that I have outlined will not occur in 1990-91. Indeed, once we take away the profits of asset sales and some manipulation of State debt financing, we are looking at a real Budget surplus of $6 billion rather than the $8.1 billion that the Treasurer is quoting. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic indicators quietly spell out the failure of this Labor Government to take action. Business investment in 1990-91 will fall by 7.25 per cent and there will be a further fall in the household savings ratio. So much for the constant assurances from the Treasurer that the Government's economic policy is working. Once again, we are flying on a wing and a prayer with the prediction of a current account deficit of $18 billion for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> More Australians are realising that even if another blow-out does not occur, the bottom line still points to our debt problem increasing. We will be lucky to keep inflation down to the predicted 6 per cent-double that of all our significant trading partners-as long as this Labor Government ties itself to its political masters, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the accord that still divorces wage outcomes from the essential yardstick of productivity. Despite the trumpeting of savings in the field of welfare, spending in this area will still rise by 12.3 per cent. The reality is that Australia continues to have a big spending government with a real expenditure increase of 0.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians will have every right to be cynical about calls for restraint, and the tightening of benefits, when this Government can still find $2m in order to promote some kind of Aboriginal compact. There is always money in the can if the Government particularly wants to do something. But, unfortunately, the reality is that the Government cannot find the money for those who need it. That is what we are talking about; that is the difference. We are talking about proper targeting of money. We are not talking about taking money from people who need it. This Government has the capacity to find money to dish out to any special interest group. With regard to the Aboriginal compact, if the Government actually sought consultation with the Aboriginal communities, it would know that those communities do not want this compact in any way, shape or form. </PARA>

The first question, which came from Senator Kemp, related to the Government's and my knowledge of the situation at Pyramid prior to the statement of the two Victorian Ministers on 13 February. The part of Senator Kemp's question to which I will refer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Was he-</PARA>
<PARA>that means me-</PARA>
<PARA>or the Government aware of the financial difficulties of Pyramid prior to 13 February, and was he aware in advance that this press statement was to be issued?</PARA>
<PARA>I said that the answer to both parts of the question was no. I was not aware prior to 13 February of the financial difficulties of Pyramid, nor was I aware in advance that the press statement was to be issued. On Wednesday morning I received advice from an officer in the Treasurer's office that prior to 13 February the Treasurer was not aware of those matters either. In the other place the Treasurer said that as the Pyramid saga unfolded-I forget the exact terminology-he was kept informed.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer that I gave to Senator Kemp's question-if the question related to the Government in terms of Ministers; and that is how I interpreted it-was correct. That is to say, prior to 13 February neither I nor the Treasurer were aware of the financial difficulties of Pyramid as they unfolded, nor were we aware that the Victorian Ministers intended to make a statement or of the contents of that statement.</PARA>
<PARA> Last night in the Senate the conspiracy theory was unfolded by Senator Michael Baume, amongst others. He claimed that this was all a ploy by the Government to get the Victorian Ministers to make a statement because at some stage there would be a Federal election. That conspiracy theory also included a careful misreading of my pecuniary interest statement, which I thought added nought to it!</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that on the weekend prior to the statement by the Ministers in Victoria on 13 February there were statements in the newspapers about the financial situation of Pyramid. I think we are all aware of that. There was all sorts of scuttlebutt about Pyramid in Victoria. There were some references in the newspapers, prior to 13 February, about the situation with Pyramid. There were newspaper reports about the situation of Pyramid on that weekend. Advice of those press reports was given by Treasury to the Treasurer's office, but at no time was the Treasurer aware of that situation.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Devereux's question starts by referring to the Pappas Carter report on manufacturing industry in Australia. It raises a number of issues relating to that report and, indeed, the question relating to productivity and quality in Australian manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> In this place on 9 May I answered a question from Senator Short. I guess the question was couched in terms of the absence of a consumption tax and the effects of the wholesale tax system on manufacturing exporters-an issue which was raised in the context of the report of Professor Helen Hughes. In that report, Professor Hughes drew attention to the fact that the wholesale tax system did impose a burden on manufacturing exports because of the cost of inputs which was added to by the wholesale sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> I said in answer to Senator Short's question that the Treasurer had agreed to look at the effect of wholesale sales tax arrangements on our export industries. The Treasurer specifically referred to this issue in his speech to the National Press Club on that same day, 9 May. In that speech he noted concerns that incomplete relief for sales tax paid on inputs could result in some manufacturers paying multiple taxation. That burden has been variously estimated as being between 2 and 6 per cent in terms of the tax burden on manufacturing exports.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Budget, manufacturers will be able to claim exemption from the 20 per cent tax on almost all computers and computerised hardware used in the manufacturing process. Software is already exempt. Many leading Australian manufacturers have already computerised their design and production techniques quite dramatically, reducing the time it takes to get new products to the market. Without such technologies some of the successes of Australian industry would not be in the position they are today.</PARA>
<PARA> The new exemption covers computers, plotters, scanners and other peripherals. It honours the commitment made by the Treasurer on 9 May to extend exemptions beyond equipment used directly in the production process. The cost to revenue of that item in the Budget is some $40m in this financial year and $70m in a full financial year. The return of that expenditure, or loss of revenue, to the Commonwealth will be of enormous benefit to Australian industry and our export strategy. It will particularly be of benefit to those firms which have accepted the challenge of modern production techniques.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fortunately, all the pensioners so affected would have got adequate compensation over the course of the year. The difficulty is that some of them-those who have to spend the $130 to get to the safety net early-would have to have spent that money in three months even though we compensate them over 12 months. This has caused some concern to pensioners around Australia. It is not a problem which the Government did not foresee. The difficulty has always been finding a way of identifying the pensioners so affected, verifying that their claim is just and, further, finding a method of payment to them which does not offend the rest of the pensioners who do not receive the advantage of an up front payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We were unable to come up early enough with a method of compensating pensioners so affected. However, given the discussions of the last few days and the concerns expressed so eloquently by some of the pensioners and beneficiaries so affected, we have undertaken to have a further look to see whether there is any other way. Just because it could not be found the first time does not mean that the Government might not be able to find it a second time. That can be done without having to unravel the Budget and without having to have any great effect on the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA> We are looking, beyond the Department of Social Security, at what other methods might be used. In fact, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, has had some discussions with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, and there will be further discussions next week. There may be a way that pensioners who regularly visit a particular pharmacist and, therefore, have established that chronically ill pattern could be able to get credit from that pharmacist and some form of reimbursement could be made to the pharmacist.</PARA>
<PARA> Those discussions will take place next week, and I am very hopeful that the Government can come up with a way of satisfying the legitimate concerns of a lot of people without any undue delay. So I undertake to report back to Senator Loosely and, indeed, all honourable senators when the Senate resumes in two weeks time. I will report the progress that the Government has had on meeting what is a genuine concern and a genuine need remembering, of course, that over the course of the year not one pensioner was to suffer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of allegations that the death of some 7,000 penguins on Macquarie Island some time in the period 28 May to 11 June 1990 has been linked to a Hercules flight which occurred on 30 May 1990. Hercules flights to Macquarie Island are normally conducted three times a year to provide air drops of food and other supplies to the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition base, and also to conduct any aerial survey work required by ANARE or the Tasmanian Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Heritage. The flights are provided free of charge from the squadron training hours. Several previous flights have been tasked by ANARE to deliberately overfly penguin colonies to enable census photographs to be taken. No incidents have occurred in the 10-year period in which these flights have taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The alleged incident on 30 May was fully investigated, under the Defence Force Discipline Act, by the RAAF Air Commander and it was found that there was no case to answer. The particular aircraft in question overflew land only at the drop zone at the ANARE base on the north end of the island, 25 kilometres from the incident. Due to strong westerly winds and turbulence the aircraft was at least one mile seaward and down wind of the incident site. A previous director of ANARE, Mr Phillip Law, has supported the RAAF investigation and has stated that he is aware such incidents have occurred when rough weather has forced penguins to crush against cliffs to escape winds and waves. Neither I nor the RAAF would wish to prolong the issue by engaging in a public debate over the results of the investigation. While there is any doubt regarding the role of the RAAF in the penguin deaths, I am inclined to defer any further Hercules flights to that region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Maguire has, of course, specialised over a number of years in dealing in State matters and has been involved in some extensive research to come up with some very penetrating questions in this area. The Government has demonstrated a commitment to diversify defence projects around various States and that is really for the benefit of local industry, and local employment, because many of these contracts are still being developed. I prefer not to go into any specifics about the intended cash commitments in any particular State but rather to indicate broad expenditure projections. This year's defence budget provides $529m for expenditure on the new submarine project during 1990-91. In addition total anticipated expenditure in 1990-91 on the Anzac ship project is $314.5m. In the latter case, some $44m is to be recovered from New Zealand's participation in the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, the split of work between States will vary over the life of any long term project as particular elements are completed and others commence. I am able to say that over $300m of this financial year's expenditure on the Collins project and the Anzac project will go to South Australia, where the projects will be completed. On a personal note, I recently visited the submarine project site in Adelaide. It is a quite magnificent facility, is well managed and is an absolute tribute to Australian effort and endeavour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter to which Senator Giles refers is one that arises from a decision of the Industrial Relations Commission on 26 July this year which was a decision handed down on the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) test case concerning the issue of parental leave. The Senate should recognise that the total amount of leave available to both parents was not increased by the test case-it remains at 52 weeks-the difference being that now it can be shared by both parents. The Government, at the Commission, supported the ACTU claim for parental leave on both efficiency and equity grounds. The Government felt, and still feels, that this will ensure that all workers with family responsibilities will be able to exercise their right to work without discrimination and without conflict between employment and family duties. We also felt that this approach would improve job satisfaction for workers of both sexes and would also, of course, improve the long term retention of skilled workers in the labour force, be they men or women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Giles mentioned that there was a strident response to this decision. The Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) did oppose the ACTU claim on the basis of the high fixed costs associated with the hiring and training of new staff on a temporary basis. The Government's view was, and still is, that as women left the work force for periods of maternity leave, employers were left to bear the costs of hiring and training new staff on a temporary basis. The allowing of both men and women to share parental leave means no added new cost. However, it does mean that the cost to industry can be shared more broadly between employers as women and men now have the opportunity to share the time absent from the work force. The Government also considers that the take-up of parental leave is expected to be low, thus minimising the cost and inconvenience to employers.</PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the decision that should be recognised in this context is that which goes towards freeing up part time work. This part of the decision is likely to increase the rate at which parents do return to employment. As the CAI, in this instance, conceded, the freeing up of part time work provisions and awards is a cost effective and desirable move.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports the move to parental leave. We feel that the decision goes some way towards encouraging increased participation by women in the work force and also enables men to undertake a greater share of child rearing responsibilities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of dementia is one of growing concern in the community. For example, in Tasmania the number of various voluntary organisations and community groups which are engaged in providing services and care, and indeed lobbying on behalf of those suffering from dementia, has increased. Their efforts have been very marked over the last several years. I would imagine that that is why, amongst other things in the Budget the other night, the dementia grants program has expanded from $200,000, covering seven hostels in 1983-84, to a $10.9m program covering 260 hostels providing programs to 4,607 residents. I think honourable senators will agree that that is a very necessary but very welcome expansion of those services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recognition of the increased demand for dementia programs, additional funds have been allocated over the next three financial years to enable expansion of the program. In the 1990-91 financial year, an additional $3.3m has been allocated, taking the total available for dementia grants this year to $14.4m. This will mean that 55 per cent of hostel residents suffering from dementia-that is, approximately 6,000 residents-will be able to participate in the programs that the grants provide. The additional funds allocated in subsequent years will enable the coverage to be maintained at 55 per cent. Applications for new programs submitted by organisations prior to May 1990 will be reassessed shortly with a view to funding them as soon as possible in this financial year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Budget time, when the Budget is the most prominent document dissected and considered, other important documents which are published are sometimes overlooked. Since the Opposition-or the Opposition as it was, before some honourable senators went into the House of Representatives and so on-continually raises the question of productivity in Australia, I thought that it might be helpful and instructive to refer to the Australian Bureau of Statistics discussion paper which was released on Friday 17 August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABS uses the measure of multifactor productivity. It found that multifactor productivity in Australia rose by a strong 4 per cent in 1988-89. The measure of multifactor productivity includes technical progress, improvements in the work force, improvements in management practices and economies of scale-distinct from the somewhat sterile measure of labour productivity.</PARA>
<PARA> Part of the credit for the rise in productivity goes to industry for lifting its investment performance and for restructuring the way in which industries operate at shop floor level. I think it is fair to say, however, that Government policy has been aimed at increasing the productivity of both labour and capital, through award restructuring and training, exposing industry to international markets, the productivity element in the wage system and so on. As an outcome of those factors, productivity in Australia grew strongly throughout the 1980s, although the Opposition-almost alone-continues to assert that productivity growth has been flat.</PARA>
<PARA> The remarkable thing about Australia's productivity performance is that its growth has been strong in the face of a number of factors that usually lower measures of productivity. For example, employment growth in Australia throughout most of the 1980s was very strong, outstripping production growth. This creates the impression that labour productivity is weaker than it really is.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there has been a steady increase in the services sector as a share of gross domestic product. In Australia, the services sector is not measured in the productivity figures. That is, productivity in this sector is defined as zero for statistical purposes in Australia, while other countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development use higher figures based on the output of the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The third important factor in Australia's productivity performance is that wage restraint and the rising cost of capital have led industry to substitute labour for capital goods in the production process, thus dampening the effects of labour productivity growth and raising capital productivity. This is a very important set of statistics, and I commend it to Opposition senators for their weekend reading.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to note that, by definition, generic drugs are required to be of the same quality, have the same active ingredients and do the same job as the brand-name drugs on the market. Of course, they have binding components and colourings which make a difference to the way in which a particular drug is presented to a consumer. But the active ingredients and medical effects are the same as apply to brand-name drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But putting that as a preambular matter, the new policy to which Senator Herron refers is part of a series of initiatives the Government has taken to encourage the growth of the Australian pharmaceutical industry and to develop a pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) which better serves the Australian taxpayer and consumer through the provision of safe, effective and better priced drugs. Under the new pricing policy, the same drugs will continue to be available through the PBS but there will be a charge over and above the basic patient contribution if a higher priced brand is prescribed and dispensed.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there will be always be at least one brand available to consumers for no more than the relevant patient contributions. I am advised that the lower priced brands have undergone rigorous testing to ensure that they are of the same high quality, have the same active ingredients, and do the same job as other brands of the drug. Senator Herron would know that the lower priced brands are already widely used and accepted in Australian hospitals with patients switching satisfactorily to other brands which some doctors in the community may prescribe.</PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that doctors and pharmacists will work together to protect low income patients, especially from having to pay higher prices.

The only worry I initially had on the morale of the ships was quite obviously the fact that at the time we made the decision several people on those ships had to face a court-martial. The allegation was that that may have affected morale on the ships. On the work-up from Sydney to Stirling, any such embryonic problems were ironed out and the morale on the ships is excellent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one on the ships has been informed directly of the operational area. It has been indicated that the most likely operational area will be in zone two, but again that has not been determined. Next week we are going to a meeting of naval nations at which a variety of decisions will be made on operational control and areas of operation. Senator Vallentine raises this sort of classic question. She is really assuming that there is some weapons platform somewhere in the world that is totally invulnerable. I would be interested to hear where it is. Any weapons platform has some vulnerability. What we have said is that although the most likely zone of operation for our ships is within the extreme outer limits of Iraqi air power, there is very little likelihood of its being exercised in that area, and logic suggests that there are far more tempting targets far closer in.</PARA>
<PARA> Within the assets of the Australian Navy these frigates are the ones best served to resist air attack. They have the Phalanx defence system, and a variety of missiles on board. No one can ever assert that any weapons platform is totally invulnerable. I have never really said this before, but I think Senator Vallentine has got together every rotten stinking rumour that is floating around and given it a run here. Had Senator Vallentine followed her normal practice and aired that question a little earlier I might have been able to suggest some changes to it so she did not fall into that trap.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: from every bit of evidence available to me, the morale on the ships is excellent. Not one person was forced to go on these ships. The morale and the working up of the ships has gone exceedingly well. The defence systems on the ships are the best that we have.

That will not be changed. Secondly, they had guidelines issued to them on Wednesday for the rules of engagement. As I have said before, whilst I will not release those publicly they reflect announced Government policy and they reflect what is required under international law. One of the difficulties we have in such an exercise is that many nations are now contributing ships. There will be a need to coordinate their activities. For that purpose, as I indicated partly in an answer to Senator Vallentine earlier, there will be a meeting next week between those naval nations which will determine who operates in which zone and which part of the zone, what the operational coordination will be, who will command, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Ambassador for Disarmament is responsible for pursuing Australia's interests in the negotiation of arms control and disarmament agreements at the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva, as well as pursuing our arms control interests in other international forums, including the relevant organs of the United Nations such as the First Committee and the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

As the honourable senator may know, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is in Geneva today, talking with Ambassador Reese whilst they attend the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I am sure that Senator Evans will be drawing on Ambassador Reese's wisdom and experience in all of his discussions, including those concerned with the Gulfcrisis. In his meetings today with Senator Evans, Ambassador Reese will have ample opportunity to give his views and influence the Minister.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that Australia signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child a couple of nights ago in New York. I believe it is a very significant affirmation by Australia of its willingness to adhere to the principles enshrined in that Convention. Honourable senators will know that the Convention is aimed at a worldwide expression of solidarity with infants, children and teenagers in their securing of those minimum rights which are essential to their very physical well-being and then their maturing and growing within a sociable community, but, of course, with the pre-eminent role being accorded to a family if it is a well functioning unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, we know that even within Australia that is not always the case and in those instances a role for state intervention, as through child welfare and other agencies where the rights of the child are paramount, is an important but, one would hope, minor role of government in relation to the usual way in which children are brought up, certainly in Australia. Worldwide there is no doubt that governments need to be confronted with a benchmark, which this convention is, against which they can be judged in the way in which they relate to children and help secure their upbringing in a sociable way as they mature.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Somebody just interjected about the rights of the parents. The Australian delegation to the various United Nations forums which drew up this particular convention took a leading role and had inserted certain articles and provisions to ensure that the parents, or legal guardians if parents were not available, should take that prior and pre-eminent role and that governments should support parents in that role. For example, the Australian delegation had article 5 inserted, which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents . . . to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights (recognised in the Convention).</PARA>
<PARA>Further, article 19 provides that States which are parties to this particular convention:</PARA>
<PARA>Shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse...</PARA>
<PARA>and make sure that where that occurs in the context of a family that is not functioning well, then certain action can be taken.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst recognising that certain households can break down in their relationships to protecting children, the pre-eminent role of the family is recognised. That would explain why Australian organisations, such as the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, which I believe has as its president Mrs Rosemary Sinclair, have been so supportive of this particular convention, as has the Young Women's Christian Association of New South Wales and the episcopal conference of the Catholic Church here in Australia.</PARA>

Now that the national account figures show us that business investment actually fell by 1.4 per cent in 1989-90, will he finally concede that his earlier estimates-and in fact the Treasurer's-were completely wrong and that his pipeline is a very dry one?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I want to give an informative answer to the honourable senator's question, I make the point that, in the last four years of the term of this Government, business investment, particularly investment in plant and equipment, has been at historically high levels, levels never attained by coalition governments throughout the 1970s. When we talk about a decline in investment, let us recognise that it is a decline from a base which was beyond the wildest imaginings of the lacklustre Government which prevailed through most of the 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone specifically asked me what I say about the current investment situation. The Budget figures provide a forecast for business investment and, as a subset of that, provide figures for investment in plant and equipment. The projected decline in plant and equipment is significantly less than the projected decline in total business investment.</PARA>
<PARA> The total business investment figure includes construction. There is no doubt that there has been a very big decline in construction investment, particularly in the major cities. Throughout the last few years, there has been an enormous boom in construction investment. This boom is normally cyclical but, as anybody who comes from any of the major cities knows, it has resulted in empty office blocks or near empty office blocks in many of those cities. The question of business investment overall has to be distinguished from that part of the question which relates to manufacturing investment, which essentially is investment in plant and equipment.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The bulk of the Tax Pack is printed on WSOP paper which was imported from Finland.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The papers mentioned by Senator Harradine are not effective substitutes for the paper that was used. Econoprint and Offset Magazine do not have a sized and calendered surface like the WSOP paper. Colour reproduction is therefore not as good because the ink is absorbed into the paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the Senate a matter of the most extreme public importance. It is a matter that we were going to bring up before the announcements of the last couple of hours about the proposed sale of the State Bank of Victoria and the partial privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That has added considerable height to the importance of this matter for discussion, namely the actions of the Hawke-Keating Government and State Labor governments which have caused massive losses of taxpayers' money through gross financial mismanagement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are witnessing in Australia today the culmination of a building-up of a web of mismanagement, deceit and corruption in financial administration in this country that is unparalleled. We have seen State governments doing deals with each other and the Federal Labor Government doing deals with State governments in a way that has been designed very deliberately to undermine the confidence of the community in our basic institutions and, indeed, to undermine our basic institutions themselves-our financial institutions, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the process of government and, indeed, the whole parliamentary system itself. Never in the history of this country have we seen such an insidious, progressive and continual undermining of those basic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have par excellence in this country Labor Inc. Indeed, it is not Labor Inc-it is Labor red ink. Everywhere we see a Labor government in office at the moment we see the taxpayers of those States being bled to death. We have seen it in my own and Senator Button's State. I am glad that Senator Button is going to be replying in this debate to the disastrous situation in the State of Victoria, a situation that has become so disastrous that today, against the expectations of any Australian, the heart and soul of Victorian financial institution-the State Bank of Victoria-is bankrupt and is being put up for sale by the State Government against every philosophy, every practicality and every pretence of decent management and government administration in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It flies absolutely and totally in the face of everything that Victoria and the Victorian Government have stood for. The amazing thing about the announcement in the last two hours that the State Bank of Victoria will be sold is that not one Victorian spokesman was involved. Not the Premier of Victoria, not one Victorian spokesman, but the Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating) made the announcement. As of one hour ago, Mrs Kirner, the Premier of Victoria, had not made one statement relating to this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal potentially requires very heavy Commonwealth Government involvement because the Commonwealth Bank of Australia will be one of the tenderers for the State Bank. According to Mr Keating, to meet the financing requirements of that, the proposal will be that the Commonwealth Bank itself be privatised up to the level of 49 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Button a couple of questions that I hope he will answer in his remarks. If the Commonwealth Government wanted to bail out Victoria, which is entirely what this matter is about, then why did it not provide the money in the Budget brought down in this Parliament less than three days ago? Why did it not have the guts to tell the Australian people that Victoria was bankrupt, that Victoria was broke and that it would help bail out its mates in Victoria?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not have the guts to do that for one reason. It would have smashed the integrity and credibility-not that any exists any longer-of both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and, more particularly, the Treasurer and would have thwarted once and for all the Treasurer's unbridled prime ministerial ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> How does Senator Button, the decent man sitting opposite who leads the Government in this chamber, feel about that? In the last couple of days questions have been asked of him relating to financial dealings in which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been involved. Senator Button is the third most senior member in this Government and he did not have a clue. He has been deliberately excluded from the counsels of this Government on matters of high finance and issues affecting every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I want Senator Button today to try to untangle a little the web of the amazing confusion that he in the Senate and the Treasurer in the House of Representatives have caused in the last 24 hours. They have a complete inability to get a consistent act together in terms of the questions asked of them of their knowledge of and involvement in the matters pertaining to the Pyramid Building Society in Victoria and the role of the Reserve Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the role of the Reserve Bank, I believe that the Government in its financial dealings in recent weeks and months has prostituted the role of the Reserve Bank. It has politicised the Reserve Bank. The bank is one of the basic institutions of this country. The Government has undermined people's confidence in the integrity of the bank in a way that is very damaging indeed to the whole of this nation and the whole of our financial structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Cabinet made this decision about the Commonwealth Bank? I do not know whether Senator Button was involved in even that one. What will be the situation in the Caucus? What will be the decision by the wider Australian Labor Party? Because of the way that the Labor Party is structured, the only way that a decision to privatise the Commonwealth Bank can be taken finally is to have the approval of the Labor Party, at least at a special conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government obviously could not deliver on the Commonwealth Bank proposal quickly, if at all-and the odds are against it given the strength of the Left within the Australian Labor Party. Senator Button made this announcement today. I just ask what degree of confusion the Government and Senator Button think this will throw into the whole web of financial relations in this country?</PARA>
<PARA> I go back to my earlier point: this decision announced today has nothing to do with proper financial management; it has nothing to do with the proper finances of government; it has all to do with saving the neck of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and putative Prime Minister of this country. If that is the way this country is to be run, and it is the way it has been run during the period of this Government, it is no wonder Australia has had its credit rating in the world downgraded twice-and for the first time ever in the history of this country. It is no wonder, because of the deals done between the Federal and Victorian Labor governments, that we have had a downgrading of the Victorian Government's credit rating for the first time in any State government's history. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the State Bank of Victoria is unbelievable. I do not believe that the activities and developments in the State Bank of Victoria over the past year or more have been unknown to the Treasurer. I believe that the Treasurer of this Commonwealth, Mr Keating, has known of and has been involved in the negotiations concerning this matter virtually from day one. I believe that in the handling of the State Bank matter over the last 12 months there has been a total abuse of the whole processes of proper financial administration between governments and within governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave my colleagues Senator Campbell and Senator Michael Baume to deal with this matter as it concerns other States; in my remarks today I want to concentrate on Victoria. The State Bank is only one of a series of disasters that has occurred under Vic Inc. over the period of the Cain and now Kirner Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Bank disaster started from the day it took over the Tricontinental merchant bank in 1985. Tricontinental was the highest risk merchant bank in Australia. Why did the State Bank ever get involved in that operation? The State Bank, almost from the day that Tricontinental was taken over, found massive losses in that institution. It tried various avenues to get out of Tricontinental, to get the financing of it taken away from its ledgers. Those avenues ranged from Queensland coal companies to Japanese banks to the Australian Bank Ltd. The Australian Bank operation to take over Tricontinental was stopped only by the intervention of two independent directors on the board. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, not only did the State Bank go as far as the Australian Bank, a private bank, but it also went to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. When the losses were disclosed publicly for the first time in the middle of last year, the State Bank was technically bankrupt. Despite that, State Bank representatives went to the Commonwealth Bank for financial assistance. The Treasurer must have known about that at that time, at the very latest, and he almost certainly must have known much earlier. The State Bank had to get $300m or go insolvent. Where did the State Bank go after it had all these knock-backs from the other banks? It went to the South Australian Government and got a loan of $300m. </PARA>

I am not casting aspersions on him and I do not deny that Senator Button did not know about it, but that simply proves the point that has been so patently obvious for so long: Keating and Hawke have cut him and most of the other Labor Cabinet members out of any decision- making in relation to the fundamentals of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 8 August in the South Australian Parliament, Premier Bannon said that the deal was done `in full consultation with, and with the approval of, the Reserve Bank'. That could only have happened with the full knowledge and connivance of the Treasurer of this Commonwealth. The Reserve Bank does not take fundamental decisions like that without consulting the Treasurer, as it made clear time and again in its annual report tabled last night. </PARA>
<PARA> The web of deceit that has been weaved by Labor governments-State and Federal-on the question of financial relations is unbelievable. On Wednesday night I raised in the Senate a matter which we happened to pick up from some obscure papers relating to the advances to the Minister for Finance. It related to three deals that were done during the Premiers Conference-one of them was two days before the Premiers Conference-involving $72m: $40m to Tasmania, $20m to Western Australia and $12m to South Australia. These deals were done to subvert the whole processes of the Loan Council and the Premiers Conference. They were not announced at any time by the Federal Government and, until those papers were tabled in the Senate on Wednesday, they had not been made known. Certainly, the South Australian deal had not been made known to anyone at all. I do not think that the Western Australian deal had either. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian deal is particularly extraordinary because during the Premiers Conference the Treasurer made great play of knocking back a Western Australian claim for an additional capital grant for road purposes. Whilst the Government was doing that, so that it could escape the vision of the other Premiers, it was doing a deal out the back door to give Western Australia $20m. It gave Western Australia $20m and did not tell anyone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now in the Budget Papers, but it is in obscure Budget Papers. It is not in the appropriation Bills or the Budget documents that have to be legislated by this Parliament. It is in documents that come to the Parliament a lengthy period after the decisions and deals have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, we are seeing a continual process of the undermining of the fundamental institutions of this Parliament. We are seeing the same shabby deals, the same contempt for proper procedures and for all normal standards of basic conduct in the public scrutiny of public financial administration in this country as we saw 15 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind those honourable senators who were here at the time-there are very few left now, but Senator Button is one of them-of what happened to this country when precisely the same sort of web was woven inexorably in the period 1974 and 1975. We are seeing a Labor Government going down the path which led in 1975 to the destruction of the confidence of virtually every Australian in the process of government in this nation. If that is the way this Government wants to go, so be it, but the cost that it is imposing in terms of confidence in our basic institutions, our financial structure, our whole process of government and parliamentary democracy, is certainly the most serious since that time. I believe that it is an even more serious situation than pertained then, and that is difficult indeed to imagine. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Button responds to my remarks today I want him to answer the questions I have raised. In particular, I want him to tell this chamber why the deal that is being announced today in relation to the State Bank of Victoria is being done three days after the Federal Budget? Why was it not done in the Budget context, despite the fact that it was only half a Budget?. The other half was missing-the hole in the doughnut, as John Hewson quite rightly said last night. It was a doughnut Budget because the whole core of the Budget was missing. The core of the Budget was to be some you-beaut statements on micro-economic reform-about which this Government has not got a clue and about which it could take not one whit of action because of the deep factionalisation that has brought it almost to a standstill in terms of decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was that gap there the other night and yet three days later the Treasurer can come along and purport to make a statement of the nature that he has today? If anyone was going to make that statement today it should have been, it must have been, the Premier of Victoria. There are deals, there are connivances going on here. There is a basic destruction of the fabric of the institutional arrangements that have made this nation the way it is-a great nation. The Government is doing great damage to that fabric, damage that will serve Australia and the Government ill for a long time to come. </PARA>

It ironed out a few instances of corruption. But the Opposition supported that Government throughout the Opposition's history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short comes in here today and uses these words, `deceit and corruption'-mismanagement, yes. There is doubt that there has been mismanagement in Victoria. But deceit and corruption? Does any member of the Opposition have the guts to go out of this place and accuse the Victorian Minister of corruption? Not one of them would do it. Opposition members sit here and listen to this guy speak and allege corruption against Ministers in this Government and Victorian Ministers. But not one of them would go outside and say it. If they do it to me, I will tell them what will happen to them. They would do it in here, but they would not have the guts to do it outside this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An 83c dollar, says Senator Archer. Why did industries go to the wall through the period of the Fraser Government? They did so because of an artificially overvalued dollar. Everybody knows that. But one of the first micro-economic reforms this Government introduced was to float the dollar and deregulate the financial sector. That was a micro-economic reform about which a former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, is on record as saying that a conservative government did not have the guts to implement, in spite of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System commissioned by the Fraser Government. The Opposition got all of the reports. It was not game to do it. We did it, and every economist and financial commentator in Australia applauded us for that. I want to come back to that point in a minute when I deal with some of Senator Short's wilder allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, what did the Opposition do about the tax system except leave us with a system like a gruyere cheese-riddled with holes, loopholes, and the capacity for tax avoidance by the rich. That is what the Opposition left us with. The tax system has been tightened by this Government and every commentator knows it. Senator Short wants me to respond to some specific allegations he makes about Victoria. He is peculiarly excited about the fact that the State Bank of Victoria is up for sale. That has been a matter of common knowledge in Victoria for some days. Where does the Commonwealth Government get involved in that? The State Bank of Victoria is up for sale. There are, as I understand it, a number of bidders from the private banking sector for the State Bank of Victoria. The Commonwealth Government, as the principal shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank, has made a decision that the Commonwealth Bank might also bid for that bank. I would not get too excited about that. I do not think that that is cause for great excitement. Where is the deceit, the corruption and the mismanagement in that?</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has told the Commonwealth Bank that it may, like the other major banks, make a bid for the State Bank of Victoria. As the retail banking business of the Commonwealth Bank in Victoria is only eight per cent of the total retail market it is not a bad thing for the Commonwealth Bank to have access to a much larger retail market in Victoria. </PARA>

We did not participate in that. Senator Short can sit here day after day trying to develop his own private conspiracy theories about what happened, but he will not get anywhere. One of the problems which those opposite confront is that the rubbish and rhetoric of the kind that Senator Short gave forth in his speech does not deal with truth. They have to confront the truth about what has happened. It is all very well for those opposite to invent conspiracy theories but they had better at some stage confront the truth on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the micro-economic reforms introduced by this Government was, of course, the deregulation of the financial sector. I have followed with some interest the consequences of the deregulation of the financial sector in Australia. So has the world. In no way would this Government revisit or retreat from that decision to deregulate the financial sector. But we have to look at some of the behavioural consequences of that deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, in a speech during the election campaign, made the point, with stunning simplicity, that if the banks in Australia had exercised the financial diligence and prudence which Tiny Rowland exercised when Alan Bond tried to take a bit of his company, this country would be a great deal better off. That is absolutely true, because, being a people of convict ancestry, we still have a few brigands around this place who try to sell gold bricks to everybody and who do not know how to behave in a prudential manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The best summary is to be obtained by reading opinions in the Japanese financial press about Australia. I do not pretend to read them in Japanese, but I do read them in translation. Again and again, newspapers such as Nihon Keizai Shimbun have made some points-more in sorrow than in anger-about the behaviour of Australian business following the deregulation of the financial sector. They have made these points time and time again and they essentially concern the fact that there have been a lot of so-called entrepreneurs in Australia who have not been content with being rich, but have wanted to become mega-rich because they have been motivated by greed. This comment, from a very respectable Japanese newspaper, is reflected in newspapers such as the Financial Times in London. These newspapers, commenting about Australia, say, `Look at the tragedy of these people who were not content to be rich; they had to become mega-rich overnight'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are similar comments about the Australian banking sector, concerning a lack of relationship with real industries; a willingness to lend on the basis of things such as negative pledges and so on to the high-fliers who wanted to become mega-rich overnight. These things, admittedly, are the consequences of financial deregulation. There is no doubt about that. </PARA>

<PARA>The report refers to the temptations that some businesses were led into. The report also says that the quality of loans made by banks and other financial institutions and the lack of proper prudential behaviour by lenders were not helped by the development during the 1980s of creative accounting practices and complex corporate ownership structures, and that this was compounded by the evidence of serious failures on the part of some company directors to meet their obligations fully, together with deficient disclosure of financial transactions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance today raises the role of government in our economy, which is certainly not to plan and finance every detail of the country's economic efforts. That model has been tried in Eastern Europe and found wanting. The question arises whether the corollary is true: should governments abdicate all responsibility and leave the workings of our economy essentially to the invisible hand of the market? For those who are well off and powerful, this is a good solution. They can borrow at will, here and overseas, pushing up Australia's foreign debt, as they have done since 65 per cent of our foreign debt is due to private borrowings, turning equity into tax deductable interest, losing billions of dollars in revenue to the Australian taxpayer, and providing for them a very useful base for the argument that we must cut pensions, sickness benefit and youth support programs because we have not got enough funds. They can buy public assets-that is, assets owned by the Australian community-at bargain prices. After all, public corporations are not fashionable since they have community service obligations, and that fits in badly with the formula of return on capital ratios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Cross-subsidising concessions to pensioners and people in remote areas means that other users are asked to contribute on the basis of their capacity to pay. I think that this is eminently logical in a just and fair society, but the markets contend that it is untidy; so the Government starves its utilities of capital until there is at least a superficial argument for privatisation, and the result is increased charges for domestic users. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at part of the record. In the United States of America, users of the telecommunications system faced a 46 per cent increase in charges within five years of the system being opened to other competitors. In the United Kingdom, charges increased by 25 per cent between 1986 and 1987, following privatisation in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other benefits to the rich and powerful. They can buy and sell other entities at will, establishing new monopolies with little interference from a largely lame duck Trade Practices Act. In the heyday of deregulation in which we now live, when they get into trouble they can sell Australian farms, factories and forests to foreign interests-once again, with minimal interference from the toothless Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The losses to Australian taxpayers emerging from this thumbnail sketch of wholesale deregulation-a Government policy which is supported by the Opposition-are high interest rates for home buyers and small businesses, with a 46 per cent rise in bankruptcies in Victoria during the past year alone, and a massive loss of tax revenue, with major entrepreneurial companies paying minimal company tax on their real profits and a consequent reduction of community services due to lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, Industrial Equity Ltd, one of our foremost industrial companies, paid 4.6 per cent company tax, against the 39 per cent that it should have paid, and it is by no means the leader in a long list of our major companies that have managed to bring down their tax liabilities at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said, there is growing pressure to reduce the number of public utilities providing essential services. In other words, we are now starting to use assets to pay current expenses-with a consequent reduction in the Government's ability to influence public policy in the private sector and to enforce standards of safety and financial responsibility in the various sectors of industry and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at how that can work. The Commonwealth Bank is currently in line for privatisation. When we look at its behaviour compared with that of the private banks we find that it was always the last to raise its interest rates and the first to drop them. That is an example of how public policy can be introduced as a leading agent into the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The growing transfer to foreign investors of our productive capacity is placing the decisions affecting Australians in the future in board rooms in Tokyo, New York and London and is mortgaging our future. This year, we are remitting $11 billion-56 per cent of our current account-in interest. This equates to 20 per cent of our total export income. If that curve continues, in five years time we will certainly be able to confirm that we have arrived in a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the Government's real failure and the greatest loss to taxpayers was the ideological surrender to deregulation. I am sorry, but I cannot agree with my friend, Senator John Button, who has turned out to be such a staunch advocate of deregulation. I wish that he would recant and turn back from a path that is further mortgaging the future of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The way to regain control over our destiny is to give more power to the Trade Practices Commission to protect the Australian consumer, to the Foreign Investment Review Board to slow down the fire sale and to the Prices Surveillance Authority to make sure that Australians, and not just companies, get a fair deal. This is part of the Democrats' concept of the role of government in the economy-to provide a legislative framework to stimulate and support economic activity and to ensure that the consumer is protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that it is not fashionable in this chamber to say a kind word about the Cain Government, but that government accepted this responsibility. It showed-if by nothing else, then by its record of job creation, which is still ahead of that of the other States-that the direction it took was right. But, clearly, the execution was miserable. That government certainly failed in its management, and that is on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The record is well and truly on the table and I will not repeat it, except to say that there is actually an example in Australia of a body which shows that government or public enterprises need not be inefficient, mismanaged or negligent. Recently the State Electricity Commission in Victoria in a six-month period shed 3,000 jobs, increased efficiency by about 6 per cent, and is now able to keep prices at a level less than the inflation rate. It is quite clearly a matter of management. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other areas in which we feel that the Government must take the initiative and provide not only the framework but also the positive encouragement of our industry and of our community to achieve the sort of society we want to live in. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the taxation system and the tax avoidance rorts which are still with us. To be fair, the Government has done a reasonable amount to tighten the tax system, but many rorts, most of them exploitable only by the rich, still remain. The worst of these, the so-called foreign loans rort, not only hurts taxpayers by increasing their burden but also worsens the current account deficit which induces the Government, in its mistaken policy, to keep interest rates much higher than they should be. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other schemes. Negative gearing, essentially involving huge company takeovers, costs billions of dollars every year. There are various rorts minimising capital gains which, again, cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The Pitt Street farmers who pass themselves off as primary producers cost the taxpayer at least $50m a year. The evasion of interest withholding tax was recently estimated by the Australian Taxation Office itself in its evidence to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the Martin Committee, to be well over $100m a year. Income splitting using trusts robs ordinary taxpayers who do not use that particular avenue of well over $100m per year. It is one scheme on which the Government should have acted long ago; it is one on which we intend to take action. Tax havens have been only partially and very sensitively regulated against. There is also the incorporation of businesses to avoid the maximum personal tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other areas in which we feel that the Government, State governments, and the economy need more legislation. I emphasise to Senator Button that not less, but more, regulation is needed. We need federal legislation to control all financial institutions including building societies, friendly societies and investment trusts. It is interesting to note that the Financial Corporations Act 1974 has remained unproclaimed to this day. If it had been proclaimed then it is quite possible that we would not have been faced with the Pyramid Building Society disaster in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> We would also advocate controls on overseas borrowings by private corporations for loans above certain limits. I really do not see why we should allow private corporations to damage the public interest by establishing paper empires which, in turn, damage the savings of investors. We want increased powers and resources for the Prices Justification Tribunal-that was a slip of the tongue, but maybe it was an intentional one; it is now called the Prices Surveillance Authority. The Prices Justification Tribunal was actually so called during the Whitlam Government years, and perhaps in some of these areas we should return to those days. </PARA>

<PARA> We certainly want more Commonwealth Government regulation and/or more direct intervention in determining interest rates for home buyers, small business and consumer credits. We have the slightly outlandish notion that the small people in this community should be protected and should be given a chance to work and to achieve an existence of their own choosing. We also need to have some legislative framework that protects them against the big boys who are not in any way reluctant to exercise their power for their own profit. Product liability in this area is long overdue. It is another initiative that we will tackle in this term. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other areas where we feel that this Government and the State governments need to take urgent action to ensure that the sort of financial mismanagement due to lack of financial control which we have been experiencing in Victoria and in other States does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the area of corporate law reform. We believe that there should be quarterly reports and six-monthly balance sheets for listed companies. We believe that all key financial indicators should be standardised and that there should be mandatory cash flow reporting, as is the case in the United States. In particular, we want transactions involving directors and related parties to be on the public record and to be subject to an auditor's statement. That has become the subject of some of the company disasters which we have witnessed. We want management fees open to public scrutiny on an agreed formula. </PARA>
<PARA> We also want future tax benefits not to be carried forward as an asset in the accounts of business, which has happened on a number of occasions, giving potential and actual investors a totally illusory picture of the health of their own investments. Strangely enough, we believe that capital formation should be given a boost in Australia rather than us going cap in hand to foreign financiers who then dictate our economic policy. We believe that we should give savings--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to talk about the actions of the Hawke-Keating Government and State Labor governments which have caused massive losses of taxpayers' money through gross financial mismanagement. Coming from Western Australia none of this is new to me. We have certainly, in the words of Senator Short, suffered gross financial mismanagement, deceit and corruption in Western Australia. It is very hard to walk outside this Parliament, as Senator Button said earlier, and talk about deceit and corruption, but I would think that the proper course of action in Western Australia is to have a royal commission and have it all out in the open for once.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The beginnings of this mismanagement, deceit and corruption in Western Australia was started by Brian Burke, now the Ambassador to Ireland-he was sent over there by his mate Bob Hawke, the Prime Minister, and his cronies. I think it goes deeper than that, though. Senator Spindler referred to it in his speech when he suggested that we should go back to the Whitlam years. I suggest to the Senate today that indeed we may be going back to the Whitlam years. We are looking at finding money off Budget, looking at doing deals between government instrumentalities-for instance, the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria, as is the case today. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to find things off Budget. We are trying to keep things out of the eyes of public scrutiny. It would seem to me that the Commonwealth Government is now beginning to get involved. Its involvement is being unveiled. Perhaps that is why this matter has been brought on today. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn back to Western Australia. The history of the Burke Government was quickly wallpapered over for the purposes of the State election with, as I said, former Premier Burke being sent off to Ireland and the Holy See. Peter Dowding, of the local Western Australian Labor Party, was installed to wallpaper over the problems. But, of course, that wallpaper could not stick for very long, because when the walls start tumbling down and the bricks start falling apart the wallpaper is not going to last very long. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when that started happening the Western Australian Labor Party-and I am sure Senator Walsh was part of this-had to find some slightly stronger wallpaper just to try to save itself from electoral annihilation in Western Australia in the Federal election. So it put in Premier Carmen Lawrence to try to save things for a few weeks. I am sure that the Carmen Lawrence solution of veneering over the deep problems of mismanagement, deceit and corruption in Western Australia cannot last long. Sooner or later there will be an inquiry or royal commission, the truth will come out and the deceit and corruption will be uncovered. Putting Premier Joan Kirner in place of Premier Cain is another example of trying to wallpaper over deep cracks in the fabric of the Victorian financial establishment. Of course, it is pretty hard to stick wallpaper over a wall that has already fallen down. I suggest to Senate that that is what has happened here. </PARA>
<PARA> How did all this start, what is the cause of it and what is the real problem? The problem is that we have political interference and manipulation of these public authorities and public financial institutions. Perhaps the fact that they are publicly owned opens them to that sort of manipulation and those sorts of problems. Back in March 1983 honourable senators will recall that Malcolm Fraser said to the voters of Australia, `Your money might be safer under your bed'. I am sure that people in Western Australia who had money in the Teachers Credit Society Ltd or Rothwells Ltd or Victorians who had their money in Pyramid Building Society would probably think back on that statement of the former Prime Minister and agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, shortly after then, Brian Burke was elected as Premier, and soon after started the insipid placing of Labor political stooges into some of our great financial institutions in Western Australia. An interesting case of this is the State Government Insurance Office (SGIO), which was formed after an inquiry which was set up by Brian Burke. He appointed none other than Laurie Connell of L. R. Connell and Associates to look into the SGIO and the Motor Vehicle Investment Trust and suggest a restructuring. Of course, the State Government Insurance Corporation (SGIC) was formed, and the history of that corporation since that day is a sad and sorry one. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You tell us about Denis Horgan. The SGIC has been involved with some of the major losses that have been included in the WA Inc. disaster. After Laurie Connell recommended its formation and structure, WA Inc. was one of the beneficiaries of the SGIC when things started hitting the wall in 1987, 1988 and 1989. The Rural and Industries (R and I) Bank of Western Australia is another institution. For honourable senators who do not know, it is the State bank in Western Australia. It has been used to bail out one of the early victims of WA Inc., and that cost the R and I Bank, the State bank of Western Australia, $129m. Here is another classic example of a State government owned institution getting involved through political manipulation or having political interference in the State government and government financial institutions. In the last financial year, after that bail-out, the R and I Bank recorded a loss of $98m, the first loss in its history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to inform the Senate of some other losses and the involvement of the State Government Insurance Commission, the R and I Bank, the Government Employees Superannuation Board and the now infamous Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd (PICL) project and refer to the impact of those on the people of Western Australia. Sooner or later someone has to pay for it all. We are suggesting that the people of Victoria will pay very heavily. The people of Western Australia are already paying very heavily and, as the Commonwealth Government now seems to be getting deeply involved in these disasters in Labor governed States, other people of Australia will pay, and pay dearly. We are already paying dearly in terms of international credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I will run through some of the losses. The losses related to the bail-out of Rothwells Ltd by the State Government through various deposits from the SGIC came to a total of $147.9m. The payments made by WA Government Holdings in relation to the petrochemical project, or so-called PICL, totalled $393.3m. All this was done through the SGIC in Government payments to WA Government Holdings and various loans from the SGIC and associated bodies. Of course the State government superannuation board, where thousands upon thousands of State government employees have their superannuation tied up, had a total loss in various transactions, including revaluation of shares, debentures, and various other dubious investments to bail out other mismanagement, of $146.4m. </PARA>
<PARA> There were many others. In the Midland Abattoir scandal there was about half a million dollars difference between the sale price and the valuation. On the Perth Technical College site, again where Laurie Connell was involved with the Government and the SGIC, there was another $6.6m. The Teachers Credit Society, to which I have already referred, had a $129.6m loss. </PARA>
<PARA> As I go through these losses, we must remember that someone has to pay for them. Of course, it will be the taxpayers of Western Australia and Australia as a whole. In the Fremantle Gas and Coke deal, the State Electricity Commission of Western Australia (SECWA) bought out one of the Government's mates at a price about $15.9m above valuation. There have been various other losses: the Silicon Smelter project; the Gold Corporation statutory authority; the WA Government Holdings losses between 1983 and 1988 which amounted to another $4.3m; Swan Building Society and also the Local Government Superannuation Board. All those miscellaneous items add up to $195.2m. The total funds lost without any doubt or fudging of figures is at least $882m. There are further funds at risk, some quite substantial figures which, when all the bills come in over the next couple of years, could add up to at least $1.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fairly sad and sorry balance sheet for Western Australia. It would seem that per capita the events in Western Australia are far worse than those in Victoria. That is hard to imagine, but I guess people in the eastern States have not been overly exposed to that sad state of affairs. The effect of those losses is that the people of Western Australia are now already paying through higher taxes and charges, increases above the level of inflation, quite severe cuts in government services, and a capital works program that has almost totally ground to a halt which will see the infrastructure of Western Australia wind down to an appalling degree. </PARA>
<PARA> A classic example of the capital works program and a case where the Commonwealth is implicitly involved is in handing over the secret $20m for roads. That was done off the records, behind closed doors at the Premiers Conference in June. I believe that is just the tip of the iceberg in relation to this Commonwealth Government's involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that in Western Australia these off-the-budget and behind-closed-doors deals without public and parliamentary scrutiny are the cause of a serious problem. The Liberal Party of Western Australia and, indeed, the coalition parties in Western Australia would like to see a royal commission established to uncover the truth of this matter. If there has been no deceit and no corruption, that is good and that will rebuild confidence in the State of Western Australia, and indeed in Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the people who were involved in these deals have escaped any scrutiny. Brian Burke, the former Premier, is in Ireland as an ambassador appointed by this Government. Peter Dowding is over in Sydney, and I believe that David Parker is in Hong Kong. A lot of people who have been closely involved have so far escaped scrutiny for their involvement in these deals. Of course, a royal commission would put them under that scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other people, of course, in the private sector. After reading the West Australian this morning I am reminded that one Tom Forrest Hugall is now behind bars for his part in only one small section of the WA Inc. scandal. In the West Australian of Thursday, 23 August prosecutor Ron Davies, QC, said there was an immense need to deter people from this type of dishonest business dealing. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Tom Forrest Hugall, who is now in gaol, is only the tip of the iceberg. He has had to stand trial. He has had to come under public scrutiny and the scrutiny of courts, but what about all these people who have not?</PARA>

<PARA> It is important that we understand that Western Australia's problems and Victoria's problems are well documented. Today, in this discussion of a matter of public importance, the Opposition is drawing public attention to the seriousness of the Commonwealth getting involved in bailing them out. It would seem that the late announcement that the Government will now be selling 49 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank may be a way of funding a bail-out of the problems in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I would make is that the Federal Government over the last year or so, and as recently announced in the Budget, is spending somewhere in the order of $200m to set up this new Australian Securities Commission to strengthen and centralise the national corporate watchdog and to take away all of the corporate affairs powers from the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is doing this to try to get rid of the so-called corrupt business dealings, to get rid of shonky public companies and to bring directors to more account. So, we are spending a couple of hundred million dollars there hopefully-and I honestly pray it will happen-to increase the confidence in Australia of the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> None of this $200m will help Australia's credibility in the international scene unless these shonky dealings between governments at the State and Federal level are fixed up first. That is what I pray will happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, when Senator Spindler was speaking he said, in effect, `We know the way they managed the economy in eastern Europe didn't work, so nobody wants to do that any more'. Then I thought he gave us a prescription for managing the economy in exactly that way. I found it difficult, I must say, to detect any substantial difference between the economic management systems applied in eastern Europe and the one which Senator Spindler was advocating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I want to make a qualified apology to the Democrats and correct an error of fact. For many, many years I have habitually described the Democrats as totally useless people who just waste time and space. I want to make a limited correction to that because this week the Democrats did something very useful. They blackballed Senator Crichton-Browne. Consequently, he is not Deputy President of the Senate. I want to put that qualified apology on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> When I looked at the terms of this matter of public importance, it reminded me that I had been noticing for some time symptoms of the softening of the brain in members of the Liberal Party. This discussion has provided significant confirmation for that view. The matter of public importance states:</PARA>
<PARA> The actions of the Hawke/Keating Government and State Labor Governments which have caused massive losses of taxpayers' money through gross financial mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not hear all of Senator Short's speech; I did hear all of Senator Campbell's. We have heard wild allegations of deceit and corruption, with absolutely no evidence to back them up. In Senator Campbell's case, the clinching evidence so far as he was concerned was that sooner or later it would be shown that the Commonwealth Government was a party to and an active participant, at least a supporting player, in some of the mistakes a couple of State Labor governments have made. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the speakers that the Opposition has put up, I would like to say something about their qualifications. Senator Short was speaking about 1975 at one stage. Of course, he then worked in the Treasury. Some people allege that he had a different name at that stage. Some people allege his name in those days was Mr Williams. But I know that he vehemently denies that, and I am in no position to pass judgment on it. However, he was perspicacious enough to realise that he did not have much of a future in the Treasury, so he won the seat of Ballarat and then sat in the Parliament throughout most of the Fraser Government years. I might come back to that if I have time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what Senator Campbell's qualifications to speak on the matter are but, of course, Senator Michael Baume, as a former member of Patrick Partners, ought to know a great deal about gross financial mismanagement. But what they have failed to do so far-and I am supremely confident that Senator Baume will also fail to do-is provide any evidence whatsoever, other than their own conspiracy theories, about the alleged involvement of the Federal Labor Government in some of the errors that may or may not have been committed in a few Labor States. So the symptoms of brain softening are still there. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has already made the point, of course, that somebody who sat in the Fraser Government for most of its years, as Senator Short did, does have a bit of a cheek to be moving a motion such as the one he has moved today. He did not seem to be unduly concerned about the Ministry of the Fraser years when, as Senator Button said, people used to say at that stage that this was the cleanest Ministry in Australian history because they had all been acquitted. I must say in that respect that the former Deputy Leader of the National Party certainly was acquitted. The presiding judge of the trial, whose name was Staunton, virtually directed the jury to find him not guilty, and seven hours later the jury did. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we all know the history of the Fraser Government on financial mismanagement. It came in and was going to clean everything up. It was going to get rid of inflation. It was going to end the secret tax of inflation, which was Malcolm Fraser's way of describing what other people might have called fiscal drag or bracket creep. It was going to reduce the size of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as I pointed out-outside the House I might say-a few weeks ago, the Fraser regime in the end welched on all the fundamental commitments that it had made at the time it came into government. It left the finances of the Commonwealth Government probably in the biggest mess they have ever been in. It left the incoming Federal Government in March 1983 with a prospective Budget deficit of almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product. As former Senator Stone's note pungently pointed out to the then Treasurer, Mr Howard, there was 11 per cent inflation, 10 per cent unemployment and a $10 billion Budget deficit-the big trifecta. </PARA>
<PARA> I also understand-I said earlier that I did not, unfortunately, hear all of Senator Short's speech-that, in amongst all the other wild allegations about corruption and deceit and so on, he attempted an exercise that was forcibly tried by the Opposition Leader in South Australia. He attempted to plant the story that the Bank of South Australia was in some way connected with the State Bank of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> He ought to know by now, since it has been corrected publicly, that the South Australian finance authority did buy some notes issued by the State Bank of Victoria, but the State Bank of South Australia had no connection with that whatsoever or, at least, as far as is known. He must know that, but it did not stop him trying to rerun the furphy that the Liberal Party Leader in South Australia had first tried to run 16 days ago, which I suppose is consistent with the quality of his speech in general. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Campbell gave us a list of purchases and sales by the present State Government of Western Australia and said that they were, at best, unwise and implied that they were probably crook as well, but he did not delve all that far back into history. I recall the Court Government buying-not taking over-the Midland railway, which, of course, had been consistently recording losses. The Court Government used taxpayers' money to buy it. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the subject of one float in a Labour Day procession at that time made the point that the motto of the Court Government was: `If it loses, buy it. If it makes a profit, sell it', which was summed up as socialism Courtstyle. Of course, there is also the Entertainment Centre. That is the same story-the Entertainment Centre was bought by the Court Government. Private enterprise failures used to be picked up by the Court Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia is a strange place in some ways. It has many attractive features and it has a few unattractive ones. One of those, I think, is that there is a bit of a cowboy mentality around Western Australia, but it is nothing new. I ask honourable senators to cast their minds back to the days of the Poseidon boom. They were ultimately flushed out in some detail by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, chaired by Senator Peter Rae, as he then was, which showed that there was a gap of five or six days between the initial assay of the cores from the Mount Windarra nickel strike and the public announcement of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In those five days a number of people who had access to the knowledge traded in Poseidon shares-they bought heaps of them. One of the so-called investment companies that did that was called Burrell and Associates and Senator Crichton-Browne was a significant shareholder in Burrell and Associates, Burrell geologists being the consulting geologists to Poseidon who knew about the assay of the core that had been taken from Mount Windarra. That was the sort of thing that went on in Western Australia at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the stock exchange was another of the insider traders who had taken advantage because he had access to the initial assay long before it became public, who bought shares heavily, who was the recipient-if I remember correctly-of a placement of shares in Poseidon arranged by the other directors--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Perhaps I should explain. I did name Senator Crichton-Browne; I said he was a significant shareholder in Burrell Investments, which had done some insider trading in Poseidon shares. All that has long been a matter of public record. When Senator Short objected I was talking about the president of the Stock Exchange in Perth in 1974, who had no association, to my knowledge, with Senator Crichton-Browne. But perhaps Senator Short knows something that I do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The president of the Stock Exchange was revealed in the Rae report in 1974 as having been up to his ears in insider trading in Poseidon shares a few years earlier, and he remained the president of the stock exchange. One would have thought he would have been sacked, or removed, or would have had the decency to resign the day the Rae report became public. But no, he stayed there and saw out his term which, if I remember correctly, was another six or eight months. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a bloke whom most people would describe, quite reasonably, as a crook. He was up to his ears in insider trading because he had privileged information about a mining strike. He not only did this but also was allowed to remain president of the Stock Exchange of Perth after the fact that he had done it was made public. At the time I thought it was pretty amazing; I still think it is pretty amazing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the couple of minutes remaining I will make some brief observations about the deregulation of the financial system and some of its consequences. I half believe, not that it was a mistake to float the dollar and deregulate the financial system but that it probably was a mistake to deregulate it at the particular time it was done; that is, the mid-1980s when there were plenty of paper entrepreneur spivs. The easy credit that the deregulation seemed to induce at that time made it much easier for these spivs to put together their takeovers and their paper entrepreneurial empires because money was so freely available. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also astounded when I finally discovered-perhaps I should have known long before-the lending practices of the Australian banks, some of which Senator Button has referred to. They provided no security other than negative pledges. They did not even question these paper entrepreneurs as to how much money they owed financial institutions. I found it astounding that mainstream Australian trading banks behaved in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if the financial system had been deregulated in the 1970s, as it probably should have been if the then Liberal Government had had the nerve to do so, this may not have happened. I should also put on the record that the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, with whom I once briefly discussed this, believes it would have happened no matter when the financial system was deregulated because the techniques of the negative pledges and the leverage buy-up were well known. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Short says, to do the same sort of secret and dishonourable deals with them that have been exposed today and last night by the Opposition and by the State Premiers who did not get the benefit of those sleazy, slimy backdoor deals done by a government, which apparently has the same fiscal morality as the Whitlam Government in its backdoor sleazy financial deals. It has done the same sort of backdoor deals. It has also attempted to hide the sleaze and to cover up the crookedness. This is what is going on here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that no contribution from the Labor Party has been able or intended to deny the hard core reality that in the last couple of days we have seen a secret deal entered into by the Federal Government to bail out State governments in trouble because of their own problems, because of their own, in some cases, massive incompetence-and we have yet to see the extent to which anything other than incompetence was involved. We have seen the Government bailing out its mates to the tune of $70m. Now we are seeing up to $600m going to bail out the Victorian Government in the sleazy deal which is deliberately being done off-Budget so that it will not affect the one thing that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) says he has going for him. He claims that he still has integrity. I always get concerned about people who go around the place protesting they have integrity. Keating has said that the surplus is the rock--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator Baume, I reminded you early this morning that if we are talking about a member of the House of Representatives we should use the proper form of address. `Mr Keating' would be far better than `Keating'.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Mr Keating has said that `the surplus is the rock on which our whole credibility is founded'. I think he spelt the word `foundered' wrongly. His credibility sank. It is clearly sinking because of the way this sleazy deal is being done to rescue the Victorian Government. Mr Keating can say, `No, this is all above board. This is honourable. We are calling for tenders'. Let us just have a look at this process and see how phoney Mr Keating's press conference today was when he protested his innocence. He even went to the extent of saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My purpose in recommending that course of action to them was to guarantee there could be no question of the Commonwealth Government bailing out the State Government of Victoria for its problems flowing from Tricontinental. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating set out-and will fail in the attempt-to give the appearance of not doing something that is sleazy and deceptive, but he will be doing it. The reason I say he will be doing it is evident from his own press statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us recognise that Mr Keating has to make certain that the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) will not be affected by any big hand-outs to Victoria because, as I noted earlier, that is the basis-the rock-on which the whole credibility of the Government is founded. Let us see. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating claims that he was approached six or seven weeks ago by the Victorian Labor Government about these problems and the Victorian Government's desire to sell the State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw in the Australian Financial Review this morning one proposition floated as a way to get Commonwealth Bank control of the State Bank without affecting the PSBR, in other words, the Federal Government in one way or another selling an asset or providing funds to the State Government by an off-Budget device. That device apparently did not get up in the lengthy Cabinet meeting last night. </PARA>
<PARA> What Mr Keating says did happen is that the Cabinet gave an in principle agreement to allow the sale of enough of the Commonwealth Bank's capital to finance the purchase of the State Bank of Victoria-the troubled State bank of a troubled State government. For the word `troubled' we could almost substitute `bankrupt'. Certainly, in the case of the Government, it is absolutely bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing is that the Cabinet agreed to Mr Keating's proposal, which he says was on the basis of a request from the State Government. What Mr Keating did not tell us is whether the Commonwealth Bank itself wanted, of its own initiative, to acquire the State Bank of Victoria and whether the Commonwealth Bank thought that buying up the $3 billion in bad debts-I think the total is getting close to that-was worth the $600m-odd which is being spread around as the likely price. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Parliament is entitled to know whether the Commonwealth Bank, which is supposed to be a separate statutory authority-and one would have thought it might have had some interest in this matter-is interested in acquiring the State Bank's enormous problems. But that is by the way. We have not been taken into the confidence of the Treasurer about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank, like the Reserve Bank of Australia, is now being regarded by the Treasurer as one of his toys-it takes directions. Last year he arrogantly said that the Reserve Bank will do what it is told about monetary policy. In fact, the Reserve Bank did what it was told about its annual report this year. I dealt with that matter last night. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to express a certain degree of incredulity about the Treasurer's press statement. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I believe the State Government of Victoria came to the conclusion that the State Bank of Victoria might best be sold. And as a result of that conclusion, the State Government of Victoria approached the Commonwealth Government, me in particular, with a view to the Commonwealth Bank purchasing the State Bank of Victoria. I told the representatives of the Government that, in my view, it would be very difficult for the Commonwealth Government or the Commonwealth Bank to make a judgement about the values which might be attached to the State Bank of Victoria and that the best course of action, I believe, that was open to the State Bank would be for it to offer the State Bank widely among other financial institutions. Now, this they readily agreed would be the best course of action and they commissioned Meryll Lynch to draw up documents and invite expressions of interest from financial institutions. That, I believe, they have done. And it is now a matter for the State Government of Victoria to decide which of those bids are in the best economic interests of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds all very rational-with one marvellous exception, because the Treasurer then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Now, the Commonwealth Bank is one of those bidders. </PARA>
<PARA>Having just previously said that it would be very difficult for the Commonwealth Bank to come to any estimation of value, he then said, `But it is making a bid anyway'. If that is the rationale for it not doing the bid straight up, for not having it, it is a nonsense-there was a hidden agenda. This Parliament wants to know the real reason. The reason Mr Keating gave was transparently phoney and dishonest. It was not a factor in that matter. No direct bid was made by the Commonwealth Bank because it was too hard for it to make a proper bid as it could not tell the value, but in fact even without the Commonwealth Bank having access to the tenders of the trading banks it could still have made some kind of rational offer. If it were an auction and one could see who the other bidders were, Mr Keating's rationalisation of his position would be capable of defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely tenders are secret. Surely tenders for a business remain the property of the person for whom the bid is being made unless there is a great deal of phoneyness and crookedness and there is no intention of having the tenders remain secret-and, in this case, no intention on the part of the Victorian State Government, at the direction of the Treasurer, to reveal to the Commonwealth Bank what the other tenders were so that the Commonwealth Bank could make an appropriate bid. If this were not so, there would be no rational explanation for the absolute garbage that the Treasurer has gone on with in this statement. It is just incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly there is a deliberate and determined attempt to get around the fiscal restraint the Government says it is imposing on the States. It is using a device; it is selling an asset owned by the people of Australia to provide a benefit to a particular State which, by its incompetent Labor Government, has got itself into a condition of bankruptcy. That is the simple and uncomplicated situation. </PARA>
<PARA> One can almost hear the campaign cry of the Labor Party at the next State elections around Australia: `Vote for us because when we lose multimillions of dollars we know that the Commonwealth Government will pay us through the back door'. I admit that they have lost one of their benefactors, Senator Walsh, who in recent years has been very kind through his Advance to the Minister for Finance. For example, on 30 June 1988-what a remarkable day!-the last possible day on which such an advance could be given in the financial year, the last possible day before the 1989 election, he provided $60m through the Advance to the Minister for Finance as capital grants for social infrastructure associated with defence installations. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular grant to South Australia we are complaining about now was not an unexpected grant. That is what the Advance to the Minister for Finance is supposed to be about. It was exactly the same sort of grant that had gone on for the previous two years. This kind of phoneyness, this kind of deceptive behaviour which the Premier of New South Wales has quite properly drawn to our attention in complaining bitterly about this deal, is a sleazy attempt to bail out the Labor Party's mates in governments which have been proven to be a mixture of incompetence and corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole approach of the Labor Party through these problems is either to deny that the problem exists-that is usually the Keating approach: `There is no such problem; we are on track'-or if there is criticism, to silence it, as we have seen in the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Government silenced the Reserve Bank's independence when it coped with extraordinary circumstances last year-they are even worse this year-by putting out an extraordinarily frank annual report. If there are critics, silence them. If there is someone who can be used as a fall guy, sack him. Look at the former Premier of Western Australia, who suddenly disappeared. Mr Cain, obviously, is another fall guy. The Government is pretty good at finding them, even if it has no idea about how to solve the real problems. If there is a political disaster, just kill it off. If there is a failure or some corruption, hide it. That is what this debate is all about. There is so much evidence of disgraceful Government mismanagement that this discussion is needed. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish briefly to refer to the recommendations that are contained therein. In particular, I mention the link road between Gungahlin and Mitchell and the necessity, because of the problems that the Mitchell traders have had waiting for Gungahlin, that that be done as soon as possible. I also refer to the matter of the speed of traffic in Bateman Street and Learmonth Drive. In relation to that recommendation, I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Report on Proposals for Variations of the Plan of Layout of the City of Canberra and Its Environs-Variations 1990/1</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to variation 6-Kambah Gleneagles Estate development and draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 1.14 on page 4 of the report and the Committee's recommendation that measures to control the volume and speed of traffic in Bateman Street and Learmonth Drive be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say at the outset that I believe Gleneagles is a very impressive development. </PARA>
<PARA> It has considerable potential to enhance the property values of proximate residential areas. </PARA>
<PARA> However, problems have been identified in relation to the proposed access to Gleneagles, which could have a negative impact on neighbouring suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been contacted by a large number of residents of Kambah who expressed concern at the proposal that Learmonth Drive and Bateman Street be the access route to the Gleneagles development. </PARA>
<PARA> With the development of the Hyperdome in Tuggeranong these streets have already seen an increase in traffic estimated, by residents, to be around double. </PARA>
<PARA> The Learmonth Drive, Bateman Street, Boddington Circuit route is attractive to motorists within to avoid traffic light control and is used not just by Hyperdome shoppers and Tuggeranong workers but by those travelling to and from the southern suburbs of Tuggeranong, to Lanyon, Cooma and the snowfields and to Queanbeyan, via Isabella Drive. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally this increased volume of traffic has had an adverse impact on residents of these streets. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems include-</PARA>
<PARA> noise (causing sleep disturbance)</PARA>
<PARA> air pollution</PARA>
<PARA> dust</PARA>
<PARA> hazards in moving motor vehicles in and out of driveways</PARA>
<PARA> hazards in exiting from side streets</PARA>
<PARA> potential for injury or death to the aged</PARA>
<PARA>and potential for injury or death to children (cycling, playing or those who have to cross the road to and from school or when visiting friends). </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates indicate that that part of the Gleneagles development which is proposed to exit via Learmonth Drive and Bateman Street would increase traffic volumes by a minimum of 400 vehicles a day, further reducing the amenity, safety and property values of the surrounding environment. </PARA>
<PARA> One suggestion put forward by Kambah residents was for an alternative route onto the Kambah Pool road. However, I understand from correspondence with the ACT Chief Minister that there are a number of practical impediments to this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had a number of meetings with the residents of the area who have stressed that they have no objections to the concept of the development-their legitimate objection is to the impact it will have on already heavily used roads in their neighbourhood. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year I contacted the Woden Valley police to discuss the issue of speeding traffic on these roads and obtained an undertaking that the area would be monitored. </PARA>
<PARA> In February I was advised that between 31 January and 5 February, members of the AFP Central Traffic Branch conducted a traficomp survey in Bateman Street. A total of 6,368 vehicles were recorded as having travelled in the street. Statistics indicated there was some evidence of speeding vehicles, and the AFP undertook to give attention to the street with police patrols. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wrote to the ACT Department of Transport to put it to them that a roundabout or speed humps might assist in keeping traffic speeds to the legal and safe limit, and I corresponded with the ACT Chief Minister, Mr Kaine, on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these representations, the Transport Policy Branch carried out official traffic counts over a two-week period in late February and early March, on the streets in question. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently received a letter from Transport Policy Branch with the results of the traffic count. </PARA>
<PARA> It indicated that volumes had increased in the last few years, but although peak traffic was significant, it was considered to be within the volumes which would be expected for streets of this type. </PARA>
<PARA> It did not show evidence of motorists using these streets as alternative routes to the Hyperdome. </PARA>
<PARA> It acknowledged Country Club Estate would add to the volume of traffic. The Department undertook to complete further surveys when the estate is complete, and take any remedial action necessary at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter also acknowledged traffic speeds to be relatively high and advised that action was in hand to increase enforcement of 60kph limit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have subsequently received correspondence giving rise to some doubts about these findings. </PARA>
<PARA> A resident of Kambah has indicated that at the time the traffic surveys were conducted road improvements were being made in the area and there was a noticeable decline in the traffic volume in this period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed that every time traffic survey officers were on the streets it was the Tuesday or Wednesday of an off-pay week. This is felt to be unrepresentative. Pay week or weekend traffic volumes are much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pursuing this with ACT Transport. </PARA>
<PARA> While I believe the problems in Learmonth Drive and Bateman Street arise from developments further away, I am pleased that the Committee has recognised the problem for nearby residents of the estate and look forward to seeing some action to reduce the speed of traffic travelling on these streets. </PARA>

It shows Mr Hawke standing in a puddle of mineral water holding a graph showing rising imports. Mr Keating is standing beside him with two hands and a foot in a dyke trying to stem the importation of mineral water. I will table this cartoon as one of a series of documents which I will be tabling in support of my statements on this occasion. I apologise to the Senate that there is a lot of technical and legal detail in this speech that I am making. I had sought leave to incorporate it but, unfortunately, that leave was denied so I must now proceed to outline it in full. </PARA>
<PARA> The cartoon which I have just tabled is rather prophetic. Our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and our Treasurer (Mr Keating) would not have been in this predicament if the mineral water processing and bottling plant of Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd had not been crippled by fraud and corruption by bankers. In a letter dated 6 February 1986 to the Managing Director of the ICLE bank, Mr Georgie Draskovic, Mr Bruce Naghten had this to say about Huon Valley Springs:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the product Huon Valley Spring Water would have to be by personal and independent assessment a product of higher quality than any other Australian and possibly international mineral waters . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>The bankers fraudulently stripped Huon Valley Springs of its assets, thereby depriving Australia of a world class domestic and export industry. The cartoon could have applied equally to the microwave cookware manufactured by Mighty Chef Products Pty Ltd, the steel framed housing manufactured by Tony Rigg Welding and Manufacturing Pty Ltd and many more. The cartoon is prophetic because unless the Government saves our manufacturing industries from the asset stripping operations of banks, all honourable senators may find themselves with their hands and feet in the dyke trying to stem the importation of many other products besides mineral waters. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now disclose to the Senate and to the Australian people at large the disgraceful saga whereby Huon Valley Springs was crippled financially, stripped of its assets and sold to predetermined parties. Honourable senators will recall that this case was one of the first three of 85 cases that I have now tabled in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985, Durna Proprietary Ltd owned land and a mineral water bottling plant in the Huon Valley, Tasmania. The directors of Durna were Anthony Sofia, Dominic Vizzone and Maxwell Reynolds. The shareholders were family companies of the directors. Mr Reynolds owned adjoining land containing a mineral water spring. The rights to the mineral waters were shared by the three family companies equally. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1985 the parties signed contracts with Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd and its proprietor, Miss Donna Batiste. Durna leased the premises containing the bottling plant to Huon Valley Springs. If Huon Valley went into receivership, Durna had the right to terminate the lease. Clause 6(a) of the agreement for the lease dated 20 September 1985 provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) . . . if the Lessee . . . is placed under . . . receivership then . . . the Lessor may at any time re-enter upon the demised premises . . . and thereupon the term hereby created shall absolutely determine . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table a copy of that document. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this means is that if Huon Valley went into receivership Durna could terminate the lease and prevent the receivers from selling the business as a going concern. That would place Durna in a favoured position to acquire the assets of Huon Valley on its own terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In September 1985 Mr Reynolds granted water rights to Miss Batiste. If Miss Batiste failed to pay the royalties, Mr Reynolds could terminate the agreement. Clause 8.1 of a Mineral Water Agreement, dated 26 September 1985, provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Proprietor shall have the right to terminate this Indenture in the event that . . . the Grantee fail to perform any of their covenants and obligations herein contained PROVIDED THAT . . . written notice of intention to so terminate has been posted . . . and . . . the Grantee . . . have failed to rectify such breach within thirty days . . . </PARA>

Again, that would place Durna in a favoured position to acquire the assets of Huon Valley on its own terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In September 1985, Huon Valley appointed Mr Reynolds to maintain quality control of the mineral water. Clause 12.3 of a consultancy agreement dated 26 September 1985, provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The services to be provided by the Consultant to the Company shall be-(d) to devise and implement all such procedures as may be reasonably necessary to ensure the . . . sterility of mineral water produced and bottled by the Company and to maintain the quality control of the mineral water . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table that document in support. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this means is that Mr Reynolds had the sole responsibility for maintaining the quality control. If Mr Reynolds failed to maintain quality control, contaminated product would have to be withdrawn from the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By mid-October 1985 plant necessary to commence operations had been installed and commissioned. Mr John J. Splatt, Managing Director of Brewers and Bottlers Trading, in a report dated 15 October 1985, reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . each machine is in very good mechanical condition and . . . should settle down and perform well. </PARA>
<PARA>The system of product treatment and filtration appears to be quite good and . . . will be very efficient in relation to both . . . production and quality requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table that report in support. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this means is that the plant was adequate to meet quality requirements. If the mineral water was contaminated, it would result from a failure of Mr Reynolds to properly discharge his duty as quality controller.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Production of mineral water commenced in late October 1985. The Commonwealth Trading Bank, as it then was, granted an overdraft to Huon Valley Springs. The cash flow projection, commencing in October 1985, showed that the overdraft could rise to a debit balance of about $1.2m in November, but sales of product would commence in December estimated at about $1.6m. The debit balance was to be cleared by February 1986. I seek leave to table a cash flow projection in support of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this means is that for Huon Valley Springs to meet its budget and continue to trade, the Trading Bank had to honour cheques drawn against Huon Valley's overdraft account, up to $1.2m, and Mr Reynolds had to maintain quality control so that initial sale of the product would reach $1.6m. Neither of those things happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Development Bank approved a loan to Huon Valley Springs of $500,00 to assist with the reimbursement of building extensions and equipment-I think that means refurbishment. The Development Bank took a registered first equitable mortgage over the assets and undertakings of Huon Valley. The equitable mortgage dated 8 November 1985 provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>2 (i) The moneys hereby secured shall at the option of the Bank . . . immediately become payable and this mortgage shall immediately become enforceable without any demand or notice in each or any of the following events:-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) If the Mortgagor . . . makes default in the payment of moneys hereby secured or any part thereof . . . </PARA>
<PARA>3. At any time the moneys hereby become payable or after this mortgage shall have become enforceable, the Bank . . . may appoint in writing any person to be receiver of the mortgaged premises . . . and such receiver so appointed shall . . . have power:</PARA>
<PARA>(e) to sell . . . all or any of the mortgaged premises either by public auction or private treaty . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table an extract of that equitable mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This means that if Huon Valley defaulted in the payment of any instalment, no matter how small, the Development Bank could appoint receivers without making any demand or giving any opportunity to rectify the default.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The application for finance, dated 1 November 1985, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Instalments of $8,920 covering both principal and interest are to be payable on the first Wednesday of each month of the year. The first instalment is to be met in July 1986 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This meant that, all things being equal, Huon Valley would not have to service instalments of principal or interest until the overdraft account with the Trading Bank had been fully discharged and the business was profitable. The application goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the above repayment instalments, interest charged to the account on the first Wednesday of December 1985 is to be met on the first Wednesday of January 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence, Huon Valley was obliged to make only one payment to the Development Bank before its operations became profitable-that was a payment of $7,708.33 in the first week of January 1986. It also meant that if Huon Valley, for whatever reason, failed to pay $7,708.33 on the appointed day-whether the Development Bank had issued a reminder notice or not-the Bank could thereupon, without issuing any demand or giving any opportunity to Huon Valley to pay the money, appoint receivers to the assets and undertakings of Huon Valley. All the Development Bank had to do was wait for Huon Valley to default and then strip it of its assets. The plot is straight out of the Middle Ages! The measure has now been put in place, and the Bank has proceeded to put it into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The application goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Security is to be given to the Bank . . . and is to comprise-</PARA>
<PARA>(A) Registered First Mortgage by applicant over Registered Lease issued in terms of Agreement dated 26 September 1985 between Durna Pty Limited and applicant . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Development Bank paid $350,000 of the loan funds to Huon Valley on 12 November 1985. The funds were placed on term deposit with the Trading Bank for a period of 181 days precisely, as per the term deposit lodgment authority dated that day. The funds were placed on deposit as a form of security for additional drawings on the overdraft account of Huon Valley Springs. I seek leave to table the term deposit lodgment authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During November 1985, Huon Valley bottled five container loads of mineral water under the quality control supervision of Maxwell Reynolds. In late November and early December 1985, these containers were shipped to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. It was found that each container load of product was contaminated with pieces of particle board. The pieces of masonite in the bottles were clearly visible to any casual observer. The product was manufactured over a period of at least four weeks. Throughout that period, Maxwell Reynolds was in direct personal control of the manufacturing process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of Brewers and Bottlers Trading established that the filtration system was in order. A report to Huon Valley Springs recorded that 90 per cent of the stock shipped to Sydney was contaminated; 40 per cent of the stock shipped to Melbourne was contaminated; and 100 per cent of the stock shipped to Brisbane was contaminated. The stock was not fit for sale and was dumped. Huon Valley Springs had no hope of achieving the estimated sales for December of $1.6m. This means that the mineral water was deliberately sabotaged to cripple Huon Valley Springs. Reynolds had the opportunity and the motive to sabotage the mineral water. I seek leave to table the report from John Della Pietra as annexure `J'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first shipment of contaminated water was dispatched to Sydney on 5 December 1985. By an extraordinary coincidence, the Trading Bank commenced to dishonour cheques drawn on the overdraft account of Huon Valley Springs on that day. Miss Batiste and the management of Huon Valley Springs did not learn of the contamination until 18 December 1985; so they could not have forewarned the bank. Maxwell Reynolds did know of the contamination. He had motive and opportunity to disclose the contamination to the bank and, hence, trigger the process of cheque dishonouring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is curious that the Trading Bank commenced to dishonour cheques drawn on the overdraft account of Huon Valley Springs on 5 December 1985. If the cheques had not been dishonoured, the debit balance of the overdraft account at the close of business on that day would have been $942,105. Every bank statement since that date, up to and including 17 January 1986, shows a debit balance far in excess of that amount. What is more curious is that, in the case of each dishonour, the cheque was debited to the account and then the transaction was reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> That means that the Trading Bank deliberately recorded transactions on the bank statements, discrediting the creditworthiness of Huon Valley Springs. Between 5 December 1985 and 21 January 1986 the Trading Bank recorded 234 reversals spread over 26 separate statements. Page 42 of the bank statements, issued on 27 December 1985, showed an entire page of reversals, totalling 40 in number. </PARA>
<PARA> What is even more extraordinary is that, when each of the 234 reversals was recorded, the Trading Bank held $350,000 on fixed deposit. No part of that sum was released by the Trading Bank to service the dishonoured cheques and, more importantly, no part of that sum was released to pay the $7,708.33 owing to the Development Bank. No part of the $350,000 was released to pay the debt of $7,708. By withholding the $350,000 the Trading Bank was responsible for Huon Valley Springs being in default under its equitable mortgage to the Development Bank. That default led to the appointment of receivers and the eventual sale of the business to a company, being a wholly owned subsidiary of Durna Pty Ltd-that is, the family company of Reynolds, the man in charge of quality control. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that Reynolds crippled the cash flow of Huon Valley Springs by contaminating the mineral water and the Trading Bank prevented Huon Valley Springs from recovering from Reynolds's actions by withholding the money held on deposit. Furthermore, the Trading Bank destroyed Huon Valley's creditworthiness, thereby preventing the raising of alternative finance or the negotiation of a joint venture. I seek leave to table pages 29 to 60 of the Huon Valley Springs bank statements as annexures. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Huon Valley Springs did not make the interest payment to the Development Bank and was in default under the equitable mortgage. On 8 January 1986, a meeting took place between Mr K. Robinson, Acting Assistant General Manager of the Trading Bank, Mr J. Vanner, Deputy Chief Manager, Mr K. Simington, Senior Manager, and Mr J. Cambourn, Solicitor, Legal Department, representing the Trading Bank, and Mr J. Thompson, State Manager, New South Wales, representing the Development Bank. An internal memorandum by Mr Simington dated 9 January 1986 reported on the meeting as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Mr Thompson was informed of our intention to serve demand on both the company and Miss Batiste. He said Commonwealth Development Bank would not serve demand immediately but would wait until being informed that the company proposes to cease operations. Mr Thompson mentioned that if CBA was prepared to underwrite the cost, CDB would be willing to appoint a Receiver if the CBA thought there was a possibility of the company trading out of its difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>This meeting must stand as one of the most extraordinary in the annals of banking in Australia. Mr Simington, the Senior Manager to the Trading Bank, was present at that meeting. He knew that the Trading Bank held the $350,000 on interest bearing deposit. In an internal memorandum, purportedly dated 20 December 1985, Mr Simington said:</PARA>
<PARA>The term deposit is held as security to support advances to Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Development Bank knew that the Trading Bank held the $350,000 on interest bearing deposit. On 12 November 1985 the Development Bank wrote to Huon Valley Springs as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We have today presented your cheque for $350,000 to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Park and Castlereagh Streets, Sydney, New South Wales, for placement in term deposit. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter was signed by Mr M. H. Dublin, for the State Manager, Mr J. Thompson. Mr Thompson was at the meeting. What that means is that management at the most senior level in both banks knew of the default, knew of the $350,000, and did nothing to rectify the matter-a default relating to a mere $7,708.33. What they did was discuss receivership. No wonder Australia is the laughing stock of the world's business community. </PARA>
<PARA> One further matter: the Development Bank made it known that a receiver would be appointed if the company ceased operations. What that means is that Vanner and Simington had the knowledge to pass on to a party who may seek, by fraudulent means, to convince the Development Bank that the company had ceased or would cease operations. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 January 1986, the Trading Bank credited $358,980.52 to the overdraft account of Huon Valley Springs. That sum represented the principal held on interest bearing deposit, $350,000, and interest thereon. The authority relied upon by the Trading Bank to appropriate the funds in reduction of the overdraft account of Huon Valley Springs is dated 13 November 1985, and reads:</PARA>
<PARA>We acknowledge the Bank's existing right at any time without notice to us to apply the whole or any part of the moneys payable in respect of Term Deposit referred to in Acknowledgment No. 1136360 . . . in or towards payment of any balance or balances that may stand to the debit of either or any of our following accounts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The authority does not specify any account or accounts and was left blank. I seek leave to table that authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In other words, the authority was ineffective and the money was transferred without authority. What that means is that the Trading Bank held the funds on deposit until Huon Valley Springs was crippled and then misappropriated the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The deposit of those funds into the overdraft account meant that cheques after that date could be honoured by the Bank. That did not happen. Cheques were still dishonoured until the account was effectively frozen on 21 January 1986. That was blatant fraud. Vanner tried to cover this fraud by telling a blatant lie. In an internal memorandum, dated 20 February 1986, Vanner alleged:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a decision was made to appropriate funds held on term deposit and apply such moneys to the reduction of the O/P/A (overdraft account) on 21 January 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not what the bank statement said. To round off the Trading Bank's disgraceful treatment of Huon Valley Springs, I refer to memoranda of Simington and Vanner: Simington, 14 January 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>Cheques total $7,344.88 as below were held over from 13 January and will be dishonoured today unless cash funds are provided . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Vanner, 15 January 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>The hard line is to be taken. Cheques drawn on the Huon Valley Springs account are to be dishonoured . . . Batiste cannot expect otherwise and she is not worthy of some special treatment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Reynolds, Vanner and Simington had sabotaged the business of Huon Valley Springs. Now the vultures made their move. Durna had applied to the ICLE Bank for finance through investment and development consultant Mr Bruce Naghten Managing Director of ABC Property Planners Pty Ltd. On the day before the Trading Bank froze Huon Valley's account, Naghten wrote to the Managing Director of the ICLE Bank, Mr Georgie Draskovic, relating to a proposed mortgage over the mineral water agreement, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Donna Batiste has the expertise to promote Huon Valley Springs we perceive there are possible dangers in relation to the control of the marketing of the product which will derive the income base by way of the royalty as per volume of extraction. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter went on to envisage a joint venture with Miss Batiste. What this means is that, to better secure the loan from ICLE to Durna, Miss Batiste would have to relinquish control of Huon Valley Springs. I seek leave to table that letter as annexure L. </PARA>

That would necessitate offering a carried equity to Miss Batiste for relinquishing control of the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Trading Bank was an unsecured creditor and stood to lose heavily from the receivership. Therefore, it would be appropriate to offer a carried equity to an affiliate of the Trading Bank and to take over the leases of the plant and equipment by the Trading Bank to Huon Valley Springs. In a memorandum from Reynolds to the Sunday Telegraph, it is recorded that an offer was to be made to Miss Batiste, as follows:</PARA>

<PARA>(c) The connection between ICLE, AEFC and the Commonwealth Bank was evident. </PARA>
<PARA>The reference to AEFC refers to Australian European Finance Corporation Ltd, an Australian resident merchant bank then owned by the Banca Nationale Del Lavoro of Italy and the Commonwealth Bank.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1981 Australia, Belgium and Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the coordination of spare parts procurement and initial aid in the maintenance of the Tank Fire Control System, manufactured by SABCA in Belgium, and common to the Leopard Tank operated by the three countries. This agreement has allowed the transfer of information and technological developments between the three user nations at regular tri-partite Working Group meetings. As a result of successful trials in Australia of the device developed by Mr Scheitler to improve the Tank gun/sight relationship, it was considered that the device may also be able to be sold to Belgium and Canada, thereby creating an export market for the invention, with concomitant benefits of larger royalties for the Commonwealth, and a lower production cost for the relatively low numbers of the item required by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Prior to the issue of Mr Scheitler's invention on loan to the Belgium Army for evaluation, the Commonwealth applied for, and was granted, a Belgian patent for the device. This patent is still in force. Canada has requested a loan of the invention under the auspices of the Quadripartite ABCA organization. Under this agreement, Armies of the participating nations, America, Britain, Canada and Australia, agree to make provision for the reciprocal use of materiel when such usage is in the interest of standardization. Among the conditions governing these standardization loans is the quite specific requirement that the providing Army retain ownership of all patent and manufacturing rights to the materiel.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Government has agreed detailed arrangements as the basis of the new Australian Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme to come into effect on 15 May 1991, the information provided at this time is based on the premise that the final form of the Australian Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme will be embodied in the enabling to be put to Parliament in the current session.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Administration of the scheme is currently under consideration. I will provide a response when that decision has been taken.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Members of the Defence Force will need to complete six years services to be eligible for the loan. Once eligible, the decision as to whether a full or partial advance is sought will be up to the individual.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The current proposal is that members will be able to use the Australian Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme loan for home acquisitions (including home and land acquisitions), extensions, renovations or improvements, or to discharge other loans for these purposes. At the time the Government subsidised loan commences the borrower must occupy the home and must not own another home.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Members who joined the Australian Defence Force prior to 15 May 1985, who are still serving and have not yet exercised their Defence Service Homes entitlement, can elect to forgo that entitlement and instead seek assistance under the new scheme. Subject to passage of the necessary enabling legislation during the Budget Sitting of Parliament, it is proposed that pre-May 1985 members be required to make the election to join the new scheme in the period 1 January 1991 to 30 June 1991. If a member chooses not to make the election they will retain their Defence Service Homes entitlement which can then be taken up under the normal conditions that apply to the Defence Service Homes scheme.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The information to answers parts (a), (c) and (d) of Senator Newman's question as to who has been employed and when the services commenced and finished is contained in appendices A, B, and C for 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90 respectively. Copies available in Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The detailed records required to answer parts (a), (c) and (d) of Senator Newman's question relating to FY 1986/87 are not held in a central location within the Department of Defence due to devolution and revised arrangements for authorising consultancies from 1985 onward. To obtain the information for FY 1986/87 would be time consuming and resource intensive and I am not prepared to undertake this task.</PARA>

<PARA> (h) the sponsor's requirements in relation to the broad content, the format and the number of copies of the final report required;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) any role to be played by the consultant in implementing approved changes (it would be made very clear that in projects which are likely to involve a later implementation phase, selection to carry out the project does not imply any commitment to engage the prospective consultant to carry out subsequent action);</PARA>

<PARA> (k) any necessary background information needed to assist the consultants in preparing their proposal;</PARA>

<PARA> (n) the form in which the consultants should submit their proposals;</PARA>
<PARA> (o) the deadline for submission of proposals; and</PARA>
<PARA> (p) a copy of the proposed contract document.</PARA>
<PARA> Contracts with consultants outline the terms and conditions of the agreement. Where the agreement is simple and straightforward general conditions of contract are used with documents such as purchase orders. With complex consultancies covering major projects, a specific agreement including all the terms of the consultancy is drawn up.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Concerning part (e) of the question, for short term consultancies the charges and fees on which a contract is based are taken as firm for the period of the contract. For longer term engagements (over 12 months) the inclusion of a price variation clause may be justified but would reimburse the consultant only for verifiable cost increases, approved salary movements, increases in air fares, etc during the period of the engagement. Other reasons for varying fees include an approved change in scope of a consultancy or an extension of time. Additional fees would not be paid to a consultant because of failure on the part of the consultant to cost the proposal accurately or for additional work claimed to have been undertaken for which proper authorisation was not obtained in advance. Given these conditions, fees in excess of the accepted quote would be unlikely to be incurred. In view of the large number of contracts entered into during the time span nominated, I am not prepared to undertake a detailed examination of each individual agreement to determine if there are cases of payment of fees in excess of the consultants quote.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2217" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The maximum power of the transmitter will be approximately 500 kilowatts but it will not necessarily be required to operate continuously at maximum power.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is not because of safety that the transmitter will be located at least 25 kilometres from townships. This was an arbitrary distance adopted for planning purposes to minimise the inconvenience of electrical interference. Any such interference, if it occurs, can be attended to and eliminated but it would be uneconomic to do this for built up areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Radiowaves in the frequency range used by the radar have been used for short wave broadcasting since the 1930's, that is about sixty years. Experience in their use, and research findings, have led to various codes of practice related to personnel and environmental health and safety. The most important of these is Australian Standard 2772:1990 which specifies maximum safe levels of exposure to radiation. The transmitter site is planned in accordance with this standard so that all unsafe areas are contained in an inner fenced-off zone of about one hundred hectares in area.</PARA>
<PARA> (4, 5) Given the design standards that are being rigorously adhered to, there is no known reason to believe that there will be ill effects to health and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The OTHR site search area determined in April 1988 covered the whole of the shires of Longreach, Flinders, Aramac and Ilfracombe, the majority of the shires of Dalrymple, Richmond, Winton, Isisford and Barcaldine, and small parts of the shires of Barcoo, Jericho, Blackall, Belyando, Etheridge, McKinlay and Hinchinbrook.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) A possible alternative location for the transmitter was identified in the Ilfracombe area some thirty kilometres east of Longreach. This locality appears to meet the very stringent terrain flatness criteria which are essential for good radar performance. However, the greater separation distance from the receiver site at Stonehenge would result in a performance penalty.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Of the technologies available at this time which may be considered as alternative ways of obtaining surveillance capability (ground based microwave radar, airborne radar or satellites), there is no doubt that OTHR is the most cost effective by a large margin.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) In this respect it is no different to every other military installation and many civilian facilities throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Landholders affected by the buffer zones will be compensated under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1989. The amount of compensation for purchase of any land would be a matter for negotiation between the landholder and the Australian Property Group. Payment would be made at settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Commonwealth would grant a long term lease to the former landholder if so desired by him.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The contention that there has been a lack of consultation and negotiation is incorrect. There has been extensive consultation and negotiation with State and local government and members of the public. Information about the project has been actively promulgated through the local newspaper and radio stations. Three public meetings have been held at the Longreach Council Chambers and there have been numerous discussions with landholders and others over a period of more than a year.</PARA>
