<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the comments made by the British Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, in Cairo that Saddam Hussein may have to be forced from Kuwait at the point of a gun, I ask: What is the current assessment of the Australian Government as to the effectiveness of the current sanctions? Does Australia believe that greater pressure should be applied and, if so, what? How many Australians are currently being held against their will in Kuwait and Iraq?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3001" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the last question, the situation is that the numbers of Australians actually restrained from leaving-in effect held in Iraq and Kuwait against their will-are 15 and 17 respectively. The number of Australians actually in detention in Iraq is just one, and in Kuwait just one-the two who have been mentioned in public comment on a number of previous occasions. There is a larger number of other Australian passport holders-about the same number again in Iraq and Kuwait respectively-but they are largely people of Iraqi or Kuwaiti origin who, to our knowledge, have no inclination to leave and, for that reason, are not being held against their will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general situation in the Gulf at the moment is not, in my assessment, such as to make us believe that military action will be necessary, although it remains the case-as the Australian Government has said from the outset-that the military strike option must be kept open as an option in the event that sanctions and related peaceful means of resolving the crisis do not work. I understand the British Foreign Secretary to be saying no more than that-that should peaceful means prove not to work, then of course the military option will be contemplated. I understand American spokesmen to have said nothing different from that; nor, as I say, have Australian spokesmen-myself, the Prime Minister or anybody else. We all wish that the strike option can be avoided because the downside consequences of that are very significant, but if it comes to that-and nobody at this stage wants to indicate the timing within such a decision may have to be made-that course of action will just have to be confronted. What is clear is that Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to win, cannot be allowed to win by default.</PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, having said all that, I do strongly believe that the various Allied forces are all, at the moment, committed to securing a result by peaceful outcomes if that is humanly possible. In my judgment, nobody is pressing for a military strike option in advance of its becoming clear that peaceful means will not succeed.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as sanctions are concerned, my assessment of the situation, following again another very substantial round of discussions in New York and Washington in recent days, is that there is a belief that sanctions can and will bite. The emphasis should not be placed solely on foodstuffs, but on industrial consumables, spare parts, and things generally to keep the transport and industrial infrastructure going. Things as different as water purification chemicals, not just for potable water but also for industrial processes to avoid the mineralisation of pipes and things of that kind, batteries, ball-bearings, and a whole variety of other things of this kind are already in very short supply and there is a reasonable expectation that shortages of this kind will before very much longer start having a dramatic effect. It is very difficult to be precise about when that effect will show up or when it will be perceived as inevitable, which is also something we are trying to create in terms of perception. But for the moment there are strong grounds for believing that the sanctions course, around which the world is holding together in a very united way, will be successful.</PARA>
<PARA> It may need to be accompanied by some appropriate negotiations on matters which are legitimately negotiable. It is very clear that a number of matters are not legitimately negotiable because they would undermine the basic objectives which this exercise is all about. But things such as the future security environment of the Middle East area are manifestly things which can be the subject of discussion. It may be that those sorts of things can come into the process at some appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be quite inappropriate to be foolishly optimistic about the environment in the Gulf. It is much too dangerous, much too critically poised, and the stakes are much too high for any easy assumptions of any kind about the future course of these events. But I do, as I say, remain personally quite optimistic that the course on which the world is embarked can bear appropriate fruit-peace without appeasement-and without there needing to be recourse to military action. But that option must, I repeat, be maintained as very much part of the allied armoury in the event that that more confident prediction does not in fact eventuate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to reports that Israel has refused to cooperate with a decision by the United Nations Secretary-General to send a mission to the region to report on the deaths of over 20 Palestinian demonstrators in East Jerusalem on 8 October, despite the fact that the mission has been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council over the weekend. What is the Government's reaction to the Israeli decision?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3002" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government welcomes the terms of United Nations Security Council resolution No. 672, which the Security Council adopted unanimously on 13 October in response to the deaths, as Senator McKiernan has said, of more than 20 Palestinian demonstrators in East Jerusalem on 8 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resolution does several things. It expresses alarm at the violence which occurred, pointing out that it involved not only death and injury to Palestinians, but injury to innocent worshippers as well-a clear reference to the Jewish worshippers at the Wailing Wall. It condemns especially the acts of violence committed by the Israeli security forces. It calls upon Israel to abide scrupulously by its obligations and responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which is applicable to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967. It welcomes the decision by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to send a mission to the region to report on the violence, and it requests the Secretary-General to report his findings to the Security Council by the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government, in a statement by the Acting Foreign Minister, Dr Blewett, has deplored the deaths which resulted from the violence in the past week, and I do so again. My Department has in recent days called in the Israeli Ambassador to impress upon him our deep and serious concern in this respect. Whatever the provocation-and there undoubtedly was provocation from the Palestinian demonstrators-the response of the Israeli authorities was wholly, and tragically, disproportionate.</PARA>
<PARA> We support the Secretary-General's mission as a means of defusing the current highly-charged situation in the occupied territories, which could easily produce more needless deaths. We are, therefore, extremely disappointed that Israel has refused to cooperate with the Secretary-General's mission. The Israeli decision is simply not helpful to progress in the resolution of the Palestinian problem, either in the short or the long term. We urge the Israeli Government to reconsider its position.</PARA>
<PARA> I can say, a little more generally, that the Security Council's unanimous decision in relation to the Secretary-General's mission does reflect the Council's enhanced authority in dealing with key global and regional issues such as the situation in the Middle East. This decision, and indeed the Security Council's several resolutions during the past 10 weeks in relation to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, do give us reason to hope that we are beginning a new phase in international cooperation; in fact a new world order, if that spirit of cooperation can be sustained. I have to say in this respect that Israel's negative response to the SecretaryGeneral's mission does stand in contrast with these new international norms of cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA> Israel, and friends of Israel, know that the Palestinian problem cannot forever be wished away. Demographic and strategic imperatives demand that it be addressed, and addressed sooner rather than later. It is very much in Israel's own interest that it be addressed in a climate of reconciliation rather than hatred, of international cooperation rather than confrontation. The kind of unapologetic, defensive and negative reflex reaction that we have seen from Israel over the last few days will simply not do anything to help establish that kind of climate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In supporting the Government's decision to accept a 20 per cent carbon dioxide reduction during the next 15 years, I recognise that for such a significant decision to be taken, considerable detailed investigation was necessary. Accordingly, can the Minister advise: first, what is the priority status for dealing with the various sources of emission; and, secondly, what revised funding will be provided for all the extra research that will be necessary if the changes are to be accomplished in accordance with the timetable to which we are now committed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the last 12 to 18 months the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council has been looking at this question, as have the energy Ministers. During that time, a consultancy for the environment Ministers commissioned from Jenny Green provided some valuable information on the way we might go in this debate. The energy Ministers also have done some work on this question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I imagine that the exact decisions about which areas will be targeted first will come about only after discussion with the States. Obviously, the States will have a crucial role to play in this. Those discussions are yet to take place. Both environment Ministers and energy Ministers would have a hand in them. I would not have thought it appropriate to try to pre-empt those discussions. Nonetheless, there are a number of ways, particularly in the use of energy in households, that we can attack the problem fairly cheaply and fairly quickly while making significant contributions to the reductions which these targets call for. I imagine that they are high on the priority list of environment and energy Ministers. I shall endeavour to keep the Senate informed on those discussions as they take place over the course of the next six to 12 months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister completely failed to answer the second half of my question about what revised funding will be provided for all the extra research that will be necessary. He also raised the matter of the consultancy. Are we to be privy to the suggestions made by the consultancy? Also, have the States-he referred to them being included in this-agreed to participate and to fund in some way?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3003" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To the best of my memory that consultancy to which I referred was made public nearly a year ago, but I will check on that. On the assumption that there is no objection, and I cannot imagine there would be, we will have a copy sent around to the honourable senator as soon as we can. In terms of funding, the honourable senator will also be aware of the very significant funding which the Prime Minister announced last year for greenhouse research, which will place Australia in the forefront of greenhouse research right around the world. I do not believe that is the end of the funding on greenhouse questions and on research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is appropriate now for us to be setting levels. But rather, as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and whatever consultants or State energy commissions come up with during the course of the next few years, we will certainly have to look to extra funding. It is a matter of assessing those requests as they come in. We have set up a greenhouse committee of very prominent, eminent scientists and I think they will be better at assessing these claims than we are. So I am sure that that is where they will go.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of claims that the rock music industry in Australia has achieved export earnings for Australia to the value of some $90m this year? Can the Minister advise what the comparison is to export earnings from opera, ballet or the more conservative forms of the arts in Australia? If the rock music industry earnings, which have increased some 100 per cent in the past two years, are exporting to such an increased market, what plans are there for expanding Government assistance to rock music organisations, such as Export Music Australia or Ausmusic, to take advantage of the huge overseas demand for Australian rock music?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3004" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht's tie seems to have encouraged as much interest as the ballet, for example, or perhaps the opera. I confirm to the Senate that the music industry is aggressively marketing its products overseas. Senator Schacht pointed out that export earnings by the Australian rock music industry will amount to $90m this year. I can just give you some examples of success by Australian bands, such as INXS, which is currently at the top of the American charts and is also exporting Australian rock to the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Schacht asked about the more traditional performing arts companies, such as the opera and the ballet. I am not able to answer that part of the question in full, except to say that the Australian Ballet deservedly has a very fine reputation overseas for the quality and imaginativeness of its performances, and it has just recently had a very successful tour of the United States. I am unable to make any equally charitable remarks about Australian opera.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But that may be based on ignorance, as some interjector friend at the back of me just said. However, the facts are that the popular music industry has much greater potential for continued growth in its export earnings. For example, last week there was a presentation of a master copy of a television program featuring Australian recording artists to be shown on Soviet television. Soviet radio is already playing 24 hours of Australian popular music each month to an audience of an estimated 280 million people. The Australian singer, Gyan, is already a very popular figure in the Soviet Union. Soviet television will be showing a number of programs by Australian recording artists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Schacht asked about funding. These initiatives have been jointly funded by Austrade and Export Music Australia, which was started with some Government assistance but which is now a private sector organisation. Both Austrade and Export Music Australia recognise that there will be no quick return on their investment in the Soviet market, but they are working to generate a demand for Australian music which will put our industry in a good position when the Soviet Union is in a position to trade in hard currency.</PARA>
<PARA> Export opportunities are not just there for the asking. As in every industry they have be looked for, and companies have to be willing to invest both time and money in new markets. The popular music industry has shown a commendable initiative in doing that, not just in the market to which I have referred, but also in Europe, and of course it has had some considerable success in North America.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade seen reports from Amnesty International of human rights abuses being committed by both the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA), including torture, police threats, assaults, extrajudicial executions and deaths in custody? Has the Minister also seen recent media reports that the blockade of Bougainville has not been lifted, resulting in a drastic reduction in the supply of food and medicines there? If so, has the Minister raised these concerns with the Papua New Guinea Government, or does he intend to do so? If these concerns have been raised, what was its response?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3005" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just seen the report this morning. It was tabled before the joint committee during my absence overseas. I have not had time to study it in any detail yet, but certainly I will do so. I understand that the abuses referred in the report are in the main those which characterise that very unhappy period early this year when the PNGDF was still stationed on Bougainville, although I understand there are also reports of continuing abuses committed by the BRA. Naturally, we deplore those continuing abuses, although it is not the case that the PNG Government can be in any way regarded as responsible for them. We simply hope that the resolution of the overall problem on Bougainville will resolve that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to raising specific human rights concerns of the kind that are addressed in the Amnesty report with the PNG Government, the situation is as follows: both the Prime Minister and I have raised the issue with the PNG Government on a number of occasions at the highest levels, emphasising the need for investigations and appropriate disciplinary action against those who may be responsible. Most recently in September, the Prime Minister discussed our concerns with Prime Minister Namaliu and senior Ministers during his visit to Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA> The PNG Government has acknowledged that abuses have occurred on Bougainville. It has undertaken investigations, but there are difficulties, it has to be acknowledged, in pursuing some of those allegations because of the continuation of the dispute over Bougainville and the unavailability of witnesses to be interviewed. Nonetheless, 67 cases have been listed before the National Court in Rabaul and they are being handled by the Public Solicitor's Office, with the first preliminary hearing set for a couple of days ago-12 October. I am not sure what the outcome of that hearing was. During the endeavour talks, the PNG Government proposed the involvement of the International Commission of Jurists to assist investigations into human rights abuses by both sides, but I understand the BRA did not agree to that.</PARA>
<PARA> It remains an important objective of Australian assistance to the PNG security forces to provide training to ensure discipline and an environment in which respect for human rights is upheld. All I can say in response to the question generally is that it is an issue which we are very conscious of and will pursue with vigour and consistency so far as the PNG Government is concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may get a few guffaws from the other side, but it is a very important matter as far as the micro- economic reform of the Australian economy is concerned. I was very pleased this morning to officiate at an extremely important occasion in Port Botany in Sydney when National Terminals (Australia) Ltd announced the major upgrade of its container facility at Port Botany. This upgrade will involve a total expenditure of $60m at the container terminal, $40m of which will have been spent before the end of next year. It is a very significant addition to waterfront reform in Australia as it will make the container terminal in Senator Loosley's home port of Sydney the largest container terminal in Australia. But more importantly, the renovated terminal will have the capacity to reduce the turnaround times of shipping in that port by 40 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Parer's interjection, the Opposition's sole contribution to the debate on waterfront reform, apart from constant knocking, has been an absolute tirade of misinformation from the shadow Minister, Mr Sharp, who does not seem to be able to get anything right in the statements he puts out on this important issue. What Mr Sharp and those with him have consistently said-and they have a mindset on it-is that there can be no significant improvement in waterfront reform in Australia without a stoush. That is what they want-a fight; prolonged industrial action so that they can demonstrate that the Government's agenda of negotiated settlements on the waterfront will be a failure.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Hill's interjection, we constantly hear from them about following the example of Great Britain and New Zealand by declaring war on the unions, and that this is the only way to fix it up. One could fairly ask the question: Why will National Terminals be spending $60m on a major upgrade of a terminal facility? The reason is that as a direct result of the Government's waterfront reform program National Terminals is in a position to demonstrate a significant degree of confidence in the future of waterfront reform. At the time that I announced a $60m upgrade for the facility in Sydney, I was also in the happy position to announce that agreement has been reached between National Terminals and the waterfront unions on enterprise agreements for the ports of Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are only minor drafting alterations to be made to the agreement and the sending of that agreement to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority for its assessment is now imminent. All major issues have been agreed and only minor drafting changes now need to be made. The parties to this agreement have estimated the productivity gains to be made from these agreements to be in the vicinity of 30 per cent in the port of Melbourne and some 60 per cent in terms of productivity improvements in the port of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been six months of very intense and difficult negotiation considering that it is the first time for some 50 years that any attempt has been made by any government in this country to reform the waterfront. The Inter-State Commission, after a detailed examination of the waterfront industry, pointed out what I thought was a fairly accurate observation; that is, that the industry was not about to reform itself. As I said to the participants in this morning's procedures at Port Botany, it is not correct simply to assume that the Government is the prime player or the only player in this area. There is a certain mindset about that that is the case. All that any government can do is to provide the right environment for the participants in this major Australian industry to take the opportunities provided.</PARA>
<PARA> As Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, I am delighted that National Terminals has taken this opportunity, that agreements for the ports of Sydney and Melbourne have been concluded between that company and the unions, and that as a direct result of those agreements being achieved-although with difficulty, peaceably-National Terminals is prepared to put its money where its mouth is and, in addition to the agreements being negotiated, has announced a $60m upgrade for its terminal facility, which will result in significant improvements in the productivity of the port of Sydney.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report to which Senator Crowley refers. I have also seen the allegation that the scientists have breached the guidelines established for genetic research. By way of background-in March this year the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee was advised by the Adelaide University biohazards committee that there had been a breach of GMAC's safety guidelines for research involving genetic modification. This emanated from a project involving the Adelaide University research team and a South Australian company. Shortly after this-and I am sure this has led to the media interest-the Australian Conservation Foundation issued a press release claiming that there had been an unauthorised release of transgenic pigs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The project that is the subject of this particular problem is one that was meant to produce pigs with superior quality meat and rapid growth for sale weight. It had been partly funded by grants by the  Industrial Research and Development Board-which is the responsibility of Senator Button-and compliance with GMAC guidelines was a condition of the grants.</PARA>
<PARA> I had these reports brought to my notice, and at my instigation the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee inquired into the incident and has provided me with a report, as is indicated in the Sydney Morning Herald article. GMAC found that a total of 67 genetically modified pigs had been transported from experimental facilities to abattoirs between May 1988 and March 1989 and that the guidelines were breached when the principal investigators failed to inform the biohazards committee of the intention to transport these pigs.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that, in the event, all other appropriate procedures were followed. All the pigs transported were slaughtered. There were no escapes and there was no interbreeding with non-transgenic animals. I am sure that Senator Button will be pleased to know that the meat was also cleared and assessed by the food science and technology committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council, using information supplied by the company. The meat was also considered to be fit for human consumption, with approval being gained from the South Australian Health Commission and the Department of Agriculture. GMAC accepted that those involved acted in good faith in the belief that the necessary government approvals and clearances had been obtained. The breach, therefore, was found to be due to a failure of communication between the biohazards committee, the researchers and the company.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot be absolutely precise on what role the Commonwealth would play in its implementation, given that the strategy to which Senator Watson refers is, of course, a strategy concluded at State level in Tasmania-and concluded, moreover, between the State parties in the form of all of those groups the honourable senator referred to in his question. I can say, however, that last year the Commonwealth agreed to assist Tasmania in terms of forestry because of the World Heritage listing in the western side of Tasmania and because of the decision of the Commonwealth to support an area of World Heritage listing arising from the report of the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. We decided last year to assist Tasmania with financial support for afforestation programs; programs aimed at encouraging a better yield of sawlog from forest; programs aimed at providing for better technology and thus better recovery of millable material from logs which might ordinarily not go to the mill; and a whole program of support for access into areas of the forest.</PARA></TALK.START>

The community consultation process is managed by a three-member panel led by Mr Bob Lansdown, the former Chairman of the National Capital Development and Planning Authority, and other members are Dr Deidre Jordan, the Chancellor of Flinders University, and Dr David Wilmuth, Associate Director of Victoria University of Technology. The consultation process will involve a range of activities in Adelaide and in other major cities throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

These submissions will form an important input to a progress report to the Commonwealth and South Australian governments in December 1990. During the final stages of the feasibility project the panel will make a comprehensive report to the Government on its findings, which will be a major input into the Government's final decision on the project.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources. Is the Minister aware that areas in Western Australia subject to exploration or mining claims for mineral sands include most of the coastal strip from Perth south to Dunsborough, and from Augusta east almost to Esperance, and that this includes parts of the D'Entrecasteaux and Fitzgerald River National Parks as well as State forests, nature reserves and freehold land? In view of the fact that the flora of the south coast is highly significant-much of it growing only in restricted areas and most of it highly susceptible to dieback, which already poses a conservation risk, and is likely to be spread further by mining operations-will the Minister give his assurance that he will use the Government's export control powers to ensure that no national parks, nature reserve, areas with wilderness values or areas listed on the Register of the National Estate will be mined?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that the opening parts of this question seem to equate exploration with mining and/or the pegging of claims with mining. It should be said for the record that in most cases where exploration occurs-or, indeed, where claims are filed-very little mining follows, and certainly it is not automatic. It depends on what the nature of the discoveries might be. However, the exploration and granting of mining leases is not a matter within the purview of the Commonwealth Government; it is, indeed, a matter for the State Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If as a result of exploration any claims were developed which lead to proposals for mining developments concerning mineral sands, and the output of that mining development were to be exported, then the export control powers of the Commonwealth would come into play and we, as the Commonwealth Government, would have a role. Therefore, before a mineral sands export project could be granted export approval and be allowed to proceed, it would be subject to environmental assessment in terms of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and, where relevant and if necessary, the Australian Heritage Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be said that the mineral sands industry is now subject to the most stringent environmental and rehabilitation conditions at both State and Commonwealth levels. Indeed, in many instances the industry has demonstrated both a willingness and an ability to successfully rehabilitate mined areas.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that answers the question, but I should say that the mineral sands industry, most of which is located in Western Australia, makes a significant contribution to the economy, with exports valued at around $700m in 1988-89, with this forecast to rise to around $1.2 billion by 1992, including through investment in value-added production.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of this problem because Senator Maguire gave me notice of his question. I have been provided with the following answer: the occupational superannuation standards legislation administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission requires a fund wishing to benefit from tax concessions for the relevant year of income to be maintained for the purpose of providing benefits for members or dependants in the event of members' retirement, resignation or death. This type and range of superannuation benefits provided by an employer is a matter for the employer to determine. However, when a superannuation arrangement is established the occupational superannuation standards legislation requires that certain components of benefits be fully vested in the member and, therefore, no deductions can be made from them. In particular, the legislation requires that a benefit arising from member contributions and employer award contributions must be fully vested in the member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the legislation currently does not require vesting of non-award employer-financed benefits, the Government announced in 1989 that it intends introducing into the legislation, with effect from 1995, a requirement for full vesting of the employer-financed benefit after 10 years' membership. The level of voluntary vesting of the employer-financed element in a particular case, and the extent to which that may be varied at the discretion of the trustee, will depend on the provisions of the fund's governing rules. Any concerns about a fund's compliance with the standards or about the adequacy of existing standards should be brought to the attention of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to give an answer to a question asked last week by Senator Walters about delays in the child support scheme. I am very pleased to say that delays have, contrary to Senator Walters's assertion, considerably shortened since I became Minister for Social Security. But I will not take sole credit for this, as it was the Government's decision to provide additional resources for the Child Support Agency to remove backlogs in processing. My colleagues the Treasurer and Senator McMullan have also taken a strong interest in the performance of the Agency which, as honourable senators will be aware, is in the Australian Taxation Office and not in my portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year there were problems of delays in the Child Support Agency due to lack of resources. The problem came to light earlier this year and I acknowledged it in the Senate on 29 May. As announced on 31 May, the Government provided major increases in resources for the Agency to clear the backlogs. I am pleased to say that the backlogs have now been cleared. The Agency has advised that 85 per cent of applications are now assessed and registered by the Agency within 28 days. There are particular reasons-generally awaiting information from clients-for cases that go over 28 days.</PARA>
<PARA> A separate issue is the structural delay of eight weeks for the first payment to be made. This is due to the arrears method of collection; that is, child support assessed for the first month is not due until the seventh of the next month. The Department of Social Security then deposits the money in the custodial parent's bank account on the first Wednesday of the following month. As Senator Walters appears to be confused about this issue, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an example.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The example read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>* A child support liability assessed for the month of October is not due from the non-custodial parent until the 7th of November and is paid out on the 5th of December.</PARA>
<PARA>* Provided a non-custodial parent pays his or her child support obligations regularly and on time, then this is a `once-off' delay and payments are made regularly after that.</PARA>
<PARA>* During this period if a custodial parent is a sole parent pensioner then he or she will receive all the pension to which they are entitled, ie pension is not reduced for child support until the first payment is actually received.</PARA>
<PARA>* On the question of interest, payments received by the child support agency are paid into the child support trust account. The trust account, in itself, does not earn interest. The account forms part of the Commonwealth public account. The budget as a whole gets the benefit of interest on cash balances in the Commonwealth public account and other benefits in terms of reduced Government borrowings and subsequent reduced public debt interest.</PARA>
<PARA>* This initial delay should be put in context:</PARA>
<PARA> -Comparable delays in the court processes which existed before the scheme began could be much longer;</PARA>
<PARA> -Custodial parents who have money collected through the agency have a significantly increased prospect of receiving regular and ongoing payments, ie before the scheme began only 30% of custodial parents received payments, whereas now the agency collects 70% of liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Success of the Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>* The legislation itself is fundamentally sound and there have been only 125 appeals in more than 18,000 assessments after one year of operation. Most of these have been about the facts of the case not about the formula assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>* There are more than 90,000 sole parent pensioners declaring receipt of maintenance and this number continues to rise by about 1000 a month.</PARA>
<PARA>* There have been major increases in the levels of child support:</PARA>
<PARA> - The average level of court orders per child per week has risen from $27 in April 1988 to $39 in February 1990</PARA>
<PARA> - Under stage 2 the average amount of assessments per child has risen from $46 in 1989/90 to $49 in 1990/91.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The documents I have tabled are as follows: the annual report for the year ended 30 June 1988, together with the director's report and auditor's report, which documents were filed with the Corporate Affairs Commission on 12 September 1989; the balance sheet, profit and loss account, and notes to the accounts for the year ended 30 June 1988, which documents were filed with the Corporate Affairs Commission on 12 September 1989; particulars of charge in favour of Westpac Banking Corporation created on 31 March 1987; memorandum of priority in favour of Westpac Banking Corporation granted on 29 April 1987; particulars of charge in favour of Placer Industries Ltd created on 29 April 1987; particulars of charge in favour of the Commonwealth of Australia created on 29 June 1988; notice of appointment of receiver on 20 April 1990; report as to affairs as at 20 April 1990 sworn by director, Wayne Kenneth Turl; and an assistance agreement and charge between the Commonwealth of Australia and Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, which I understand was previously tabled in Committee of the Whole on 25 May 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These documents clearly show that prior to the signing of the assistance agreement on 29 June 1988, securities existed in favour of Westpac Banking Corporation and Placer Industries Ltd. Westpac's charge secured the borrowings of other companies in the group, and was additionally cross-collateralised over the assets. In short, the liabilities and assets of the group were as one. The Commonwealth's loan was also secured, but this ranked behind the other two and was not cross-collateralised. </PARA>
<PARA> From 29 June 1988 to 20 April 1990, the Government advanced $4.5m in interest free loans to the company as well as making some $3.1m in grants in accordance with clause 2 subclause 1 paragraph (b) of the assistance agreement. The accounts show that as at 30 June 1988, Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd had $6,535,719 in non-current liabilities, of which $2,335,719 was owed to other companies within the group. A further $2,040,001 was owed to secured creditors other than the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> As at 20 April 1990 when the company was put in receivership, $4.2m remained outstanding to the Commonwealth and $2,229,000 to Westpac. Instead of being a borrower from other companies within the group however, Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd was owed $3,024,000 by associated companies, all of which was considered irrecoverable. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that there was a net movement of $5,359,719 of loan funds out of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd to associated companies during that 22-month period. In addition, there was an increase in the face value of investments in companies within the group by $400,084 from $2,173,916 to $2,574,000. This latter item may be accounted for by a retention of profits but could equally have been an injection of additional capital and therefore requires further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the assistance agreement was to retool the mill to accept pinewoods, and to provide operational subsidies to protect the jobs of 40 mill workers. In spite of this, however, the mill is in receivership and the retooling is still incomplete. In fact, the Commonwealth has recently made another grant of $500,000 to finish the job. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of contrary evidence, these facts, combined with the movements in the loan and capital accounts, lead to the distinct possibility that at least $5,359,719 and perhaps as much as $5,759,803 may have been misappropriated out of the company. I say that because large portions of this money should have remained in Ravenshoe instead of going to Sydney-at least that was the intention of the assistance agreement. When the Commonwealth's money is not spent as intended, one must suspect it has been misappropriated, either by negligence or other means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now accepts that the $4.2m in loan moneys will not be recovered. In addition, there is the $3.1m of grants to be considered too. What the Government cannot say is where that money went. As late as the 18th of last month, Senator Richardson stated before Estimates Committee C that Mrs Kelly had not ascertained what had happened to the Commonwealth's money. How could this happen? How could more than $5m disappear from a company in less than two years, right from under the Government's nose? The answer to these questions lies in the Government's loan documents and the gross ministerial and departmental negligence that accompanied their preparation. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the assistance agreement nor the charge required the company to present in a timely fashion quarterly or half-yearly reports. The only such obligation was under clause 9 of the assistance agreement for the company to provide an annual balance sheet and profit and loss account as soon as they were completed. In fact, for most of the period in question, the company was substantially in default of its obligations under the Companies Code. The 1988 annual accounts were not filed with Corporate Affairs until 12 September 1989-over 14 months after year end. The 1989 annual accounts were not completed at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The loan documents also lacked negative covenants to prevent loans being made to associated companies without approval. Moreover, the Commonwealth failed to take securities over the assets of associated companies as other lenders did. Such terms are normal in commercial loans for large sums of money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be embarrassed too, Senator Richardson, if I were the Minister responsible. This means that the Commonwealth had no way of preventing the misuse of its $7.6m loan and grant funds, nor did it have any chance of recovering them after the act. In fact, the Government did not apparently have any idea at all what was going on. That is why, according to the company's records, the Commonwealth is owed a further $300,000 in unpaid taxes for the year ended 30 June 1989. That is also why $600,000 is owed to trade creditors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I still believe that the mill at Ravenshoe is viable, even if the governmental incompetence in these loan documents does not help. I believe, however, that the time has come for the Government to make good the money owed to unsecured creditors and to come clean on details of this affair. I therefore call on Senator Richardson to explain how so much money disappeared from Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd when the Commonwealth should have been monitoring its operations. I also call for the tabling of all correspondence between the receivers and the Government regarding the mill, which I believe may disclose further irregularities in these transactions. Honourable senators, the people deserve to know the facts regarding this shameful affair.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ever since I have been elected to this chamber, I have been trying to find out some information on what happened to the $7.6m of taxpayers' money that was granted and lent to this particular mill. I have asked a number of questions, some on notice. I raised the matter with Senator Richardson in Estimates Committee C and it just seems to be impossible to get a reply from the Government as to what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Estimates Committee C on 18 September, Senator Richardson indicated, as did senior public servants, that they would know all when a report was received from the receiver-manager and they indicated that they expected that report in a couple of days. On 25 September 1990 in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) interview on the 7.30 Report the announcer indicated that he had been advised by the receiver-manager that the report had been sent to the Government some 10 days previously; that is, on 15 September. Subsequent to that, I have asked the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) whether he received the report and, if so, what was in it. If what was in it was not satisfactory to the Government, I then wanted the Minister to indicate whether he would institute a full and complete inquiry into the subject, which he did. He said that he would, in fact, have a complete inquiry if those things did not come out of the report from the receiver-manager. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister indicated in answer to my question last Thursday that he would seek advice from the responsible Minister, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, as to whether that report had been received. The ABC was able to tell me and the whole of Australia on 25 September that the report went 10 days ago, but so far this Minister has not been able to obtain from Mrs Kelly whether or not that report has been received. If it has been received, why can we not be told what is in it?</PARA>
<PARA> All of the questions that I, Senator O'Chee and Senator Boswell have raised on this issue may well have a very simple answer. The answer may be in the reports, figures and statements of the receiver-manager, but we are never going to know that unless we find out from the Government whether it has received the report and what is in the report. If what is in the report is not sufficient for its needs, when will it conduct a full, open and frank inquiry into the advances and loans, which the Minister has indicated he will do?</PARA>
<PARA> I know that this is annoying Senator Richardson and that he has been fairly helpful in the past, but he could save himself, the Government and this chamber a lot of trouble if he would answer the questions, let us know whether that report has been received, and let us have a look at the report so that we can find out what has happened to $7.6m of taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 September I asked Senator Collins, as Minister responsible for the northern part of Australia, exactly the same question, when we would get the report, as have Senator Macdonald and Senator O'Chee. The advice given then was that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, wrote to the receiver-manager on 19 June. On 27 June the receiver-manager wrote to Mrs Kelly to advise her that he could not meet the requirement at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 18 September, both Senator Macdonald and I at Estimates Committee C put Senator Richardson and Dr Andy Turner through a fairly vigorous question time. We were told then that the receiver's report would be due in a matter of days-within a short time. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What is `shortly'? Is it a week or two weeks?</PARA>
<PARA>The doctor told us that it would be a `matter of days'. Last Friday Senator Macdonald again asked for a response on when the report was due. Up till this stage we have not received any response from the Government. I think that the Senate should be indebted to Senator O'Chee for his investigative abilities. He has gone back to the annual accounts, the reports of receivers and to the Corporate Affairs Commission in delving into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee makes a very serious allegation. It relates to over $5m. I believe that I can establish the allocation of another $1m by Senator Richardson to the sawmill, and quite rightly so, as the Government's response in providing the 48 mill workers at Ravenshoe with a future and a living. However, that money should have been spent on that mill. Senator O'Chee's investigations point out that that money has not gone to that mill. It may have gone to other mills. It may have gone to the other sawmills owned by that company. It is a very serious allegation that we in the Senate are faced with today. Where has the money that was allocated to ensure that the Ravenshoe mill workers were to have a future and a job gone?</PARA>
<PARA> We have been continually seeking that information since 14 September, and even longer. No longer can we be fobbed off as this Government has been doing for four or five months. I urge Senator Richardson to make a statement today, to put the matter clearly on the table and to let the Senate and the people know where the money that was allocated to Ravenshoe has gone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give an answer, at least in part, to the concerns that honourable senators have expressed. Following World Heritage listing, the Government decided that the best way to assist the Ravenshoe community was to keep that mill going, rather than close it down. Nothing that has happened subsequently would make us change our mind. Therefore, an assistance grant was negotiated by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before that took place, there were two independent studies of the viability of a retooled sawmill. They were considered by ACIL Australia Pty Ltd and Price Waterhouse. An interdepartmental committee was established to oversee the implementation of the structural adjustment package. It determined the parameters of negotiations with the Associated Plywoods Sales (APS) sawmill, and negotiations took place. The legal agreement, which was finally signed, was prepared by the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement contained a series of conditions. They included retooling the sawmill, maintaining a work force of at least 40 people, making good operating losses, meeting taxation and stamp duties levied on assistance, paying plantation timber royalties, using timbers only obtained from outside the World Heritage area, submitting audited balance sheets and annual reports to the Department as soon as they were completed, executing a floating charge over its assets in favour of the Commonwealth and obtaining 20 years guaranteed access to plantation timbers from the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department's monitoring of the sawmill's operation prior to the holding company going into receivership found that all the above conditions were met. Officers of the Department's Cairns office made a number of visits to the sawmill during the period. The sawmill work force remained at over 40 all of the time and in 1990 had grown to over 50. The first loan repayment was made on time and the sawmill apparently made a small profit for the financial year ended 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The holding company's first financial statement in June 1988 was completed in December 1988 and was received by the Department in June 1989, prior to making the first subsidy payment. This statement was audited by the chartered accountants Parkhills BDO, 96 Phillips Street, Parramatta. The next audited financial statement was due to be completed in December 1989 and would have been received by the Department before the second full subsidy became due. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department wrote to the holding company on 28 March 1990 before the holding company advised the Government that it was seeking a buyer and before receivers were appointed to the company to initiate an audit of the holding company's expenditure on the APS sawmill by the Department's accounting advisers, Price Waterhouse. However, before that review was completed, the holding company was placed in the hands of the receiver. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) wrote to that receiver-manager on 19 June and 14 September this year, seeking details of how the Commonwealth assistance had been used. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now received an interim report from the receiver, who is also using Price Waterhouse. This interim information has been examined by the Minister's department, which considers that the Commonwealth assistance provided to the holding company has not yet satisfactorily been accounted for. The Minister is referring the matter to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to investigate whether the Commonwealth can take legal action with respect to the moneys unaccounted for. It is not possible to release that report now, for two reasons: firstly, it is commercial-in-confidence and, secondly, I am not certain of the Commonwealth's legal actions in seeking redress. So we cannot release the report now, but I hope that we can release it at some later time. I am still not certain when we are likely to get a full report from the receiver. Until we do the Commonwealth can do nothing further. </PARA>

<PARA>The crunch line in the letter to the Senate calling for this urgency debate is the last one:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the hollowness of the claim that the Hawke Government has any commitment to ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the Federal Government has stated quite clearly a commitment; indeed it has circulated a draft discussion paper on ecologically sustainable development. It has also, I believe, through the environment statement made several months ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), recognised that greenhouse warming is, to use the Prime Minister's words, `the most serious environmental problem facing Homo sapiens'. If greenhouse warming is not an example of the fact that our industrial development is not sustainable, surely nothing would convince anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen Mr Hawke's plan to plant one billion trees. Of course, this bears very much on the other issue which is raised in our urgency motion-that is, the plan to slaughter a large part of the south-east forests of New South Wales. If I could paraphrase the biblical injunction, what does it profit a man if he plants a billion trees and at the same time he removes a billion old trees? Of course, one might be cynical enough to say that in political terms it certainly does not save his political soul. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Watson. I would have thought the links between the cutting of forests and the problem of greenhouse were absolutely plain to every person in this chamber. As we cut down these old growth forests that are in balance with the ability of the atmosphere to maintain its carbon dioxide levels we turn them-this is predominantly the case in respect of the south-eastern forests-into woodchips and paper. They are on a one-way trip to the junk heap to be burnt and to be put back into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. So, there is a clear link between what the Prime Minister has recognised as the most important environmental problem facing human kind at this time and his decision to get into those forests and remove a substantial portion of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision to remove these trees from the south-eastern forests in our view shows a clear lack of understanding or, indeed, any real commitment at all on the part of Mr Hawke to sustainable development. The decision has been made to satisfy very short term economic ends in a way which is quite similar to a number of other decisions which we have seen the Hawke Government make recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke, in his discussion paper on ecologically sustainable development, says this:</PARA>
<PARA> Resources that are free or underpriced tend to be overused and abused and environmental damage may result. Deficient pricing of natural resources is one factor contributing to Australia's problems. Changing prices is one of the more direct ways of changing patterns of resource use. </PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! We could agree with that absolutely. Let us look at the situation in relation to the pricing of the resources of the south-eastern forests. First, let us look at the question of employment. It is true that employment in the forest industry is falling. But it is equally true that the employment there is not falling as a consequence of the activities of the conservation movement or moves to protect the forests. It is falling because there has been a significant move towards greater capital intensity and less labour intensive type exploitation of the forests. It is falling also because there has been a substantial move away from sawlogging and towards the exploitation by way of chipping and pulp manufacture-something which is capital intensive and not particularly labour intensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that it is rather surprising at this time to hear both the Federal Government and the New South Wales Government, in this case because it was a joint announcement, expressing concern over employment. If I could pick up what the Opposition has said this weekend in connection with the insipient oil strike, Mr Howard was quite adamant that the loss of a thousand workers' jobs in that industry was part of a process of rationalising the industry, and he did not express a great deal of concern that those workers should lose their jobs in the process of rationalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that the New South Wales hardwood industry in the Bega Valley in the Bombala region employs only about 6 per cent of the population in that area: 1.1 per cent in sawmills, 1.3 per cent in the chip mill, 2.3 per cent in logging and cartage, and 1.4 per cent by the Forestry Commission. A total of only 600 people are employed in that area in the forestry industry. Employment in the region, moreover, in the timber part of the industry there, remained static throughout the 1980s while overall employment in the region increased by 2.3 per cent between 1981 and 1986, which is approximately three times the rate for New South Wales as a whole. Quite clearly, there are substantial shifts in employment in the timber industry which are quite unrelated to actions to protect the forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out the other losses of employment which are going on in New South Wales at the present time and which are countenanced-indeed, praised, furthered and promoted-by the New South Wales Government and looked on, presumably, favourably by this Labor Government. There have been 3,300 jobs lost in education, 3,500 in the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, Elcom, 4,000 in government supply, 450 in the closure of the Homebush abattoir, 200 in the State brickworks, and another 550 in family and community services. Very significant job losses have occurred throughout New South Wales in the name of rationalising industry and production and yet when so few jobs are concerned in the forestry industry, apparently we must destroy old growth forests to provide that employment. </PARA>
<PARA> What other measures are available? If we look at the direct financial circumstances of the forestry industry, we note that gross royalties received by the Forestry Commission to 30 June 1990 amount to-and these figures are very instructive-$15.59 per tonne from pulp wood, with 93 tonnes per hectare being collected, which amounts to $1,449 per hectare, and $30.02 per cubic metre from saw logs, with 11 cubic metres per hectare, a total of $330 per hectare. In other words, that amounts to $1,780 in gross royalties per hectare. If we look at that on a 50-year rotation basis, that is $36 per hectare per year collected in royalties as a consequence of the exploitation of these south east forests. By any stretch of the imagination, that is a paltry sum to weigh against the destruction of these very important areas. </PARA>
<PARA> To place the matter in a somewhat different perspective, Mr Sid Walker of the forestry working group has placed a value of 60c per tree. That is his estimate of the value placed on each tree as a consequence of the amount of royalty being paid, and this 60c per tree has not been questioned by the Forestry Commission or by industry. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Hawke announced that he was going to plant one billion trees he suggested-rather disingenuously, I think, in the light of what happened since-that he could plant and nurture those trees for $1 a tree. The Opposition immediately said that that was a ridiculous figure and its estimate, as reported in the media, for the planting and nurturing of the trees until one could be reasonably assured that they would grow on was $11 a tree. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to the Prime Minister's statement in his `ecologically sustainable' draft that `resources that are free or underpriced tend to be overused and abused'. Surely, if any resource is being underpriced, abused and overused, it is the south-eastern forests of New South Wales.  If the Opposition is correct in its estimate, and if we are to adhere to market processes for the allocation of resources-and I certainly share with the Government and the Opposition the view that the market system is an efficient way, not always an equitable way, of allocating resources-then surely the value that should be put on a tree is, at the very least, the cost of replacement, which, according to the Opposition, is $11 a tree, and not the 60c which has been placed on these trees by way of the royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Daishowa, the company which is exploiting about 80 per cent of the southern forests, is a totally foreign owned company. That fact needs to be stressed because, very often, the term Harris-Daishowa is used and the names are linked. I believe the company started with those owners, but Mr Harris, an Australian citizen, very quickly sold out and the company is now totally foreign owned. In 1987, 1988 and 1989 it made after-tax profits of 100 per cent, 93 per cent and 93 per cent respectively on investment. Those profits, of course, were immediately and totally repatriated to Japan. The profits as a percentage of before-tax sales range between 21 per cent and 26 per cent through those years, which is several times higher than the national average. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to increase royalties to 50 per cent of before-tax profits, that would raise an extra $5m a year and, in three years, $15m, which is more than enough to establish the industry on a sustainable basis and provide long term security for the work force-an alternative to the very short term solution which this Government has sought. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Democrats' alternative budget we suggested that there be a substantially larger increase in the royalties charged on chips, in line with the idea of charging the full value of these trees. We suggested that there be an additional royalty of $20 a tonne. That would raise over the whole of Australia-we are not talking only about the south-east forests here-$110 million a year. That would give a substantial sum of money which could be used to direct this industry away from its present exploitative, non-renewable practices towards those practices which would ensure sustainability in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we also need to look at the demand side of this equation, not just the supply side. When we look to see why those forests are being destroyed, we see that the products are being used for a lot of purposes for which there is really no good, substantial reason. I have here the junk mail which I collected from my letterbox in just one evening. It is material which is absolutely useless; it certainly does not advertise a single item that I would wish to buy and it simply goes straight into the waste paper bin. This is the sort of activity which this Hawke Government is defending in the light of--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume for raising that. The Senate will notice that quite a lot of that junk mail is on glossy paper which is extremely difficult to recycle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia imported 36 per cent of our paper and 22 per cent of its pulp in 1986-87, which cost over $1 billion. When we look at what Australia does in the form of recycling, we find that it is only recycling about 28 per cent of its pulp, whereas Japan is recycling 49 per cent and even in the Netherlands the amount is some 45 per cent. There are substantial opportunities for increasing the amount of recycling and, therefore, decreasing the demands on our forests-particularly our old and original forests which contain such a wealth of other values. </PARA>
<PARA> If I might return to the principal theme-putting an appropriate value on these trees would make that material, that is, the pulp and other material that we get from those virgin forests, much more expensive. This is precisely the price message that needs to be put into the market system to level the playing field so that there can be an appropriate allocation of resources. The market will do that, provided the right price mechanisms are put in. In short, Australia is currently paying Daishowa and a number of other substantially foreign companies like Daishowa simply to take our resources away. We are not being adequately recompensed for those chips. </PARA>
<PARA> Timber is not the only value for which we need to protect forests. The Government has continuously reduced the funding for the Australian Biological Resources Survey. One biologist to whom I spoke just the other night down at the National Science and Technology Centre said that he had made a calculation in relation to the number of species being described in Australia and the task which still lay before us. His estimate was that we would not have a complete inventory of all species, plants and animals, in Australia before the year-wait for it-3000. In other words, it will take more than 1,000 years from now, at the rate we are proceeding, to describe the biological richness that was in this country before European settlement. Of course, if we take that length of time, many of those species will long have disappeared because of the destructive practices we have adopted before we have a chance to even know what is there, and that is certainly true of the south-eastern forests. </PARA>
<PARA> I need only reflect briefly on the map showing the areas which the Government is seeking to protect. Any person who knows anything about biology would recognise the uselessness of those narrow strips on the map. One of the southern pieces is shaped like a three-legged spider, with the protected areas being no more than a few hundred metres wide. One leg stretches along the Princes Highway, apparently to make the roadside look attractive for those who drive along there, and the other two legs stretch up river valleys. That is absolutely useless protection in terms of other values-the species and so on-that might reside in, and might need the protection of, an intact ecosystem for their continued survival. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth of the old plantation timbers is now exceeding the rate of increased consumption of timber in this country. It is easy to predict that within 10 to 15 years, even with present consumption patterns, the timber needs of Australia could be supplied from those plantation sources and we would not need to go into the forests. Of course, if we were to put in place proper costings and the recycling measures to which I have referred, the apparent need to go into these forests would be seen as being without any foundation whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> In last Monday's announcement of the south-eastern forests decision the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>It will provide for a more stable long-term strategy for the management of the South East Forests. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>This strategy will be finalised in consultation with the New South Wales Government by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of this long-term strategy has pre-empted the outcome of the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry into forests and timber resources. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be remembered that the RAC is supposed to be the centrepiece of the Federal Government's processes for reconciling environmental and developmental objectives, particularly those which are particularly controversial. The forest and timber inquiry is its first, and an interim report is due early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the point that I made at the beginning, which is that the decision to log the south-eastern forests is poorly based, and clearly the words which the Government mouths in relation to sustainable development indicate that either the Government does not understand what it is talking about or that those words are hollow and without foundation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, as Minister responsible for the environment from 1987 to 1990, had to spend quite a deal of my time wrestling with this complex and difficult issue. As a precursor to my remarks, it is worth noting that there has been a clamour from both sides in this debate, not just about the south-eastern forests but about each and every environmental issue, that governments ought to make their decisions based on the best scientific advice available. It is pretty hard for anybody to reject that as a sensible course of action for governments now and in the future. The only problem for governments appears to be that, after they seek the best scientific advice available, whoever is aggrieved by the advice that is produced then wants to disagree with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Government was dealing with Wesley Vale, that notorious mill in Tasmania, there was scientific evidence produced by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and even by the client department, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which suggested that there were very real risks indeed in proceeding with the mill at the time, particularly if its technology were not to change. The company walked away because the Government took a decision to impose extra conditions on the basis of the scientific evidence which was produced for it. There was an example of industry walking away when it did not want to accept scientific advice. Sadly, when we look at what has happened in the south-eastern forests, we are seeing some people in the conservation movement taking a similar step. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to the calibre of scientific advice, an examination of those who were put on the committee to look at this area points to a pretty impressive list of scientific brainpower. Contrary to assertions that in some way it is a forestry plot, names such as that of Henry Nix appear on the list. There is not even a minority report from people such as that for the conservation movement to base some sort of counterargument upon. In the absence of any argument of that kind, one wonders how far the scientific argument can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> To go back to the genesis of the committee itself, it came about after discussions between Senator Cook and me as to what were the Commonwealth's obligations in trying to settle the south-eastern forests logging argument. We took the decision to protect 95 per cent or whatever it was-a very high percentage-of the area while we were getting this scientific advice. There was never an undertaking to continue the protection beyond the time when that scientific advice had been produced. When it came down, I have to say, it was an even tougher proposal than that which the Cabinet finally adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that people can take all of this advice and tear it up and ignore it when it does not suit them. In the course of the next few years all of us, no matter where we stand in these debates, whether we class ourselves as green or not, will have to believe that, when experts are assembled for the purpose and learned reports are produced, we just will not have the luxury of allowing our bias to reject them when they do not suit our arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough for Senator Coulter to say that we should wait for the Resource Assessment Commission. I suppose that there is always a reason to wait-one can wait forever- but eventually governments have to make decisions. That is the task we are given by those who elect us. It is not as if there has been some tiny area reserved for future generations in the south-eastern forests. The reserve system for the south-east will conserve some 55,000 hectares through new national parks, nature reserves and flora reserves. The proposed boundaries take account of both conservation and heritage values and the needs of the timber industry. One has to look at the Commonwealth's obligation for protection of the National Estate to discover why it is that those values had to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we should dispel the myth that in some way National Estate status means no development of any kind. Not even when that legislation had its beginnings during the Whitlam era was it ever suggested that the National Estate was untouchable, as were national parks. It was always the case, even for those who were drafting this legislation, that the Commonwealth's responsibility was to see whether there were prudent and feasible alternatives to going into the National Estate. It was never the case that the National Estate could not be touched under any circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen in the past few years is an attempt to equate National Estate with national parks. Sadly, they are just not the same. Obviously we have an absolute duty to do our best to protect the National Estate, but one wonders, having looked at all the circumstances of this debate, what more we could have done. </PARA>
<PARA> Further to that, we should compare what went on in the south-eastern forests here with those old growth forests of Tasmania. When it came to settling that argument there was scientific evidence about 400-year-old trees and about areas of world significance. That can be settled, if the Commonwealth has the will to do it, by listing for World Heritage. So in Tasmania there was a clamour from the environment movement for a World Heritage listing. The Commonwealth, having examined that, agreed; we went ahead. There were arguments with industry, arguments with the State government of the day in Tasmania, but we went ahead because there was sufficient evidence and the adoption by the World Heritage Committee of those boundaries suggested that the evidence was indeed there. But one does not hear the clamour from environmentalists about listing these forests for World Heritage so that the argument can be settled. The reason is that so many of these forests have been logged before. It is pretty hard to establish wilderness values, apart from a few small areas. In the case of Tasmania there were some very large areas that had not been touched. It is also always necessary to take in some areas that have been touched to provide proper buffer zones around those areas that have never been touched. The opposite applies in the south-eastern forests because logging has been going on in them for so long and most, as I have said, have been logged in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, in looking at Senator Coulter's motion, there is at least the suggestion that in some way the concept of sustainable development has been infringed by the Government's decision. I have to reject that suggestion as well. This decision is all about sustainable development. It is all about making sure that the forests can regenerate themselves, that we will be able to see logging done again after the proper cycle has gone through. </PARA>
<PARA> That becomes the crux of the question. I was very critical a couple of months ago, when I was launching a book which listed some of the great areas of Australia, of those in industry-not just the timber industry; on that occasion in particular the mining industry-who were seeking to hijack the sustainable development debate, seeking to suggest that it meant an open slather for a whole raft of areas which the Government and, I think, a majority of Australians want to see protected. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion I hope that those in the environment movement, or indeed Senator Coulter, do not get to the stage of believing that some argument about sustainable development can be used for the opposite purpose; that is, to protect everyone. It has to be, by its very nature, somewhere in the middle. It has to be the case that sustainable development implies development occurring. By establishing such an extensive system of reserves in the case of the south-eastern forests, I do not think anyone can suggest that what we are about here will not be anything but sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told in this motion that the fact that the Resource Assessment Commission has not yet decided is some reason for delay. But the reality is that that Commission is looking at a long term assessment. It will look at the future over the next few centuries. There is no pretence that the Resources Assessment Commission will come up with a forest by forest decision about what we ought to be doing around Australia during the next few years. The fact that there is a long term forest inquiry is a very good thing for the future of the industry and for conservation but it cannot be used as a reason for stopping decision making, either at a State or at a Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> We have come a long way since the beginning of the debate. Here we are, being critical of what we have been able to protect, when only a couple of years ago we had the then State Minister, Ian Causley, absolutely anxious to take the chainsaw to every tree in the south-eastern forests. Because the Commonwealth got involved in this process, because it would not cop that sort of redneck attitude, we now have a situation where the governments can agree on the reserving of a very large section of those forests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Michael Baume-through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I know I am not to speak across the chamber-I do not believe that Tim Moore is a redneck; I believe that he has a genuine pro-Green feeling. I also believe that he is completely powerless within the New South Wales Government. I would like to see a bit more muscle given to his arm. If Senator Michael Baume can help in that process, I think New South Wales will be a lot better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nothing that the Commonwealth has done in the course of this debate should be seen to take away from a look at the future. The future of this industry does not simply lie in the management of old growth forests. The States and the Commonwealth must do all that they can to tease out just what we can do with plantation forestry. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that any long term solution to the problems of balancing conservation and development in Australia can be even attempted without an acknowledgment that eucalypt plantations will play a big part in that future. The Australian Conservation Foundation has quite rightly pointed out that eucalypt plantations are an essential component of any strategy to reduce pressure on old growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some sections of industry want to reject that claim. I know that some sections of industry do not want to accept that sawlogs can ever be got out of plantation forests. But again, it seems clear to me, when looking at research carried out by the CSIRO and even by some companies, especially in Tasmania, that there is a future for the industry in looking at eucalypt plantations. It would do well for everyone in industry, in the conservation movement and in government to spend a bit of time and money on that--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree. They should do so so that there will be a future for everyone in the industry. From day one of the debate, at the heart of the Government's undertakings was an undertaking to try to maintain employment in those south-eastern forests. There is a very difficult decision to be made any time one gets to a forest-specific argument. Having been through the Ravenshoe debate and having seen people put out of work when they and their family predecessors have worked at a particular job, sometimes for 100 years, through generation after generation, it is pretty wrenching to say to them, `There's no longer a place for you here. You've got to go somewhere else'. It does not matter how Green one considers oneself; that kind of human concern is pretty hard to dismiss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that many Green people are very hard on this issue. It is very easy to get up and say, `This area, that area, has to be protected; to hell with the jobs'. But when one is faced, as I was, time and again with people, quite naturally, being very angry about the prospect of their lives and the lives of their families being disrupted by a government decision on conservation, it forces one to start thinking about what really is balance in the argument. There is no balance in the argument that suggests that there is no future for forestry in the south-eastern forests. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard mention of Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd. We had the foreign bogy raised again. The south-eastern forests argument has never been about Harris-Daishowa; it is a sawlog driven argument. All of the arguments that we have been having over the last few years are about sawlogs keeping some small mills going; they are not about finding cannon fodder for the machinery at Daishowa's mill, because that can be found in a whole range of areas around the south-east. It has always been about sawlogs. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us not raise the foreign bogy. More to the point should be what the long term future of the woodchip industry is in Australia. All of us who have a belief in secondary processing of our raw materials have to understand that there cannot be endless woodchipping here; that there will come a time when we will require companies to do more with the resource than just chip it. Of course, when that time comes, there will be the argument of what kind of pulp mill to have, what kind of waste it will have and what kind of machinery it will use. I would rather face that debate than simply have sterile debates about woodchipping itself. In my view, there is no long term future in that. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, we need to be a bit smarter-the clever country will not just woodchip; it will do a lot more. So I hope that we do not have to--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson says, `What about Wesley Vale?'. I have already said why the company did not get on with Wesley Vale, and that was because science was against it; there was a welter of scientific evidence against it. In the cold light of day, we really ought to acknowledge that evidence. Senator Watson will never get a Wesley Vale or any other mill built without proper studies being done beforehand. In the end, the fact that the Gray Government never had the guts to ask North Broken Hill Holdings Ltd and Noranda Forests Inc. to actually go out and do some baseline studies was the largest contributor to bringing them undone. The fact that Senator Watson would go along with it is even more appalling. Mind you, it is not surprising-we have listened to him here before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But to get back to the matter-I do not want to respond to interjections all the time-it will never be possible to get decisions that satisfy everyone in this debate. As one who sat around God knows how many negotiating tables during the course of the last few years trying to get that agreement, I know that it is hard enough getting it within any political party let alone getting it with industry, conservation groups and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> However, here we have made a very real attempt. By and large it has been successful. I hope that conservationists note that the industry did not just race out and say, `What a terrific agreement. You've saved all our jobs'. Far from it. It came out and said, `You've reserved too much. In reserving 11 1/2 per cent of resource, you've reserved too much'. It was angry that the Government would take such a decision. It believed that even what we did placed jobs at risk. So no-one has come out here and said, `It's a great decision'. If both the conservationists and the industry are saying that it is not such a red hot decision, maybe we have got pretty close to the right balance. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is not being said too much during the discussions of the last week or two, we should also note that no logging will occur anywhere in the Tantawangalo catchment area for the next four years while we get some more science, while proper hydrological studies are done. That is something that I was calling for a couple of years ago. So, there has been tremendous concessions made on the New South Wales side. The agreement that we have got here is nothing like what Minister Causley was calling for two years ago. He was removed from his portfolio and his ambit claim has been destroyed by this agreement. The truth is that the Greiner Government did move back. I do not want to criticise Mr Greiner for doing it. I want to congratulate him. </PARA>

Anyway, I seek to defend this agreement not just because it is signed between the two governments but because it is a genuine attempt to recognise that science must play the overriding role.

This is not because they are the only people who are genuinely concerned with the environment in this chamber but, on the contrary, they are the only people who are prepared to beat their breasts in an unrealistic and nonsensical way, pretending that trees are things that do not grow, that they are something static and that once harvested can never be replaced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was not one mention in Senator Coulter's speech of the Report of the Joint Scientific Committee entitled Biological Conservation of the South-East Forests. The facts would have interfered with Senator Coulter's speech. On the question of Senator Coulter's speech, it is worth noting that there is not one other member of the Australian Democrats supporting him by being in the Chamber listening to his speech, and listening to this allegedly important matter of urgency that the Democrats have brought before this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not surprised by that because, quite frankly, the Democrats in this area have been demonstrated to be phonies and this debate is another example of that total phoneyness. For heaven's sake, here at last we have a situation where there is a prospect of that wonderful term `sustainable development' being recognised as the most important and practical response to our environmental problems. What we have in this chamber is a grandstanding act by the Australian Democrats refusing to recognise that if there can be a degree of political unanimity on this matter, we will have gone a long way to solving some very serious problems that do exist in Australia about the environment, and which for far too long have been political footballs. </PARA>
<PARA> Now at a time when the New South Wales coalition Government under the Liberal leader, Mr Greiner, can come to an agreement with a Labor Federal Government about sustainable development in the south-eastern forests, when in fact at last politics between the major parties are removed from that kind of issue, what do we naturally see? We naturally see the Australian Democrats like dogs sniffing around a garbage bin picking up the leftovers, and quite frankly, I suppose they have nothing else to chew on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At last we have another one who has come in. The honourable senator must have been listening on the radio in the comfort of her office when I made this point. But let us see what really is happening in this debate, because as the Australian noted in its editorial of 10 October:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Whatever the motive, the coming together of Mr Hawke and Mr Greiner on the forests-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the south-eastern forests-</PARA>
<PARA>is welcomed. Now is the time for moderate greens to join them, to bring to life the ideal of sustainable development, to suggest how projects can proceed in an environmentally acceptable way-to be positive about Australia's development. That would be a green revolution. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is the position of the Opposition. There is no doubt that as the Australian said:</PARA>
<PARA>A calmer environmental movement would accept the need for growth to maintain living standards and throw its efforts into ensuring projects went ahead with first-rate environmental safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA>That surely is what we all should be about. Let us concede that for far too long there have not been adequate environmental safeguards, and because that pendulum was so far one way, naturally it swung back too far the other way to a situation where we have people like Senator Coulter taking the view that no development is acceptable; that there should be minus population growth; and that in fact every tree apparently must remain extant-static. I think Senator Coulter might have forgotten the fact that trees actually grow. I know this is a terrible thing to intrude into this debate and it may be that it takes 50 to 100 years for some trees to grow to the sorts of sizes that may even be commercially necessary for logging purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I know it is uncomfortable for Senator Coulter but I have here a scientific report which says quite clearly what the realities are about these forests. Senator Coulter says, `old-growth'. In other words, nothing could be worse than chopping down these wonderful old-growth forests for short term vulgar, commercial gain; or in fact simply to sustain living standards or to sustain any kind of economic growth in Australia. Let us read what the Joint Scientific Committee, which reported to both the State and the Federal Ministers for resources, reported so recently:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Estate forests in the Eden region have been described as old-growth forests, an emotive term which has considerable public appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us recognise that obviously Senator Coulter would prefer to call them that, because he is depending in this issue on emotion and on a public appeal, because the Democrats are running out of issues. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The forests are in fact-</PARA>
<PARA>contrary to what Senator Coulter was suggesting to us-</PARA>
<PARA>multi-aged, consisting of a main canopy of old trees infilled at intervals by other trees representing many age classes, each class having regenerated after a fire or as a result of early selective logging. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter apparently has forgotten about the fact that Australia is subject to bushfires. I do not know whether he is going to pass a law against bushfires or against lightning, but unless he does that, he is going to find it very difficult to sustain every `old-growth' forest area in its pristine present state. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>On a wet . . . site examined, groups of trees originated at about 40 year intervals, coinciding with roughly every second fire event. In dry . . . forest, trees originated at a average recruitment interval of 18 years, about twice the frequency of recruitment to a wet . . . site. The oldest tree recorded on the former site was estimated to have been 400 years old when cut, 210 years on the latter. We acknowledge that these very old trees are to be found within the forests but not all of the forests are made up of such trees, nor will the forests contain these same trees forever. The forest is not a static entity but a dynamic one. At any one time parts of it represent stages in the successional gradient, regenerating, developing, ageing, senescing and dying. </PARA>
<PARA>Trees actually die. Under the best of all possible Coulter worlds, trees would remain in their static beautiful state forever. It is simply not so. There is no doubt that chopping them down hastens that process, but the question is this: Can we come to a sustainable level of development? The answer is yes. We must not overcut our forests, but there is no merit in pretending that they should not be cut at all. What disturbs me about this debate is that anyone who takes a view contrary to the extremist position of Senator Coulter is seen and presented as someone who is running around the forests of New South Wales with a chainsaw, chopping down everything without consideration for or recognition of any other factor. That is simply nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> We also hear how forestry practices that will follow will be the slaughter-that is the word Senator Coulter used-of large parts of the south-eastern forest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have been there. I have had a good look. That is why I am talking with some knowledge of the area and some knowledge of the facts. It is a pity that Senator Coulter did not address himself to the scientific material that is available and which he studiously avoided in presenting this debate. I would have thought that something that regenerates was not being slaughtered; it was being farmed. I wonder whether every time Senator Coulter sees a harvester cutting through a wheat field he describes it as the slaughter of the wheat. It is the same kind of emotional claptrap which we expect from the Democrats and which we get consistently. As for this stuff about how it will destroy the fauna as well, I will read out some more of the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is possible to harvest the forest and maintain an appropriate age series and canopy structure so that conservation values of the forest will not be impaired. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the rational, sensible, middle course. It is a course which Senator Coulter could not recognise if he bumped into it. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>At each successive harvesting the conservation values of the harvested area will be altered: some organisms will be disadvantaged for varying periods of time, some will be benefited, but none will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA>As the report says elsewhere, forests are continually changing. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no scientific evidence to support a contention that the sequence of management practices now being employed in the area will result in the extinction of any organism, either plant or animal. Many will be reduced in numbers, but none will be rendered extinct at either the local, regional or national level as a result of carefully controlled forest harvesting operations where conservation is one of the objectives of forest management. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is a rational approach to the irrational statements that have been coming from the Australian Democrats. What we have to recognise is that in effect in many of the older growth forests there are relatively small volumes of sawlogs available due to the high proportion of mature and overmature or senescent trees, the relatively few merchantable stems and the low level of utilisation relative to total wood yield. The Eden native forest management area is no exception. So we are not going to see a massive destruction of those areas. There is no doubt that a reasonable reading of this report shows that it is quite possible to have rational, coherent and relevant conservation policies while at the same time allowing for a reasonable level of farming of trees. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just me, the Government or Mr Greiner in New South Wales making those points. In fact, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has looked at the matter in some detail. Earlier this month at a luncheon at the National Press Club, I think, Dr Stocker of the CSIRO announced details of a forest management plan which could boost Australia's timber exports while preserving more native trees. He said that it was commercially practical to gently thin out young trees at different stages of growth from eucalypt forests. This technique would increase production by up to 60 per cent, according to a five-year young eucalypt program of research by the CSIRO in collaboration with industry and the Victorian and Tasmanian governments. Thinning provides a third way of forest management which could help break the impasse between environmentalists and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Stocker said that trees could be produced in 50 years which would normally have taken 80 years to grow in a natural regrowth forest. As an added bonus, the young trees older than about 18 years would be an excellent source of pulp wood. Research has estimated that there would be about 300,000 hectares of regrowth forest in Australia suitable for thinning. 'If we could identify 800,000 hectares of regrowth forest, we estimate we could meet the projected needs of Australia's pulp and paper industries by 2030', said Dr Stocker. Let us see what the Australian Democrats' view really is. It is an anti-growth view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am one of the few senators, I believe, who have actually visited the Tantawangalo and Coolangubra forests, although Senator Michael Baume has just said that he has been there too. I know that several Australian Democrats have also been there. There is no doubt in my mind that the areas we are debating today hold enormous significance in environmental terms. These forests are strikingly beautiful places. They include substantial areas of largely undisturbed old growth forest and habitats for many rare and endangered plants and animals, including the long-footed potoroo, which is one of Australia's rarest mammals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much of the significance of the south-east is also connected to the wide variety of virtually intact ecosystems found over areas that will now no longer be viable. This decision will mean their effective destruction. We are not talking about the possibility of extinction here; we are talking about a definite outcome. This decision will mean the extinction of some species. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in their 1988 survey of the Bega district, for instance, ecologists Lunney and Leary found that the numbers of large and medium sized mammal species dropped sharply after 1910 due to land clearing in the Bega Valley. Six species of native mammals are already in danger of extinction while many others have become dangerously rare. Some of the wildlife, such as koalas, were almost eliminated in the Bega Valley by the removal of nutrient rich species of eucalypt. </PARA>
<PARA> These forests were not originally the prime possum and glider habitats in New South Wales, but they now form a major refuge for this animal group. Increased logging of these forests will reduce their habitat further. We must understand that the issue of wildlife conservation is integral to the areas of habitats which are now threatened by this logging decision. These areas of unlogged forest are essential for ensuring that viable populations of wildlife are maintained in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, in a report it prepared for the New South Wales State Government, estimated that, even then, the areas of high nature conservation value left in the State had been hugely diminished due to logging. That report cited that of 27 rare or threatened plant species in the south-east, only eight have been adequately conserved on a national scale. Already at that stage-and this was three years ago-nine of those species were endangered. The report also commented on the impact of woodchip operations on the wildlife. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The extensive study of mammal fauna undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1979-84 reached the conclusion that logging operations are having a significant impact on the forest fauna. For those species dependent on mature unlogged forest there will be only a small and fragmented area of suitable habitat after logging. At this point there will be an increased likelihood of local extinction of these vulnerable species. </PARA>
<PARA>Two hundred years ago forests covered more than a quarter of Australia's land surface. Eighty per cent of that forest has now been destroyed. In the last couple of years, however, I have been encouraged to believe that we in this chamber seem to be starting to get the same feeling for the land that Aboriginal Australians have had for thousands of years. But we are now faced with a decision which means that about half these National Estate forests will be logged. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Federal and New South Wales governments have chosen to ignore a strong body of independent scientific evidence which suggests that logging these areas will cause irreparable damage. Both the Federal and New South Wales governments have chosen to ignore a strong body of community feeling that National Estate forests should be protected. This recommendation of the Federal and New South Wales governments was based almost exclusively on the report produced by the Joint Scientific Committee. The findings and recommendations of this report really do not deserve the prominence and reverence that they have been given by this Government and the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> To begin with, five of the six members of the Committee were foresters, and three were employed by the New South Wales Forestry Commission. No-one disputes that the Committee should have had foresters in its membership, but it should be obvious what bias was built into the policy making process even before the recommendations had been drawn up. It is not just the Australian Democrats who believe that any committee which is top heavy with foresters is obviously going to produce a report in favour of logging. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, when commenting on the Joint Scientific Committee report in December last year, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is highly unlikely that the findings of the final report can arrive at a conclusion other than that which supports the claim that forestry operations and conservation are compatible-a finding at odds with most of the literature on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA>Many scientists and academics have found grave flaws in the report. Dr Hugh Possingham, a prominent and well-respected scientific academic at the Research School of Biological Sciences at the Australian National University, directly contradicted the Joint Scientific Committee conclusion that there was no evidence to suggest that species extinctions would occur because of forestry practices. A recent report by the Department of Ecosystem Management at the University of New England warned that logging in the south-eastern forests would increase the probability of extinction of some species. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of mammal species which have become extinct over the last 200 years in this country is more than in any other continent in the world. The decision to log almost half of this National Estate area is obviously an appalling act of environmental vandalism. To protect our critically endangered species, we should be preserving as much as possible of our remaining natural ecosystems, not destroying them. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim that logging can be carried out in a manner which maintains biological diversity has not been independently tested. Logging has an immediate effect on all the surrounding flora and fauna. Some species will almost certainly become extinct, and the range and abundance of some species, particularly tree dwellers, will be severely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, and groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, have been arguing for years that it is possible to have a viable and responsible forest industry strategy involving the establishment of, for instance, sufficient eucalypt plantations on previously cleared land to supply all expected local hard wood needs with no logging of native forests except for small volumes of very high quality saw and specialty logs for some high value added manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> This could have been the strategy taken with the south-eastern forests. All three National Estate areas could have been declared national parks and at the same time sufficient plantations could have been established to produce an equal amount of timber from new plantations. There are already significant areas of existing cleared land with suitable soil, adequate rainfall and topography where the development of plantations that will produce pulp wood is technically feasible and likely to be economically viable. Seven hundred hectares planted each year for 20 years and managed on a 20 year rotation would yield 280,000 cubic metres of pulp wood per annum which is more than sufficient to replace the volumes that would be preserved in the south-eastern forests. </PARA>
<PARA> I am offering these proposals because the Democrats and other responsible conservation groups in our society genuinely believe that there is a way to preserve our National Estate and ensure that the forest industries, which are so important to the country, will continue. I am well aware of the argument that if we halt logging in the National Estate now, where will our timber requirements come from in the interim? To begin with, I believe that most of Australia's bulk hard wood timber needs can be met, as I have already said, by establishing eucalypt plantations on currently cleared land. While plantations are maturing, timber needs can be met from existing but lower conservation value forests. We cannot dismiss this lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now well established that plantations in Australia are of increasing importance to the forest industry. After the plantations mature in 20 to 30 years, clear-felling can be phased out of the lower conservation value native forests and replaced with long rotation selective logging for high value saw logs as required. Meanwhile the forest industries have admitted that there is much that they could do to improve the efficiency of their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent reports, for instance, estimate that improved utilisation of logging waste could produce an additional 2.24 million tonnes alone and create additional jobs in the industry at the same time. Such an approach carries an enormous number of benefits and very few costs. By using plantations, the timber industry will benefit from higher growth rates and lower logging costs. Environmental benefits would include reduced native forest logging, improved land productivity and water quality, and reduced soil erosion. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor which tilts the economic balance in favour of plantations is the higher value which is given to pulp wood obtained from plantations over native forest supplies. Hard wood plantations based on forestry would benefit timber production economics in a number of other ways as well. Growth rates are up to three times those of the native forests, logging and transportation costs are reduced, and processing costs are reduced because of the greater uniformity of quality obtained from plantations. The capacity to breed and select the most appropriate timbers also has the potential to increase growth rates-a factor which is understandably important to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the environmental benefits of using plantations are enormous and include things such as a reduction in erosion and salinity problems, as well as improved water quality, wildlife conservation and land values, to mention just a few. I am trying to show that it is not very difficult to map out a strategy which would not only help to preserve a significant and rapidly dwindling wilderness of Australia's native forests, but which also makes good economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> There is enormous community opposition to logging in our National Estate forests. Even the leader of the Labor Party Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, is publicly on record as supporting the Democrats' position not to log the National Estate forests. His statement last Tuesday probably summed up the feelings of most conservationists when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> To think of this area being logged, as this decision allows, is tragic. Here was a decision to make a really bold, visionary conservation decision-there's no vision in what has been decided. I really think politicians in 1990 ought to be thinking not just of the next election . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Many New South Welshmen will remember that it was under the previous Labor Government in New South Wales, of which Mr Carr was the Minister for Planning and Environment, that a promise was made to declare these forests as national parks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that these three areas of National Estate forests are some of the most significant parts of the natural heritage in my own State of New South Wales. I believe their preservation is a matter of urgency and I urge the Senate to vote in favour of the motion. </PARA>

In broad terms there is a far greater understanding of the interrelationship between economic growth and environmental protection than there was just a few years ago. That is evident in the contributions that are being made to debates on environmental issues, such as the sensitive issue of the south-eastern forests of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking directly at the proposition before the Senate this afternoon, as moved by Senator Coulter, it apparently seeks to cry `hold' to the decision-making process while further attacking the Labor Government for the determinations that were announced just recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premier of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the proposition lacks clarity. I am obliged to say that it apparently seeks to cry, `Hold'. The proposition also offers no alternative. Beyond that, the proposition is flawed. It is flawed because it is simply assertive, rather than analytical in the terms in which it approaches the issue. If I am being unfair, I suggest that it is the language that suggests that, if not the intent. To date, the Senate has heard from those who support the proposition no alternative strategy. None has been advanced. No realistic alternative approach has been outlined and no practical solution to the dilemmas about the south-eastern forests of New South Wales has been defined or held up on offer. All we have, by way of the alternative proposition, is a deferral. </PARA>
<PARA> As everyone in the chamber knows, there are economic consequences to decisions taken on environmental protection and conservation generally. Often, there is the tragedy of unemployment, some of which is long term. That hits hard the people who very often have the least capacity to resist change in that they possess the fewest skills. Decisions can also result in the dislocation of families, the disruption of communities and the destabilisation of entire regions. We need to be very careful in weighing up the decisions well before they are taken. That has certainly been the case here. The process has been exhaustive. The economic consequences of decisions such as those on the south-eastern forests cannot be ignored by the Senate in debating the proposition this afternoon, and they have not been ignored by the Government in taking the decision that has been announced in cooperation with the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are political as well as economic consequences. The consequences of making the wrong political decisions on the environment are perhaps best demonstrated by the defeat of Senator Chris Puplick at the last general election held on 24 March 1990. To his credit, Senator Puplick had endeavoured to bring an environmental conscience to bear upon the Liberal Party of Australia. For his pains, he was punished by his internal adversaries, relegated and defeated, rejected by the Liberal Party, which sought in turn to return to irrelevance in the environmental debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another political consequence of this decision, however, is something that is of immediate relevance-that is, to confirm that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Ros Kelly, has been both accomplished and capable in her portfolio. There can be no doubt of that for the future, given the magnitude of the decision taken. There is no doubt about the quality of the decision making of this Government, the quality of debate in the Cabinet and beyond, not only as seen in the decision on the south-eastern forests but also taken in the context of its being a week or so away from the greenhouse gases decision. To achieve a decision with the conservative government of New South Wales on this issue is no mean feat, particularly given the history of environmental decisions in New South Wales since March 1988 and the defeat of the Labor Government there. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision also took a degree of courage that has not been acknowledged, as seen in the context of the reaction and the responses from some industry groups, to a lesser extent from the Australian Council of Trade Unions and from some of the conservative groups. This decision required courage and resolution and it has required a degree of resilience in the political process subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this afternoon Senator Richardson said that Federal pressure from the Labor Government has caused the Greiner-Murray Government to change course on this issue and to change course dramatically. The philosophy of `rip it out and tear it down', on which the Greiner-Murray Government was elected in New South Wales, could not be sustained. While we are talking about environmentally sustainable decisions, environmentally sustainable process, it is interesting to note that that philosophy of `reduce it to rubble or to chips' has not proved politically sustainable either in the State context or nationally. Things have changed to an extent in Macquarie Street. A chill wind of electoral as well as economic reality has registered. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Michael Baume referred to the Democrats in this debate as being the odd man out. Given Senator Bourne's original contribution and her analysis of the election of Democrat senators, I thought that was singularly inappropriate and inaccurate. I prefer to think of the Democrats as seeking to carve out for themselves a position in Australian politics as being a fourth faction of the Australian Labor Party, some group off to the left of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the debate is about the environmental agenda, about relations with the green constituency, which has developed an affinity with this Government and has been and remains close to the Labor Party in a primary sense in decision making. It is about political support. Political support, votes, polls and relationships are insufficient elements in Australian government. There is a bipartisanship here that is important in what has been reached with the New South Wales Government. It has been a bipartisan decision and in many respects that is the way it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> A few points need to be made about the Government's approach in the broad on this decision and related environmental decisions. It is undeniable that this Government has taken decisions on merit and has made decisions accordingly. There has been balance overall and the right decisions have been made. The decisions on Kakadu, the Franklin, Wesley Vale, the Tasmanian forests, the wet tropics, the ozone and the Antarctic, in my view-and I think in the view of a broad majority of Australians-are all sensible, realistic and sound decisions. When Senator Richardson was Minister for the Environment, decisions were not considered easy; they are not easy now. The only way to gain environmental protection was to fight a battle. The battle is being fought and has been fought by this Government. A lot of nonsense has been talked about how the Labor Government has become less green. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision on the south-eastern forests was always going to be difficult. It is understandable why some people in the green movement did not applaud the determination. Some wanted more of the forests to be saved. If any proof was needed that the Labor Government deals with issue according to merit, it was given last week when it looked at the determination of the south-eastern forests and the greenhouse effects in the same week: one decision was considered a soft green decision; the other a deep green decision. As the Prime Minister said a few days ago, `We make decisions on their merits. We have done this and we will continue to'. It is obvious from watching the debate taking place throughout the community that the official Opposition has simply staked out a claim of irrelevance, of playing no part, of vacillating and procrastinating. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the Government's decision are worthy of a brief outline to the Senate. A system of new reserves is to be established in the south-eastern region, containing about 55,000 hectares. The boundaries have been drawn taking into account both conservation and resource considerations. It will conserve about 60 per cent of the three national estate places involved in the recent dispute. It will draw about 11 1/2 per cent of the timber resource currently available to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has made it clear that it will cooperate with all bodies involved to achieve measures, such as resource supplementation through plantations, industry development through improved resource utilisation and value adding, further biological research, and management of the new parks and reserves. Overall it might be said without fear of contradiction that these measures and the reservation system will provide a more stable long term strategy for the management of the south-eastern forests. All of this is to be finalised by the end of the year. That is no mean achievement at all. </PARA>
<PARA> A brief word must also be said about the reactions to the decision, both for and against. The New South Wales Forest Products Association Ltd can be numbered amongst those who have welcomed the decision. That Association notes that it will be an opportunity for the forest industry and the environment movement to settle differences over the south-eastern forests. </PARA>
<PARA> It notes also that there was a necessity for compromise and balance. It notes also that a cooperative approach has been achieved at long last-with Ian Causley thankfully rendered inoperative-between the relevant Ministers. Most importantly, the decision will end the resource uncertainty for industry in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is not the view taken by Dr Robert Bain, on behalf of the National Association of Forest Industries, who was very critical of the Government, in some respects representing the alternative poll of opinion to that which has been advanced in Senator Coulter's proposition this afternoon. Dr Bain argued, for example, that far more was given to the conservationists than to the forest industry in terms of the decision, claiming that it would halt timber production in 75 per cent of the National Estate in the area, with a resultant loss of jobs and the like, and arguing also that the agreement would not help industry to process its resources. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply not one side of an argument here; there is another side to the coin. There was enormous pressure on the Government in terms of the decision that had to be taken. The decision on the south-eastern forests, taken with the Government of New South Wales, was based on a thorough scientific study of the biological values of the forests involved. It does mean that about 60 per cent of the National Estate forests will be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision is also part of a very detailed industry restructuring package which will be based on such things as sustainability and value-adding. I might say on that score, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that is one thing that many conservationists have rightly been saying is necessary if we are to properly use our resources overall as Australians. Many people in the broad community and the conservation movement and beyond recognise and acknowledge that this Labor Government has an environmental record second to none. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the national interest, this was a balanced and fair decision. It sent a signal about Government priorities. It sets the basis for a policy of environmentally sustainable growth, and that is the policy being pursued effectively by this Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our colleague in the Senate from the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, has put forward as a matter of urgency-which I do not believe, in light of the debate we have heard today, that he can really sustain-the peremptory nature of the decision to destroy the ecological integrity of the south-eastern forests and the hollowness of the claim that the Hawke Government has any commitment to ecologically sustainable development. Again, we are seeing a situation where the conservation movement is complaining because its leaders did not get everything that they actually wanted, despite the loss of over 100 jobs a sawmill and an agreement which goes well beyond the recommendations of the Joint Scientific Committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In politics, timing is important. I believe that, in addition to all the significant problems that are facing Australia today-which include an oil strike, a wool crisis, balance of payments problems, high interest rates, business failures, bankruptcy, and declining standards of living-the Democrats wish to perpetuate this debate in relation to forestry. Secondly, if I may, I take issue with Senator Coulter on the relativities. I think it is well known that the growing of young trees tends to solve this problem much more satisfactorily than the preservation of older ones. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to put things into perspective with regard to the Government's decision-in Senator Coulter's words-`to allow extensive and destructive logging in the south-east forests of New South Wales'. Over more recent times the focus of the forestry debate has moved from the Tasmanian forests to the south-eastern forests of New South Wales. Whilst the concentration was on Tasmanian forests, I remind the Senate, the Commonwealth Government was responsible for adding a further 600,000 acres of Tasmania to the World Heritage Register. This additional amount, together with other forest areas and forest reserves, et cetera, takes to 25 per cent the amount of land which is locked up in World Heritage, national parks and other Crown reserves and is thus unavailable for commercial use. Now the attention has swung to the south-eastern forests and pressure is being applied by members of the conservation movement for the locking up of National Estate areas, in particular, within that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government made a decision last week to allow logging to continue in certain parts of the south-eastern forests while other parts were conserved or, if you like, preserved. The decision, on the one hand, allows logging in 40 per cent of the three most contentious areas of the National Estate in the south-eastern forests-Coolangubra, Tantawangalo and Yowaka. On the other hand, a larger proportion of the three national estate areas-60 per cent-is to be conserved. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that my colleague Senator Coulter is not of the mistaken belief, as are many conservationists, that in locking up an area from logging it will remain unchanged forever. A forest can never be preserved. A forest is extremely dynamic and ever-changing, and that is why it is such a tremendously renewable resource. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a myrtle-dominated forest which is preserved through its inclusion in the World Heritage, national estate or other listing will revert to a eucalyptus forest should a wildfire raze it. Even without wildfire, over time the forest will die and will be replaced by eucalypt species as the forest canopy opens to allow the sunlight into the forest floor. </PARA>
<PARA> That a forest should be conserved because it is registered as National Estate is also of questionable logic. One of Tasmania's National Estate areas which received national press in recent times was Jackeys Marsh. A handful or so of residents in Jackeys Marsh did not want the State forest around the logging area. Even after the State's forestry service, the Forestry Commission, had spent many hours with the residents altering the road access to divert it from housing and changing the logging coupes so that they were not visible from residents' homes, the objection still stood. The area was nominated for National Estate and placed very promptly on the National Estate interim list. There were numerous species listed as rare and endangered in an attempt to justify the Jackeys Marsh nomination-all of which, it has since proven, are neither rare nor endangered. In fact, for one species there was strong evidence of its succession and proliferation being assured by the logging and regenerative processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing about Jackeys Marsh is that the forest, a eucalypt forest, has been cut over for sawlogs for many years and, I might add, is still being cut over by the locals for fence posts. All that remains are gnarled, twisted old eucalypt trees-a pure pulpwood forest which would only be used commercially as woodchip. The forest is not a particularly good example of a forest type and thus begs the question as to why it was consigned for National Estate nomination in the first place and subsequently registered. </PARA>
<PARA> While I admit that I am not as familiar as some of my other colleagues with the south-eastern forest areas, I will not pass comment on their worthiness or otherwise for inclusion in the National Estate and whether their National Estate values would be threatened by logging in the area. But the point that I am leading to is that I wish to inform the Senate that the Resource Assessment Commission was told in its public hearing in Hobart on 5= October 1990 by Mr Geoff Law, a spokesman of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, that the use of National Estate listing by the conservation movement has been a calculated ploy to further its cause to cease logging in native forests. </PARA>
<PARA> This must throw doubt on the validity of the whole National Estate processes, including the Australian Heritage Commission, which, as the Australian editorial put it, plays a game of claiming to be merely advisory when it suits it and of being avowedly conservationist when it suits. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt Senator Coulter is quite hyped up at the moment on his topic of forest conservation, having entertained tribal leaders from Sarawak who spoke about the devastation of their rainforest. And from my personal on-site inspection in both of those countries, I must say that I share his concern about Thailand and Malaysia because they lack proper logging and regeneration practices. But unlike Sarawak, what Senator Coulter and others of like mind need to understand is that here in Australia the majority of those who plan logging coupes, supervise those logging coupes and regenerate those coupes after logging, have undergone four years of tertiary education. They have an educated and scientific basis to every decision that they make. Theirs is not the rape and pillage mentality which I regret is rife in some other parts of the world. The standards overseas are not the same as the standards here at home. </PARA>
<PARA> This is borne out by the comments made by the World Bank when the Wesley Vale mill did not eventuate. In fact, the World Bank expressed its regret at the cancellation of the Wesley Vale project on the basis that if the supply of bleached kraft pulp was not met from Wesley Vale, it meant that the mill would be built somewhere else in the world, probably a developing country-a country in which the environmental control standards do not come anywhere near those in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So the forests of the south-east are not about to be invaded by a bunch of gung-ho cowboy equivalents with their Cats and D9s. Australia's forests which are utilised by the timber industry are managed by professionals. This is the point that I want to make. In many instances it is these professionals and the research departments attached to the forest companies which make the scientific advancements in the industry-for example, the introduction of machinery to minimise soil erosion and the best methods of regenerating the logged coupes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's forest industry companies do not go in and rape, pillage and run. They take a long term view in planning their operations. The time frame forestry employees think of is between 20 to 80 years. Those working in research today certainly do not expect to see the results of their research in their working lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania has been fighting the forest resource utilisation-forest conservation battle for almost a decade now. In that time there have been something like 10 inquiries, all of which have handed down decisions in favour of the industry. The latest in the long line of reports and inquiries has been the Salamanca agreement, which led to the forest and the forest industries strategy. The difference with regards to this strategy from any other inquiry was that all the players in the forestry industry in Tasmania, along with their adversaries, came together over a 12-month period to put that strategy together. The sawloggers, the woodchip companies, the environmental groups and the Government agreed to sit down and, with the Federal Government's financial support for the process, to try and work out a strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea was that each would put the particular issues on the table and work out where the compromises needed to be made to try to develop an industry that had some certainty about it for investment purposes and also gave relevant value to conservation issues. So at the end of the day we got the magic phrase that so many of us like to use, `sustainable development'-developing such things as private forestry, utilising properly State forests, and looking at all the different methods of logging and so on. All the parties which have been involved in this process over the 12 months signed the strategy, except the combined environmental groups which represented the Australian Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy sets out certain areas to be locked up and certain areas to be made available on a long term basis to the forest industries for commercial use. When it came to the crunch the environmental groups were unable to sign the strategy. Their reason for not signing was foremost that the strategy included the logging of some National Estate areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make two points from the Tasmanian forest and forest industry strategy. Firstly, the process which arose out of the Salamanca agreement was the first attempt at bringing all the parties to the table and undertaking a process of discussion, information sharing and compromise. This process had the financial backing of the Federal Government. While it may seem like a good idea for the Federal Government to finally get the forestry issue sorted out in Tasmania, let me tell the Senate that the people of Tasmania have viewed the Federal Government as enemy No. 1 on forestry issues over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> People have lost count of the number of times that the State Government has made a decision with regard to the forestry industry only to have that decision overturned by the Federal Government. Even today in this chamber, despite the signing of an agreement by the industry and the various unions and endorsed by the Tasmanian Government, we could not get a clear undertaking from the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, that the Federal Government would not intervene. </PARA>
<PARA> For a change, we do have a Federal Government that is showing signs of cooperating with State governments in these matters. Likewise, on the matter of the south-east forests of New South Wales, the decision as to the areas to be conserved and the areas to be made available to the logging industry was made in conjunction with the State Government. I believe that this State-Federal government cooperation on forestry matters is to be applauded. It augurs well for the creating of a secure environment for investment in the forest industry over the coming years. Such investment, particularly in the pulp and paper manufacturing sector, is necessary if we are to reverse our current economic trends. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that the move to a Salamanca-type approach to forests can be viewed as a very serious move by the Federal Government to take the forests out of the political arena and put them back into the realm of scientific and rational debate. We welcome that. However, as with Tasmania's forest and forest industry strategy, where a combined environmental group could not sign the final strategy because it went against the basic philosophies of the groups it represented-no logging in National Estate and no logging in native forest-I will be highly surprised if agreement can be reached on the definition of `sustainable development'. To the groups at different ends of the spectrum, sustainable development does mean different things. Unfortunately we cannot support this urgency motion today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past few weeks we have seen a spate of newspaper articles saying that the greens are over the hill and that now Australia must give priority to economic realities. These are the people who are trying to distance themselves from the result of the Federal election in March. I would define it as a polite way of saying that the Government is giving in to the demands of industry and mining interests. This contrasts curiously with the findings of Simon Balderstone whose report, not fully published yet, indicates that green preferences indisputably helped Labor get across the line in 10 key seats in the March election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the Australian Labor Party holding a parliamentary majority of eight, that could have meant the difference between government and opposition. Three of those 10 seats were in my home State of Western Australia. If honourable senators had asked any of the House of Representatives members of the Labor Party on election night how they felt about green preferences, I am sure there would have been a ringing endorsement of the fact that most green preferences were going in their direction and they certainly made the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Government has to realise is that those people who voted green and then gave their preferences to Labor, did not do so in order to see the kind of policies put into place that we are talking about here this afternoon. Nor do we look forward to a mining go-ahead in Kakadu to satisfy the economic rationalists. There are a whole lot of other issues that could be included in this debate, where the Government made promises during the election which seem now to be fading fast. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to see that the decision made last week on the greenhouse limits went some way to meeting the demands of the environment movement. Although it was disappointing that it was not 20 per cent of carbon dioxide gases alone, it included the other greenhouse gases as well. However, it was some return to sense on the part of the Government that it did not turn totally away from the hard decisions that have to be made in favour of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> A classic example of this rush away from sustainable development pertains to the south-eastern forests of New South Wales, although I would add that it also applies to the forests of East Gippsland and to Western Australia-a situation I intend to refer to in a few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision that is being made about the future of the south-eastern forests of New South Wales is a long term decision. The Government did not need to make it now. The timber industry had between six months and two years timber in reserves outside of essentially undisturbed forest, that is, most of the National Estate and all of the high conservation value areas. The conservation movement and even parts of the Federal Government have tried to find out from the Forestry Commission where the timber reserves are, but it refuses to divulge the information. Apparently we just have to take the Forestry Commission's word for it. It is this kind of secrecy and evasion which is so frustrating in terms of trying to reach an agreement for a long term strategy for the forests. </PARA>
<PARA> It is criminally irresponsible to make these kinds of long term decisions about the forests when we are denied important information that will allow us to dialogue effectively and offer an informed critique of the arguments put forward by the Government of New South Wales and the big timber interests. This Government has made a decision to circumvent the Resource Assessment Commission and to give in to the timber industry in advance of any long term strategy that may come out of the RAC. As Senator Coulter has said, it is a peremptory decision and it did not need to be made now. Essentially, therefore, the Government has given in to the logging protests, and I presume that any future waivering will result in another blockade until Cabinet backs down again. The loggers talk about resource security, but I want to question their definition. After all, loggers have had resource security for many years and what we have seen is a winding down of jobs, some 20,000 or so jobs in the last 20 years. At the present rate of forest destruction, the Nimmitabel sawmill, for example, will not be around in 10 years unless there is a long term strategy drawn up for the region. The Greens did not cause this; it was the timber industry and the nature of the timber trade. Targeting the Greens is going way off course and blaming the wrong people for the loss of jobs in the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Harris Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd, a totally foreign owned company despite the name, is well known for greedily taking out profits as fast as it can. We have already been given the relevant figures by Senator Coulter, so there is no need for me to repeat them. What the Government should have done before giving Harris Daishowa undertakings on future resource allocations is to have demanded a proper strategy for renewable resources for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the concern of the Government of New South Wales where jobs are concerned, its hypocrisy is breathtaking. This is the Government which is trying to cut back on 30,000 jobs in the State, mostly in the Public Service, many of them in rural areas, providing vital community services such as schools, health care and infrastructure. Why should it show so much concern for around 600 jobs when there are only 10 years of forest left anyway? As the Wilderness Society has asked: How does the Government reconcile job losses elsewhere in the economy, which are explained as the product of industry rationalisation, when it is not prepared to address such rationalisation in an industry which, of its own accord, admits that it is not sustainable?</PARA>
<PARA> As for the timber industry, it cannot have it both ways. On the one hand it wants free markets but on the other hand it wants, in effect, a sheltered workshop where it can knock down all the trees as fast as it wants. In fact, the conservation movement has repeatedly spoken out in favour of a long term strategy for the forests which guarantees job security. There have been repeated proposals for the creation of tree plantations which would guarantee supplies into the long term future. </PARA>
<PARA> Where, though, is the security for national parks? They are not going to be managed properly. They do not have ecological integrity. They do not have long term security. We have now missed the chance to have one great escarpment forest stretching down to the Victorian border and beyond. Coolangubra is in effect being demolished. I am seriously led to question this Government's commitment to ecologically sustainable development. I quote from a document put out by Australia's leading environment groups, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace Australia, the Wilderness Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature:</PARA>
<PARA>Ecologically sustainable development has, as its foundation, the limits set by the earth's biological process. An appreciation of the overall imperative of ecological sustainability can only be gained through an understanding of the state of the global environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The overall picture of the global and Australian environments is one of continuing decline. Loss of biological diversity and the degradation of natural systems are accelerating. </PARA>
<PARA>This particular section goes on to point out that Australia is classified as one of the seven most important mega-diverse areas on earth. Yet the rate of species loss in Australia over the past 200 years has been extraordinary, as Senator Bourne pointed out earlier on in this debate. Here in the south-eastern forests of New South Wales we have a situation where a choice could be made for the future, and the Government has chosen to follow its old discredited path. A recent good example of what I am talking about is the destruction of Devils Creek koala habitat, where the Forestry Commission has failed to honour a promise to carry out further koala habitat survey work in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Instead, it has begun roading activities which pose a major threat to this most significant koala habitat. </PARA>
<PARA> The koala faces regional extinction in the very near future. In this context, it might be useful to remember a little of the extermination process which this animal has experienced. Koalas were once so numerous in the Bega Valley that one resident could write, `When I was a boy in Bega...almost every tree had its bear'. Today, the only surviving wild koalas reside in the State forests of the area. It is highly likely that the logging and roading activities of the Forestry Commission in the Devils Creek catchment area are a significant contribution to the final chapter of the extinction of the animal in this region, despite what Senator Michael Baume has said this afternoon about no species being threatened with local or national extinction. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 20 years, there have been koala sightings in this area and the regional and district foresters of Eden must be aware that the major threat to the koala is the destruction and fragmentation of habitat. The failure of the Forestry Commission to honour its promise to carry out further survey work is just one more example of the secrecy, deceit and destructive arrogance which has characterised its management of our forests. It is this failure even to carry out an adequate survey of koala habitation which is one of the reasons that conservationists have urged the Government not to make these crucial long term decisions so soon, despite what Senator Richardson has said about not really needing any more time for making these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, more time is needed. We need that time for the surveys that the industry says are not needed, but I do not believe that the industry needs an immediate decision despite its claims at the moment. It is also a savage irony that it is a Japanese company which is so heavily involved in this destruction of forest habitat when the Japanese people are so enamoured of this animal. The other question, of course, we must ask is to what use Harris Daishowa puts Australian woodchips in Japan. It is a highly consumer oriented society, and I imagine that our valuable timbers are being wasted hand over fist by Japanese consumers, who are not very concerned about recycling or reusing. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the more overall issue of ecologically sustainable development. A move away from a resource driven economy is imperative if Australia is to avoid economic and ecological decline in the long term. Although it is understood that decisions that have to be made now will seem to be tough, they must be made. As the conservation movement has argued, ecological sustainability imposes a new discipline upon the Australian economy. Guiding principles for ecologically sustainable development include intergenerational equity, the conservation of biodiversity, constant natural capital and sustainable income, an anticipatory and precautionary approach and the pricing of environmental values and natural resources. At the moment they are not priced in any way at all and yet they have almost priceless value once they are removed. By then, of course, it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's discussion paper fails to acknowledge the underlying imperative of ecological sustainability or environment as the basis for continued human existence, not just as a facet of it. It is the underlying principle, and I think the Government has failed to grasp that basic concept. The emphasis on the maintenance of economic growth ignores the need for major changes in structure and major distribution in resource and energy use. It has to address demand, not just look for continuously expanding supply. That is why we question this Government's lip service to sustainable development when it makes the kind of decisions that we are talking about in respect of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is not very different in Western Australia. Again, we have a situation where commitments are made to continuing forestry operations before all assessment information is made available and before putting in place a strategy which is ecologically sustainable. I know that Western Australia does not figure very much in terms of the debate on the fate of our forests, as I have noticed this afternoon, but I want to put on record the Western Australian row over the Four Corners program entitled `The Wood for the Trees', which examined the economic basis of the timber industry in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a program which raised questions about the price received by the State Government for the timber resources it administers and focused on the role of the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management. It was an interesting program which triggered off a lot of protests from vested interests-objections which were considered by the ABC and covered in a report dated 18 July this year. I have not got time to deal with the report in this debate, despite its relevance to the critique that has been presented by Senator Coulter and Senator Bourne this afternoon, so I ask permission to table it. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the other speakers in this debate because it has revealed a great deal about their approach to this matter. Senator Watson has talked about the Australian expert foresters coming from Tasmania. He would know that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission ran up a debt of over $400m to the extent that it could not even afford to pay the interest on the debt. That shows how well it was managing the forests in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several senators have commented on environmentally sustainable growth-the term that was used by Senator Loosley-which indicates just how little this Government really understands about sustainability. Let me say absolutely and unequivocally that growth, as measured by economists-that is, growth of gross national product-is not consistent with environmental sustainability. There is an absolute irreconcilability and unless the definition of 'growth' is modified we cannot have sustainability. That assertion is absolutely provable-it is not an arguable point at all. To hear members of the Opposition and the Government still talking about balancing environmental ecological sustainability and economic growth is to talk in absolutely absurd terms. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of points were mentioned. Senator Richardson began by pointing out that he was relying on a scientifically reliable report. He was referring simply to the joint scientific study. As Senator Bourne mentioned, five of the six people on the committee of the joint scientific study were foresters. There are a number of other studies which indicate that a great deal of circumspection should be used in approaching this whole matter. We should not be going in, as we are, logging these forests. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote a few other experts. Liz Dovey, a specialist potoroo biologist from the National Parks and Wildlife Service in New South Wales, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the current management regime continues in the way that's been advocated . . . the long-foot potoroo will almost certainly become extinct in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Harry Recher from the Department of Ecosystem Management in the University of New England said:</PARA>
<PARA>A balanced membership--</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to the joint scientific study--</PARA>
<PARA>might have avoided some of the inconsistencies in the Committee's report and its apparent support of logging interests. </PARA>
<PARA>I will quote Dr Hal Cogger of the Australian Museum, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>When we undertake the kinds of operations that are proposed for the south east forests there is . . . a high risk of some organisms becoming extinct. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hugh Possingham-who has already been quoted-from the Research School of Biological Sciences at the Australian National University said:</PARA>
<PARA>Their use--</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to the Committee--</PARA>
<PARA>of ecological theory is poor. If a graduate student wrote this . . . I'd think that I'd done a poor job in educating them. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Gordon Orians, the eminent Professor of Zoology from the University of Washington, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The confident assertion of the committee that continued logging of the South East Forests will not threaten . . . species in the region is not supported by the scientific evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the basis on which we approach this matter of urgency which was brought into question by Senator Richardson. We believe there is abundant scientific evidence to support the stand we have taken, and the Government quite clearly accepted the evidence that suited its particular purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Several of the speakers in this debate have suggested that we need to compromise, and suggested that we know enough about the forests to maintain the biological values. Let me say again, unequivocally, that an incredible arrogance runs through the arguments of the Government and the Opposition in the assumption that we know everything about these forests and that we can, indeed, maintain their biological integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence is that we are supremely ignorant, and the reason for protecting these forests in their undamaged state is not to hold them-as Senator Watson and Senator Baume tried facetiously to suggest-in an unchanged state, but to hold them in a way which will preserve the range of species in them. Certainly, they will turn over and they will die and new animals and plants will grow, but we want to maintain them so that the evolutionary processes which are going on in those forests will continue in perpetuity without the disruptive intrusion of human intervention. They will be areas to which we can go to discover more about the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give one example, which is happening globally. Honourable Senators may have read about this. It appears that throughout the world not only are frogs disappearing in terms of numbers of species, but also the numbers in each species are in rapid decline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking to Dr Mike Tyler just the other night. He said that he has been in virgin rainforest in north Queensland and in virgin rain- forest in Costa Rica quite recently and, in both situations, the number of frog species and the number of frogs were in rapid decline. We do not know why that is occurring. I hear Senator Watson saying, `That is the warming'. I wish we jolly well knew why it is occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Years ago we sent canaries down into mines and when they died we said, `Ah ha, there is something wrong, we should not go in there.' We now have frog species-not just one but frog species generally throughout the world-declining in numbers and we do not know why, but there is a strong suspicion that it is because of the intrusions which humans have made into the global environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The assertion was repeated by Senator Richardson that the reason for coming to the agreement in relation to the southeastern forests was to protect the jobs of the sawmillers. My evidence is that 80 per cent of the timber that comes out of these south-eastern forests goes to the chippers. I can only assume, therefore, that the practices which this Government is about are to protect the interests of Daishowa, not the interests of the loggers. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the statement I made earlier: where it becomes a matter of protecting the assumed model of the economy, neither Mr Hawke nor Mr Greiner in New South Wales cares a hoot about jobs. I listed the large number of jobs that are being lost to protect their model of the economy-to protect what they see as a desirable shape to the economy. If it becomes a matter of protecting the environment and losing two or three jobs, they say, `To hell with the environment! We are not going to make ourselves unpopular to that limited extent'. I thank Senator Vallentine for pointing out that at the last election the Labor Federal Government was returned substantially on the preferences which flowed from the green parties and from the Democrats. I do not wish to draw any distinction between greens and Democrats, because we are supporting the same environmental ends. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear that the membership of the Labor and coalition parties is very much in decline. I can put it on record that our membership is substantially increasing-and I am not surprised, because every poll of public opinion one looks at indicates that the public are right behind the sorts of measures that we have raised in this urgency motion this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainability has become a term which is bandied around. Indeed, one author cynically suggested in the Adelaide Advertiser the other day in a letter that it will not be very long before we hear the term `sustainable nuclear war'. It is a term which it is very important to get right. I point out that sustainability must become the basis for industrial development from now on into the indefinite future. It is not understood by the Government or by the Opposition, and it is absolutely important to get it right. The logging of the south-east forests is an important reminder that the Government has still not got its economic house in order. </PARA>

<PARA>STEVEDORING INDUSTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act 1977 and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977 to give statutory effect to the Government's waterfront reform strategy. It is introduced in conjunction with the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I will now outline the background to these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been poorly served by its waterfront industry, with major costs for the rest of the economy. This key point in the export trading chain has been characterised by gross inefficiencies and high costs due to an absence of competition and competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government determined that the true potential of our waterfront industry should be unlocked by a coherent strategy for reform. This is a task on which we are embarking vigorously. It is a major element of the Government's program of microeconomic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 June 1989, following consultations on the conclusions of the Inter-State Commission's waterfront investigation, the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Ralph Willis, announced a far-reaching reform strategy for the waterfront industry. The strategy is designed to improve waterfront efficiency, reliability and productivity which will, in turn, assist our exporting sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, the waterfront reform strategy has been consolidated. In October last year, a three year ``in-principle agreement'' for waterfront reform was entered into with Stevedoring employers, relevant unions and the ACTU. The agreement resulted from negotiations with waterfront parties conducted under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, which oversights the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to the reforms outlined in the agreement is the shift from the present industry-wide employment practice to enterprise-based employment, and other new employment arrangements where appropriate. Under the new arrangements, employment responsibilities which have rested with the industry will be assumed by individual employers, an arrangement more in line with the practice in other industries. These changed arrangements will contribute to achieving a competitive and productive waterfront industry with improved services to clients. </PARA>
<PARA> This initiative is to be assisted by a workforce rejuvenation program involving a one-off early retirement and redundancy scheme. In addition there will be a progressive phasing out of statute based arrangements for cross subsidies between ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills, as a package, underpin the waterfront reform strategy:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, by facilitating through the existing special statutory levy, the collection of employer contributions to the new retirement and redundancy scheme</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, by providing for the phasing out over the reform period of cross-subsidy arrangements for smaller Australian ports which are currently financed by revenue raised under the general statutory levy. </PARA>
<PARA> These smaller ports, sometimes referred to as non-permanent ports, are those which employ Division B waterside workers, that is, ``waterside workers'' who are employed by the industry and are available for engagement by Stevedores on an ``as required'' basis, rather than under the weekly hire arrangements which apply to the majority of the waterfront workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> The phasing out arrangement will involve payment of the general levy by a small port being discontinued when all employers in that port have moved to new employment arrangements, and a complementary phasing out of cross subsidy payments. This will ensure that these ports are exposed to the competitive pressures necessary to improve their efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> As this Bill contains a number of amendments of a minor nature which are explained in the explanatory memorandum, I will confine my comments to the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act 1977</PARA>
<PARA> The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is established by this Act to administer statutory levies imposed under the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977. It comprises a government appointed chairperson, three representatives of the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, and a representative each of the Australian National Line, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the membership of the Committee be expanded to include an officer of the Department of Industrial Relations (which has administrative responsibility for the legislation and is involved in the collection and administration of the statutory levies) and a nominee of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The functions of the Committee are to be expanded to enable it to make recommendations to the Minister as to when the general levy should cease to apply to employers in smaller ports which have moved to enterprise-based employment or other new employment arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Under provisions contained in the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990 the Minister for Industrial Relations will be able to discontinue the levy for the smaller ports to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment is proposed to enable the Committee to make payments directly to an employer for reimbursement of expenditure incurred in satisfying relevant award obligations. Current arrangements require that these payments be made only to the Association and therefore do not cover the situation where an employer decides to withdraw its membership from the Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements, these payments will continue to be made to individual employers or the Association in respect of employees in the smaller ports until such time as the Minister notifies, by gazettal, a finishing date for a port indicating that all employers in that port have moved to new employment arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 of the Bill provides the vehicle by which revenue collected through the special levy is to be applied to the provision of prescribed benefits to eligible employees. The ``in-principle agreement'' defines eligibility for the early retirement and redundancy payments in terms of, amongst other things, employment by a member company of the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour. </PARA>
<PARA> However should a Stevedoring company withdraw its membership from the Association, its employees may no longer be eligible for early retirement and redundancy payments. A prescription power is therefore proposed in clause 9 to provide for this and other exigencies. Monies raised to meet redundancy obligations will be paid to the Committee, to the Association or to individual employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill involves a change to the definition of ``local cargo'' contained in this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Under current arrangements, cargoes shipped to oil rigs and other associated structures or vessels located above the continental shelf in Australia are levied at the higher special levy rate applied in respect of overseas cargoes. As these cargoes are not destined for overseas locations, it is clearly illogical and inequitable that they continue to be levied in this way. Amendments included in the Bill seek to rectify this small anomaly by including these cargoes in the definition of ``local cargo''. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalties prescribed for offences against these acts and regulations are to be increased for the first time since the Act came into effect in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not involve a financial cost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the definition of ``local cargo'' will not affect the amount ultimately collected through the special levy to meet employer contributions to the early retirement and redundancy scheme. The levies will be in place no longer than is required to meet outgoings. </PARA>
<PARA> Any financial impact will be positive as, due to amendments contained in clause 10, the Commonwealth will be able to recover expenses (including salaries and audit costs) incurred in its administration of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>STEVEDORING INDUSTRY LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977. It is introduced in conjunction with the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the phasing out of the general statutory levy imposed in respect of Division B waterside workers which is, in part, used to finance cross-subsidy arrangements for the smaller Australian ports, that is those ports where Division B waterside workers are employed. </PARA>
<PARA> This levy is applied to meet attendance money, guaranteed wages and retainers and annual leave for employees in smaller, non-permanent ports. It also finances, for all ports, employers' retirement fund contributions, administration and port conciliator costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The `in-principle agreement' entered into with stevedoring employers and unions and the ACTU (in October 1989) provides for the general levy to be discontinued in the smaller ports on a port-by-port basis once new employment arrangements are effected. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 9A is introduced into the Act to facilitate the phasing out. This section provides for the Minister to notify, by gazettal, a date in respect of each small, non-permanent port after which the general levy will cease to apply to employers in those ports. </PARA>
<PARA> A date will only be notified in respect of a port when the Minister is satisfied that all employers at the port have revised their employment arrangements in line with the `in-principle agreement'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to restructure home ownership assistance arrangements to better reflect the changing pattern of home ownership assistance requirements in recent years and to ensure that Commonwealth funding is better targeted to the needs of home buyers on lower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the Bill is to preclude payment of assistance under the First Home Owners Act 1983 to sole or joint applicants who contract to purchase or build, or commence construction of, a dwelling on or after 22 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also fixes 30 June 1991 as the cut off date by which applications for assistance under the First Home Owners Act must be received by the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill additionally deals with two minor amendments. Firstly, it amends section 38 of the First Home Owners Act, to create an offence related to the recklessly making of false or misleading statements in connection with applications under the act, in addition to the existing offence of knowingly making such statements. Further, it deletes certain references which are unnecessary duplications of provisions which can be found in the Crimes Act 1914. Secondly, the Bill corrects some anomalies which occurred when references to migration law in the First Home Owners Act were amended by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The second minor amendment corrects drafting oversights affecting applications since last December. These oversights have resulted in inequitable treatment of certain migrants, generally from New Zealand and some of whom are long term residents here, in the application of the scheme's income test. The proposed amendment will enable the Department to review such applications. </PARA>
<PARA> The First Home Owners Scheme (FHOS) was introduced on 1 October 1983, to assist low to moderate income first home buyers into home ownership, to stimulate construction of new dwellings and to create new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> When FHOS was announced, housing activity was at a 20 year low-only 105,000 dwellings were commenced in 1982/83. Housing finance was in short supply and it was rationed. This often resulted in `cocktail' arrangements whereby home buyers had to take out a second mortgage at a higher interest rate-thus driving up the overall cost of finance. </PARA>
<PARA> In its first year of operation, FHOS assisted over 54,000 households into home ownership and was a key element in a remarkable recovery in the housing industry-housing commencements increased by almost one third, to about 137,000 in 1983/84 and some 40,000 new jobs were created. Since inception FHOS has helped over 360,000 households into home ownership at a cost of around $1.53 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed earlier, the nature of home ownership assistance has changed over the last few years and so has the economic environment. Housing activity has fallen to a more sustainable level following the record level of 175,000 commencements reached in 1988/89. The Australian financial system has been progressively deregulated which has ensured an adequate supply of housing finance and enabled lenders to develop loan products which are more responsive to the needs of lower income borrowers. The overall supply of housing finance has increased from $7.2 billion in 1982/83 to $18.8 billion in 1989/90. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, greater emphasis has been placed on the efficiency and effectiveness of home ownership schemes under the CSHA. The 1989 CSHA not only represents the most significant reform of public housing funding but also has laid the foundation for a significant increase in funds available for home purchase loans by inclusion of private sector funds. As a result of these reforms and the development of shared home ownership schemes under the CSHA home ownership has been extended to include people on lower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of the close co-operation between the States/Territories and the Commonwealth in the home ownership area has led to a considerable increase in the number of families benefiting: from 16,000 in 1987/88 ($720 million) to over 32,000 in 1989/90 (over $2 billion). The market share of State Housing Authorities has more than doubled: from about 4.5 per cent in 1987/88 to over 11 per cent in 1989/90 (or some 30 per cent of the first home buyer market). Since 1983 some 124,000 households have received home purchase assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> However, despite the development of innovative financial arrangements, insufficient savings capacity continues to be a major barrier to home ownership for some lower income people. Lack of savings capacity can in some cases preclude potential home buyers from accessing State HPA Schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> To some extent, the First Home Owners Scheme has been used by home purchase assistance recipients to bridge the deposit gap or assist in meeting the entry costs and some home purchase assistance schemes are designed on this basis. However, wide variations in house prices across Australia have made it increasingly difficult to maintain and develop an equitable and efficient national scheme such as FHOS. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, under the current home ownership arrangements the same target group is benefiting from both FHOS and Home Purchase Assistance but the two programs are administered at two levels of Government. In order to streamline the administration and remove the duplication in this area the Government has decided to cease the First Home Owners Scheme and provide funds to the States to link deposit assistance with existing home lending schemes. The new arrangements will be administered directly by the State and Territory Housing Authorities and will ensure a fairer and more equitable distribution of these funds to lower income earners. The Commonwealth will develop broad guidelines against which States will develop more flexible deposit assistance tailored to family needs and local market conditions. The new arrangements will thus provide State and Territory Housing Authorities with an impetus to further develop their home purchase assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The new deposit assistance arrangements are envisaged to come into effect from 1 January 1991 provided agreements can be reached with State and Territory Governments over the next few months. It will receive total Commonwealth funding of $14 million in 1990/91 which will increase to $30 million in 1991/92. The new arrangements will be incorporated into the Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The First Home Owners Scheme ceases from the budget night. Home buyers who are already receiving assistance under the First Home Owners Scheme will, of course, continue to receive the assistance to which they are entitled. People who have entered into a binding contract to buy or build a home, or have commenced construction, before 22 August 1990, and who are otherwise eligible for assistance under the First Home Owners Scheme will have until 30 June 1991 to lodge their applications. FHOS assistance will not be available to those entering into contracts on or after 22 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990/91 some 11,000 families who have already acquired a home will receive FHOS assistance for the first time and ongoing assistance will be paid to a further 140,000 families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Housing Program is a key part of its Social Justice Strategy. It is Governments policy to maximise access to affordable and appropriate housing. Since coming to office, the Government has delivered effective services in greatly increased numbers to assist thousands of people throughout the community: 360,000 households have been assisted under FHOS; over 124,000 home purchasers received assistance under CSHA; public housing stock increased by 39 per cent and 1,450 services were provided under the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) for transitional housing support. The Government is also aware of the importance of adequate medium and long term accommodation to the successful movement of homeless young people towards independence. In responding to the needs of these young people, as highlighted in the findings of the Burdekin Report, a $100 million package of assistance, over 4 years, was announced last year. The package included substantial increases in funding for youth housing, in order to provide assistance for an additional 6,000 young people. </PARA>
<PARA> The new CSHA agreement was renegotiated in 1989 and as I said earlier, represents the most significant reform of public housing funding since the CSHA was introduced in 1945. The new arrangement will provide an unprecedented level of funding and forward commitment for public housing: $1.028 billion was provided in 1989/90 and at least that amount guaranteed for each of the three years 1990-91 to 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing area is now high on the Government's list for major reform. Current problems and projected demographic trends will change the pattern of housing demand and we need to come up with imaginative housing solutions. The Government is determined to ensure that all Australians have access to affordable and appropriate housing, in the right locations, and that this continues well into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Housing Strategy, which the Minister for Community Services and Health recently established, will examine innovative ways of providing secure, affordable and appropriate housing, within a broad economic, social and demographic framework. It will also examine longer term proposals for remedying fundamental structural problems in the housing market. The Strategy creates a major opportunity to evaluate trends in home ownership and provide a framework to examine the effectiveness of the current range of assistance schemes and policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we adjourned on Thursday evening we were discussing the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990 and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. I notice that in the intervening period there have been press reports in the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday, 13 October, about an uproar over plans to deregulate radio and television. At this stage, I want to note my concern that the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, is talking about Government plans to deregulate the broadcasting system and to replace the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with a new regulatory authority. I am concerned because this is coming at a time when this Senate is looking at passing an efficiency package and, in fact, allocating more powers to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It seems that we have things in the wrong order. I am pleased to see that Mr Beazley has moved to distance himself from the plan, indicating that the proposals represented only departmental thinking and had not yet been conclusively considered by him or the Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I place on record my concern. I wonder who really sets the agenda when we are in the middle of debating these important Bills and comments are reported in the media which cause us to question the value of this entire debate. </PARA>
<PARA> When we adjourned on Thursday I was making some comments about the extra remedies provisions of this Bill. The Broadcasting Amendment Bill inserts in the legislation certain suitability requirements for the holders of radio and television licences. Further, the Bill provides the Broadcasting Tribunal with a number of options where it finds a radio or television licensee not to be a fit and proper person to hold a commercial licence or where it finds that person to be unable to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. </PARA>
<PARA> For fairly obvious reasons, these amendments have come to be known as the Bond amendments. Although the issue of whether Alan Bond was a fit and proper person to hold a broadcasting licence may not yet be fully resolved, this example clearly highlighted the glaring deficiencies in the Act with respect to the Tribunal's powers in such a case. As is seen in the Bond case, it may be that a company is operating well within the prescribed boundaries but that one of the interest holders in the company is the party in question. The only option previously available to the Tribunal was to impose conditions on the licensee company itself. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will grant additional powers to the Tribunal, enabling it to give specific directions to relevant parties or to impose appropriate conditions on a licence where it finds a licensee fails to meet suitability requirements. Further to this, the Bill provides that where these directions or conditions do not sufficiently address the situation, the Tribunal can direct relevant parties to divest their interests. As I have indicated, the Australian Democrats welcome these additional powers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes provision for aspirant public broadcasters to transmit sponsorship announcements. The Democrats have always been strong supporters of public broadcasting as we recognise the value of diversity in our media. It is vital that potential public broadcasters have the ability to test whether a market exists for their particular broadcast format. As such, we support these clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) before us today is the so-called `efficiency package' designed to, among other things, streamline the Tribunal's share transaction approval process. The Bill will change the share transaction process to require Tribunal inquiry into only those transactions which involve the acquisition of a prescribed interest, those which result in a party coming into a position to exercise actual control or those which may breach foreign ownership provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Bill will raise the levels of general meeting votes or shareholding interests which constitute a prescribed interest in a television licence from 5 per cent to 15 per cent. The Democrats accept that these measures are desirable. We will be supporting these clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will, however, also remove the requirement for prior notification of share transactions to be given to the Tribunal. To the Democrats, it is an untenable situation that the Broadcasting Tribunal is not empowered to issue or withhold approval of share and financial transactions that affect the ownership of licences prior to those transactions taking place. After all, the Federal Communications Commission in the United States of America has this power; the Canadian radio-television Telecommunications Commission also has the power of approval, and the British regulatory commission had it up until its removal by Margaret Thatcher. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate the absurdity of the existing Australian regulations, we have the situation where the original purchase of the Nine Network by the Bond group and the question of whether Alan Bond was a fit and proper person to hold a broadcast licence was not fully resolved before the Bond group had sold the network. In the public interest, we believe the Tribunal must be provided with greater legislative power with respect to the takeovers of broadcasting stations. In particular, all share and financial transactions affecting licence ownership should be subject to prior approval by the Broadcasting Tribunal, and the Tribunal should also be empowered to step in and freeze any share sales or purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course before the Murdoch amendments of 1981, introduced by the Government of the day, the Tribunal had this prior approval power. I would like to remind some of the present Government Ministers of what they had to say when the approval requirement was removed back in 1981. Senator Gareth Evans said at the time that there were many things wrong with the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill including:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . allowing the unconditional takeovers without prior approval and with later approvals by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which is necessarily reduced to an empty cypher. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button also said:</PARA>
<PARA>The provision that the prior approval of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is required has not been a terrible inhibition to Australian companies and those who seek to take over media companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that I agree whole-heartedly with both of these statements. Requiring Broadcasting Tribunal prior approval power is not an inhibition to Australian companies and the removal of it has reduced the Tribunal to an empty cipher. This situation, we believe, should not be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Saunderson Committee noted, without prior approval it becomes a case of the Tribunal attempting to `unscramble the eggs'. Rather than seek to strengthen the Tribunal's hand with respect to the approval process, this Bill actually weakens the Tribunal by removing the obligation for parties to transactions to give the Tribunal prior notification of the transaction. For the Tribunal to at least be given the chance to function efficiently, an absolute minimum requirement is that it has as much information available to it as possible. To deny the Tribunal access to the very information it relies on to perform its duties is almost culpable. The Australian Democrats will be opposing the removal of prior notification. </PARA>
<PARA> Another clause of this Bill provides that where the Tribunal has failed to approve or decline a commercial licence share transaction within six months of the transfer inquiry beginning, then it is deemed to have given approval to the transaction. The Bill also allows the Tribunal to extend the inquiry period where it feels this is appropriate but it must provide written reasons for doing this. My concern with this clause is that if a situation is serious enough to warrant an inquiry in the first place, then it is inappropriate to simply deem approval because six months has elapsed. One of the primary reasons that some tribunal inquiries go beyond the six months is again because the Tribunal is grossly underfunded. Such a clause provides no incentive to the licensees to assist in the speedy resolution of the inquiries; it does just the opposite, and it may be more appropriate to deem rejection where an inquiry is incomplete after a prescribed period. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the more controversial clauses of this Bill relate to the networking agreements between the regional stations and the networks. The Bill will provide exemptions from ownership and control limits for parties to such networking agreements. The granting of these exemptions results from a ruling by the Attorney-General that networking agreements may breach the 60 per cent audience reach limit. </PARA>
<PARA> As the aggregation of our regional stations relies heavily on these agreements, action is clearly needed to be taken. It is already on the record that the Australian Democrats opposed aggregation, as we believed it would be detrimental to the quality of service provided by the regional stations, particularly in terms of local content. We accept, however, that regional viewers deserve to have the same choice of programs that their city counterparts have. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, the regional stations have been in a reasonably strong position with respect to purchasing programs from the networks. They have been able to `cherry-pick' from the networks the best programs at relatively cheap prices. As these monopolies are to be broken down under aggregation, the pressure is now on for closer affiliation agreements and, because of the small number of networks, regionals are virtually compelled to line up one for one with networks. Also, because of the emerging economic pressures towards maintaining affiliation agreements, the regionals will be keen not to upset their network partners, and this potentially allows the networks to exert significant influence over the regionals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats recognise that there are economies of scale and viewer benefits to be gained from these networking agreements, and while we do have serious reservations with respect to the aggregation of our regional television markets, we also realise that to dismantle networking agreements at this stage would be most destructive. As a consequence, we do not support the coalition's opposition to the networking clauses in these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats recognise the potential that these agreements provide for the networks to exert control over regionals and are concerned to ensure that this potentiality does not eventuate. As such, I indicate that I will be moving an amendment to this legislation in the committee stages to ensure that the autonomy of the regional stations involved in networking agreements is protected. This Bill will increase the maximum licence renewal period from three years to five years. It also allows the Tribunal to specify a shorter licence period where it is satisfied that the circumstances justify this. Clearly, part of the motivation behind this Government amendment is to reduce some of the workload of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the Government has approached this issue from the wrong direction. The solution to the Tribunal's backlog of work is not simply to remove some of the very important work that the Tribunal does. Instead, the Tribunal needs to be provided with sufficient resources to enable it to undertake all of its tasks successfully. When the areas of inquiry that warranted Tribunal attention were originally identified, the issue of three-year licence renewals was seen as sufficiently important. To my knowledge, nothing has occurred since that time to make three-year licence inquiries any less important. Indeed, I would have said that these have become considerably more important. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened, of course, is that the Tribunal has become snowed under in work which is directly due to underfunding by this Government. To simply turn around and say that the solution to this underfunding is to reduce the issues into which the Tribunal need inquire is clearly unacceptable to us. We believe that this is a highly inappropriate time to be extending licence periods. Licensees are facing financial turmoil, the uncertain affects of aggregation and the new requirements for Australian content. With these conditions prevailing, I believe that more, rather than less, tribunal oversight is required. With the five-year licence, a licensee's service may be inadequate for two years but not attract any Tribunal sanctions because of an improvement in the last two years before renewal. After all, we do not trust our politicians for anywhere near five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The last clause that I wish to discuss is the one that will delete the financial interest test from the existing legislation, which effectively means that loan interests will no longer be considered when determining whether a person holds a prescribed interest in a licence. With two of the networks currently in receivership, it seems reasonable to expect that in fulfilling their fiduciary duties, the banks will now take some interest in programming. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of the existing scheme that must be retained is the requirement for Tribunal notification of any change in a loan interest. In line with this concern, I will be looking at an amendment to this clause in the committee stage. Senator Alston in his remarks referred to the `old days'. Well, some basic things do not change and one of those things is that television licences bring with them power and influence-the power to shape social and cultural opinion. We, as a parliament, have a huge responsibility to scrutinise sufficiently potential candidates for such power and influence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it two Bills, both of which seek to amend the Broadcasting Act. There is, in the opinion of the Australian Democrats, more amendment needed to the Broadcasting Act beyond that which the Government is putting forward in these two Bills. Senator Kernot has outlined our response to the amendments put forward by the Government and further amendments which we will be putting forward. I will outline an area in which we believe the Broadcasting Act is grossly deficient and put forward reasons why we will move further amendments beyond those mentioned by Senator Kernot. Those amendments will be to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) which presents the Parliament-in the first instance the Senate-with a marvellous opportunity to remedy what we see as a major deficiency in the Broadcasting Act and, at the same time, to contribute to the improved health of the Australian community and continue initiatives of this Parliament in its passage of my private member's Bill last December-the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Act Bill which prohibited the advertising of tobacco products in the print media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments which I will introduce relate to the deficiency in the Act which we believe the loophole allowing incidental advertising on broadcast media of tobacco products represents. We wish to close that loophole. Therefore, at the committee stage I will move amendments to stop the high level of advertising coverage which has been obtained on television in particular by tobacco companies which sponsor sporting and, to a lesser degree, cultural events. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware-if they are not, I will make them aware-that the so-called direct advertising of tobacco products was phased out of the Act between September 1973 and September 1976, but that advertising, which was defined as `accidental or incidental' to broadcasting remained permissible. I understand that this innocuous-sounding caveat was an eleventh hour amendment successfully lobbied for by the tobacco industry. That was before the Australian Democrats either existed or had representation in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that few parliamentarians at the time could really have known just how effectively that loophole in the Act would be exploited. Following the passage of that legislation in the 1970s, the tobacco companies set about buying out Australian sport and, by 1980, the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria tells us, the tobacco industry owned every sporting event worth having-high profile televised events such as tennis, cricket, Rugby League, Australian Rules, horse racing, golf, soccer, ballet and opera: the list is almost endless. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, the tobacco industry spent an estimated $20m on sporting sponsorship, of which $12m went to sporting bodies and $8m to promotion, through this loophole in the Act which is before us today for amendment. This is no act of sporting philanthropy on behalf of tobacco companies. It has been a deliberate and highly successful effort to gain access to the broadcast media, access facilitated by the loophole which was retained at the time of the amendment in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of studies have shown just how much television coverage cigarettes have received since the so-called ban in 1976. The Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria estimated that the televising of test cricket over the summer of 1980-81 gave the sponsors Benson and Hedges at least 72 hours of coverage. This included 40,000 exposures of the name Benson and Hedges on a single channel. Things have not improved. A recent report has shown that during one day's play of a Benson and Hedges-sponsored cricket match televised from Sydney in 1988, the television spectator would have seen the Benson and Hedges name or logo clearly for a full 88 minutes of that one day's coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally concerning are the Grand Prix events which feature vehicles predominantly sponsored by tobacco companies. An analysis of television coverage received by Marlboro's Formula One racing car in the Adelaide 1989 Grand Prix show that the Marlboro name gained prominent exposure for up to 36 per cent of broadcasting time. There are other statistics of this nature which have been circulated to all senators and members. I also commend to the attention of all honourable senators a report-a very well documented study-by Donald Martin circulated by the Australian Medical Association. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that the tobacco industry has deliberately sought to circumvent the intention of the Act as it stands. This has been revealed in a number of court cases. An example is the contract between Rothmans' Winfield and the New South Wales Rugby League which was revealed during the Federal High Court case in 1985. A number of clauses in the contract ensured maximum exposure and assistance from the League in gaining high quality exposure, and that exposure was specifically for Winfield cigarettes. Interestingly, there was also an escape clause. The company had the right to terminate the contract if the kinds of advertising and promotion it sought through its sponsorship were restricted or banned by government or any other authority. Not surprisingly, the judges in that case in 1985 agreed that `the sponsorship arrangement was intended as an advertising opportunity rather than an act of sporting philanthropy'. </PARA>
<PARA> The same court case examined the contract struck between Benson and Hedges and the Australian Ballet. In this contract an incredible 75 per cent of sponsorship money was earmarked for advertising and promotional purposes, leaving the remaining 25 per cent of the funds to be used at the recipient's discretion. In another High Court case decided only in February this year, United Telecasters-Channel 10-was convicted for broadcasting a cigarette advertisement in the form of a Winfield spectacular, a dance extravaganza featuring the Winfield name and logo that took place just before the beginning of the 1984 New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final. Yet more evidence was stacked up in that case against Rothmans. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, in the much publicised Mr Fix-it trial, also earlier this year, in which a former Rothmans executive was tried for fraud, in his summing up of the evidence the judge stated, and I think it is worth quoting:</PARA>
<PARA>The company's main concern in all this ... would seem to have been to circumvent the ban placed upon the advertising of tobacco products on television not only by having events assume the company's brand name but also by ensuring that the advertising signs were transmitted on television. No one seems to have questioned the legality of all this, a question which perhaps would now have to be reconsidered in the light of the High Court's decision, the Department of Public Prosecutions v United Telecasters Sydney Limited (which was decided only on 15 February last). </PARA>
<PARA>I could continue to lay before the Senate other examples of a multitude of breaches of the Broadcasting Act, which we are considering today. In short, the legislation-if it is intended, as it says, to ban the advertising of tobacco products-is not working. It has been found before the High Court to have been breached on a number of occasions. It is clearly time for the Parliament to act in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment which I will move at the committee stage seeks simply to remove the so-called incidental advertising provision. Material which is genuinely accidental to broadcast would continue to be permitted. It comes as no surprise to the Democrats that our proposal has met with strong tobacco industry opposition. The tobacco industry's arguments in defence of its actions and position and of continued advertising through sponsorship are fatuous in the extreme. I am reluctant to bring its arguments before the Senate as I do not want to give the industry any particular credibility. But as we will be hearing them in the future, as we have in the past, until, I imagine, it believes the Democrats' resolve has crumbled-which probably will not be until hell freezes over-I suppose I should take the opportunity briefly to refute at least some of the arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> The tobacco companies ask us to believe that their advertising has no effect on children and that it is merely to encourage brand loyalty, or to persuade existing smokers to swap brands. They claim that restriction of their access to electronic media via sports sponsorship is an incursion on their right to free speech. The industry also threatens the demise of sport as we now know it in this country should we amend the Broadcasting Act in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take each of those particular claims in turn. With total smoking prevalence declining in Australia by about one per cent a year bringing about an estimated annual reduction of smokers of about 120,000, for the tobacco industry to remain viable, clearly it must recruit new smokers. We have very good evidence which shows that children are influenced by tobacco sponsorships. The Australian Cancer Society conducted a national survey in 1984 to measure the smoking habits of Australian schoolchildren. In an interview last week on a radio station in another State, when I sought to quote this survey I was accused of quoting surveys from vested interests. In this debate I would much prefer to quote surveys from the Cancer Society whose vested interests, I would suggest, are positive, than to quote surveys from anyone connected with the tobacco industry whose vested interests are material at the very least, and damaging at the very worst. </PARA>
<PARA> This survey was conducted in 1984 to measure the smoking habits of Australian schoolchildren. As well as finding alarmingly high smoking rates among schoolchildren the study also identified different brand preferences in different States. It is interesting to look at them. In New South Wales and Queensland, far more children smoked Winfield where Winfield received high exposure through sponsoring the major winter sport, rugby league. Escort was favoured among South Australian children where it sponsored the Australian Rules Escort Cup. Escort was not one of the leading brands anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, Peter Jackson was the most popular brand, followed by Winfield. Both of these brands are heavily advertised, or were at the time, through the Victorian Football League in a number of forums and, in particular, on television. </PARA>
<PARA> The freedom of speech argument is a favourite of the tobacco industry. In this context, freedom of speech means the freedom to advertise a highly dangerous and addictive product that killed in excess of 18,000 Australians in 1987. Frankly, I believe that a more important freedom is that of children to be free of advertising pressure to adopt smoking. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent media reports of a British study state that over 90 per cent of teenagers who smoke three to four cigarettes a day are trapped into a career of regular smoking which typically lasts for some 30 to 40 years. The report from the Australian Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare on drug problems in Australia, chaired by Senator Peter Baume in 1977; the Better Health Commission, established by Dr Neal Blewett in 1985; and, only last year, the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, have all endorsed the view that there is no place for tobacco advertising in the Australian community. At the end of last year, through the all party support for my private member's Bill, which placed a ban on the print advertising area, we saw that even the Parliament as a whole had finally come to the view that it was time for us to act again federally for the first time since the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> If tobacco advertising has been a blight on the print media, then it is equally a blight on the electronic media in spite of the Act as it stands which nominally places a ban on that advertising. It is naive to regard the forms of advertising as different entities. Tobacco sponsorship is tobacco advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the tobacco industry's threats about the certain decline and fall of Australian sport as we know it in the absence of tobacco sponsorship. I make it very clear that the amendments I will move do not prevent tobacco sponsorship of anything. In Canada, the Canadian Government has simply banned tobacco sponsorship of sporting events. If the tobacco companies wish to respond by withdrawing their funding of certain sporting bodies, I suppose that will show us that the arguments we have put about sponsorship being advertising are very clear, but I do not believe that should hinder the passage of these amendments in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that honourable senators will be aware of the very successful health promotion foundations that have been established in Victoria and South Australia, funded by purpose-built levy mechanisms on wholesale sales of tobacco products and providing considerable support and replacement sponsorship to sport and other health-related activities. </PARA>
<PARA> A mere one per cent of revenue from the Federal excise on tobacco would provide $12.5m, sufficient to replace current tobacco company expenditure on sport sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Federal excise on tobacco products is currently under review. I also believe that submissions are being made to Cabinet at the time that we engage in this debate and I commend those submissions to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, under the terms of the amendments which we will be moving, sporting and other organisations would be free to continue to accept sponsorship from tobacco companies if they wished, subject to legislation enacted at State level. Tobacco companies would be permitted-as they are in the United Kingdom and West Germany-to use their colours, they simply would not be allowed to display trademarks, brand names or logos. As I said, that happens in Europe. In those countries tobacco companies have demonstrated that they are quite able to comply with that level of regulation, and it is the utmost in hypocrisy for them to say in Australia that the livelihood of Australian sport would be threatened. If we allow ourselves to fall for that argument, I suggest that we are succumbing to precisely the blackmail that the tobacco industry always intended, and the tobacco industry will not only have bought sport, but government or the Parliament as well, with the exception of the Australian Democrats who are putting forward these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may be aware that one recent parliamentary report does not recommend the ban of tobacco sponsorships for sport-that is, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its second report on an inquiry into sports funding and administration. This report does not favour a ban on tobacco sponsorship which, as I have already said, is not the purpose of what we are proposing to do with the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The report went on to conclude that a complete ban on the accidental and incidental televising of cigarette products is not realistic on the grounds that it would be an impossible piece of legislation to enforce. I agree with that. That is precisely why in the amendments I am putting forward I am proposing to continue to allow accidental broadcasting of tobacco advertisements. `Accidental' means just that-accidental. If an event is being filmed and somebody wanders past with a Marlboro tee-shirt on, that is not the fault of the organisation involved. It is not my intention to devise troublesome legislation that would be open to vexatious litigation; indeed, I think I have already demonstrated that litigation is exactly what is happening with the legislation as it currently stands. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators of the level and strength of support among the general public for action in this area; indeed, support specifically for the amendments which the Australian Democrats will be moving. As I said, there was all party support for a move in the print media a few months ago. It would be inconsistent in the extreme of both the coalition and the Government to fall away at this stage from a public health move of major significance and to close what is a dramatically damaging loophole in some legislation which is clearly the Federal Government's responsibility. There can be no claims that this is not within the responsibility of the Federal Parliament. Quite clearly it is. The amendments that we propose go forward with the strongest endorsement from medical and health groups, as well as from a range of wider community groups. State governments are increasingly taking what action is open to them within their jurisdiction with, I regret to say, the notable exception of New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague from Queensland expresses some concern that the brave pre-election promises of the Goss Government in this area, as in too many others, seem to be falling by the wayside. It is up to us, as Federal legislators, to meet our responsibility to support the landmark work that has already been passed in Victoria and South Australia, that is in passage in Western Australia and is being proposed in other States, and to push those States that are being laggardly in this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tobacco related illness, death and disease are costing our community dearly. The Democrats will be putting forward a very sensible rationalist move in the committee stage of this legislation. There is no economic and, certainly, no moral argument for not taking this step. I tell the Senate that as I move amongst young people, and I do that as it is of the highest priority when I am not in this place-I visit their schools and talk to them in every other environment in which I can-I find that it is a matter of very great concern to young people that there is such a close link between sport and drugs and even an apparent or accepted dependence of sport on drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> We make a lot of song and dance-indeed there are some people in this chamber and in the other place with whom it seems to be an absolute obsession-about drugs in sport. Tobacco is a drug. I might be corrected, but I think that of the legal drugs, it is the only one of which we could say that there is no safe dose. I do not know about all the illegal drugs, but we could probably say the same thing, based on our present knowledge. Tobacco is certainly a grossly damaging substance. The very fact that it is legal is irrelevant in this debate. As for those people who say, `Why don't you just ban tobacco smoking?', we know that that would not work; we know that all that would create is a black market and quite probably even more peer pressure on young people. We have a responsibility to take the pressure off whoever it is and not allow the promotion of a product which we know costs our community so dearly-over $2 1/2 billion a year at least. </PARA>
<PARA> The health bodies, such as the Australian Medical Association Ltd, the Heart Foundation, the Asthma Association, the anti-cancer councils and a whole range of other groups, are putting their voices so strongly behind this move because they are the ones who have to cope with the damage that is created in our community. Amongst us in the Parliament are people from the medical fraternity who know very well the gross damage which tobacco causes. I make a plea to them, in particular, for leadership within their various parties on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard that the Opposition has set its course against the Democrats' amendments-although there seems to be some uncertainty, as contact with the office of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has given us to understand that there is some uncertainty about its position. I hope that is the case. There is still some time for consideration by both the Opposition and the Government on these amendments. I could not commend anything more strongly to both sides of the chamber. We owe it to our young people and to their future. If we cannot bring ourselves to take this action for them, at least we should take it on the basis that we need not be spending $2 1/2 billion, largely out of the health budget, which we could put better into the other activities by way of government expenditure. I will be moving these amendments to correct what we believe is a gross deficiency in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill, which is before us today for amendment. I commend that action to both sides of the chamber. </PARA>

Both the broadcast and print media prohibitions provided exemption for advertising material which is an accidental or incidental accompaniment of the broadcast or publication of other material, provided that the broadcaster or publisher does not receive any payment for tobacco advertising, with the exemptions that I have talked about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also provided uniform legislation requiring health warnings on cigarette packages, bans on smoking on domestic airline flights and commuter services-for which I am grateful-bans on smoking in buildings occupied by the Australian Public Service, bans on smoking in all Commonwealth-owned buildings, bans on smoking in all federally registered coaches, bans on the importation of manufacture of snuff intended for oral use, commencement of the young women and smoking campaign-two groups were targeted: young women aged 12 to 15 and aged 20 to 24; this campaign presents lifestyle images showing the advantages of being a non-smoker-and bans on domestic sections of international flights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will adopt the position to consult very widely with all affected groups on the imposition of such a ban before the Government supports a proposal. Having said that, I thank all honourable senators for the contributions to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I foreshadow that the Government will move amendments of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. The amendments will be circulated prior to consideration of the Bills in committee. The principal purpose of the amendments will be to ensure that banks and other bona fide lenders are able to land to licensees, without breaching the ownership and control limits in the Broadcasting Act. These measures are consistent with related provisions in the Bill which remove automatic regulation of television loan interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the control provisions in the Act and related provisions in the Bill, lenders could otherwise have been taken to control media companies through standard loan agreements. The ownership and control limits would then have prevented lending to numbers of media clients. The foreign control prohibition in the Act would then also prevent foreign banks from lending to commercial licensees. It would not be appropriate to restrict the media lending activities of banks, simply because of powers of restraint which only protect the legitimate interests of creditors in the protection of their loan funds. The loan exemption will not apply, however, to any lender who controls the programming decisions of a licensee or prevents a licensee from meeting its licence conditions. It will be incumbent on lenders to distance themselves from such programming control. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also proposed to move two minor amendments to the Bill. The first amendment will ensure that the new associate provisions apply to situations of actual, rather than deemed, control of a commercial licence. The second amendment will remedy a technical defect in the transitional provisions associated with the increase in the licence renewal period from three to five years. This will ensure that all existing licences obtain the benefit of the extended licence renewal period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time and time again taxpayers' money is wasted by this Labor Government. Tonight we have a prime example of such waste. As a result of ill-considered sales tax legislation which passed this Senate, we are now considering a Bill to further amend that legislation because of the unintended consequences. Of course, I am referring to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which will amend Sales Tax Acts (Nos 1 to 9), which received royal assent on 16 June, only four months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Sales Tax Acts (Nos 1 to 9) increase from 30 to 50 per cent the rate of sales tax payable on motor cars and station sedans, including four-wheel drive vehicles, with a wholesale value exceeding $28,793. The anticipated revenue- I emphasise `anticipated revenue'-from this gain was in excess of $100m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> These nine Acts were flawed from the day that they were announced. They were announced in a manner familiar to the Treasurer, Mr Keating, that is, legislation by press release, which, as a matter of principle to all democrats, is wrong. Furthermore, it was the retrospective nature of the legislation which was reconsidered once these Bills reached the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The application date for the new sales tax was altered from 1 April to 1 May, causing copious complications and chaos for car salesmen, as well as for purchasers. In fact, their fate is now changed by the introduction of Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). Luxury car sales surged during the period from Mr Keating's tax increase announcement in February-an election gimmick-until its implementation in May. Sales during this period pulled forward an estimated $54m in duty and sales tax. A threat of an increased sales tax was the impetus that many buyers actually needed to get into that new luxury car sooner rather than later, and as a consequence pay 20 percentage points less tax. </PARA>
<PARA> When sales tax Acts were being debated in the Senate in May, the coalition said that it did not believe that the increase in luxury car sales tax would raise anywhere near the amount of money claimed by this Government at the time. We also argued that it would have a negative impact on employment and business viability. The fact that the Government is now introducing amending legislation to these Acts vindicates the arguments which were put forward at the time by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) will amend the Sales Tax Acts (Nos 1 to 9) in accordance with the changes announced in the Budget. The overall effect of the Bill is to reduce the rate of tax applicable to lower priced luxury motor vehicles by applying a progressively increasing rate, commencing at 30 per cent. The amended tax system commences at 30 per cent for vehicles priced at $30,234 and increases up to a maximum of 50 per cent for vehicles with a wholesale price equal to or greater than $54,419. This will mean that the higher priced luxury vehicles will remain subject to the existing 50 per cent rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the luxury car tax, as admitted to by the Government, was to encourage wholesalers to adopt a number of undesirable practices which artificially reduced the wholesale prices below the threshold level, in some cases by removing safety options from the vehicles. For example, advanced safety features, such as anti-skid brakes, were removed in some cases. While this may have saved the purchaser a substantial amount in sales tax in the short run, they could well find themselves paying a higher price in the long run. What price do we put on a life?</PARA>
<PARA> Many within the car industry have referred to the increased sales tax as a tax on safety, not only because it has led to the practice of removing safety options from vehicles to bring the price down, but also because it prevents the safety items filtering down to the less expensive models as they would push the price of those cars over the threshold and thereby make them uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also cites as reason for the amendment the plight of primary producers living in remote parts of Australia where the terrain necessitates the use of a four-wheel drive vehicle, the price of such vehicles placing them in the luxury category. I remember that my colleague Senator Panizza, from Western Australia, drew the Government's attention to the absolute necessity for four-wheel drive vehicles to have air-conditioning in remote parts of Western Australia. My colleague Bruce Lloyd also pointed out in the House of Representatives that it is bad enough that the farmers cannot obtain an ordinary sales tax exemption for four-wheel drive vehicles with a back seat. It is going over the top to classify these farm workhorses as luxury vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is not admitting to in making these amendments is the fact that the increase in luxury car sales tax has resulted in a negative impact on tax revenue. In fact, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, when announcing the hike in luxury car sales tax from 30 to 50 per cent, said that he expected the measure to raise an extra $100m dollars a year. This would increase the total revenue raised from this source from $450m to $550m per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Car company figures showed that the Government was unlikely to even maintain its previous revenue base, falling short of the $550m figure by as much as $260m, or almost 50 per cent. When the Government was doing its sums on this sales tax increase, it did not realise that the high interest rates had caused a slowdown in demand for luxury cars. From the information available to the Government, it should have known that annual average sales from September 1989 to February 1990 were just 10,900 units. If this level was maintained for a full year it would have cut the Government's sales tax and duty revenue on these cars by $130m in 1989-90, even without the tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA> For Mr Keating to get his bloated figure-perhaps we should say `boasted' figure-for an additional $100m in sales tax revenue, Australians would have to be buying almost 13,600 luxury cars a year. The absolute maximum likely to be sold over the next 12 months is only 8,000 units. So, the luxury car market is driven by price. The more expensive the cars become, the more the consumer finds alternative ways of spending money. The warning signs were there. The Government just failed to heed them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also failed to mention the impact that the increased sales tax has had on the sales of Australia's two home-grown vehicles which fell into the luxury car category: Ford's LTD and General Motors-Holden Ltd's Caprice. At the 50 per cent tax level, a Ford LTD retails at $58,490, $16,335 of which is paid to the Federal Government in sales tax. Holden's Caprice has a price tag of $61,860, including $17,276 worth of sales tax. In both these instances, the amount of sales tax paid represents 28 per cent of the price tag. </PARA>
<PARA> Catching these two Australian-made cars in the higher tax net and jeopardising their sales prospects was described by Mike Kable of the Australian as `nothing short of absurd'-and we agree with that-`given the Government's commitment to the Buy Australia campaign'. The changes which will be implemented as a result of this amending legislation will particularly benefit those vehicles in the lower end of the luxury car market. LTD and Caprice both fall into this bracket and will now sell for $5,554 and $4,966 less respectively than under the 50 per cent tax regime. While this will make Ford and Holden happier, it has certainly not impressed the luxury car importers whose vehicles fall into the upper end of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to delve into what role the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries played in having the sales tax altered or the matter of export credits, other than to make a general observation to the effect that the Button car plan has not been adhered to. It will be very interesting to see what the current Industry Commission's inquiry into the automotive industry recommends. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating's estimation of the cost to revenue of phasing in this new progressive rate of luxury car sales tax is $8m in 1990-91 and $10m in a full year. I presume that these amounts are to be deducted from the $550m which Mr Keating's 50 per cent tax was expected to earn. My guess is that, given present sale volumes, this tax change will add between $8m and $10m to the $280m which the car industry expects the Government will earn in view of the current sales volumes. Thus, the overall impact will be a negative revenue return and poor work on the part of the Federal Treasurer. Such a mess indicates the urgent need to review sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> When the matter of a luxury car tax was being debated in May, I said that the sales tax needed a complete revision because of its arbitrary classifications, its ad hoc composition and the difficulties of finding a proper wholesale value in an age when wholesale merchants are so few in number compared with, say, 20 years ago. We note from the Budget Papers that the Government is undertaking a review aimed at simplifying the wholesale sales tax system. This review is, as other senators would appreciate, a direct response to pressure by the coalition for a broad-based consumption tax to replace wholesale taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some of the aspects that the Government is reviewing-for example, classifications and sale value-we see that the possibility is there for the Government to introduce a turnover tax by the back door. Perhaps this would be the back door response of the Government to the coalition's suggested need for a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the Australian Taxation Office is making good progress. It has 18 months in which to complete that review and I commend it for the professional way in which it is going about that simplification. I only hope that there is the same commitment to simplification of income tax. Although the Government has promised in the Budget to deliver a Green Paper on the simplification of income tax-the good honourable Senator McMullan said that it would be out by the end of September-it is now October and we have had no word. There is no enthusiasm for simplification despite the fact that it was suggested in 1985. In other words, other matters took greater priority. Simplification was a No. 1 priority in 1985 but look at what has happened to income tax in the intervening time. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the need for simplification cannot be greater than at the present time. Yet for some reason the Government is taking its time. It is taking much too long, and people-professionals and ordinary men and women-are crying out about the need to simplify income tax because we cannot have a proper system of self-assessment until there is certainty before the law. I commend the sales tax section of the Australian Taxation Office on the speed at which it is moving to simplify the sales tax law. I call for that same sort of commitment in income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the review of sales tax takes place, it is likely that we will be faced with similar situations to the one we presently find ourselves in-that is, debating amendment Bills on amendment Bills. Let us just be grateful that we are not the ones out in the marketplace trying to run a business and cope with these taxation alterations which have been as changeable as Melbourne's weather. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just give some brief information about another likely change. The Income Tax Amendment Bill, which will debated later on tonight, has some thin capitalisation rules. But before it hits this place we have been promised that by December there will be changes to the thin capitalisation rules. This is how absurd the situation is with amendment on amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1990 and schedule 2 of Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990. The purpose of these Bills is to overcome what the Tax Office considers an anomaly in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. Under the present arrangements, printed matter which is inserted into a tax exempt publication, such as a newspaper, has also been exempt from the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. If this same article had been distributed separately, the 20 per cent sales tax would have been applied. </PARA>
<PARA> So the sales tax treatment of news supplements and inserts has been a contentious issue for many years with the Australian Taxation Office seeking to tax such material as advertising matter. Many taxpayers have been challenging this approach. In general, the courts have agreed with the taxpayers. The courts held that the inserts and the supplements are exempt from sales tax on the ground that they were merely part of the newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax Amendment Bill and schedule 2 of the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill amend items 51 and 54 of the Sales Tax Act 1935. The amendment provides that the following will not be included in exemptions provided under items 51 and 54 where the following conditions exist: the material is printed on a different sheet size from the rest of the publication; the material is printed by a different process from the rest of the publication; the material is printed on different paper; the material is inserted into the exempt product after the latter has been made; and the exempt publication is a magazine in which the insert is detachable or the publication is a newspaper in which the insert is not related to news, sport, entertainment, travel, leisure or similar sections. I believe that, even with this legislation, the ingenuity of the newspaper proprietors will probably get around even this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are expected to raise $20m in additional revenue in 1990-91 because inserts are a popular way of advertising. It is supposed to be the `in thing' nowadays. The coalition does not object to these amendments and, thus, will not be moving any further amendments when the Bill reaches the committee stage. In this instance, however, I wish to add that I trust that the Government has done its homework correctly on the impact of this tax alteration and that we do not find ourselves back here next session or even before amending the amendment, as we have with the luxury car sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Just before the dinner break, the Australian Democrats gave us a few moments notice of their intention to proceed with a series of amendments. All these amendments have particular personal appeal and they also appeal to particular interest groups because they provide benefits in relation to the recycling of certain products and they provide relief, for example, to the disabled, which is very attractive. The problem that worries me is that they provide opportunities for an upper House virtually to take over a legislative program on issues which would not otherwise be before the House as a result of the contents or scope of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we have to act with a degree of responsibility, as an upper House with certain limited financial powers, in opting for knee-jerk type reactions no matter how desirable an amendment might be. After all, it can affect the Government's Budget integrity and Budget strategy, certainly if taken too far.On the other hand, it might well be said that it is a minimal cost to the Government but I do not think it is up to an upper House to pick and choose what it believes to be politically attractive taxation measures and to provide exemptions or benefits to certain categories, particularly when the items chosen are not normally within the scope of particular legislation. Therefore, I believe we on this side of the Senate will have difficulty under those circumstances unless we can be persuaded during the debate to change our minds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not the uplift factor. Senator Watson received a sheet of paper listing all nine Democratic amendments to all the taxation Bills which are now coming before the Senate. I must say that I was somewhat disappointed that the Opposition parties did not find time to give due consideration to the amendments that we are proposing and I trust that during this debate I will be able to convince Senator Watson sufficiently for him to take the message to his colleagues so that they in turn may approve what I believe to be quite important amendments in a number of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These amendments are in the area of sustainable development, the matter we have heard so much about this afternoon. Here is a practical opportunity for both parties, Government as well as Opposition, actually to put their actions where their mouths were this afternoon. I refer to the proposition to make tax exempt products that are manufactured out of 100 per cent recycled plastic material. I also refer to another amendment which proposes to exempt from sales tax that part of a product which is constituted by 100 per cent recycled paper. That is one omission in the legislation that previously exempted recycled paper. It is an omission that I believe should be corrected, and the Democrats are offering that opportunity to both the other parties to consider that what we are here for is to put into effect what we are talking about and that is the sustainable economy. We should not keep putting it off. The Government has indicated to me that, while not entirely opposed to the propositions that the Democrats are putting forward, it is not ready at this stage to consider those propositions. I regret that. How long do senators have to wait to pass a simple amendment that deals with urgent matters such as this when we are paying lip service to developing a sustainable economy?</PARA>
<PARA> I should return to the substance of the Bills before I deal in more detail at a later stage with our proposed amendments but the Senate must agree that I was provoked by Senator Watson, unlikely as that may seem. Today the Senate is debating two Bills: the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1990 and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. The Bills seek to enact two sales tax measures announced in the Budget. These measures are, firstly, to phase in the 50 per cent luxury car sales tax by introducing an alternative method of calculation to apply in a certain price range only; and, secondly, to ensure that printed matters inserted into tax exempt printed matter, for instance, in newspapers, are taxable as if they were distributed separately. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently these inserts are generally taxed at 20 per cent if distributed separately, for instance, as junk mail. However, a recent court decision has exempted from sales tax inserts placed inside exempt printed matter, for example, newspapers. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) also seeks to define what an insert is, and that raises some concern. It appears that some publishers may be able to defeat the tax by simply ensuring that the item is not a separate insert, for instance, if the insert is physically attached to the publication by perforation, stapling, gluing, sewing, et cetera. Whether or not such an exemption could be practically exploited is open to some doubt. I simply mention it to draw the Minister's attention to it and suggest to him that this is a matter that the Government should pay some attention to. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect is the phasing in of the tax on luxury motor vehicles. Currently there are two rates for taxing luxury motor vehicles: a 20 per cent rate and a 50 per cent rate. Because there is such a big difference in the tax payable, many dealers and possibly manufacturers seek to qualify for the lower rate by taking out the optional extra components from the car and there are fears that this may spread to safety equipment as well as items that we would normally consider to be standard equipment, such as stereos, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the Government is proposing to lessen the severe impact of the 50 per cent rate by allowing a lower rate to apply to vehicles with a wholesale cost in excess of $30,233 but less than $54,419. Above that level, the current 50 per cent rate will continue to apply. The effect will be to reduce the cost of so-called lower priced luxury motor vehicles by taxing those vehicles at 30 per cent plus 75 per cent of the excess of the vehicle's price over the $30,233 threshold. This will lessen, on a per vehicle basis, the Government's tax take somewhat. For example, for a car which sold for $53,318, $1,000 below the higher limit, formerly the tax would have been, in round figures, $26,650. In round figures again, the new tax will be approximately $26,400. So there is a slight drop in the tax take. </PARA>
<PARA> However, basically we accept the argument that there will be a better compliance ratio in collecting this tax. While we intend to monitor results, the Australian Democrats do not propose to oppose this measure or amend it. Therefore, both Bills will be supported by the us; however, not without amendments that have been foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first instance we will move an amendment to seek an exemption from sales tax for products made of 100 per cent recycled plastic, as well as that part of a product that is constituted by 100 per cent recycled plastic. For example, if the door trim of a car is made of recycled plastic, its price will be deducted from the total price of the car and no sales tax will be charged on it. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of the products that are currently reaching the market in a somewhat halting flow-because they are competing against other products some of which, like timber, are not subject to the 20 per cent sales tax-is Syntal, which is manufactured by Smorgon Consolidated Industries and is still subject to the 20 per cent sales tax. I understand there has been continuing contact between Smorgon and the Government on these matters-and, I believe, with other manufacturers as well. I have before me some correspondence from Smorgon Consolidated Industries addressed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Ros Kelly. That correspondence states:</PARA>
<PARA>Smorgon Consolidated Industries believe that the recent discussions between industry and government indicated the urgent need for national strategies on waste minimisation and recycling--</PARA>
<PARA>It also makes suggestions as to which measures should be taken, apart from the exemption from sales tax of the actual products. It suggests that all equipment that is imported for the purpose of recycling plastic waste should be exempt from duty and any other taxes, and further that capital expenditure on plastic recycling equipment be subject to accelerated depreciation for taxation purposes. Finally, it suggests that research and development grants be substantially increased in respect of the Australian development of new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> We support all of these suggestions, and the Minister might be pleased that, at this stage, we have not fashioned them into amendments. But we will, unless the Government means what it says about sustainable development and beats us to the punch-I wish it would-and introduces some of these measures which are so badly needed. Alas, at the moment, that is not to be. </PARA>
<PARA> A little further on, that letter from Smorgon Industries states:</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot understand government policy in regard to the imposition of sales tax when on one hand, government supports recycling initiatives, yet on the other hand there is a penalty for those consumers who want to support recycling by``closing the loop'' through purchasing products made from recycled materials. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust that these arguments will find their target with Senator Watson and his colleagues, because he stated earlier that he is still open to persuasion and I am doing my darnedest. I trust he will appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have another letter, from Hardeman and Rolls Packaging, a firm in Melbourne which specialises in producing plastic shopping bags from recycled plastic material. We all know how many plastic bags we are inundated with-sometimes they are of practical use-in department stores. Clearly, if some firm takes the initiative and innovatively produces plastic bags from recycled plastic, that firm should have the support of the Australian Parliament, which says that we must support not only innovation but also home-grown industries-once again, let me use the words-to build up a sustainable economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to my second amendment, which refers to recycled paper. I have briefly mentioned it before. The amendment seeks to enact a new sub-item (1a) to item 60 in the First Schedule, which will exempt from tax that part of the value of the finished goods which relates to the value of the recycled paper which is part of those finished goods. That simply is closing an omission in the initial legislation, which exempted 100 per cent recycled paper from the sales tax. Currently, it applies only when an item is simply that-totally recycled paper. When dealing with a book which includes added value, such as printing and bookbinding, the item is not currently exempt from sales tax. Clearly, the occasions on which an item is purely composed of 100 per cent recycled paper are rare. To be realistic in our commercial world we must attempt to ensure that this legislation is, in fact, effective and meets the objectives that it sets out to fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I will not again run through the arguments as to why that is necessary. It should be obvious to everyone. We have had a debate this afternoon on why it is necessary, but in our view it is totally reprehensible, destructive and, in fact, idiotic to cut down National Estate forests so that we can make paper. Of course, we do not make most of the paper; we cut up the trees into chips, ship them to Japan and then import the finished product. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a group of other amendments which will be moved by the Democrats. They concern mainly aids for disabled people. To a large extent they are based on recommendations made by the report of the Industry Commission on aids for disabled people which was delivered in July this year. To some extent I believe the Minister might well take that fact as an excuse-but I think it is a very threadbare one-for saying the Government must continue to consider that report before it can decide whether or not the amendments that we propose are acceptable to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how long the Minister has been in the Senate and whether or not he is aware of the speeches made by Senator Macklin in 1989, by Senator Macklin and Senator Janine Haines in 1988 and by them and other Democrat senators in previous years seeking exemption from sales tax for equipment that is used by disabled people-deaf people, blind people and otherwise handicapped people-who need these aids to enable them to lead as normal lives as they possibly can. All of these appeals in one form or another and, in substance, the amendments that we have sought are very similar indeed, yet those pleas have fallen on deaf ears. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if these matters would result in a large loss to the Government's tax revenue. In fact, these measures involve single million dollar figures. I remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) of the fact-and would appeal to Senator Watson and his colleagues-that a nation is judged by the way in which it treats its most disadvantaged citizens. It is a well known principle ascribed generally to Mr John Rolls as the Rollsian principle of social justice, but I would have thought that the principle is so obvious that it does not need an academic reference. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now briefly to describe the three amendments that we intend to move. The first is to extend the exemption from sales tax to vehicles used by disabled people-for those disabled people who do not use a vehicle simply to go to and from work but who also need a car to enable them to be generally mobile. We believe that it is a question of mobility, not a question of employment for disabled people. Currently the exemption that applies benefits 750 people-that is all-at a cost of $2.3m. If we extend the provision to disabled people who can afford to buy a car-and I assure the Minister that there will not be hundreds and thousands of them-so that they can visit relatives, attend adult education classes, and go to places of entertainment, sporting fixtures and so on, I can assure him that it will not affect revenue by much more than $2m or $3m. Yet I understand that the Government intends to say no to this amendment. How do members of the Government reconcile that with their consciences? I wonder whether Opposition members will step into the breach to teach the Government a lesson. </PARA>

The next item refers to a matter that has been suggested by the Industry Commission in the wording of the general provision exempting aids and other goods which are used by disabled people. In line with that recommendation, the amendment seeks to modify the current test whereby exemption from sales tax is granted only on goods which are not ordinarily used by people who are not disabled, diseased or ill. It would turn it into a positive formulation so that the exemption would apply to goods which are predominantly used by people who are disabled, diseased or ill. That recommendation is contained in an Industry Commission report of July 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, the third amendment concerns section 123a of the first schedule of the exemptions and classifications Act, which deals with aids that assist deaf people to communicate. Some existing examples are interactive and broadcast videotex systems and broadcast teletext decoding devices. The Industry Commission has recommended adding computer equipment used as, or in conjunction with, electronic communications equipment to the list of exemptions under the provision. </PARA>
<PARA> All three items are concerned with an attempt to ensure that our most disadvantaged disabled people in the community are allowed to live as normal a life as we can make possible.

It is not as if the Treasurer (Mr Keating) can say, `This will cost $100m or $500m and will demolish my surplus' or anything of the kind. It is a mere pittance and it should be one of our priorities to put the matter right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are tonight debating the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. The legislation seeks to alter the sales tax on certain classes of vehicle and certain types of printed material. However, I wish to confine my brief remarks to the legislation as it affects vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill comes to us barely six months after we in this place debated the provisions as they related to vehicles, and indeed on the previous occasion when the matter was before us we spent many hours on this matter. The Opposition then told the Government what the effect of the legislation would be, and we are already discussing amending provisions. I remember at the time terming the legislation the `jealousy tax' Bill, and I think that that name still holds good. </PARA>
<PARA> The original legislation was a reaction by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the high number of accidents that had occurred in this country, mainly on the eastern seaboard. A number of semitrailers and passenger buses had crashed, and this legislation was probably introduced by the Prime Minister in recognition of the fact that the neglect of the roads by his Government over a period of some six years, added to the neglect of the New South Wales roads by that State's Labor Government, had finally come to fruition. Over the weekend I made a personal inspection of a number of New South Wales roads and my visit bore out what I have always felt, namely, that those roads are unsafe. The legislation sought to raise $100m and an extra $100m was to go back into road funding. However, that is certainly not enough to fix the problem which was in existence six months ago, and following the floods in New South Wales and Queensland such a sum would not be enough to fix the problems in those States.</PARA>
<PARA> There are other ways in which to bring down accident figures, especially accidents involving heavier vehicles. I believe that alternative ways were not addressed by the Government. Mr Acting Deputy President, I promise that I will return to the Bill in a moment. I refer to action being taken in respect of driver fatigue, speed, lack of control, drivers' habits and so on. I believe in uniform laws throughout Australia when one is dealing with the heavy vehicles that are on our roads. I believe that heavy vehicles and buses should be governed by the same licensing and driving laws. I would even favour an alcohol limit involving no detectable alcohol in the case of drivers of buses and heavy vehicles. The area involving the driving of private cars could then be left to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Prime Minister did say that the measure would raise an extra $100m, I thought at the time it was another jealousy tax and a measure aimed at picking up some extra votes. Senator McMullan may tell us in his reply just how much extra in revenue the last piece of legislation brought in. I understand that the Bill created a certain reaction and that fewer of the vehicles in question were purchased. Certainly manufacturers carried out measures to get the figure below the threshold. I thought that, because bringing in the present Bill so soon after the previous measure can be seen as a back-down in face of the arguments we have advanced, there would have been a costing of the whole exercise so that we would have some idea as to the funds that may be raised by the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I heard Senator McMullan on the national media calling for many amendments to taxation measures. Last weekend or the week before he said that it costs 11 times more in Australia to file or substantiate tax returns than it costs in our trading partner countries. I look forward to seeing some of the amendments that may come through. This measure changes the sales tax level on the wholesale price of a vehicle costing over $30,234 by applying 75 per cent to the amount over that figure. When the value of $54,419 is reached, the overall tax reverts to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last debate, about six months ago, I spoke of four-wheel drive vehicles used in remote areas. These vehicles are subject to this measure. I have never believed that a four-wheel drive in a remote area is a luxury. Rather, it is a necessity. That point has been borne out by the fact-I do not know how long this has applied-that members of parliament from the electorates of Kalgoorlie, Maranoa, Kennedy and Grey are issued with four-wheel drive vehicles as their parliamentary cars at a cost of $6,000 per annum, whereas some people in State parliaments get these vehicles for about $400 or $600 a year. Members of parliament are allowed to purchase these vehicles because they are obviously necessary for them to do their work in their electorates. They need four-wheel drives because of the state of the roads, some of which are not sealed, so I certainly agree that they should be given four-wheel drives to use in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I believe that the people who live in those areas and, of necessity, have to buy four-wheel drives should be given the same consideration. Under this Bill, a four-wheel drive costing over $30,000 certainly fits the bill when it is a goods carrier. In other words, a goods carrying vehicle is not subject to sales tax. This Bill does help those people who purchase a vehicle in the $30,000 to $35,000 bracket. Unfortunately, a vehicle used in remote areas also has to double up as a passenger vehicle. It is all very well for a work vehicle such as a Toyota Land Cruiser tray top to double up as a passenger vehicle, but it is impossible for it to carry more than two people. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, very few four-wheel drives cost around $30,000. People have to go to much higher priced vehicles to fit the bill. Then, of course, one pays much more; a Toyota Land Cruiser station sedan type vehicle costs near $50,000 and the Range Rover costs much more. These vehicles can be used in remote areas as well as doubling up as passenger vehicles to take the family into town or carry men to work. But these vehicles are still carrying the burdens of a sales tax and a luxury tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Can honourable senators tell me what is luxurious about a Land Cruiser station sedan that carries seven or eight people? I suppose they are considered luxury vehicles because there has been a propensity for the more affluent to buy them. These vehicles are used as RVs-if I can use an American term I picked up which means `recreation vehicle'-to run around on weekends even though they are used on bitumen roads. But the sales tax is applied to those vehicles that are used in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see why those two categories of use should be treated identically, especially when one vehicle is used for recreation and the other as a necessity. I know that certain imported four-wheel drives cost around the threshold mark. These are generally utilities which cannot carry too many passengers. Just below the Toyota Land Cruiser is the Toyota Hi-Lux dual cab which can carry a driver and four passengers. Of course, that vehicle attracts sales tax as well as this extra tax, as has been pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government has a lot of thinking to do on this. People who use four-wheel drives in remote areas of necessity should not be treated the same as those who use their vehicles elsewhere. The Government picked this up too hastily because of the serious accidents on the roads. The immediate reaction was, `How can we fix it? We need more money to be spent on roads. We'll try out a luxury vehicle tax'. I am afraid it has thrown things out of kilter. </PARA>
<PARA> Levies on road fuel have been continually rising. They are now rising at a far greater rate because of the Gulf crisis. The Government is having quite a windfall. I have called for the Government to pass on to the motorists some of the windfall that it receives now that the price is above the Budget forecast of $US23 a barrel. If it does not want to pass any back to the consumer, it should at least provide extra road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I quickly take up a point made by Senator Spindler who argued that there should be no sales tax on fully recycled plastic. That is the trouble with vehicles these days-there is too much plastic in them. This is unsafe. When these vehicles are involved in accidents they seem to fold up. I suppose I could support his argument because recapped tyres-correct me if I am wrong-do not carry sales tax. I do not know whether I have missed any changes on that. But I believe that that sort of thing is nitpicking. We have a total overall problem. If the Government wants to spend more money on roads, it should get it from the money it is already raising. </PARA>
<PARA> From seeing this Bill and other Bills I believe that the Government is using a piecemeal approach in order to get money for roads or to do something like that. It is time that the Government looked totally at the sales tax system. We on this side of politics have an agenda for that the next time around, and I believe it is time that the whole sales tax system disappeared as it has been getting worse and worse and more and more out of kilter. I think the way to go is the goods and services tax, by which everything will be treated the same right across the board, so that we will not be here every six months passing a new piece of legislation to pothole this and to pothole that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill are a damning indictment of this Government's indirect tax system, of its car industry policy, and of its attempt to rouse the politics of envy in support of a discriminatory and completely unjustified tax. Despite strong opposition from the coalition, legislation was passed in May of this year to give effect to the March Federal election campaign announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that he would increase the rate of sales tax on what he called luxury cars-that is, those with a then wholesale value of more than $30,234 representing a retail price of more than $42,910, now adjusted with inflation to $45,056-from an already discriminatory 30 per cent to a massive 50 per cent. Let us not forget that cars below that value are taxed at only 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from the complete absence of any economic rationale or any other justification for these changes, this Government through that legislation also increased the complexity of our tax system which, contrary to needing increased complexity, in fact needs drastic simplification. Barely three months later, the Treasurer, on Budget night, announced further changes which increased this unwanted complexity. Tonight's legislation in part, as well as dealing with other matters, gives effect to those changes. The changes mean that instead of a 50 per cent sales tax applying to the whole price of vehicles with a retail value above $45,056, cars above that value will be taxed at 30 per cent on the first $45,056 and then 75 per cent on every dollar above $45,056 up to $97,429. Cars above $97,429 will be taxed under the same provisions as introduced in May; that is, at the rate of 50 per cent on the total value. If that sounds confusing, it is. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke on the original legislation in May, apart from condemning its arbitrary nature, I said that the Government had to be able to answer three questions in the affirmative to justify this increased tax. Those questions were: Firstly, was an increase in an already discriminatory tax justified? Secondly, was it consistent with the Button car plan? Thirdly, were the revenue assumptions of the Treasurer correct? The clear answer to each of those questions was no. </PARA>
<PARA> So the legislation had absolutely no justification. All the consequences of that legislation have confirmed that the negative answers to those three questions were fully justified. But instead of cancelling it, this out of touch Hawke Australian Labor Party Government has introduced the legislation which we are debating tonight which compounds the problems rather than corrects them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's revenue assumptions have been clearly proved wrong. I predicted this would be the case when I spoke in this chamber in May and that prediction has been proven correct. The Government's objective of incremental revenue is not based on the realities of the marketplace. It has based its calculations on the selling rates of these vehicles for the 1988-89 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> To give a single example: in the first half of 1989, one vehicle importer was selling on average 272 units per month of vehicles priced above the threshold. In June and July of this year the running rate was 43 vehicles per month; a massive collapse, and of course all of those were still selling at the lower price, because their wholesale sales tax had been paid before the legislation came into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that the net effect of the change it is introducing through this legislation tonight will be a loss of only some $8m in revenue off its previous target of an additional $100m, but that $100m has already been proven unattainable. In the financial year 1988-89, which was the basis used for the targeted increase, the annual selling rate of imported vehicles above the threshold price was 15,400 units, which resulted in a total estimated government revenue of $446.6m. However, what the Government did not take into account was the effect of the downturn that hit this market segment from September 1989. The annualised running rate in the period September 1989 to February 1990 was 10,950 units on vehicles above the threshold price. This equates to a total annual government revenue of some $317.6m on the 30 per cent tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> In June and July of 1990 the annualised running rate was some 6,050 units and that would provide only $242m in government revenue based on the 50 per cent tax base. However, it is unlikely that many would have been sold at the new tax levels. Most would have been pre-sold in the period prior to the increase in the sales tax rate at the old rate of 30 per cent. On this basis, the revenue could be as low as $175.5m on an annualised basis. I seek leave, and I have already spoken to Senator McMullan, to have incorporated in Hansard two graphs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first graph shows the annualised registration rates of imported vehicles subject to this discriminatory tax. The second graph shows annualised government revenue based on the payment of a 50 per cent tax as from May on that imported vehicle market segment. Reference to the graphs clearly confirms my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first clearly shows what has happened to the imported car market with regard to this segment in recent times. In March 1989, it was predicted that the market would be slow due to the Government's high interest rate policy, and as can be seen from that graph that prediction in fact came true. The graph also shows the enormous disruption caused to the market earlier this year as a result of the introduction of the 50 per cent tax, and the pull forward effect in terms of sales of vehicles because of the commencement of that tax some time after its introduction was announced. As can be seen, the projection of the balance of this year is optimistic, if anything, as the market is actually developing compared with the prediction in this graph. </PARA>
<PARA> The second graph translates these sales into projected government revenue including both import duty and sales tax. It compares the average level of estimated government revenue of $450m in the 1988-89 financial year with the 1990-91 target of about $550m, and also with the actual result which is likely to be achieved. The graph also shows the pull forward effect of the commencement of the 50 per cent tax some time after its announcement, and it has been estimated that that pull forward effect was approximately $54m in revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the predictions of this graph have thus far been fulfilled and that, as I have said, the graphs are probably optimistic in terms of the likely sales of cars and the consequential revenue that will be gained, the Government continues to ignore the fact that it has killed this segment of the market through excessive taxation. That in itself is a disturbing development. As can be seen, currently the annualised rate is a little more than 5,000 vehicles and that, it is expected, will continue for the foreseeable future. At best, it is expected that the annualised rate will not recover to much more than 8,500 vehicles whose price is over the tax threshold. That will realise revenue of some $340m based on a 50 per cent sales tax rate on all vehicles over the threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has claimed, in introducing this legislation, that it will lose only $8m in revenue. One presumes that is off its original estimate of $546.6m. With that relatively minor adjustment in tax, the incremental volume effect is likely to offset the lost tax due to the reduction. That leaves the Government with an annualised revenue of $340m from these cars-well below its new target of $538.6m. So much for the promised source of $100m of extra revenue that was to be devoted to improving Australia's roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Current projections indicate that annual revenue from these cars will be at least $150m below the level required by the Government for this tax year. The Treasurer, in his Budget press release, stated that the additional revenue from the higher tax will still provide increased road funding. But when one clearly examines the actual market information, it soon becomes evident that without a price reduction of over 80 per cent in this sector of the car market, there will in fact be no revenue generated and the $100m which was promised for extra road funding is a pie in the sky promise. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Treasurer thinks that the new policy will be only a small cost to revenue of $8m in 1990-91, as he claimed in his Budget press release, and thereby implies that $92m rather than $100m additional revenue will be obtained, it simply reinforces the point that this Government has ignored the fact that over $150m has already been lost in the 1990-91 tax year in terms of revenue against the Government's original estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that the Treasurer in particular and the Government in general simply do not understand that this discriminatory, iniquitous 50 per cent car tax has totally crippled this segment of the car market and that without sales tax and duty the revenue cannot be forthcoming. That sales tax and duty have simply been forgone as a result of the combination of this iniquitous tax impost and the impact of high interest rates on the car market. </PARA>
<PARA> An assessment of the market for cars between the retail value of $45,057 and $97,429 clearly demonstrates also the protectionist nature of the changes we are debating. It simply reinforces the point I made in May that this car tax is directly contrary to the intent of the Button car plan. In general terms, this segment of the car market is highly polarised, with the locally produced Ford LTD and Holden Caprice accounting for the bulk of sales at the lower end of the price bracket under $65,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The major beneficiaries of the revised tax structure which this legislation introduces are the vehicles priced in the $50,000 to $65,000 price segment. However, this represents only 18.7 per cent of the market segment over the threshold and 10.8 per cent of that, which is more than half, are those two locally produced vehicles. These locally manufactured vehicles will benefit from a price reduction of between 8 and 12 per cent under the changes brought about by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of the market, which is those cars priced between $65,000 and $95,000, which represent more than 80 per cent of the market between the $45,000 threshold and $95,000, will benefit, at most, by a price reduction of less than 6 per cent. Indeed, two-thirds of that group will benefit by a price reduction of no more than 3.6 per cent. Needless to say, all vehicles in the more than $65,000 price category are imported vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The massive price increases imposed on these vehicles by the increase in sales tax to a discriminatory 50 per cent in May therefore, to all and intents and purposes, will remain. On the other hand, the amendments introduced by this legislation mean that the Australian manufactured vehicles previously also caught by this rapacious tax impost will now be affected only to the tune of 2 to 3 1/2 per cent compared with their pre-May prices. So, in practical terms, the new policy alleviates pricing pressure on the locally built Holden Caprice and Ford LTD, almost returning them to their previous 30 per cent sales tax levels. </PARA>
<PARA> But for the majority of vehicles over the tax threshold, the retail price reduction will be minimal or nil. In effect, through these changes the Treasurer has, yet again, raised the protection levels of locally built cars, even more than the original tax increases did in May. How dare this failed Treasurer criticise Senator Button for dragging the chain in reducing protection when he is introducing this blatantly protectionist measure?</PARA>
<PARA> To quantify this, the theoretical retail pricing effect on a $58,490 Ford LTD would be a reduction in the vicinity of $5,500, equal to nearly 15 per cent reduction in sales tax; whereas vehicles which are priced at above $85,000 would benefit by a reduction of as little as $1,400, or a mere 1.6 per cent. Add to that the normal optional extra fitting ratio of about $4,500, which is now taxed at 75 per cent, and the net price reduction potential is less than $500, or 0.5 per cent on that $85,000 motor vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> The new tax structure will create total chaos in the pricing of optional extras with vehicles between $45,056 and $97,429 having to be priced individually. As a result of this legislation there will be three different option prices: category A, based on 20 per cent tax for vehicles under $45,056; category B, based on 75 per cent tax on vehicles between $45,057 and $97,429; and category C, based on 50 per cent tax on vehicles over $97,429. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this confusion, there will be the added turmoil, firstly, that a vehicle in category A with options added which take it over the threshold will be subject to an incremental 10 per cent on the whole vehicle price and the option price will increase due to a tax change from 20 per cent to a massive 75 per cent; secondly, if options added to a vehicle in category B take it over the price of $97,429, the tax on options fitted reduces from 75 per cent to 50 per cent-some logic in that; and, thirdly, options on vehicles priced at more than $97,429 will be cheaper than on vehicles whose prices are some $50,000 less than that, an example being that a sun roof on a BMW 525i will be 14 per cent more expensive than the same sun roof on a BMW 535i or BMW 7 series. </PARA>
<PARA> So the 30 per cent and 75 per cent sales tax mixture will be applicable under this legislation to vehicles between $45,056 and $97,429 at retail price. That makes a complete mockery of the pricing of optional extras. How ridiculous to have the option of an electric sun roof on one model being taxed at 75 per cent, whereas the identical option on another model will be taxed at 50 per cent, or indeed at 20 per cent. The practical problems associated with explaining these price differences and anomalies to customers is a communications problem seemingly ignored by the Treasurer and his advisers closeted in Canberra away from the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation completely ignores the three basic principles of tax legislation that it should be fair, efficient and simple. It should have come as no surprise to the Treasurer, as he claimed in his press release on Budget night, that the 50 per cent tax introduced in May had led to the deletion of safety items in some cases to reduce the vehicle price below the higher sales tax threshold. The Treasurer ascribed these deletions to the so-called discontinuity caused by his initial changes whereby the 50 per cent tax rate applying, instead of 20 per cent, once the threshold price was reached, caused an immediate price increase of $9,070. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation does not remove that so-called discontinuity as far as optional extras are concerned and so will not eliminate the practice of deleting safety items. In fact, the chaos now introduced in pricing optional extras will worsen the situation with regard to safety items. Under this Bill, at the threshold, the tax on the whole vehicle increases from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, while the tax on the option increases from 20 per cent to 75 per cent. This is hardly an incentive to change the option fitting policy of a vehicle marketer. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, let us take a car priced at the threshold at $45,055 and add an option such as anti-lock brakes at a cost of $2,320. The cost of fitting anti-lock brakes which should cost $2,320 will, in fact, be an enormous $6,199. So it will cost substantially more to fit a safety feature such as this to a car just below the threshold. In addition, it will cost more to fit it on a vehicle under the $97,500 retail price than it will on one above that price. There is, therefore, still no incentive to fit additional items, including very important safety items, to lower priced vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if this Government continues with its manic determination to tax quality, this should not as well become a tax on safety. Safety related items such as anti-lock brakes, air bags and seat belts should be allowed to be brought in free of duty and free of sales tax. These inequities again point to the artificial and anachronistic depreciation limit, from which this additional tax rate is levied, to which I referred in my remarks on the May legislation. I will not repeat those comments. It is certainly timely that I again reinforce the demand that this anachronistic limit be scrapped if Australia is serious about bringing about a productive local manufacturing industry, capable of exporting vehicles to other countries, with vehicles competitive in terms of cost and quality. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, the fact that this new policy does bring the retail price of some vehicles down and brings an element of progressiveness to bear, thereby eliminating to some extent the large no-man's- land which the May legislation introduced, by no means offsets the many disadvantages of this legislation, which I have outlined in my remarks. In essence, the policy is flawed because it relies on a Clayton's revenue projection-a revenue projection which will simply not be achieved; it further discriminates against imported vehicles; it will cause confusion in the marketplace; and, most importantly, as I have just explained, it still discriminates against the fitting of optional extras and, in particular, safety related items. The Treasurer is either being devilishly clever or he completely misunderstands the nature of the car industry in introducing these changes to the legislation and, indeed, in persisting with the discriminatory sales tax announced in March and which began operation with the legislation which was passed in May. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation simply reinforces the need for a complete overhaul of the indirect taxation system, which has applied in Australia for many years, and it simply reinforces the justification which the coalition has for announcing that when it forms government, which will now be a certainty after the next election, it will introduce a goods and services tax, a form of indirect taxation, which will replace this motley range of indirect wholesale sales taxes which we currently have, and will also allow substantial reductions in income tax, as well as offsetting compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> That simply is the highlight of this legislation-the need for the substitution of that goods and services tax for this unholy mess which we have in the form of a wholesale sales tax. As I said, the way in which it is being applied in the car industry is discriminatory, it is totally unjustified, it is contrary to the directions which the Button car plan sought to set for the Australian car industry and, above all, the revenue projections, which were the reason which the Treasurer introduced this legislation to get an extra $100m for road funds, will not be realised. There is no way in which this legislation can be justified and it simply should not be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, the Senate has before it this evening in a Budget session a Bill to adjust the sales tax. Whether or not these adjustments have been mechanical or contentious, they have provided an annual ritual that has led many of us to question the efficiency of a tax that continually creates anomalies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A great continuing evil of sales tax is its manipulation by this Government, either to increase revenue by stealth or to score points through cheap symbolism. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 before us tonight adjusts one such move made earlier this year when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) felt the political need to reinvent his populist credentials by throwing a punitive tax on the sorts of cars that only more affluent Australians can supposedly afford to buy. The politics of envy by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats are obviously alive and very much well. The fact that this Bill is now necessary to introduce a phasing-in period for the 50 per cent luxury rate of tax only reminds us that the original legislation was a hasty and cynical political move, as is so much of the tax legislation that is introduced into this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout its term of office the approach of the Hawke Labor Government towards indirect taxation has been a saga of opportunism, cowardice and hypocrisy. What was to be an essential plank of taxation reform in 1985 is now damned by the Treasurer and the Government because the coalition is moving towards a more logical, equitable and honest form of indirect tax. It was after all the Treasurer who, on 3 July 1985, told the National Taxation Summit that `by cutting out the broad-based consumption tax we cut the heart out of the package'. They were the Treasurer's words, not my words, and now because his political masters-the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-have told him to back down he is retreating at a rate of knots. It is a matter of record that the Government beat a political retreat after that pressure from its political masters, the ACTU, but the Treasurer cannot convince anyone that what was logical and right in 1985 is an unjust tax in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Treasurer who declared himself to have been in favour of an indirect tax from his first days in office and who dismissed criticisms of his 1985 indirect tax proposition as `divided, sectional and too uncompromising in tone'. It was the Treasurer who proclaimed the virtue of a `single rate, exemption-free tax, particularly in the supermarket context'. Such a tax `would create the foundations for a more efficient system to promote stronger economic growth and higher living standards'. They were his words. How different the world is today. </PARA>
<PARA> In one important sense the Hawke Labor Government has been consistent in its attitude towards indirect tax. It may have run abjectly from the 1985 proposal for a goods and services tax, but it has deliberately sought to increase its revenue from the existing, underhand, wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In reality it has not run away from its proposals of 1985 to introduce a consumption tax; it has simply called it something else. It has simply masqueraded under the wholesale sales tax system. We know that to be true, but unfortunately because of the way in which it is done year after year, little by little-sometimes not so little by little-most Australians do not understand that this form of consumption tax exists. Very few people who go to the supermarket or buy something on a day-to-day basis realise how much consumption tax they are already paying. We have five levels of consumption tax in this country: zero, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 50 per cent, all of which have been implemented under this Government. But the Government says, `No, we do not have a consumption tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, the last year of the coalition Government, sales tax comprised 8.5 per cent of total taxation revenue. By 1989-90, it had risen to 11.2 per cent. That equates to $10.1 billion out of $90.5 billion. Under the Hawke Labor Government total tax revenue rose 122 per cent to 1989-90. Sales tax-the Labor Government's form of consumption tax-has risen by a massive 190 per cent. In five Labor Budgets, sales tax receipts increased ahead of total tax revenue, but nobody realises it because it is done quietly and surreptitiously. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a government that lacks the courage to reform the system but has broadened sales tax by stealth. This Labor Government has extended sales tax to previously exempt items, such as flavoured milk, fruit juices, household disinfectants, skin lotions, sun screens, photographic film and ice-cream. It has doubled sales tax on hand gardening tools and household wrapping material. It is interesting that the Government has put a sales tax on sun screens at a time when taxpayers' money is being spent trying to convince people not to get skin cancers. On the one hand the Government spends taxpayers' money telling people to use good sun screens, while on the other hand it increases sales tax on those products. They used to be exempt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that so? Let Senator McMullan deny that the Government has now put a sales tax on a previously exempt item-sun screens. Let him also deny that the taxpayers have not been spending money over the past umpteen years to convince people to drink less alcohol. Yet, low alcohol beer that previously used to be exempt now attracts a tax of 20 per cent. Senator McMullan cannot deny that; that happens to be fact. That happens to be the Government's form of a consumption tax. The Government promotes a higher use of sun screens, it promotes a greater consumption of low alcohol beer, and then it taxes both of them, which were previously tax exempt. It is just absolute and utter duplicity. These are the facts that expose the hollowness of such grandstanding exercises as the 50 per cent impost on luxury vehicles-luxury vehicles deemed to be luxury by their value, not by their accessories, not by their features, but by their value. The politics of envy again!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In contrast to this newfound rhetoric, the actions of the Hawke Labor Government show a determination to extend indirect taxes to a range of items routinely purchased by ordinary Australians and those which particularly affect families with children. As I mentioned before just to prove a point, we have items that used to be exempt which the family buys for children: flavoured milk, fruit juices, sun screens and, of course, ice-creams; let us not forget them. Because they are consumed by children in a fairly high quantity, the Government says, `Let's tax them as well'. But then it says, `No, we will not have a consumption tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax may prove quietly useful to this Hawke Labor Government, but it defies logic and credibility for it to mount a defence of a tax that in 1985 the Treasurer rightly described as anomaly ridden. Nothing has changed. Sales tax is essentially selective in its impact on national economic life, imposing a particular burden on the transport and equipment sectors and hampering exports at a time when Australia's gross foreign debt of $156 billion has reached 39 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Then again, this Government does not seem to care that we are uncompetitive internationally while it pursues economic policies that send producers broke. The coalition simply cannot accept what the Government implicitly upholds: that we can afford the $1 billion added to the cost of exports as a result of sales tax. Once again I state: the Government does not care that we are uncompetitive. It does not seem to care that it is sending the primary producers and all the small businesses in this country broke and that those sectors cannot afford to produce products that can be exported viably. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a tragedy for me to be talking to people last Friday week who now have to have things produced in Malaysia because they cannot afford to have them produced in Australia and viably exported. It is absurd for any Labor or Democrat senator-both parties, I might add, are hooked on higher taxes-to prattle about any supposed greater equity in sales tax as opposed to a goods and services tax, when the services sector attracting the spending of the more affluent section of the community currently escapes indirect tax. It is essentially dishonest to pretend that ordinary Australians who will pay a goods and services tax do not already meet the end cost of indirect taxes through sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer was more honest in 1985 when he described sales tax as `mostly a tax on Australian household goods' and stated the truth that all necessities must be purchased from income depleted by income tax. Never a truer word was said. The Treasurer is otherwise known as `Bracket creep' because of the bracket creep that has gone on in 7 1/2 years of this Government-7 1/2 years of bracket creep where people's disposable income, the money they have left after paying the enormous taxes put on them by this Government, has diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor now tries to terrify retirees and low income earners regarding a goods and services tax, we might recall that in 1985 the Treasurer promised that such people would be better off as part of the general package centred on a broad based indirect tax. How he has changed his tune again. When the Treasurer actually boasts that sales tax has grown under this Labor Government, the question can only be asked as to why the next logical step is not taken and an Australian goods and services tax introduced in line with 21 of the 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries that have a broad based indirect tax in place. Why the Treasurer considers increasing sales taxes by 190 per cent as a good move is beyond comprehension, other than to say that the reason he does it is that most people do not know he is doing it. </PARA>
<PARA> As we debate this sales tax legislation we should ask: What specific compensation has been offered to low income earners by this Government, as it has extended sales tax to everyday items? In contrast, it will be an essential feature of a goods and services tax that compensation be given to those adversely affected along with a reduction in personal income tax for all other income earners. The Treasurer can try to fool Australians with the specious claim that all of his supposedly wonderful reforms since 1985 make indirect tax reform unnecessary. Yet the fact remains that income tax now accounts for 72 per cent of tax receipts compared with 66 per cent in 1985-86. That is not what I would call a fairer tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1985, the Treasurer accused the tax system of being recognised as unfair and as failing to reward initiative. If he thought that that was what the tax system was in 1985, heaven only knows what he thinks it is now-but he is not game enough to say so. How right he was when on 19 June 1985 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless we find another major base in the tax system, and tax expenditure in some way, then it will be the ordinary working people who will carry the burden. </PARA>
<PARA>That was prophetic, was it not, because it is the ordinary person who is carrying the burden today. Ask any taxpayers whether they think they are better off today than they were back in 1985 when the Treasurer said those words. But how he has changed his tune now just to appease his political masters, the ACTU. Not only was that statement logical, but, as I say, it was most prophetic. Australians with incomes 15 per cent above average weekly earnings pay tax at the top marginal rate and revenue under this Labor Government has fed quietly on that well recognised bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the average Australian is told that he lives in the best possible of all taxation worlds, and that he or she must beware of the goods and services tax bogey. At least with goods and services tax the taxpayers would know how much tax they are paying; they would know if it were to be increased, which is certainly not the case today. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge any opponent of the principle of a goods and services tax to say with a straight face what is equitable and logical about the wholesale sales tax that will be abolished by a Liberal government as an essential step towards a goods and services tax. Is it in the long term interests of Australia that Parliament year after year debate the tinkering of a form of indirect tax that affects only some businesses and that was designed as a luxury tax in the 1930s? It is certainly no luxury tax now when it starts taxing things like children's ice-creams. It ignores the contemporary business reality that some wholesalers have become their own retailers and can shift the profit margin beyond the point where tax is applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Just what is fair and sensible about a 30 per cent tax on cameras, photographic equipment and household clocks, while exempting antique clocks? Why should a tool box attract 20 per cent sales tax when expensive clothing like Italian suits is exempt; and chocolate biscuits attract 10 per cent sales tax when caviar attracts no tax? How can anyone describe that as a fair taxation system?</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the answer for the Government would simply be, `Okay, we will tax the lot, but we will tax it at a luxury rate, just as we are doing with this luxury car tax-whack it up at 50 per cent'. As I say, it just comes back to the politics of envy of the Labor Party and the Democrats. The only answer is a new honest system of indirect taxation, not open to the special pleading and sleight of hand of this Government. No-one puts the case better than the Treasurer in describing `the current anomaly ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector'. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Treasurer gives unspecified administrative difficulties as to why services cannot be taxed, ignoring the fact that most of our competitors have managed to do so in all but financial services. But he obviously cannot exercise his mind that far. He was able to do so in 1985, but he cannot really do so now because the ACTU will not let him. The coalition is unimpressed by the announced review that will supposedly simplify sales tax and examine relief for business inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> A simpler tax system-that is what we were promised in 1983 before this Government even came to office. Yet we have had thousands upon thousands of pages of tax regulations and amendments and additions in 7 1/2 years. Creating more pieces of legislation, to this Government, is a way of making the taxation system more simple. Talk to any accountant or businessman and see whether they think it is more simple. Talk to the individual taxpayer and see whether he can now do his own tax return or whether he has to get an accountant to do it-that is the result of the Treasurer's simplified tax promise in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this simply acknowledges what the Opposition has been saying as to the inefficiency and inequity of sales tax. What we have seen over the last 7 1/2 years of this Labor Government is a Clayton's goods and services tax. A rise in sales tax over that time of 190 per cent is proof positive. This Bill and scores of its predecessors should convince rational observers that what is required is not more tinkering with sales tax but its replacement with a broad-based, equitable and honest indirect tax. Australians simply cannot afford to be hit with more sales taxes at the rate at which this Government is increasing them. </PARA>

<PARA> Referring to some of the things to which Senator Spindler referred, he did draw attention to-and Senator Watson made some fleeting reference to-possible loopholes in the way in which the newspaper insert section has been drafted. That is a matter, of course, which we will have to look at, but at this stage it is envisaged that it will achieve its purpose and we will keep that under review. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler's amendments we will debate at the committee stage, so I will not duplicate that the Government will not be accepting any of those amendments. They are more appropriately matters that should be dealt with after a wider community consultation and after a priority setting exercise where the Government has reviewed the priorities which it wants to set, consistent with the general view that in many of these matters, though not all of the ones in the amendments, it is usually better to deal with providing assistance to the people to whom the Government tries to target such assistance through revenue matters rather than through tax deductions. Certainly in some of the matters that were raised by Senator Spindler I think that would be more appropriate. I will not say any more now; we will deal with it in the committee stage. I simply indicate that we will not be supporting those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some discussion about the revenue outcome of the previous change and the revenue consequences of this change. It is difficult to make a long term assessment of that because, of course, sometimes purchases are merely deferred. If one looks at a six-month period, one may say that there was a decline in revenue because there were fewer purchases of such vehicles. But it may be that if one looks at figures over one or two years, there is simply a trend of decline. It may be caused by other factors to do with the state of the economy and in the long term there may be a significant revenue enhancement. Even if there were to be a transfer of purchases to lower cost vehicles, those, of course, are not sales tax exempt. They are just taxed at a lower rate. There would be some increased sale tax revenue under the other classifications. </PARA>
<PARA> So the hyperbole we hear about revenue is a bit inappropriate. I have to say that I cannot imagine very many Australians shedding tears because we have a situation in which there are fewer imported luxury motor vehicles coming into Australia than there were before. I certainly do not. I do not regard that as a disastrous outcome or as a matter about which we ought to be wringing our hands. I can understand why the Opposition might be concerned that the Ferrari-led recovery is in a bit of trouble, but the rest of us are not. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the call by Senator Chapman for safety items to be free of sales tax because he then went on to advocate a broadly based consumption tax. A broadly based consumption tax, apart from its other shortcomings, gives away the capacity of government to discriminate in that way. It consciously abandons the weapon that the Opposition purports to be one of its strengths. Certainly, it does remove the capacity to do that. It may be that Senator Chapman has a good point on the safety issue. That is a matter for another debate. I simply say that the Opposition has to stop trying to have it both ways. It must stop trying to say that we should have this broadly based consumption tax at a uniform rate while raising particular proposals for exemptions. Of course, there is a basic inconsistency in that position and it will be exposed over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The description of this situation applies equally well to debate about issues to do with the environment. It is impossible to argue that there ought to be tax concessions through the sales tax system for environmentally conscious activities and at the same time advocate a broadly based consumption tax. The two are mutually exclusive. I have to say that to hear the impassioned defence of the luxury motor vehicle market in the context of an advocacy of a broadly based consumption tax only reinforces my view that I cannot have much sympathy for a tax proposal that reduces the price of Rolls Royces and puts up the price of a bread roll. I really think that those priorities are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles's contribution in the main does not warrant a response, but I do want to clarify one thing because she made a factual error that could mislead people. She talked about the tax on sun screens. I interjected but I did not want to pursue the matter in detail at that stage. I simply read into the record a section from the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Act. In respect of preparations, the section states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that are put up and sold for use as substances to be applied to the skin for the purpose of screening out solar ultra-violet rays, but not including . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to exclude certain cosmetics in respect of which there is a certificate saying that it provides an acceptable level of protection from solar ultraviolet rays. These are exempt from sales tax at the moment. I say to Senator Knowles that I doubt that they would be exempt from a broadly based consumption tax but I understand her concern. It is a pity that she does not understand her own argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. As indicated during the second reading debate, both of these amendments deal with, first of all, the recycling of 100 per cent plastic material and, secondly, previous legislation exempting recycled paper from sales tax. That legislation omitted the circumstance where we have a product which is partially composed of 100 per cent recycled paper. Since that would be the majority of products in the marketplace, it is important to extend the exemption to these products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As indicated before, these amendments seek to put into practice the sustainable economic development principles that we have debated in the Senate earlier today. I must again register my disappointment at the fact that both the Government and the Opposition parties have indicated that they are not prepared to take even this small step towards the implementation of sustainable development principles. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to advert briefly to an extraordinary argument that was put forward by Senator Watson in the course of that debate-that is, that we, meaning the Senate, should not attempt to amend legislation unless the particular item was part of the Government's Bill or was clearly the Government's intention. Then, perhaps, we may, with some trepidation, I gather, attempt to fine tune here or there. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder why Senator Watson is here, why the Senate exists, if we are not to amend, not to review the Government's legislation and take every opportunity that is offered to us by constitutional provisions and the conventions and practice of this place? Senator Watson seems to indicate that what he prefers is a Senate that simply sits and nods and perhaps delivers itself of some erudite and detailed theoretical comments but nay, never shall it act; that would not be in keeping with the Senate. I regret that this is not the Australian Democrats' position. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must respond to those provocative remarks. I am not one for pushing my own barrow, but there is a time and a place for all amendments and necessary changes. I am very proud of what I have been able to achieve in the 12 years that I have been here and I challenge Senator Spindler to try to match that record. The thrust of the Australian Democrats, through these various amendments tonight, has been an attempt, in their words, to shame senators into agreeing with their selective amendments through what I would call the technique of moral embarrassment. Not one person in this chamber would disagree with the thrust of the Democrats' sentiments, but the mechanism that was used is inappropriate and wrong on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that changing the Government's Budget strategy by selectively reducing items on politically advantageous measures would create a precedent so that a government could never be certain of delivering its Budget, not because of changes in the people's House, the House of Representatives, where governments are formed by majorities as a result of a general election, but changes in an upper House, a House of review. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech of Senator Spindler, I believe, will not be lost on either the Government or the coalition as down the track the force of the arguments will be taken up as part of an overall Budget strategy. I remind the Australian Democrats that timing in politics is essential to ensure that the persuasive arguments are carried in the appropriate circumstances, in the right forum and with the degree of accuracy needed for certainty in reforming and amending the income tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that certain of Senator Spindler's amendments were technically defective and therefore they should come back at another time and on another occasion. To be specific, paragraph (1A) needs further refinement to its present form as presented to the Senate tonight. On behalf of the Opposition, we will not able to support any of the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in the second reading debate, the Government will not be supporting this amendment. Firstly, there is a problem. I do not want to exaggerate, and Senator Spindler is right that great expenses are not involved in this; it is not a matter of crisis for the revenue. Nevertheless, in any amendment of this sort the Government would want to make sure it had the opportunity to examine it and cost it and examine any implications of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I think there is a concern each time a new layer of complexity is added to the problems that individual businesses have in dealing with the sales tax regime. I have discussed the proposal with regard to the recycling of paper with Senator Spindler and it is not of itself a bad idea. I understand the point the honourable senator is trying to deal with. The point is also caught up in the recycling of plastic in terms of the partially recycled products. It becomes administratively hard for the taxpayer. It requires all along the production chain communication of advice about the composition and cost of various components of a product in ways that may not readily be available to people at stages in the production chain and which some people may not wish to disclose. It is not of itself a straightforward matter for the ultimate payer, in this case the taxpayer, to know necessarily all the information he or she would need to comply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not mean tomorrow, I mean as a continuing problem of administration. I think there is in there the kernel of an idea with which the Government has some sympathy, but I am not confident that we have the right way of going about it. I am not convinced that the tax system is the best way to achieve our shared environmental objectives. I could give Senator Spindler a repeat of my half-hour speech to a seminar this morning on that question, but I promise him I will not. In spite of the pleadings by my colleagues that I should do so, I will refrain. It was a very good speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the tax system is not necessarily the best mechanism and, if it were, these are not necessarily the priorities we would choose. Those are the sorts of issues we need to look at without in any way saying that the Government is necessarily fixed in opposition to the objectives which the Democrats are trying to achieve. Of course, some part of it is merely building on initiatives which we both supported in this chamber previously concerning recycled paper. I understand the objective and it is not alien to the Government's overall objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson has raised some drafting points which we would also wish to look at if we were going to proceed in this direction. One of the advantages of the wholesale sales tax system over the broadly based consumption tax system is that it does give a capacity to move in this direction that is absent from the broadly based consumption tax. That is one of several good arguments against a consumption tax, that it makes it impossible to take these sorts of initiatives, and I think that is undesirable. I think that would be a step back in the development of an environmental policy in Australia, to move towards a tax that does not have the capacity to distinguish between desirable and undesirable products from, for example, an environmental point of view or health point of view, such as those sun screen issues which we were debating earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is not the appropriate mechanism; I think it is a matter that the Government will want to review and I will discuss some related issues to do with the subsequent amendments when they arise. The Government will not be supporting this amendment for those reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a sense of deja vu. Those of us who support the amendments-as, of course, I do-and those of us who do believe that the tax system is an appropriate part of the process of encouraging environmentally sound practices need to try to find some avenue of comfort when significant legislation like this, and amendments such as this, are being opposed by both of the old parties in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take some very small comfort from the fact that, via my sense of deja vu, I recall that in about May of last year a similar amendment on questions of tax exemption for recycled paper was put forward in this chamber by the Democrats and we were told then it was not the right mechanism, it was not the right time, it was not the right process. Then the Democrats found out what the mechanism was, what the time was and what the process was in the world's greatest environment statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in the context of an upcoming Federal election campaign, in which he made a commitment to the implementation of that very system which, of course, had been rejected only six weeks before in this very place. </PARA>
<PARA> It did take a bit longer for the legislation actually to come here, but it arrived just in time for the election. The thing that worries me a little is that we are much further away from an election this time than we were last time. Clearly we can see that if the mechanism is not to promote amendments by the Committee of the Whole, I do not really know what it is unless it is in the context of public and community pressure in an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope this time the Government will not wait to pick up these initiatives until six months before the next Federal election. It does have an obligation, particularly to those Australians who put it in office-that is, over 70 per cent, I think, but certainly over 60 per cent of voters for the Democrats and like-minded Independents who, with their second preferences only, ensured the return of this Government. Therefore, I think that places an obligation on this Government not to string those supporters along until the six months preceding the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend these amendments to the Government. We would have been happy for this Bill to have gone off under our new committee system for the consideration which the Government and the Opposition both said was needed-a little bit of redrafting and a little bit of consideration about how it will work and whether people can get the information. We do have a system here which could actually handle that. I do not think the appropriate standing committee has actually got anything to do on Friday, so we could have sent it off on that track if the only reason was that it just needed a little bit more time and polish. We do not mind being called a little bit unpolished on issues like this, and we are happy to negotiate on drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been given the opportunity to do that this time. We commend these amendments and the principles behind them to the Government and the Opposition. I think the Opposition's environment spokesperson, former Senator Chaney, would find his slightly green tinged image slightly tarnished tonight by virtue of his colleagues here opposing this set of amendments as well. I express my disappointment, too, that the Government and the Opposition are not supporting these amendments once more. </PARA>

<PARA> After clause 3, page 2, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``First Schedule</PARA>
<PARA> 3A. The First Schedule to the Principal Act is amended:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by omitting sub-item (1) from item 123 and substituting the following sub-item:</PARA>
<PARA> `(1) Goods designed and manufactured especially for, and of a kind predominantly used by, persons with sickness, disease or disablement.';</PARA>
<PARA> (b) by inserting in item 123a, after paragraph (d), the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `(e) computer equipment used as, or in conjunction with, electronic communications equipment,';</PARA>
<PARA> (c) by omitting from item 135a `in the transportation to and from gainful employment'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment refers to the exemption from sales tax of various items used by disabled people. One part of the amendment seeks to expand the exemption from sales tax of cars used by disabled people. Currently it applies only if they use vehicles to go to and from work. We believe that the issue for disabled people is one of mobility and that, therefore, this should be extended to all their activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the amendment looks at a change of words recommended by the Industry Commission to express positively the exemption for goods designed and manufactured especially for and of a kind predominantly used by persons with sickness, disease and disablement. The final part of the amendment seeks to exempt computer equipment used in conjunction with electronic communications equipment predominantly for deaf people. </PARA>
<PARA> All three parts of the amendment in one form or another have been moved previously by Senator Haines, Senator Macklin and even by Senator Mason, going back several years. Therefore, any arguments that the Government will put forward in its soft shoe shuffle that these require further consideration and further thought simply do not hold true. </PARA>
<PARA> We are putting forward administrative arguments to provide urgently needed assistance to people who need it most. I again refer the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (Senator McMullan) to the Rollsian principle that a civilisation is judged by how it treats its most disadvantaged members. Today, when the Government and the Opposition refuse to help disabled people, is a day of shame for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found Senator Spindler's remarks a particularly disappointing contribution to what had otherwise been a fairly measured and reasonable discussion of sales tax. We are getting into the situation where people who, to put the matter at its kindest, hope they can gain some electoral advantage by writing to every disabled group in Australia, as they will tomorrow, suddenly are trying to put on the cloak of morality by saying that only people who agree with them are people of morality and that it is a day of shame if we do not agree with them. Up until this moment we have had a perfectly reasonable debate. People have had disagreements and it has been accepted that people can disagree with one another and still act with goodwill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It remains my view, and the Government's view, that in the main the best way of providing assistance to people in need, whether people with disabilities or others, is through the revenue side of the Budget rather than through its tax side. That remains our policy. That does not mean that there can be no movement in the tax area. We are aware of the issues raised by the Industry Commission, but we are not bound by those proposals any more than the Democrats are bound by them. The Democrats cite those parts of the Industry Commission report which they find to their taste, but not the others. That is a perfectly proper thing to do, because commissions advise and governments decide, but we should not pretend that, because the Democrats like some parts of the report, we should all be bound to support those matters and ignore the rest. </PARA>
<PARA> We have concerns with the Democrats' amendments for three reasons. First, we are not yet convinced that the people with disabilities most in need are those who have difficulties buying their motor vehicles and that the first priority for the Government in assisting people with disabilities ought to be that initiative. Even though that may at some stage be an appropriate one, it is an odd priority. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not satisfied with the Industry Commission's proposal about the use of the word `predominantly'. I understand what it and the Democrats are trying to achieve in this matter; we do not believe that they have yet achieved it appropriately. The Industry Commission's proposals, as everybody in this Committee will know, traverse a wide range of matters to do with assistance to people with disabilities and aids and appliances for them. It is appropriate that that should receive consideration by members of both Federal Houses. Picking up bits of legislation that one hopes may appeal to some interest group is not good government. It is the luxury that minority groups have. Good luck to them, I understand that, but the Government will not be supporting the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to speak for a while about the visit I have just undertaken in the company of three other senators-Senator Giles, Senator Vallentine and Senator Crowley- together with the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senators Vallentine and Crowley have already explained, we went there as a delegation of Federal female politicians at the invitation of the Soviet Women's Committee. I think the invitation was extended to us for two reasons: first, so that we, in this Parliament, could have a better idea of the problems and the challenges facing the Soviet nation in this time of enormous change; and, secondly, to see what advice we could offer and help we could give as women members of parliament to those who are trying to introduce democracy and a market economy in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very beginning, I express my appreciation of the members of the Soviet Women's Committee who were our hosts for the entire time we were in the Soviet Union. I especially express my appreciation to Galina Negrustuyeva and Vera Soboleva from the Soviet Women's Committee, who organised the program, and to Ellen Mitriaeva and Tania Anisimova, who were our interpreters. My colleagues have already paid tribute to these women, who really were essential to making this a most successful visit to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> What did we do in the 10 days that we were there? In those 10 days, we spent almost every waking moment talking with Soviet citizens-men and women in the cities of Moscow and Leningrad- learning about the Soviet Union today. We met deputies at the national, republic, city and district council levels. We met journalists, generals, doctors, housewives, members of the intelligentsia, kindergarten teachers, people in industry and agriculture, communists and former communists, non-communists, human rights activists and veterans. We encountered a wide range of people and a wide range of views. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not pretend to speak for my colleagues on the delegation but some lessons that I learnt as the 10 days in the Soviet Union progressed were lessons which I have carried away with me. First and foremost is the clear demonstration of the failure of communism. If any evidence of that was needed, it was the rout of the Communist Party in the votes cast in the assemblies in the last 12 months. Time after time we were given details of how the Communist Party was not supported by the people at the last elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, time and time again clear evidence was given of how central control had failed. That, of course, is a major issue facing the Soviet Government, which I hoped would have been announced today. I have not heard whether Mr Gorbachev has made an announcement about the future of central control, but it was expected today. We saw it in such areas as the failure of the delivery of food to the people in those vast cities of Leningrad and Moscow. I understand that this is the case throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw it in the inability or the unwillingness of the bureaucracy to ensure that not only the crops are grown but also that they are safely stored and delivered to the consumers. We saw it in visiting a hospital where, until recently, every minor decision had to be referred to Moscow; where there was a question of how many pharmaceuticals would be bought and how much linen would be procured. The decision as to whether the linen was needed was laid down from Moscow, and there were no arguments about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We found it also in talking to a young woman of entrepreneurial spirit who, with a group of her colleagues, had set up a travel agency in competition with Intourist. She told us how the only way that the travel agency could deal directly and immediately with the outside world was by telex, because all faxes and all overseas telephone calls had to go through Moscow adding enormously to the delays and the bureaucratic frustrations of people inside and outside the Soviet Union trying to do business. Time and time again central control was demonstrated to have been a failure. </PARA>
<PARA> State ownership has failed and that was also very clear in talking to some of the people who were involved in enterprises in the country. There has been a lack of foresight in ploughing back money made by enterprises into the redevelopment; whether it was to provide environmental controls, better equipment or whether it was to go with the new technology into the future. There has been a distinct failure in a state-owned enterprise to put the money aside to make sure that the future is productive. </PARA>
<PARA> We found interestingly in those state-owned enterprises that in very recent times they decided that they had to do something about labour and initiative. I was intrigued on three occasions to be told that the labour force now had contracts negotiated-in one case it was one-year contracts-and the wages were reasonably good but that there were incentive schemes built on a base wage. The incentive schemes varied from the hospital I mentioned earlier where doctors and nurses had to be able to give evidence that they had given quality medical care and that their patients had not returned within a short period with the same complaint, to the industrial concern where the workers had to demonstrate that they had had accident free days, that they had turned out a quality product and that they had increased their productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> We found in a joint venture a similar scheme for a base rate of salary coupled with incentive payments, and these had been negotiated at the enterprise level with the workers. Until now, of course, when productivity had not been such a vital issue and the state controlled all enterprises, these had not been the way forward. I would think that the Labor Government in Australia could learn something from the direction that these labour contracts are going in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that I found of interest was the failure of affirmative action, and by that I mean the failure of quotas for women. In the Soviet political system, since 1917 when women were given a constitutionally equal place in society, there has been an unofficial quota system whereby women get between 30 and 50 per cent of all deputies positions in the various parliaments in the country. However, with the coming of the democratic elections in the last 12 months, these quotas have now been abolished- disappointingly, of course. For instance on the Leningrad City Council only 26 women out of 400 deputies were elected in the recent election, compared with 300 out of 600 in the previous Leningrad City Council. That story was repeated to us wherever we met deputies in the various soviets or parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> The women in the Soviet Union were very concerned about this, as we are in this country when there are not sufficient women in our parliaments. But, clearly, it is not a remedy to put women there in artificial positions because increasingly, as we got to know what had been happening in the Soviet Union, we found that those women who had been there in substantial numbers had not necessarily effected better conditions of either employment or health for the women they represented. One would have expected that they might be in a position to do more for the health and for the occupational health and safety of the women that we heard about. </PARA>
<PARA> Those were some lessons that I found very dramatic: the failure of communism; the failure of central control; the failure of state ownership; and the failure of affirmative action. I also learnt a great lesson on the hunger for information on democracy and small business. The women we met were desperate to know just how they could get more women into Parliament; how women in this country go into Parliament; whether they should opt for a women's party; whether they should go back to quotas; and whether they should have political clubs, as they have already established, to try to help women become-as they say-less naive about the political process and more knowledgeable in working for the political party of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> They also wanted to know about the details of small business, about obtaining finance and about staying out of trouble in a business. They have, after all, had 70 years of no small business. Most of them have had no ability to get out of the country and see small business working in the Western world, and they were very eager to get information from us on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> But there were other issues of importance raised with us while we were in the Soviet Union which I would like to raise tonight briefly. I have mentioned women's health and occupational health and safety, and they were issues which really did worry me very much. We heard how married women in the Soviet Union might expect to have between seven and 14 abortions during the course of their married life because of the lack of contraception. We also heard about the desperate lack of sex education. We heard that few contraceptives were produced in the Soviet Union, and with the lack of foreign currency it was a low priority for buying from overseas. We heard about diaphragms that were made in the Soviet Union but were made of metal and ulcerated women so that they were very badly hurt. We heard about Soviet women being frigid. We also heard about Soviet men being alcoholic. I do not know whether the production of more contraceptives might solve more than one problem in one go, but certainly it seemed as if this is an important subject which has been of extremely low priority in the years where defence has been a very high expenditure and health has been quite low. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard about the lack of antenatal care for women. We heard about the crowded and antiquated obstetric hospitals and the difficulties for women in a crowded obstetrics system. We also heard about women working in factories with inadequate protection for their health. We were told that there were 30 million working places designated below satisfactory working conditions and that 700,000 of these places actually break the health and safety laws. We were told that women working in these jobs were unhealthy and that 100 cities in the USSR have been designated as zones of ecological disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told of the increasing numbers of children being born with health defects and deformities. We were told that partly this was exacerbated by the lack of antenatal care, but also by the exposure of women in heavy industry to chemicals, and also to the long hours with many of them working 12 hours a day in order to get sufficient income. Because in the Soviet Union a high proportion of the women are working in unskilled positions and therefore on fairly low incomes, in many cases they have opted to work 12-hour days in order to get sufficient money. These are things which are obviously facing the Government and are of great importance. I hope they will be solved. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine and I met with the Deputy Chief of the General Staff. I also met with the veterans organisation. We heard from these military people about restructuring the Defence Force and I heard about the care of veterans. The openness with which we were given budgetary information-which sometimes in Australia we have to drag out of the defence Estimates committee-was really quite an eye opener to me, at least, and I think also to Senator Vallentine. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much I could comment on but I do not wish to take the time of the Senate for long tonight. The General was particularly frank and talked about the problems facing them. One example that he stated quite categorically was that there was currently a problem with morale in the forces, which we believe to be the case, but it was interesting to have him acknowledge it. Also, the Soviet military had not been accustomed to public criticism in the Soviet Union but that was now a growing force, and they had not been accustomed to being subject to public scrutiny of the defence budget in the detail which they now had to face. He wryly told us that his opposite numbers in the United States had sympathised with him on their mutual problems in this area of dealing with politicians who want to scrutinise defence spending. </PARA>
<PARA> We were all somewhat surprised at the clear resurgence of religion and particularly that there were a lot of young people taking part in religious services wherever we had the opportunity to see them. We heard about legislation which has changed the censorship laws, but other people told us that senior management in some of the media are exercising covert censorship even if the overt censorship is banned. We heard reports on the human rights situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We went to an exhibition of paintings which I found particularly interesting. Two galleries displayed works of dissident artists which had not been displayed in the Soviet Union until this last year. The artists had been imprisoned, executed or exiled in the early years after the revolution in 1917. Although they had made their names in the West and their work had been exhibited and bought and sold in the West, they were not known to the Soviet people. They are now on permanent display. These were the dissidents who showed what it was really like for the peasants to be collectivised, for example. They showed that working in the coal mines, whether under capitalism or communism, was not the most joyous of occupations-unlike the propagandists who were accepted by the state. </PARA>
<PARA> We also heard about the shortage of housing, a matter of great concern to many people. We were told of 200,000 Army officers who, with their families, are without homes. The option at the moment is that some may well have to spend time in tents-in a difficult climate, as you would recognise, Mr President. We also heard that for many families there is a wait of three to four years for housing. We also heard, worst of all, that as there are no refuges women who are subject to violent husbands have no alternative but to stay and cope with the situation. For couples who divorce, many will spend two or three years under the same roof with the spouse from whom they have been divorced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will probably be interested to know that I was told that one of the most popular programs on Soviet television is the long television coverage when the Supreme Soviet is sitting. Democracy is such a fascinating subject for many people in the Soviet Union that to simply sit and watch the televising of the Supreme Soviet or the Moscow City Council, which is also televised, is to watch the most popular program on television. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot come away from the Soviet Union without thinking how we can possibly help. It is a wealthy country, but it is going through very difficult economic times. I do not believe that gifts of money from the West is the solution to its problems. It must find its own solutions to many of its problems. But there are practical ways that we can help. I understand that in 1987 the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, offered to Prime Minister Ryzhkov an exchange program whereby young Soviet citizens could be brought to Australia for short periods to work in business, the bureaucracy and finance to get an experience that they can take back and in that way contribute to the new market economy in the Soviet Union. I understand that the Soviet Government has not taken up that offer. I do hope that the publicity we have been able to give that offer in our travels in the Soviet Union and since we have returned will help the Soviet Union to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I also raised with the military the possibility of military cadets in our country and the Soviet Union having short exchanges to military academies, and also the possibility of junior and middle ranking officers having short exchanges to their units, as we do with defence forces from some other countries. I was told that if an offer was made by the Australian Government and the Australian military, it would be sympathetically received. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to make sure that middle level personnel from Australia can go to the Soviet Union to help in the market economy, especially people who have entrepreneurial skills and a background in small business and banking who can go and conduct seminars at the request of the Soviet people. I would like to see, for example, members of the Business and Professional Women's Association being enabled, perhaps by our Government through the provision of fares, to go to the Soviet Union and for the Soviet Women's Committee to sponsor them for a few weeks so they are given the opportunity to learn more about small business. It is particularly important for women because it gives them an opportunity as mothers to have flexibility in their working hours and to have some opportunity for financial independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Those women in the Soviet Union crave contact with the West. They have not been able to travel and, because of the foreign currency problems, they will probably not be able to do so for some time. But if they could become members of international women's organisations such as the Business and Professional Women's Association, the Federation of University Women, the International Council of Women, Zonta and so on, they would at least have that fertilisation from the West that they so crave and, I believe, need. </PARA>
<PARA> One organisation which is not present in the Soviet Union and which would be valuable is the Girl Guides Association. Women in the Soviet Union are bearing enormous burdens now. They have enormous challenges to face in the future. Something like the Girl Guides Association, which helps girls with leadership training, initiative training and confidence, would be an ideal organisation to be able to contribute to the future of Soviet women. I hope that our guides here might be able in some way to help Soviet girls. </PARA>
<PARA> We were also asked while we were there whether a parliamentary delegation from this country would be able to go to Chernobyl. I put that on the record now so that some consideration might be given by the Parliament to see whether this would be possible. They want the world to see what happened at Chernobyl. They want the world to see what is happening now. I put that to my colleagues with a hope that some serious consideration might be given. </PARA>
<PARA> I once again state my extreme gratitude to the Soviet Women's Committee for making this visit possible. A 20-minute or so speech could not possibly begin to tell of the enormous value which I personally got from the visit, of the things which I learnt, and of the understanding which I gained of the enormous job which is going to be faced by the citizens of the Soviet Union. We all depend around the world on glasnost and perestroika being successful. The Soviet people stand to gain from it and so do we. Its failure, I believe, would be a dreadful thing for us all. The contribution which glasnost and perestroika will make and can make to the reduction of tension and to peace in the world is just beyond statement. I send the Soviet people my very best wishes in the challenges that this next difficult year, or two or three years, poses for them. I hope that all goes well for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to address the Senate on a meeting that I attended last Saturday at Roma with Senator Macdonald from the Liberal Party, Senator Burns from the Australian Labor Party and Senator Kernot. We represented all sections of the political spectrum. It was a meeting that I walked away from feeling very depressed because the problems that were exposed there seemed to have very difficult solutions. The people who gathered there did a magnificent job. Between 800 and 900 people-perhaps a few more-attended. All sections of the community-from the local machinery agents, the retailers and the livestock hauliers to the farmers and graziers-spoke at that meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These people expressed a grave concern about their future and the future of their families. This year the Roma district alone will lose some $24m more than last year. There will be a loss of $10m in wheat sales and $14m in wool sales. This is only one small district of the rural community throughout Australia, one small microcosm of the primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The meeting called for a bipartisan approach from the parliamentary representatives who were there. Senator Burns, representing the Australian Labor Party, acknowledged that there was a rural crisis. He said quite openly that anyone could recognise the problems with wheat down to the lowest rate it had been for 40 years and wool in a crisis situation. Senator Burns was honest enough to admit that there were problems in the rural industry. He said that it was a rural depression. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of interest rates was discussed. The people who attended the meeting pointed out that they could no longer sustain their businesses with interest rates at the current levels. Today I was very glad to see that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have lowered official interest rates by one per cent. I hope that the banks will pass the reductions in interest rates on to the farming community. On the last four occasions when the banks have lowered their interest rates, they have failed to pass the reductions on to the farming community. The farmers were telling us that they are paying up to 20 per cent in interest rates and 3 and 4 per cent in bank charges. They also called for the lowering in the value of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also glad to see today that the dollar has fallen 3c from Friday-a possible response to the lowering of the interest rates. Every cent the dollar falls, rural Australia benefits $170m. So the farmers have a bit of hope for the future when they see the dollar fall to 79c over a period of 48 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The people at the Roma crisis meeting also expressed a problem with the high cost of fuel. The Government's revenue at the moment is 32c per litre, including excise production levies. That does not cover the State taxes imposed by every State except Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in the rural industry wanted us to bring this problem before the Senate so that the Ministers could understand what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission (ISC) report on road use charges was mentioned. I know that Senator Collins, who represents a large Territory with a very small population, would have to consider this matter. It was said that the ISC report, if implemented, would cost rural Australia another 10 per cent with the increased cost of cartage, which would be felt in bringing the goods from the cities to the rural communities and, in return, taking the products from the rural communities to the markets in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the livestock transporters estimated that it would cost an extra 40c a kilo to move beef from the Roma area into the cities. He pointed out that the cost would be passed on in the increased cost of meat. Road trains and trailers will be paying considerably more. In Queensland the registration for a 40 foot trailer weighing 32 tonnes will rise from between $2,000 and $3,000 to $18,600. This will bankrupt many of the road hauliers and the ones who are left will have to pass the increased cost on to their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of road trains in the community. The proprietors of the livestock transporters pointed out that their registration would increase from $6,000 to around $57,000 per annum. That money would be paid up-front. They pointed out to the meeting that they could not afford these increased charges and many of them would not be around in the future. They particularly wanted the ISC report brought up in the Parliament. I believe the report is causing a great deal of concern in rural Australia, as Senator Collins would be aware. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers also complained about the inspection levies. As from January next year the export inspection levies will be raised by 40 per cent to recover a full 100 per cent on export inspections. We could argue about the user pays principle and whether it was the right or the wrong process. I am saying that there could not be a worse time to increase the cost of primary industry levies than at the moment. In Australia's history I do not believe that we have seen a rural crisis such as this one. Normally one commodity will hit a depth; on the other hand, the remaining commodities will be maintained at a certain level. </PARA>
<PARA> Wheat is down to the lowest price in 40 years, and we do not want to talk about wool as it is in such a mess. There could not be a worse time to start increasing costs on primary industry. The farmers do not have the capacity at the moment to withstand any further cost increases. Many farmers acknowledge that they will not make it through the next two or three years. The farmers who are viable will have to go into debt, and the farmers who are in debt now will no longer be viable. </PARA>
<PARA> These were the problems faced by the 700 to 1,000 people who wanted to get that message to the Parliament of Australia. The Government must answer the question: What type of a rural community does it want? Does it want a family farm, or does it want the small family farm to go into liquidation and be bought by agricultural corporations? I was disappointed that I did not have the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the solutions that I think the Government should take on board-I ask Senator Collins to take this message back to Cabinet-relates to the family allowance, Austudy and the isolated children's allowance. From 1 January the family allowance assets test will be set at $300,000. Very few properties in rural Australia would be worth less than $300,000. If they were worth less than $300,000 they would not be viable. That family allowance also has an income test of $57,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It was pointed out that many children would have to leave school or tertiary education. The families would not be able to send their children to school. It was also pointed out that, whereas a farmer may make a conscious decision to earn his income from rural pursuits, his children should not be discriminated against. There are many farms that will have no income for the next three years and many farms that will have a negative income for the next three years. Those farms may be worth a lot of money but they will not produce any income. Those primary producers will have to tighten their belts; they will have to cut their costs and cut their suit according to the cloth. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers asked us to carry the message back to this place: `Please do not discriminate against our children; please give our children a fair go; please give our children the same rights and privileges as those given to every other child in Australia'. The isolated children's allowance will be asset tested at $200,000 reduced from $400,000 as from 1 January. Again, these people who require isolated children's allowance have no schools nearby to which they can send their children. They are forced into sending their children into hostels in the country towns or to boarding schools. Many children will have to be taken away from boarding school because the assets test limit will now be reduced to $200,000. That is excluding the family home on the farm. I have never been able to work out how to calculate the price of a home on a family farm. Senator Collins might be able to enlighten me. It would seem to me that the value would be only what the home was worth when putting it on a truck and re-establishing it on a block of land elsewhere in the town. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the assets test for Austudy has been reduced from $400,000 to $200,000. That is a real problem for children and young adults who are away at school, at universities and at tertiary institutions. Many farmers will have no income to pay school fees and expenses. I ask the Government to take into consideration the rural crisis at the moment. Children should not have to suffer and miss out on a basic education. I do not think that anyone in this Parliament would disagree with that. I will ask Senator Richardson-I put him on notice now-that if the opportunity arises and I receive the call during Question Time in the next week whether he will consider delaying the implementation of the assets test until people in rural Australia are in a better position to educate their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly give Senator Richardson notice of the question and I also expect Senator Collins to give him notice of it. I intend to ask Senator Richardson that question within the next day or two. As Senator Burns rightly acknowledged, there is a rural crisis. Surely all of those tests on Austudy, family support and the isolated children's allowance should be based on an income test, not on an assets test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Collins represents much of rural Australia. While he is elected by the voters who support the Labor Party, he would have a number of constituents facing similar crises, although Senator Collins is fortunate enough not to have any wheat or wool growers in his electorate. Maybe his constituents have not felt the full brunt of the rural crisis. As I have pointed out a number of times-I do it every time I have the opportunity-it is not just the broadacre farmers who are suffering now. The horticulturalists, the dairy farmers, the peanut farmers and the pineapple growers-every rural sector in Australia, perhaps with the exception of cotton and bananas-are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> In a spirit of cooperation I say to members of the Parliament of Australia that there is a great deal of concern, worry and tension facing rural Australia at the moment. I say to these people that times will change. Hopefully the wheat situation will turn around in the next year and wheat will bring a reasonable price. I bring this message from the Roma crisis meeting held last Saturday and I place it before the Parliament of Australia for us to take on board and hopefully to come up with some sort of solution for rural Australia. </PARA>

As you are no doubt aware, there was an overflow audience, and the concert was a very successful one. You also assisted the production further by lending me the old Speaker's wig in which I could play the role of the judge in Trial by Jury. I thank you for your courtesy in doing it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can lip-read. I want to mention though that this outstandingly successful concert was given without any Government subsidy whatsoever. The purpose was, of course, to be the last function here for National Arts Week and Canberra's Floriade Festival, and I am overjoyed on that score as well. It was a great success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it would be appropriate to congratulate-I can hardly congratulate myself-the other soloists, the chorus and orchestra of the Canberra City Opera under the leadership of David Parker, AM, and Marie Van Hove, who was the musical director of the concert. In particular, I would also like to express my gratitude and, I am certain, the gratitude of all of those who participated to the staff of the Joint House Department, and especially Mrs June Ey, who really worked far beyond the requirements of duty to help make this the outstanding success that it was. </PARA>
<PARA> I also should mention that Mr Harry Hall of the Sound and Vision Office and those who work for him also put in a great deal of effort to make this a success and I am grateful to them. I would also mention Mr Cleaver Elliott, who lent us his wig for one of the counsel for the plaintiff in Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention one other thing: that is, that I should apologise to Esso's Mr John Shubert and the Australian Opera's Mr Donald McDonald for my lack of courtesy in distributing dodgers about our free Sunday concert at their Friday night function in the Great Hall for the Australian Opera. It seemed to me that we had a great opportunity there. There were people there who obviously liked opera, so I zapped around and advised them of the upcoming free concert on Sunday. I hope that they will forgive me for doing that and that they will share our joy at the outstanding success of the Canberra City Opera's concert, which, like theirs, was aimed at bringing music to the people of Canberra. Perhaps it would be nice if we had a few more harmonious notes in this chamber as well, Mr President. </PARA>
