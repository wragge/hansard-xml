<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill cognately. I commence my remarks by speaking to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. I intend to speak only briefly on this matter as the Opposition supports this legislation. The Bill proposes to amend the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to entitle spouses of deceased members of the Defence Force to commute a portion of their pension. The Bill also proposes to index the fixed element of the children's and orphan's pensions to movements in the consumer price index (CPI).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1948, a child's pension is a composite fixed amount, which is currently $5,000 for the orphan's pension and $312 for other children. This element will index those fixed elements in accordance with the CPI from 1 July 1990. The Opposition has constantly pressed the Government to index these benefits. The orphans benefit was only recently raised, in October this year, from $702 to $5,000, bringing it up to date. It had been $702 for 18 long years. </PARA>
<PARA> The current legislation does not allow a surviving spouse of a Defence Force member to commute a portion of the pension payable to that spouse. This amendment in this legislation today provides the surviving spouse with that option. The amendment applies to the spouse of any contributor who dies on or after the date the amendment comes into operation. This will apply to the surviving spouses of any service members who die as a result of their posting to the Gulf. I am glad to see that both these anomalies will now be rectified. It was unjust for them to be allowed to continue for as long as they have. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of this Bill proposes to amend the Defence Act to exempt two Commonwealth owned companies, Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) and Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA), from paying capital gains tax to the Commonwealth for sale of assets that were acquired from the Commonwealth when the two companies were created. The Bill also proposes that the depreciation arrangements will be adjusted to allow ADI and ASTA to calculate depreciation on assets as though they had been depreciated for the period of time they were directly held by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the payment of capital gains tax is inappropriate, considering that the only significant change is the corporatisation of the management structure of Commonwealth-owned defence industries and that the creation of ADI and ASTA was intended to make these facilities better run and more profitable. We therefore support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. This Bill implements a number of initiatives announced by the Government in the last Budget as well as modifying important interpretive aspects of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The coalition is not opposed to the fundamentals of this piece of legislation. Indeed, we welcome a number of the changes, particularly those that have been taken directly from coalition policy. However, there are also a number of concerns, and I shall address these further today. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time there has been an inconsistency in the application of defence service home loan portability in that only those loans granted post-December 1987 were fully portable. Under the terms of this Bill, portability is being extended to all defence service home borrowers who had defence service home loans outstanding on 9 December 1987. This has been printed coalition policy since 1988. I am sure that the 140,000 eligible borrowers will be glad that the Government has at last implemented what the coalition has been promising for some time. The introduction of the availability of defence service home loans for assistance in meeting the cost of entry to a retirement village is also welcomed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There remain, however, a number of serious anomalies in the defence service home loan scheme. For example, unless very particular and limited circumstances prevail, an eligible person cannot be granted a defence service home loan to discharge his or her bank mortgage on an existing home. For a constituent of mine whose husband is dying of cancer, this means that she will have no option but to leave her current home to buy another in order to get access to a loan. In representations to the Minister on this very issue, it was indicated that the provision is necessary for purely financial, cost saving reasons. Yet that same constituent is eligible to turn around tomorrow and borrow the same amount if she wants to extend her home. But she cannot pay out her present mortgage so that she can afford to keep her current home when she is widowed. Now the sale signs are up outside that home while the husband lies dying. The wife knows that as soon as it is sold she, and perhaps her dying husband, will have to move into a new home in order to get access to a loan for which he is eligible and for which he could make immediate application if it were only to extend his home. It is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that this anomaly could not be addressed in this legislation because over 350,000 people could be in the position of being able to seek a defence service home loan to discharge their mortgage. Inquiries I have had conducted in the last few days indicate that this figure and the consequential financial impact estimates are wildly overstated. </PARA>
<PARA> This lack of rigorous research is symptomatic of the general approach of this Government. It is not interested in careful, in-depth investigation and discussion. It is not surprising, therefore, to see the Government, with the support of the Australian Democrats, gagging debate on all legislation before the Senate this week. Anomalies such as that which I have just highlighted cannot be fully addressed and debated in this atmosphere of gagged debate. It is bad enough to be gagging it in the House of Representatives, but traditionally the Senate has exercised its right to scrutinise legislation carefully clause by clause, and that is being prevented because of the time constraints today. The Government, because of its inept management of the flow of legislation coming into this chamber, has ensured that full and proper debate is stifled and many issues of importance-in this instance, issues of importance to hundreds of veterans and their families-are left unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The automatic granting of the war widow's pension to the widows of veterans who are in receipt of the extreme disablement adjustment is in line with similar provisions already existing for widows of totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners. One may well ask why the widows of intermediate rate pensioners were not included in this change. This is another anomaly which time constraints prevent us from pursuing further. </PARA>
<PARA> The indexation of allowances for certain disabled veterans is a logical extension of existing arrangements. These include recreation, transport, clothing and attendant allowances. The deeming provisions in this Bill, mirroring those found in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, have been the subject of much controversy. It was originally the Government's intention that a $2,000 threshold be applied to single pensioners and to married pensioner couples before interest of 10 per cent was deemed to be earned on money held in bank accounts or in cash. The Opposition expressed the concern that the $2,000 threshold would be unfair to a married couple. However, a drafting error in the legislation has apparently effectively set the threshold on deeming for married couples at $4,000. As a result of this, the Opposition does not intend to challenge that clause. </PARA>
<PARA> Also included in this Bill is the extension to members of the Australian Defence Force allotted for operational service in the Gulf of full repatriation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. That this should be necessary is sobering. Just when it might have been thought that the role of the Department of Veterans' Affairs would be entering a period of decline, we now find the need to extend veterans' entitlements to new operational areas. This should act as a warning to the Government, which is doing its utmost to shed its responsibilities to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also sobering to think that 20 years ago Australia was committing troops to Vietnam in the interests of all Australians and that those veterans are still today fighting for recognition and compensation for the effects of agent orange. We have to ensure that personnel returning from the Gulf are not fighting for their entitlements 20 years from now. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act so that the recent Federal Court interpretation of the phrase `allotted for duty' will no longer be applicable. This interpretation resulted in former defence personnel qualifying for benefits under this Act that they would otherwise not have been eligible for under the previous repatriation legislation. In association with this change has been a rounding down of dates for two operational areas relating to Malaysian service. These last two changes will together ensure that the precedent set by the two recent Federal Court cases will no longer be applicable. The Department has said that the changes were made to restore the original intention of the Act. Indeed, study of the repatriation legislation in force before the Veterans' Entitlements Act reveals that the rounding down of dates will bring them into line with what they were previously. However, it is not clear why the operational dates were extended, seemingly inappropriately, in the drafting of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The Government has not been able to provide an adequate explanation as to why this should have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides that the Minister has the authority to approve guidelines setting out the conditions under which a person can be considered to be suffering severe financial hardship in order to gain a defence service home loan for the purposes of discharging a mortgage or carrying out essential repairs. These guidelines have not yet been drafted and will not be a disallowable item. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that such guidelines not be used in any way to diminish the circumstances under which such assistance may be granted. They should be subjected to review and, if necessary, to disallowance. It is for this reason that, in the consideration of this Bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, the Opposition proposed an amendment that the guidelines be made a disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of guidelines being disallowable could not be any better illustrated than in the case of another set of guidelines associated with the Veterans' Entitlement Act currently before the Senate. The third edition to the Guide to the Assessment of the Rates of Veterans' Pensions has serious deficiencies which the Government is being forced to address only because the guide is disallowable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs the Government agreed to support the Opposition's amendment. I would now like to make sure that clauses 11, 12 and 14, which refer to the same guidelines, are modified in line with the amendment to clause 9. I intend to move amendments to effect that purpose during the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 82 of the Bill relates to the provision of tax file numbers. In the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, yet to be debated in the Senate, the Secretary to the Department is empowered to ask for tax file numbers from any person eligible for payment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Importantly, under that piece of legislation, any eligible person will also be required to provide the tax file number of his or her spouse. Clause 82 of this Bill addresses the widespread concern at the requirement for eligible persons to supply the tax file number of their spouses. Under this clause, the Secretary to the Department may waive the requirement for provision of the tax file number of an eligible person's spouse if he is satisfied that the person does not know that number and that it would be unreasonably difficult to obtain that number. This clause really forms part of the overall legislative framework for data matching, which is expected to be debated in the Senate later today. As I indicated earlier, the Opposition supports the essence of the legislation before us, the concerns highlighted above notwithstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish by referring to an important issue raised in representations to the Senate Standing Committee which considered this Bill-that is, the complexity of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Senator Tate indicated to that Committee that the Department will be producing a plain English rewrite of the legislation. It was suggested that this would be available some time in the next 12 months. The sooner that this occurs the better. As one witness familiar with repatriation legislation from around the world testified, the Australian repatriation system is one of the most complex in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As the bulk of our veterans population ages, every effort should be made to ensure stability, certainty and simplicity in the administration of veterans affairs. Sadly, we are seeing too many worrying and complex changes and a diminution of the caring approach which was available to veterans in the past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. The latter of those Bills, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), is constructive. It is essentially a machinery Bill which tidies up a number of anomalies and it has some very positive elements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill perhaps cannot be seen in quite as positive a light. It is important that we are clear about the climate that is out there in the veterans community. There is, unfortunately, a longstanding feeling of suspicion common among Australian veterans about what is happening to their entitlements and the attitude of governments towards them. Unfortunately, the Australian Democrats believe that to a degree this Bill reinforces that suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government attests that the proposed amendments inherent in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 implement Government election promises, give effect to Budget decisions and implement a range of other matters regarding the provision of benefits to veterans. All of this is obvious. However, what is not quite as obvious is that some of these amendments impact negatively upon entitlements that veterans already receive. </PARA>
<PARA> As I suggested, a very substantial portion of the veterans community is quite suspicious about what is happening in relation to their entitlements. I would like to cite some of the aspects of this legislation which tend unfortunately to reinforce that suspicion. The Democrats will be moving six amendments, four of which are directly at the request of veterans themselves, in an attempt to redress some of the negative features of this amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not openly admitted in any of its statements that this amending legislation will reduce benefits. I will cite some instances. Two other amendments will be moved simply to carry over into this legislation amendments in relation to deeming provisions that we attempted to introduce to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware of the fact that some recent Federal Court of Australia decisions impact upon veterans entitlements. Senator Newman referred to them. The Federal Court decision in the case of Doessel v. Davies, which overturned a longstanding interpretation of the words `allotted for duty', has now given benefits to Defence personnel who have never before been regarded by the Department of Defence-and, therefore, the Department of Veterans' Affairs-as having performed operational services and, therefore, attracting entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The term `allotted for duty' is a critical one. It is one which is very close to the hearts of many ex-servicemen because it determines whether they are entitled to wear medals and whether they can claim for a veterans entitlement. This critical decision of the Court has impacted generously and extended entitlement. This legislation contains amendments to immediately withdraw that entitlement. There are those in the community who will see that as being in line with what they regard as the approach that has been brought to bear in the general area of veterans entitlements over a period of some years. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the suspicion lies in the fact that, unfortunately, veterans, who hope that the Department of Veterans' Affairs would be their advocate, their ally and their friend, find themselves in a constant struggle to prove their case for entitlement before their own Department. In other words, they see it as the adversary. There is this dichotomy between the potential role of the Department being their advocate and the real role, which seems to be what they are constantly confronted with, namely, the Department actually being the adversary. This is inherently at the base of the suspicions which are out there and which are unfortunately reinforced by some aspects of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just referred to the significance of the court case which decided the meaning of the term `allotted for duty'. The court case, which went in favour of ex-servicemen, is now being reversed by this legislation. The number of individuals concerned is minimal. The veterans community has been fighting for this right for a long time. Now that it has been given the right by a judgment of the Federal Court, the Government is seeking to overturn that right and to reverse the implications and the outcome of that court decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman rightly cites the fact that a substantial number of the largest portion of veterans are now elderly. We are looking at the possibility that the number of people in the community affected by this legislation is reducing. Of course, we still have the Vietnam veterans who are desperately concerned about this trend of erosion of entitlement. Many of them are looking at another 30 years of life. Many of them have had their lifestyles dramatically impacted upon by the fact that they served in Vietnam. So they are keeping a very watchful and concerned eye upon what is happening to veterans entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Newman has correctly said, in the last few days we have seen the return of another group of servicemen who should have, and will have, entitlements under the veterans entitlement legislation. They join the Vietnam veterans. One would imagine, history being what it is, that a continuing group of Australian citizens, who have served their nation in war or in the preservation of peace, will have entitlements as veterans. Therefore, monitoring and constant vigilance will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman also said that the legislation is extremely complex. It will unfortunately remain so because the pieces have been put in place. We have special obligations as law-makers to monitor very closely what comes before us. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have foreshadowed, the Democrats will be moving six amendments: four specifically at the request of the veterans community to reverse some of the negative impacts of this legislation upon their entitlements and two which simply reflect the logical flowing across from social security legislation into the areas of veterans entitlements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Government welcomes the support indicated by the Opposition in respect of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) of 1990; it is important legislation which has the effect of providing for spouses a very particular benefit. Commutation for spouses of the pension entitlements will generally be available from the date of commencement of the legislation and officers advise me that they expect that that can be done rather speedily as soon as the matter is passed through the Parliament. However, there is special provision to ensure that, in the unfortunate event of any casualties in the Persian Gulf deployment prior to the commencement of the amendment, a surviving spouse will also be eligible for commutation. I believe that that is an important matter to note.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators will know, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Review Committee recommended that spouses be provided with the option to commute a portion of their pension entitlement-that is, the equivalent of two years of their former spouse's salary for pension purposes at the time of death-to a lump sum. It also recommended that the fixed rate elements of children's and orphans' benefits-$312 and $5,000 respectively-be indexed to movements in the consumer price index. The Government has accepted those recommendations and they form the basis of this part of the Bill. It is not surprising therefore that this part of the Bill has gathered the support of all those in the chamber. I thank honourable senators for their support as it will ensure the speedy passage of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill has been the subject of considerable discussion by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs at a very fruitful and constructive meeting of that Committee. I will mention, for the sake of those who are listening, some of the main features of the legislation which make it so important. For example, and once again keeping in mind the very dangerous situation in the Middle East and the jeopardy which Defence Force personnel who have been deployed for operational service are in, it is important to note that under this Bill, and in providing certain repatriation benefits, the Government recognises that Australian Defence Force personnel deployed for operational service in the Middle East face a very real danger as a result of that service. The Government has decided therefore that all Australian Defence Force personnel allotted for operational service in the Middle East, including those deployed with United States or United Kingdom units, will be regarded as being on operational service once they reach the operational area. Until such time as they reach the operational area they will be regarded as being on hazardous service. This will ensure that they receive the benefit of the more generous standard of proof in determining eligibility for compensation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> With the introduction of these amendments, eligible personnel will have access to disability pensions on the same generous standard of proof basis as war veterans. They will qualify for service pension and thus have entitlement to the equivalent of the age pension benefits five years earlier than others, as do war veterans. They will be eligible for repatriation medical treatment and associated benefits on the same basis as war veterans. Those service personnel who enlisted in the Australian Defence Force on or before 14 May 1985 will have access to subsidised low interest housing loans, insurance and other housing benefits under the Defence Service Homes Act. Those who enlisted after that date will be entitled to housing ownership assistance under the Australian Defence Force home loans assistance scheme to be implemented early in 1991. Finally, in the event of a member's service resulting in severe or fatal injury or disease, cover under the Act will also be available to that member's dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those matters just to emphasise the very real measures which the Government is taking in a way which anticipates the worst case, while, of course, it remains hopeful that terrible conflict, with resultant injury and death, can be avoided in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also changes to ensure a more equitable distribution of benefits to veterans and dependants. These include, for example, an increase in the rent assistance threshold by $10 a fortnight to $50 a fortnight from March 1991 for both single pensioners and pensioner couples to ensure that the level of rent assistance more realistically reflects the current level of housing costs. There is also an increase in the rates and automatic indexation of a range of benefits and allowances for severely disabled veterans, including allowance for specific injuries and disabilities, recreation and transport allowance, and clothing allowance. The rates of these allowances will be increased and, I believe, then indexed to reflect movements in the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of what were, as I say, very fruitful and constructive discussions held during the Committee hearings, I indicated that the Government was prepared to accede to the request by the Opposition that certain guidelines be made disallowable instruments. Quite clearly, it is very useful and in accordance with the general role of this chamber that guidelines of importance which can affect the entitlements of Australian citizens-in this case, veterans-ought to be disallowable. In other words, they are laid before each House of the Parliament, and within 15 sitting days of that being done the proposed guidelines could be subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills commented on the fact that the guidelines were not subject to disallowance. The Government, as always, has taken into account the report of the Committee because it believes that the sorts of principles and criteria used by that committee are such that they tend to remind governments occasionally of the need to provide for parliamentary scrutiny of guidelines which can have such an impact on those who benefit from legislative provisions. I believe that in this particular case, where guidelines set out the matters to be taken into account in deciding whether a person is suffering either financial or severe financial hardship, matters such as those are eminently suitable for the disallowance type procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the Committee hearings there was also comment about income from certain moneys being deemed to attract a particular interest rate. I think in the legislation the rate was set at 10 per cent per annum for the purposes of the income test. A couple of issues were raised in the Committee hearing in relation to this. One concerned the way in which the legislation was drafted so that, as drafted, a $2,000 threshold would apply to a single person and married couples would be allowed $2,000 for each person before any interest was deemed to have been received. In the Committee hearing I reserved the position of the Government in relation to that matter. On maturer reflection, the Government has decided to allow the draft provisions to stand and I will not be moving any amendment, as I foreshadowed, in relation to those threshold amounts. That is, a married couple can have a total of $4,000 before any interest is deemed to have been received for the purposes of the deeming provision. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also considerable discussion at the Committee hearing about the 10 per cent interest rate. Given the constant fluctuation of interest rates, it was nevertheless noted that the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, gave an undertaking that that rate would be reviewed before the provision commences operation in March of next year. I think in the Committee discussion it was thought that, given the considerable volatility and fluctuations that are occurring week by week, it is sensible that the Committee itself not try to establish a different rate; rather, the undertaking by Senator Richardson should be relied upon in order to set a realistic rate before the provision commences operation in March of next year.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the work of the Committee was very useful and I believe the second reading debate indicates that, on the whole, this legislation deserves the support the chamber. I commend the second readings of the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA>As the Minister said in his second reading speech, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs discussed the guidelines becoming disallowable instruments. The Opposition was concerned that the Bill as drafted did not provide for guidelines for assessing hardship that were disallowable and, as the Minister quite properly spelt out, that is not in the best interests of the citizen for the protection of his or her rights. So the Opposition proposed in the Committee that the Bill be amended to allow the guidelines to be made disallowable. However, since the Committee reported, it has been found that three other clauses, which come after clause 9, also refer to the guidelines. They are the same guidelines and I propose that the Opposition amendments to clauses 9, 11, 12 and 14 already circulated in the chamber be taken together. </PARA>

I am sure they would survive any such scrutiny but it is a useful reminder of the fact that the exercise of considerable power by Ministers ought to be subject to parliamentary debate if necessary with the final sanction of disallowance.

<PARA> (4) Clause 54, page 29, subclause (1), proposed subsection 50c after the definition of (1) ``deposit money'', insert the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `exempt organisation' means an institution, society, association, club or other organisation, the income of which is exempt from tax under section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and which provides aged care or welfare services as its principal activity;''. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Clause 54, page 30, subclause (1), proposed subsection 50c (1), at end of the definition of ``income money'', add ``, but does not include money given to or deposited with, an exempt organisation on terms that it be repaid, either on demand, on notice or otherwise, whether or not interest is payable on the money.''</PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment simply carries over into the context of this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill an unsuccessful attempt to amend also the Social Security Act, which would have been generous in terms of its interpretation of any impact of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in defining exempt organisations. Under the provision of that Act, an exempt organisation means an institution, society, association, club or other organisation the income of which is exempt from tax under section 23 of the Act and which provides aged care or welfare services as its principal activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsequent amendment to clause 54 (1) on page 34 is simply a consequence upon our attempt to interpret that definition more generously so as to allow that exemption to veterans organisations that provide aged care and welfare services. If the intention of the Government is to provide the most generous forms of entitlement, care and service to veterans, it is not unreasonable to exempt the organisations within the veterans community itself which provide aged care and welfare services from a tax imposition, the generous exemption from which applies to other organisations. So this is simply an attempt to provide veterans organisations with an exemption from an income tax impact which frankly we see as being unnecessary and inappropriate. </PARA>

As part of the need to ensure operational service applies only to those who served in an area at a time when it was operational for Australian Defence Force purposes, amendments are also being made to ensure that the commencing and closing dates of operational service for each of the items in schedule 2 reflect the actual period of conflict.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us six Bills relating to education, affecting a wide range of educational issues. The Opposition condemns the Government for the way it is managing education in this country at the higher education level, the technical and further education (TAFE) level and the schools level. In particular, it has bungled the program of overseas student participation in our education system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Accordingly, today we are faced with two Bills which are to repair the bungles that this Government has brought upon the overseas students of Australia. One Bill is totally intolerable and a disgrace because it will, by Government decision-if this Parliament agrees to it-force compulsory student unionism on the higher education institutions of this country. The Opposition is totally opposed to it. The three remaining Bills provide thousands of millions of dollars in the normal way-that is, from the Commonwealth-for the provision of all the costs of our higher education, TAFE and schools. </PARA>
<PARA> A wide range of education issues is included in each of the six Bills. My first observation is that in past years we have had two sets of education funding Bills in each year. In the Budget sitting we would deal with the major provision of funds for the following year, and in the autumn session we would consider supplementary funding Bills which would top up grants in accordance with whatever supplementation policy applied. This year the two are combined so that we get supplementation for this year and new provision for next year-in fact, at the end of the triennium in some cases-occurring at the same time. This means, of course, that we have one opportunity for debate in this Senate and, indeed, in the House of Representatives on the Government's education legislation instead of the usual two. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives there was a guillotine and there was not even time for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to reply to the speeches that the members of the House of Representatives gave. Here in this Senate-let the Australian public know-there is a guillotine whereby there are only two hours to discuss these six important Bills that affect education throughout the country. We will have to be self-disciplined in order to allow the Minister to respond and give answers to those matters about which we are still seeking replies. </PARA>
<PARA> I am critical that we are limited not only by guillotines in the debate on these Bills, but also by the actual occasions for there to be an education debate in the Parliament being reduced. Nonetheless, it is deplorable that we are so restricted. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get on with it. I turn, firstly, to the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1990. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill for it serves to set fees and needs for those students who are still covered by the former policy of the subsidised overseas students scheme. However, it is important to note that in this area the Government has been guilty of a significant breach of faith towards education institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Government announced in December 1988 that the subsidised program was being replaced with a new full fee and scholarships program, the Ministers making the announcement-Mr Dawkins and Senator Evans-said that institutions would not be hurt financially by the change. Overseas students would no longer be counted as part of an institution's student load, but the Government then claimed that the funding lost by this change would be made up by the scholarships awarded to overseas students attending these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Less than two years later, the Government has broken its word. The scholarships scheme is short-changing the institutions. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has estimated the shortfall to be $1.7m in 1990, $8.2m in 1991 and $8.3m in 1992. It is little wonder that the Vice-Chancellors Committee described itself as incensed by this breach of faith. What will the Government be doing about honouring its promise?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn, secondly, to the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill 1990. This is the Government's attempt to pick up the broken pieces from its own policy disaster. There has been a massive growth in the education export industry in recent years. If this were well handled and soundly administered it would have the potential to be of great benefit to Australia and, of course, to the other countries-especially in our near region-from which the overseas students come. However, as things have turned out, the Government's maladministration has not brought this full benefit and, at the same time, this has become a disaster area for Australia's reputation overseas. The Minister has failed to foresee the problems that would arise and failed to act promptly when problems did start to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition spokesmen have been consistently critical of the mismanagement of the Government. The Government failed to provide a proper framework within which the industry could grow. The Minister has failed to establish a process for the provision of visas and the policing of compliance with visa conditions. The failure to establish a framework for the proper vetting of visa applications until after June last year resulted in some students entering the country under false pretences. The failure to ensure visa compliance resulted in some students remaining in Australia illegally. </PARA>
<PARA> The belated attempts to remedy the problems resulted in significant visa rejection rates for students who had already prepaid their fees. Hence the need now for the Government to make this provision for repayments, for the tightening up-when it eventually came-came at a time when not all institutions were in a position to refund the moneys to those applicants who were refused visas. The process is that overseas students had to pay the money with their applications ahead of time, and institutions in financial difficulties are not able to refund the moneys, so the Government now, through all this mismanagement, has to have this legislation to pick up the pieces. This legislation, which will require the Australian taxpayers to reimburse students for their lost fees, is an admission by the Government that its own policy changes led to the losses. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to one clause in particular, clause 5, which raises a concern with regard to information collection. I refer to the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5 of the Bill empowers the Secretary (or an officer authorised in writing) to issue notices to an educational institution (or its agent) requiring them to supply ``particulars''--</PARA>
<PARA>What does `particulars' mean? That is what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is concerned about. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>of overseas students enrolled at the institution. This may be considered to involve a breach of students' privacy, as there is no indication of the kinds of information covered by ``particulars'' or the uses to which such information could be put. Though there is no formal requirement to do so, the Committee also notes that neither the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill nor the Minister's Second Reading speech refer to the Privacy Commissioner having been consulted on this matter. The Committee draws Senators' attention to the clause as it may trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1 (a) (i) of the Committee's terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust that the Minister, Senator Bolkus, in responding to the debate, will explain more clearly the Government's position on this clause. I hope there will be a Minister's reply to the debate. As I said earlier, there was not any Minister's reply to the debate on these Bills in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> I make one other reference to clause 5; that is, to observe that clause 5 (1) requires institutions to respond to requests for information within 14 days. This is potentially unsatisfactory as there is no correlation between the amount of information requested and the amount of time provided to satisfy the request. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has a reputation for demanding detailed and complex information from institutions. It may well be that 14 days is too short a time. There is a discretion for the period to be longer than 14 days, and I hope that that discretion will be used wherever appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of this problem is the situation of students already in Australia who have been denied access to moneys paid by them-their own money-before they arrived in Australia for living allowance purposes. The Government has said that it will give a refund to cover the outstanding living allowance payments to such students where the institutions in which they are enrolled have closed down. I support such payments because it is Australia keeping good faith with these students. What is not clear to me is exactly what the Government is doing where institutions are in difficulty but have not reached the point of closing their doors, yet they have not the cash flow to actually give the living allowances received from overseas students as prepayments back to those students while they are undertaking courses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum states that institutions that seem able to trade their way out of their difficulties may receive some short term assistance. I ask Senator Bolkus for a more detailed picture of what that assistance will be. What is the maximum amount envisaged? Will any interest be paid on any loans at a market rate or some lesser concessional rate? Will the assistance be made available speedily in cases where it is needed to pay outstanding amounts of living allowance to students?</PARA>
<PARA> My concern is chiefly for the students. After all, it is preposterous that the Government requires prior payment of living allowances, but has not made any provision for that money to be paid into a trust account so that it is safeguarded for return to those students for living allowance purposes when they are in Australia. A number of cases have been directly brought to my attention where students are suffering as a result of that problem. Imagine students at the University of New South Wales who have prepaid their living allowance-it is their money. Then they find that the institution-it would not be the case with the University of New South Wales, but it may be with some private institutions-is in financial difficulty and says, `Sorry, we can't give you your own money'. I believe that the scheme needs to be extended for institutions that have closed down, so that there is no failure of good faith on Australia's part. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the basic answer to this problem is that there needs to be these trust funds. The Government has given notice of legislation which will require such trust funds for these payments in the future. But this is required under separate legislation for regulating the education export industry. However, the Government has botched the job of drafting even that legislation. It was done in a hurry without adequate consultation with the States, institutions or student representative organisations, and as a result there have been numerous objections to it in its draft form. The Minister has now agreed to start consulting-hooray! So the legislation, which should have been in better shape through consultation in the first place, is not now before us. This means that the Bill will not be debated by the Senate before Christmas but will be held over until the new year. This is a Bill which, when it was introduced this year, the Minister claimed was very urgent. Of course it is urgent and this Government is not administering itself properly. On behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion add: ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>deplores the Government's mismanagement of the education export industry''. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1990. This is a most shameful piece of legislation. It denies choice, it is against freedom of association and it is grossly hypocritical on the Government's part to boot. It should be thrown out root and branch. Even now I appeal to the Australian Democrats to join with the Opposition in throwing out this shameful piece of government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government wants this Parliament to legislate to restrict freedom of choice for students when we should be legislating to enhance and entrench freedom of choice. The Bill supports compulsory student unionism in our higher education institutions. Indeed, it goes to the lengths of using the Commonwealth's pre-eminent position in the funding of higher education to thwart any State government that wishes to act to ensure freedom of choice for students. That this Government or any government should act to enforce compulsion in this matter is deeply offensive to the Opposition, and also the public, in philosophical terms and in practice. Students should have a free and unfettered choice as to whether they join the student union at their institution. It is as simple as that. Individual students should decide whether they wish to join a union and get the benefits that may derive from membership of it-the use of its facilities, the concessions it arranges and so on. Students should be free to decide whether it will be worth while for them to join. The obligation should be on student unions to market themselves effectively to students to persuade them that it is worth while joining. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a directly political aspect to this matter. The left wing Ministers, Mr Dawkins, Mr Baldwin and Senator Bolkus, understand the politics of this matter. They know that student unions have tended, except in some glorious years, to be controlled by the Left. The funds of student unions have been applied not merely to provide facilities on campus but to achieve political objectives that benefit the Left of politics in this country. This is why this Labor Government is bringing this Bill forward. It sees advantages for its own political cause in having its political allies on campuses being able to use student union funds by a sort of monopoly power without having to do any work for them-to use them as a slush fund for political purposes to help this Government. Maybe it will backfire on the Government and in fact will help opponents of the Government who are even further to the Left than the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not just this political application that concerns us. We are deeply offended by this legislation. It is against the philosophy of the Liberal and National parties and so we reject it in principle. Students' academic careers should not be dependent upon their membership of a student union; yet that is the current position. There have been suggestions from time to time that State governments, under whose legislation most higher education institutions are in fact established, may move to insist on voluntary student unionism under that legislation. That is not happening anywhere as yet, but the mere thought of it has alarmed the Government and the student Left, and so the Federal Government has bought into the issue with this Bill. More than that, I make it clear that if the Bill is passed at this time it will be repealed by us when we return to office. Our policy is that Federal legislation should be on the side of liberty and should insist that there be voluntary student unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has argued for this Bill in terms of the autonomy of educational institutions. What hypocrisy! This is a sad joke when we consider the huge extent of heavy-handed and centralist intervention in the running of institutions in which Mr Dawkins indulges. In any case, when it comes to individual rights and freedoms it is not satisfactory to say that autonomy means that institutions have the right to impose this form of compulsion on their students. I do not doubt that educational administrators who like a quiet life can be found to support compulsory student unionism, but I would argue that their convenience is hardly a satisfactory basis for policy. The issue of freedom of choice is so fundamental that it should not be left to institutions to decide upon. It is entirely reasonable for State governments to legislate to insist upon it and it is quite wrong for this Federal Government to try to stop them doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate we have already had some debate on these issues when the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990 was before us last week. Clause 12 of that Bill was related to this higher education Bill. I and other members of the Opposition spelt out then our objections to compulsory student unionism, and we repeat all of those objections today. I press on to the fourth Bill, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we totally reject it. I now turn to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill is in large measure a routine Bill, for it provides the funding for higher education institutions for 1993 and also provides supplementation funding for 1990, 1991 and 1992. This is as we would expect. The Bill simply continues the policy framework for higher education funding which has already been established, but it provides for a set of policies of which I and the Opposition generally have long been very critical. We reject the way that this Government is handling higher education. We will do it differently and better, and we long for the day of our election when we can start to put our policies into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins has given us a higher education system that is centralised and, with all due respect to the officers present, bureaucratised. This is a criticism which can be levelled at the style of operation of a Labor government. It impinges far too greatly on those decisions about the setting of institutions' own priorities which are best left to individual institutions to make. For example, Mr Dawkins's elaborate requirements for institutional profiles to be negotiated with his Department have been a mechanism for putting into the Government's hands a whole range of highly significant decisions about the structure and operations of all of our higher education institutions. These mechanisms require that institutions provide massive amounts of information to the Department-requirements which have proved to be a major administrative burden. Many institutions have complained that the conditions formulated as part of the profiles process are almost impossible to comply with and have resulted in even greater losses of their own per capita funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies flowing from the infamous White Paper of the Hawke-Keating-Dawkins Labor Government have forced institutions into amalgamations in which they would not have chosen to participate if they had been left to their own educational judgments and initiatives. Amalgamations have occurred under financial pressure from the Government rather than for justifiable educational reasons. We are reminded of this when we look at clause 4 of this Bill which, because of amalgamations, revises the list of institutions funded by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Most recently, we have the direct example of this Government's coercive attitude in the funding of higher education institutions in Victoria. Because the Victorian institutions have not proceeded to amalgamate with each other in the way or at the speed that Canberra wants, the Dawkins-Baldwin Labor Government and bureaucracy here in Canberra have announced future funding details for higher education, not in terms of individual allocations for Victorian institutions for 1992 and 1993 but set out in global amounts, pending the Government-forced amalgamations. We have already seen this happen to South Australia. The Government wants to coerce institutions into behaving as the Government wishes and it is using direct threats of funding as a means to achieve this. This interference policy, this policy of coercion, is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major problem is the education advisory mechanism to the Minister. The National Board of Employment, Education and Training structure, including the four councils under NBEET, places these advising bodies in the departmental structure rather than, as in the past, allowing them a sufficient independence and a demonstrated separate integrity. NBEET and its councils depend on departmental officials for their administrative support, a symbol of how they are too close to the Department to best serve Australian education. </PARA>
<PARA> The public perception of NBEET and the education councils is that they appear to be nobbled by the Minister, but their true role is to consult with all education interests and expertise and to present-as much to the Minister as to the Parliament-independent advice which is open and sound and which demonstrates an independent integrity. The only way to achieve this now is with a change of government. In the meantime, this side of the House encourages NBEET and the councils to do their best to become independent and sound in their advice to this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia continues to have a problem of unmet demand, estimated for 1990 as being somewhere between 13,500 and 20,100 potential students. That is 20,000 students who want to go to higher education institutions, our universities, and who are denied that opportunity. Of particular concern is that that unmet demand is the same this year as it was last year and not very different from the year before. Officials indicated in Estimates committee hearings that the number of new places to be offered in 1993 would be approximately 3,000. There is a pattern of steady decline in the number of new places being funded each year since 1989. There were 6,500 new places in 1989; 5,800 in 1990; and there will be 4,800 in 1991; 4,000 in 1992; and 3,000 in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also increases the rate of repayment for students who are paying their higher education contribution on a deferred basis. The repayment levels, which were previously one, 2 and 3 per cent of income, depending on income level, are all to be increased by one per cent to 2, 3 and 4 per cent. The nature of Labor's higher education contribution scheme requires students to make long term financial decisions, but they can hardly plan such decisions if the Government suddenly changes the arrangements and increases the repayment rate. On behalf of the Opposition, I therefore move as an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) deplores the Government's mismanagement of higher education and its failure to establish a satisfactory framework for the development of an internationally competitive higher education sector; and</PARA>

<PARA> (viii) failure to undertake any meaningful assessment of the impact of its policies on the higher education section''. </PARA>
<PARA>I have two Bills yet to refer to and I notice that I have only three minutes remaining. The States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill gives us an opportunity to reflect on the present state of the TAFE sector. This is timely, since the Deveson report has been released quite recently. Our thinking is hardly helped by a particularly thin second reading speech from the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus). It contains only two substantive paragraphs, each of them consisting of only one sentence. We deplore this Government's lack of accountability to this Parliament about TAFE or about any of these education issues. The second reading speech completely fails to provide us with any assessment of the framework surrounding the funding that this Bill provides. Because of the shortage of time, I ask that the remainder of my remarks on the TAFE Bill be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In its policy for TAFE, as elsewhere in education, the Commonwealth has been overly bureaucratic and centralist. A recent report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training observed that there has been a trend for resource agreement commitments to become increasingly numerous and complex over time. It also noted the concern on the part of the States and Territories that such agreements often fail to account for regional factors. With respect to the complexity of the resource agreements, a second report of NBEET noted that this trend had worsened with respect to objectives suggested for 1991. As in the school and tertiary education sectors, the Commonwealth's demands for information have been criticised. The NBEET report described the Commonwealths demands in this area as excessive and inappropriate. As well, this report noted that the Commonwealth's demands tend to focus on quantitative as opposed to qualitative indicators. This criticism of the objectives and indicators as `excessive' was repeated in the second NBEET report. The NBEET report noted that there is little evidence of follow-up by the Commonwealth where commitments are not met by the States and Territories and several Commonwealth priority areas are poorly reported on. The second NBEET report also criticised the lack of information given to the States and territories about the final allocation of grants. This has created a perception that the Commonwealth is playing TAFE systems off against each other. </PARA>
<PARA> Into this far from satisfactory situation of present arrangements has come the Deveson report. While the Opposition naturally does not commit itself to endorsing every single recommendation in that report, we do very much welcome its general thrust, and we see it as a most important document in enabling governments to chart a clearer course ahead for the development of training in our economy. The Opposition has long been calling for a more responsive and flexible TAFE sector. We therefore are pleased to see that report's urging of a market-responsive TAFE system. A significant barrier to this has been ill-conceived Commonwealth regulation, which has led to a confusing array of fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to a significant development, which Deveson refers to, and that is the increasing significance of private sector training in the total training effort of this country. Governments must take full account of this, and ensure that the regulatory framework in no way impedes that development but, rather, aids and enhances it. This presents the TAFE sector with a challenge, and it may need to reorient its approach in the future. In this regard I note that Deveson recommends that TAFE should move more towards support and development of in-house training activities and provide less direct training itself. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Opposition I move as an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of motion add: ``,but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) deplores the Government's:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) imposition of increasingly numerous and complex goals on the TAFE sector; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) imposition of performance indicators which are in some instances excessive and inappropriate or counter-productive; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) calls on the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to review the whole range of excessive regulatory demands it has placed on the TAFE sector and instead pursue the establishment of open and flexible training markets;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in particular, not only to widen the financial flexibility of the TAFE sector but also to provide significant autonomy in staffing matters so as to encourage the development of a TAFE sector which is flexible, competitive and responsive to consumer demand''. </PARA>
<PARA> The final one of these six Bills is the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill. Its major purpose is to provide supplementary funding for 1990 and new funding for 1991 to the schools sector from the Commonwealth. As well, it makes some relatively minor changes to the structure of the funded programs. The Minister's speech refers to these items, and I will not repeat the detail of them. I refer to clause 21 of the Bill. Again, I can either seek leave to have five more minutes to complete my speech or I can, inadequately, incorporate some material. I ask for an extension of five minutes. (Extension of time granted)</PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Senate. I wish to refer in particular to clause 21 of the Bill, which seeks to insert a new part VIIb into the Act to allow the Commonwealth to make grants to cover extra expenditure made necessary through award restructuring. Schedule 19 tells us that $50m is provided for this purpose in 1990-1991. I ask the Government how it determined that figure, which seems a pretty arbitrary one. Can the Minister tell us how this will be administered? What will be the allocation between government and non-government schools? What proportion of salary cost increases are expected to be met by the Commonwealth under this program? How will the Government use the mechanism provided by the requirement for schools and school systems to enter into agreements with the Commonwealth if they are to benefit from this scheme? Will this simply be another opportunity for the Commonwealth to interfere in the detail of the running of our schools, when there is no real need for it to do so?</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Opposition has difficulty arising from the expression `complying with an approved award', which occurs in the proposed new subsection 40f (2). This difficulty arises because schools which have been exempted from the award but which follow the award in setting salary rates for staff may not fall within such a provision. Compliance implies a legal obligation and, being exempt from the award, such a legal obligation cannot be said to exist for some schools. There exist many non-systemic, non-government schools which are in fact exempt from the award. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been further informed that it is not unusual for such schools nonetheless to set their salary rates in a manner consistent with the award. So the Opposition believes it would not be fair for such schools to miss out on government assistance for award restructuring merely because they cannot be said to be complying. The Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, is aware that we have had discussions. As a result of these discussions, a proposed amendment on the Opposition's part that we believe would have solved the difficulty has been withdrawn because we will accept a committee stage Government amendment to achieve the purposes to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not change the central elements of the Government's schools policies. These policies have received a good deal of criticism from the Opposition, and the Government shows no sign of significantly adjusting its approach to meet those criticisms. I seek leave to have the remainder of my remarks on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>For example, there is a very great deal of concern in the Australian community about the standards of the education our school students are receiving. There is no constructive recognition of this community concern on the part of this Government. The Opposition has in its policy spoken of the need to have a national standards monitoring program. We believe that the community has good reason to be concerned about education standards, and community debate will be greatly assisted if there is available much more information about the standards being achieved by students. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence the need for programs that will monitor this in some detail. Unfortunately the Minister for Employment, Education and Training shows no serious interest in acting on this point. He should reject the advice that he is getting from those administrators and educationalists who are complacent about standards or who blandly try to assure us that all is well in our schools. Standards do matter, the wider community is concerned about them, and I say to the Government that it should face up to this, as the Opposition has long been urging. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Commonwealth shows no signs of backing away from the unwarranted intrusiveness of its complex programs for funding non-government schools. Its so-called ``new schools'' policy, which in fact seeks to minimise the number of new non-government schools opening, is a good example of this. This policy and the unduly intrusive accountability provisions for non-government schools will go, under the next coalition government. And the funding categories for non-government schools will be significantly simplified. The announcement by the Minister during the election campaign and reiterated by him in November of his plans for post-1992 funding arrangements does not meet the Opposition's criticisms on these points at all. The Government needs to reverse its present inclinations and instead adopt education policies that nurture diversity and excellence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is addressing a package of six education Bills: the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill, the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill. Yet again the Government has left the education debate until the end of the session. We had a few histrionics at the beginning of the debate when Senator Teague treated us to a couple of minutes of unnecessary, repetitive verbiage about the time that has been devoted to this debate. I find that strange when we needed to grant an extension of time at the end, and strange also with regard to the fact that the debate has already had its parameters drawn. We are all well aware of what this debate is about, as the issues have been flagged for some decades. In addition, other speakers for the coalition have simply not fronted. Probably they have worked out that they have nothing left to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I begin by addressing the controversial Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. While this Bill is an undisguised threat to any State which would obstruct the collection of fees for a student association, the Australian Democrats do not accept the Government's justification for it in terms of institutional autonomy. Institutional autonomy is a fine sounding phrase, but the most important aspect of that phrase is that it is academic institutional autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not share the coalition's abhorrence of centralism. There are some good aspects of national policies, particularly, for example, in respect of national consistency regarding students' rights and obligations, Austudy provisions, and the quality of instruction which people would expect to have available to them at tertiary institutions. So centralism or a national consistency is not per se a real concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Institutional autonomy in the area of the particular curriculum provided and perhaps even the fee structure which is justified by that curriculum is certainly something which should be preserved. In the use of that phrase we should not confuse the opportunity for students to be guaranteed national consistency of their rights and obligations with institutional autonomy. The Democrats believe that all students should be required to pay a services and amenities fee. The level of that can be determined by the institution concerned. That is autonomy. The cafeteria at Monash University versus the cafeteria at the University of New England can vary as the campuses decide. There is no need for a heavy handed bureaucracy to oversee those areas. There can be some degree of autonomy in the areas that I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> There need not be an objection to a national consistency regarding students' rights and obligations. No student should be compelled to be a member of any association as a result of enrolling at a tertiary institution. These principles are distinct from the misplaced interpretation this Government has of `institutional autonomy'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of academic freedom, it is disappointing that funding for higher education is at the moment inadequate and research projects remain heavily prescribed. Education and access to it continue to be compromised by this Government while it concerns itself with this contrived and transparent Bill, which needs to be associated with what I believe is an unassociated Bill concerning States' grants to bring about the philosophical attachment which this Government has towards compulsory student unionism. I foreshadow an amendment to this Bill in the committee stage which would ensure that each student has the opportunity to choose whether or not to become a member of any student association. </PARA>
<PARA> Students who declined membership would still have to pay the full student services fee. This money would support all the other services and amenities but would not be used for the benefit of any association. This ensures that students who do not wish to join the student association, for example, do not join or subsidise activities that they object to. </PARA>
<PARA> Our position here recognises that many institutions have, in fact, failed to provide a fair and proper clause for giving students the right to decide on membership. It is commonly referred to as the conscientious objection clause, which is not consistent across the nation. Currently about 60 per cent of institutions have some opting out provisions, and the grounds for so-called conscientious objection under those sorts of procedures are usually limited to religious or cultural grounds. The students are in many cases not informed of this right and it may be granted at the institution's discretion rather than as an automatic right. Some institutions even support an additional charge upon their students for exercising that right. In these circumstances at the moment, the students' money still goes through to the student association, except in some cases-very few cases, I might add-where it is directed towards a nominated charity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) drew an analogy between living in a city and being represented by a local government body. Quite frankly, that analogy fails because living in a city does not oblige residents to join any association or union. One can easily dissociate oneself from the political activities of a city council. Residents are not required to join a residents union before settling in a particular city. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's use of this analogy merely illustrates to me that he does not really understand the dynamics of campus life. He may see it as equitable that a young person be required to join a student union before that person pursues academic studies; I do not. I see no relationship between the union and the academic studies. The provision of amenities may or may not be associated with student unions; it might be associated with some other sort of association. Student unions may have provided considerable amenities at a particular campus. But in other cases, amenities may have resulted from bequests or actions of organisations. Amenities may have been provided by the administration of the university. It is fair and proper that all users should pay for the use of whatever amenities are on site. It is not proper that any student should be coerced into becoming a member of any association, whether that be medieval German poetry readers or the political union of students. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not share Senator Teague's paranoia about student unions mainly being to the political left. That is irrelevant. Whatever the student unions are-whether they are off to the right, off to the left or up in the sky-is irrelevant. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government would be advised to drop this legislation on the basis of the amendment which I hereby foreshadow. Our proposal will preserve the ability of institutions to determine fees-whatever they may be-for student services. However, the institutions must respect the right of every student to choose whether to become a member of any association which may or may not be on campus. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to this Government's appalling treatment of overseas students. While our course fees are comparatively reasonable, students coming to Australia are subjected to a multitude of charges, including increased visa processing and medical charges. Struggling students who may arrive here not necessarily knowing much of the infrastructure of our society, what is expected and what the level of fee payments for all sorts of services is, often are even ineligible for transport and other concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is incredible if we compare Australia's treatment of tourists who come here for two or three weeks with the treatment of and our attitude towards overseas students who come here, pay us for the education services which we sell them and also contribute quite extensively to our economy. In fact, I think these students put more into our economy than they take out-and here I am talking about the cost of food, accommodation, transport and so on. Yet, we still do not seem to recognise those aspects. We are making it difficult for these students even to enter Australian society let alone participate in it and gain whatever they can from it. I speak of these matters from some experience, having been involved with some students from a couple of overseas countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I was at one stage. I did learn a little bit in the past but recently I have had direct personal contact with students from overseas countries. My personal contact was mainly initiated because I was frustrated at seeing how little infrastructure support our Government provides for these students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's confused and contradictory policies in the area of education export, as well as in the area of immigration, have damaged Australia's international reputation. I do not think we need to rely on my anecdotal evidence for the demonstration of that fact. As Senator Teague mentioned, that is particularly the case in respect of the debacle over refunded fees to students who had prepaid their courses and who later were refused visas. I agree with Senator Teague that this can only be described as incompetence. Australian taxpayers will have to pay millions of dollars for this incompetence, which was entirely unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Government is seeking to increase the rate of payment of the deferred higher education contribution charge. This will refill the Government's coffers more quickly but it does not yield any gross extra income. The accelerated payments are also regressive. This is a major area of concern to us because they fall disproportionately on lower income earners. Those who fall within the lowest income bracket will pay 100 per cent more and those in the highest bracket will pay only 25 per cent more. This flies in the face of equity and further penalises students who cannot afford to take advantage of the 15 per cent discount saving available if they pay up front. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have always opposed a tertiary tax and we particularly object to this clause which seeks to impose further burdens on students at the very time when they are faced with personal economic stringency because they are studying rather than working. In most cases they have not had the time to build up the capacity to meet their financial obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats regard the increased rate of payments under the higher education contribution scheme as a breach of the original contract which was reached between the Government and the students enrolled. To rearrange that, to change the rules in the middle of the game, is just un-Australian. There in no other way to describe it. Part of the way we look at things in this country is not to change the rules in the middle of the game. But that is precisely what is proposed here. Many students have already made financial plans and they are entitled to rely on those plans. Accordingly, I would like to see the Government reconsider its position and ensure that the payments do not operate retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I will speak briefly on the commitment to technical and further education (TAFE), which is indicated in the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990. The commitment illustrated in this Bill is frankly pathetic. The Government has spoken often of retraining, multi-skilling and award restructuring. It is trying to administer the training guarantee scheme although it has had a great deal of difficulty in respect of registered industry training agents. Also, it is masterminding many changes to the industrial profile of Australia. However, it has not, in this Bill or in any other Bill I have seen, sought to give TAFE the opportunity to become a partner in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we now have a set of organisations across the country which are unsure of their resources. If the organisations are unsure of their resources, they are unsure of the availability of expanded resources to meet these changes being implemented by the Government. They are certainly unsure of their orientation or of what the Government expects of TAFE institutions in this change process, because they have not really been given the message that they are part of the team to achieve these monumental changes. I see no opportunity in this Bill to bolster TAFE or to include it in these great changes that are sweeping across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the Government somehow thinks it is all going to be done by mirrors, that these sorts of things just happen on autopilot. There is no specific direction. In this Bill we could have had greatly increased funding or at least an indication that a team was being built. These changes, about which the Government often mouths in a superficial manner, could have been brought on at this stage, but they have not been. I am disappointed. Quite frankly, I think what is proposed here is pathetic. </PARA>
<PARA> During the discussion I was just having with myself-nobody else seems to be listening-about the higher education contribution scheme, I mentioned the fact that some students would feel compromised because they have been betrayed by the Government's changing the rules. I should perhaps have mentioned that this sort of evidence can also be seen in present Austudy arrangements. Words fail me when I start to think about that. Many aspiring students will be further disadvantaged by the changes that are proposed to Austudy, because again the Government has backtracked on its lowering of the threshold under the parent's assets test. This was reduced to $200,000, and now the Government has restored it and indexed it to over $340,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats still believe that the family farm should be exempt from provisions applying to Austudy. I cannot see the relevance of that to a student's education plans. The Government should rethink its changes to the spouse income test under Austudy. The threshold has been massively reduced, by $6,000 down to $12,150 a year. It was bad enough as it was before, at $18,000-odd for a spouse. Again, I cannot see the relevance of that to a student wishing to undertake tertiary studies. Here we have a change which is not really justified in the Budget; the Government simply explained that the threshold had been reduced and would now be $12,150 before it started to affect the partner's receipt of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an incredibly harsh measure when the average gross income in Australia today is over $26,000. It makes a nonsense of this Government's commitment to education. It excludes women, it has a huge effect on part timers and it forces young married people who want to be involved in studies into a poverty situation. The Government estimates that 1,000 students will lose Austudy as a result of this; 1,300 will discontinue their courses; and another 6,800 will stay on, but their Austudy will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> During last year's debate on this, the Democrats unsuccessfully moved two important amendments. The first would have removed the age requirement of 16 years for receipt of Austudy. We should look at that. Surely the level of education that is being undertaken has more relevance to the distribution of Austudy than age. The age requirement of 16 years for receipt of Austudy should have been removed. Our other amendment would have given part time students the right to defer payment of their tertiary charge. Given the limited time and the lack of support for those amendments, we will not waste the time of the Senate by formally moving them again, but I think that the issue needs to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent studies have warned that Australia's universities face academic staff shortages of up to 20,000 by the year 2000. The Higher Education Council has estimated that 5,500 extra staff are required in 1991 just to maintain the current student to teacher ratios. In order to avert a major crisis, the Government should be acting quickly to recruit and train academic staff, but we do not see any evidence of that in any of these measures. We should be encouraging and supporting our postgraduates. Academic careers are not being made more attractive by what the Government proposes here. When I look at this package of six education Bills, the only feeling I have in the end is one of great disappointment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wish to refer to the part of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill which provides that, in the event that any State passes legislation which provides for the voluntary unionism of students, the amount of funding to that State is reduced. The legislation makes payments under the Act conditional upon the States taking no action to prevent or hinder the imposition or collection of fees by higher education institutions or organisations representing the interests of students generally. If the condition is not met, the Minister is empowered to determine an amount deductible by the Commonwealth from a State and the amount payable by the Commonwealth to institutions in respect of such organisations. The latter amounts in total will not exceed a total of the former amounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of the Bill, and no doubt its philosophic underlying purpose, is to make contributions to student unions mandatory. Although, of course, there is no direct provision for making membership of such unionism compulsory, that is the effect. I have always found it a quaint contradiction of the Australian Labor Party that it claims to have amongst its ranks those who believe they carry the torch in a singular way for the civil liberties of individuals-in fact, some of them are so arrogant as to assume that they are the only ones who care about the intrinsic rights of individuals-yet we find that when it comes to a compulsion to join an organisation or association the Labor Party makes no apology and has no shame about the fact that it compels members of society to join associations and bodies, and it is at great peril to themselves if they dare not. </PARA>
<PARA> In a related way, I thought the recent SPC case at Shepparton was a good example of the muscle that these organisations, these associations and these unions are able to impose upon individuals because those individuals are compelled to be members. The Government understands, for instance, in respect to unionism that if there was not compulsion, if there was not blackmail, if there was not duress, and if there was not inordinate and unnatural pressure on individuals to be forced to join these associations, the associations and the unions themselves would be fundamentally without power, because they are required to have a commitment and a responsibility to reflect the attitudes, the aspirations and not the least the wishes and desires of the individual members of the unions. In other words, the unions would be required to be more responsible and more responsive to those people who choose and seek to join them because they believe that there is some intrinsic merit in that association. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw the case in Shepparton recently where a group of workers made a judgment that it was in their best interests, in the interests of their family and children and in the interests of their community for them to forgo some previous benefits if they could maintain their jobs and have some chance of economic survival. The company made a judgment that it could continue to provide them with jobs if there was a mutual agreement where the company made sacrifices, the executive and the directors of the company made sacrifices and the workers made sacrifices. Ultimately, that sacrifice would manifest itself by the continuance of the company and of the workers' positions and, ultimately, a reward by way of profit sharing in the event that the company returned to profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> We found that the individuals were naive enough to imagine that they had some basic human right to enter into such an agreement and arrangement with their employer. They thought that their labour was their own and free to be negotiated with their employer for whatever reward they judged their labour to be worth. Of course, their naivety was demonstrated in their belief that they had some rights, some responsibilities and some capacity to make judgments for themselves. Their naivety was also demonstrated when Mr Halfpenny from the Victorian Trades and Labor Council stood up and said, `You do not have a right. You do not have the capacity to make judgments that affect you. Don't you understand that in society there is a higher order, that there is a greater responsibility imposed upon you by other people who are more competent and more capable of making judgments about your welfare, your well-being and that of your family than you are?' As a result, those employees were told that, if they persisted in the folly of seeking to maintain their jobs, the company would be black-banned and would be driven into bankruptcy and ultimately their jobs would be totally lost. The only reason that Halfpenny, the thug, could do that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mentioned that matter, Mr Acting Deputy President, to raise the question of the implications of making it compulsory-which is the effect of this package-for students to join a student union. Sadly, this Government has got the support of the representatives of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and I suspect that is because of having peace at any price. There is nothing more obnoxious than young students, who go to university for the purpose of improving their education and their prospects and for developing and educating their minds, being compelled to join an association with which they may have no philosophic commitment or belief. These students may obtain no material benefit from joining an association and they may wish to have no access to the facilities that are provided to those who may wish to join the association or union voluntarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was saddened to learn recently from my own little daughter in her first year at university that the National Union of Students went to Western Australia to contribute to the plebiscite as to whether or not that campus would be affiliated. When she tried to get into the booth to cast her vote, she was harassed and intimidated by a smelly, long-haired thug from that association. I took great exception to that. It is bad enough for workers on building sites to be intimidated by union officials, but for little kids on a campus to be intimidated in that way is not something which I imagine the Australian Democrats, or anybody on this side of politics, would approve of. But I can make no judgment past that point. The consequence of such conduct is to intimidate and isolate young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it grossly obnoxious that the price of education in Australia cannot be paid for by the sweat of the brow of parents or the individual endeavours of the child. The price of education comes with capitulation and compulsion to be associated with a group or body with which the students may well have no association, no interest and no common objectives. We have legislation before us now which purports to blackmail students to the extent that if they do not join the union they do not get an education. </PARA>
<PARA> I am used to walking down St George's Terrace in the halcyon days of the Labor Government and seeing signs stating, `No ticket, no start.' That is offensive enough, and 75 per cent of workers oppose such a proposition, but going on a campus and finding young adolescents having to read a placard stating, `No union, no education. No education, no future. No future, no hope', would be incompatible, I would have thought, with the mainstream view of the overwhelming majority of Australian society. Yet without shame or embarrassment, without a touch of a blush, this Government tells the young people of Australia-while the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, says that we have to be a smarter country-that they will get their education on the condition that they join a union of students. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that time prevents me from going through the ways in which some of the money is wasted. Wasting their money on taverns and those sorts of things is bad enough, but spending the money on political purposes-I object to that irrespective of whether it is the Left or the Right-and on political advertising during Federal and State election campaigns is objectionable. Having the money supporting a lifestyle which some in this society might find repulsive and contrary to their religion is objectionable. Having the funds used to take a political view about a matter which might be quite outside the Australian borders is obnoxious. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) knows that if a poll were taken any day of the week in Australia and the question was simply, `Do you believe in the compulsion to join a union to be allowed to work?', 80 per cent of the population would say no. If the question were asked of all parents of students in this country, `Do you believe that your child should have to join a union to get an education?', I suspect that the figure would be higher. At least there can be some argument, however distorted or subjective, that by joining a union as a worker a person is bearing the fruits of the labours of those who collectively negotiate with the employers. What benefit is there for a 17-year-old girl going on a campus to simply have her money, her parents' money or other taxpayers' money spent on lesbian counselling, political advertising, a tavern or some other facility? There is no intrinsic merit in this legislation whatsoever except to say that it is a simple reflection of the Australian Labor Party's long held philosophical view of life and society that there is always somebody more intelligent and superior and with greater knowledge of what is good for the individual than the individual himself. </PARA>

<PARA> A couple of points have been made and I need to respond to them specifically. Senator Teague made a particular point in respect of the privacy implications and what the Government was trying to do with clause 5 of the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill 1990. That clause enables the Government to seek particulars of overseas students enrolled at an institution. That clause was discussed by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Without reading all the deliberations of the Committee, I would like to incorporate in Hansard three pages of that Committee's report, as they might be useful. </PARA>
<PARA> I make particular reference to the fact that the Privacy Commissioner's office was consulted with respect to this provision. The Committee thanked the Minister for his response and his assistance with the Bill. More importantly, the information that is allowed to be sought under clause 5 is information which is normally sought. The information is needed to ensure that refunds are paid where the financial circumstances are necessary and that the Government is not irresponsible in the administration of public moneys in this area. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three pages of the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows --</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 17 October 1990 by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to facilitate the refunding of payments by the Commonwealth to overseas students unable to undertake or complete courses of study in Australia for which money has been paid in advance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee dealt with the Bill in Alert Digest No. 9 of 1990, in which it commented on a clause of the Bill. The Minister for Employment Education and Training responded to those comments by letter dated 5 December 1990. A copy of that letter is attached to this report. Relevant parts of the response are also discussed below. </PARA>
<PARA>Power to obtain information and documents</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5</PARA>
<PARA> In Alert Digest No. 9, the Committee noted that clause 5 of the Bill would empower the Secretary (or an officer authorised in writing) to issue notices to an educational institution (or its agent) requiring them to supply `particulars' of overseas students enrolled at the institution. The Committee suggested that this may be considered to involve a breach of students' privacy, as there is no indication of the kinds of information covered by `particulars' or the uses to which such information could be put. The Committee also noted that, though there is no formal requirement to do so, neither the explanatory memorandum to the Bill nor the Minister's second reading speech referred to the Privacy Commissioner having been consulted on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee drew senators' attention to the clause as possibly trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1(a) (i) of the Committee's terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the Committee's concern on privacy issues and I can assure you that, while no mention was made in the Explanatory Memorandum or Second Reading Speech, consultations were undertaken with the Privacy Commissioner's Office. This was at officer level and resulted in an undertaking being given to include in the Explanatory Memorandum an indication of the information about students that would be sought from institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Committee's concern about the meaning and use of `particulars', the Minister has drawn the Committee's attention to the notes on clause 5 of the explanatory memorandum which does indicate the type of information to be sought, and that its use is to establish the amount of refund to which a student may be entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee thanks the Minister for pointing this out. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that students, when completing the Acceptance Advice Form prior visa issue, specifically authorised Australian education institutions and other Commonwealth agencies to provide to my Department, on request, information contained in the application, enrolment details, attendance records, results, current address and information regarding their entry to and stay in Australia. This provision has been included for some time and is in keeping with the Information Privacy Principles of the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee thanks the Minister for his response and for his assistance with this Bill. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will quote from Minister Dawkins's letter to Senator Cooney, the Chairman of the Committee. The particulars that are being sought are not exceptional. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should add that students, when completing the Acceptance Advice Form prior visa issue, specifically authorise Australian education institutions and other Commonwealth agencies to provide to my Department, on request, information containing the application, enrolment details, attendance records, results, current address and information regarding their entry and stay in Australia. This provision has been included for some time and is in keeping with the Information Privacy Principles of the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>The histrionics that surround that point in the debate were not really necessary, but I am sure that the incorporation of these notes will assist. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of student unions at universities has been made quite recently in the debate. The Government has a very clear policy position which I personally share very strongly; that is, that student unions at universities provide a whole range of services. They are basic to the social conduct of campuses and to the provision of funds and facilities, not only for the student union itself but also for other organisations associated with the unions at universities. I know from my experience-I am sure that Senator Bell would agree with me; I will not repeat private conversations that we may have had on the role of student unions-that student unions provide a great focus for students at tertiary institutions. They provide a range of counselling, sporting, health and career services and necessary social outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> I am struck by a touch of hypocrisy from the previous Opposition speaker, Senator Crichton-Browne. He complains about student unions providing social facilities, whether they be taverns or whatever, when we, as members of probably one of the most elite clubs of Australia, avail ourselves of similar sorts of tavern facilities, such as swimming facilities-those which he stridently makes it difficult for staff to have greater access to in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that student unions provide a whole range of facilities for students. I am one who believes that those students should not be undermined. The Government believes that they should not be undermined and that they should be allowed to continue in a strong and viable way to provide services and advice to their members. Those services and advice are in the interests of members. They do not have to represent the majority view of the membership; in fact, they do not, never have and nor should they. The student unions are there to act as a focal point for all members. They may provide lesbian advice, but lesbians are students too. If there is a need for it, then that need is catered for by the student unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember in my days at university that the Liberal Club used to get a degree of support and financial assistance from student unions. As long as student unions are diverse in their organisations, they should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> One should also not deny the fact that students have political interests. Fighting governments on higher education fees is one issue which we as a government have found unpalatable. I, and I am sure the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Baldwin), would not stop student unions from being politically active against governments in the interests of their members, no matter how direct or indirect those interests may be. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1990 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. I will very briefly canvass some of the points made by Senator Teague. One is consistently struck in this place by the degree of irrelevance to the mainstream political process demonstrated by the Opposition. We saw that again this morning in Senator Teague's contribution on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A second reading amendment was moved by the Opposition which chastises the Government on its policy performance in this area. It is a schizophrenic amendment. I ask Senator Bell to have a close read of it. On the one hand we are accused of failing to address adequately the issues of quality in higher education and to provide a framework for accountability and so on. On the other hand, we are criticised for failing to make inroads into unmet demand-for failing to do all sorts of things that cannot be done by any government, unless an interest is taken in the services provided by the tertiary institutions involved. </PARA>
<PARA> We are criticised for doing nothing about the unmet demand in paragraph (b) (iv) of the Opposition's second reading amendment. It is very easy to make those political points, but the Opposition's irrelevance is underscored when one looks at the fact that this Government is in the process of creating 70,000 places between 1989 and 1993 in this sector. That is a major attempt at meeting unmet demand in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment talks about bludgeoning higher education institutions, enforced amalgamations and the damaging pressures we have created with regard to institutional uniformity. One only has to look at the situation of the Ballarat university college, I am informed, where that university college chose not to amalgamate with other institutions. Its funding arrangements have been advised. Its position is clear: they are continuing. If Senator Teague wants to come in here with good sound sustainable arguments he should come up with them. If he wants to come up with amendments which look great and read well at his local Liberal Party Friday night scones and tea meeting, that is great. I am sure the speech will get great circulation and great respect there, perhaps ensuring that Senator Teague gets his preselection with the support of the blue rinse set in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide. But in the tertiary institutions Senator Teague will lose and continue to lose credibility for so long as he goes on with schizophrenic motions such as this.</PARA>
<PARA> I go on to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill, which is another Bill I think the Australian Democrats should have a close look at before they consider supporting it. We are told that they deplore the Government's imposition of complex goals and performance indicators. Then we are asked to develop a response to open and flexible training markets. The first point is-it is one I made with respect to the previous Bill-that the Government is taking an interest; the Government does provide moneys. The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that the quality of the service is maintained and upgraded and that kids and students all over Australia get an adequate and reasonable level of education, and to that extent we will take an interest and set goals and indicators. At the same time we will recognise the flexibility that this amendment denies that we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> A special meeting of Ministers was held on 2 November this year which agreed to the national approach to make the technical and further education (TAFE) system more effective and efficient. I am sure that Senator Bell is getting a great degree of insight into this debate from Senator Crichton-Browne. If he is going to support this amendment he should take note that on 2 November Ministers across Australia recognised the need for effectiveness, efficiency, the development of key performance indicators for the TAFE system and action to review staffing and conditions to remove inhibitions on TAFE participating in the open and flexible training market, and agreed to a process to rectify that. I do not see the need for this particular amendment. The Government has been working, moving and achieving in this area. It is one of a series of reforms that was mentioned on 2 November. The amendment is there, once again, for grandstanding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague will always disagree. Hopefully, that will do both my reputation and his good. I go on to the next Bill, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990. We get canned in a very generalised way about that. I do not think I need to go deeply into that Bill. I will leave my comments both on this Bill and the next one, and also on the definition of time problems, to the committee stage, if that is necessary. However, on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, the Government has an amendment to move. That amendment has been circulated. It has the agreement of the Opposition. I have some comments to make on it, but I think it is best for me to make those comments at the time I formally move the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT AMENDMENTS RELATION TO THE AWARD RESTRUCTURING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA>(CLAUSES 3 AND 21)</PARA>
<PARA>REVISED SPEAKING NOTE FOR MINISTER</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will be aware that the Award Restructuring Assistance Program (ARAP) is part of Commonwealth initiatives to improve the quality of teaching in Australian schools. ARAP provides for differential grants to schools on the basis of arrangements arising from particular awards and agreements as they occur in each State and sector. In each case, the Commonwealth will enter into an agreement with the system or school on the implementation of measures for improvement of teacher quality and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the benefits of the Program are available to all school teachers, including principals and deputy principals, in all types of school- non-government as well as government. It has always been the Government's intention that this should be so, but we accept that the Bill as originally drafted appeared to exclude assistance from certain limited categories of staff in non-government schools not covered by an approved award. </PARA>
<PARA>Provided that any restructuring of the terms or conditions of such staff is comparable with those under an approved award, schools and systems may, under the proposed amendments, be eligible for assistance towards the cost of approved elements of the restructuring. This applies whether schools are currently paying over or under award rates. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that these amendments will command general support, and commend them to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to today's announcement by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Treasurer of a one per cent reduction in interest rates. I ask: does the Minister agree that such a reduction requires also taking offsetting fiscal and wages policy measures, as otherwise the longer term consequences for inflation, investment and jobs could be counterproductive? If he does so agree, what offsetting fiscal and wages policies is the Government adopting? If he does not agree, then what are his grounds for expecting that the current climate provides a basis for a long term reduction in inflation as implied by today's decision and the statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very easy to take one incident like a reduction in interest rates which was announced today and telescope it into a variety of other hypothetical circumstances in which differing parameters might well apply to the Australian economy. In terms of fiscal and wages policy, the Government has fiscal policies largely dealt with in the budgetary context and except in, I think, five out of seven years here, this Government has introduced a May statement or something of that kind. Fiscal policy, however, is essentially dealt with in the budgetary context, and wages policy has been dealt with for the foreseeable future in terms of having no wage increase through 1991 on the basis of a foreshadowed tax cut for wage earners and others next year. Whether the balance of those things has to be varied in time will be something for the Government to determine at that time, probably early next year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The monetary policy decision taken today does not in itself make an enormous difference to the major determinants of economic stability. It will depend very much on the effects of that reduction-easing of monetary policy-in the way that it flows through to various sectors of the economy. There is a one per cent difference between the impact of monetary policy today and the situation yesterday. That does not, in my view, necessitate logically a huge change in the other determinants of economic stability and success.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer him to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser on 26 November 1990 about new cash transaction regulations to take effect on 1 February 1991. Will the Minister explain what prompted these new regulations on account verification under the Cash Transaction Reports Act? What improvements will result from such changes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5858" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had my attention drawn to the article Senator Foreman has brought to the notice of the chamber. It is a fact that the Attorney-General has announced that cash dealers-that is, banks, building societies, credit unions, TAB agencies, et cetera-will have to verify the identity of all new signatories to accounts. This will come into force on 1 February 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Cash Transaction Reports Act is becoming a very important weapon in the fight Australia is waging against organised criminal activity, particularly against money laundering aspects in relation to drug trafficking. As we know, that particular heinous trade generates many millions of dollars in terms of profits of crime. It is in the interests of the criminals concerned to launder that money into apparently legitimate business enterprises and other activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Costigan, in the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, indicated that some bank managers were virtually acting as accomplices and collaborators with organised crime in that they were permitting the opening of accounts in manifestly false names in their suburban branches and turning a blind eye to the fact that quite clearly this was being done in a way to mask the true identity of the origins of the money concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very pleasing to note that over the last several years there has been a major change in the ethos and outlook of those involved in the financial institutions, from top management down to the clerks at the counter. This particular change of outlook provides a very sound foundation for the work of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency in its measures to combat money laundering and the movement of profits of crime through various financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> From 1 February 1991 there will be two methods of verification of identity of those opening accounts with the financial institutions I have mentioned-banks, building societies, credit unions, et cetera. One will require a written statement from an acceptable referee. The other will require the undertaking of certain checks and the production of certain documents. In all those ways the banks will be able to verify the identity of the person opening the account. It is important to emphasise that the records in relation to the verification process will be retained by the cash dealer and will be available to law enforcement agencies only in accordance with existing law and, generally, under search warrants. So there will be no great invasion of privacy involved in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Mr Costigan's hopes for the future waging of the battle against organised crime in this area are being achieved in a way which is appropriately sensitive to the interests of the privacy of individual depositors and those who have financial dealings with various institutions. On the other hand, this certainly permits us as a community to deal with the insidious movement of the profits of crime, which not only undermines the legitimate business and trading activity of Australia but also creates havens in which the black market can operate. In that way, I believe that these new regulations Senator Foreman has drawn to the attention of the Senate will be extremely beneficial.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I ask: firstly, has the Minister yet come to understand that his proposal for resource guarantee legislation completely pre-empts the Government's ecologically sustainable development process and the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry into the timber industry; and, secondly, will the Minister give an undertaking that this matter will be resolved one way or the other at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting so that the resource industries and the public will know where they stand?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5860" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question begins by asking whether I have come to understand. I find that extremely gratifying and indeed patronising but, yes, I have come to understand and I will give Senator Powell an answer in terms of my understanding, which I think is better than hers. Let me say that her question is based on the most paranoid, suspicious interpretation of the Government's motives in this matter. She has swallowed all the misconceptions behind some of the media and public comment on this issue in recent weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's aims in its consideration of this issue have not changed, and will not change. The Government wants a clear approach that integrates environmental and economic considerations. Areas of high conservation value must be preserved from logging, and logging practices in other areas must be sustainable. Decisions on forest allocation must be made on the basis of objective scientific assessment and community consultation. The various States which have direct control of forest resources require an assurance of the availability of timber so that they can enter into long term contracts with confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> The processes must offer conservationists and industry certainty-something which has not been present in recent years, I suspect, and something which is of great concern to a lot of people. It seems fair to say that existing processes have perhaps proved less than adequate for the resolution of these issues because of some highly emotional elements in the public debate. So the answer to the first part of Senator Powell's question is no.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Powell raised the issue of the Government's consideration of these matters being consistent with its approach to ecologically sustainable development and the work of the Resource Assessment Commission-both processes invented not by the Australian Democrats but by this Government. When the honourable senator talks about my proposals in relation to these issues, I have to make the point that that interpretation comes from a misreading of a document that was clearly leaked over the telephone, with a bit of Telecom Australia static into the bargain, because it was not a very accurate view of what the proposals are.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that earlier this year the Prime Minister appointed four Ministers in the Government to look at the question of resource security issues pending the outcome of the ecologically sustainable development process and of course pending the deliberations of the Resource Assessment Commission. It is that committee of Ministers that has prepared a Cabinet submission on these matters. I think the Government's consideration of these issues is quite consistent with those two processes to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Senator Powell asked me whether I would give an undertaking that this matter would be determined in the Cabinet meeting tomorrow. My answer to that part of the question is no, I will not give any such undertaking. The agenda of Cabinet is determined by Cabinet, and the way in which it deals with that agenda is determined by Cabinet, not by a question from the Australian Democrats. In summary, the Government is committed to developing decision making processes which integrate environmental projection and economic objectives and that will be the continuing aim of this Government.</PARA>

Does the Minister not understand that, by definition, sustainable development in essence ensures resource security and that in fact without sustainable development there can be no resource security-that very certainty to which the Minister referred?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I agree with the proposition advanced in the question that this journal entitled Hard Facts is an obscure one but, nonetheless, it has been published out of Adelaide. It is nothing more than a propaganda rag and, in the tradition of propaganda rags, it bears only a remote fidelity to the truth. One could say that it is Peter Reith hopeless. The most recent copy of this journal, a copy of which I have here, proposes to make three points: firstly, that the majority of the fall in working days lost through industrial disputes from the high levels of the 1970s and 1980s did not come about during the Hawke years but rather during the last two years of the Fraser Government; secondly, that while industrial disputation has remained at a relatively low level since 1983 the key reason has been the high level of unemployment which has reduced the bargaining power of unions; and thirdly, that our industrial disputation record still compares very badly with the records in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in general. The trouble with this journal is that on each of those points it is simply, absolutely and fundamentally wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go to the first point: disputes declined from an unacceptable rate of 797 working days lost per 1,000 employees in 1981 to the unacceptable rate of 348 working days lost per 1,000 employees in 1982. Now the figure is less than half that of the Fraser Government's best year. The indisputable fact is that the rate of industrial disputation-137 working days lost per 1,000 employees in the year to August 1990-was the lowest figure since this measure was published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on a monthly basis. Under the Hawke Labor Government, the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees through industrial disputation is 62 per cent lower than under the Fraser Government period. Indeed the year to August 1990 returned a very low figure which was still trending downwards. It was the lowest year-ended-August figure for working days lost since 1967. I note that since 1967 the work force has increased by 69 per cent, so that measure of gross lost days has to be compared with a much larger work force.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the second point, let me say that the allegation that industrial disputation has been kept in check by unemployment is just so fundamentally wrong that it is a joke. In the last year compared in this table, 1982-1983, the growth rate in Australia was negative-minus 0.4. That was the Fraser Government period. Industrial disputation was kept in check by the Fraser Government strangling the economy and introducing bad economic times. That was the reason for that reduction. From the year 1982-83, which admittedly includes some of the Fraser period, to the year ended September 1990, the growth in the economy measured by gross domestic product has been at plus 4.1. So we can compare minus 0.4 in the Fraser period with plus 4.1 growth under this Government. The significance is that during a period of high growth, industrial disputations have gone down under the Hawke Government. When the bargaining power of unions is at its greatest, they exercise restraint under the accord and we get moderate wage outcomes.</PARA>

<PARA> Regarding the third point, international comparisons, these comparisons show Australia's remarkable improvement since the advent of the Hawke Government. Between 1983 and 1987, the annual average rate of industrial disputation in this country was 250 working days lost per 1,000 employees, the same level as that of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Contrary to what Hard Facts suggests, Australia was below the United Kingdom annual rate over this period, which was 400 working days lost per 1,000 employees. So this scurrilous rag, Hard Facts, which bears the authorisation of Senator Amanda Vanstone, should be rejected for the lies it contains.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Consultations with the States and the Northern Territory have taken place in regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I am pleased that that consultation has reached the stage where ratification of the convention took place last night. The convention was ratified by Australia and in that regard it became, I think, the sixty-first country to ratify this very important convention. The convention has been signed but not ratified by over 70 other countries, so one can see that Australia is now in the company of probably most members of the United Nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that any other United Nations human rights instrument has achieved such a result of signature and ratification in so short a time. It is obviously a testimony to the importance which governments around the world place on recognising the particular needs of children, who are a most vulnerable group, in many societies. It now provides Australia with a benchmark for the solidarity which we must show worldwide as far as the provision of a certain minimum recognition of the rights and responsibilities towards children is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the review of State and Territory laws which was required to be undertaken before ratification could take place, Australia has lodged one reservation in regard to the convention; that is, that we accept all the obligations of the convention except one that requires child and adult criminal offenders to be imprisoned separately. It is not always possible for Australia to meet this obligation in remote areas. Australia has, therefore, made a reservation which means that this obligation will not apply to it. But, of course, in regard to the normal situation within Australian jurisdictions, one would hope that juvenile offenders are not either on remand or kept in prison with adult prisoners after being sentenced to a gaol term.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, the Australian Government, of course, has now submitted itself to the Bar of international scrutiny as far as assistance to children is concerned. I believe that with ratification will come a very important phase in the community's understanding of this convention. It will reveal that many of the misgivings and fears which have been groundlessly aroused in the minds of many ordinary and decent Australians will be found to be unfounded because children will not be snatched from the bosom of their families, as has been alleged in a lot of propaganda that has been circulated.</PARA>
<PARA> Rather than family and parental responsibilities being undermined because of Australian work in the formulation of the convention under article 5, countries are required to ensure that parents are able to discharge their responsibilities, rights and duties to direct and guide their children in the exercise of the various rights formulated in the convention. I believe that, as I say, now having ratified the convention, those who have had their fears and misgivings aroused will find that they ought to turn their attention to those who are responsible for creating this propaganda which has been so unsettling.</PARA>
<PARA> Ratification simply means that Australia is now a state party to the convention. It does not change the law in Australia one jot or tittle. If the law in Australia is to be changed, that must be by way of an action in the parliaments of Australia by the elected representatives of the Australian people. That is also a most important matter to emphasise in relation to this Convention on the Rights of the Child.</PARA>
<PARA> So I thank Senator Reynolds for her question. She has shown a very great interest in this particular convention. I believe it marks a very important milestone in securing the international recognition of the rights of that most vulnerable group in our societies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Could the Minister explain to the Senate the difference between Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August this year and Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in December 1975? Does the Minister recognise the irony of a situation where oil is involved in both disputes but that, in the Gulf, Australia chose to side with the victim while nearer home the Government sided with the aggressor? When will the Australian Government change its position on East Timor, in line with the growing body of international opinion that is now demanding the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination? Will the Government have the courage to admit that its silence in 1975 was a mistake and that this can be rectified by Australia taking a constructive role in settling this dispute, which will not go away?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5864" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the most relevant distinction is that the East Timor invasion by Indonesia was never accompanied by any United Nations resolution determining upon economic sanctions, let alone any subsequent UN resolution by the Security Council or any- body else effectively enabling the use of force in support of various objectives if they could not be peacefully achieved. The short point is that the international response against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has been overwhelming and based on a perception as to the absolute intolerability of any naked aggression of the kind that was perpetuated there by one sovereign country against another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other grounds of distinction which could be drawn: the fact that East Timor was not, of course, a sovereign country in its own right but a colonial dependency; one that had in fact been deserted by its former colonial master and in respect of which there was a significant civil conflict waging between three rival groups, two of which, as I recall, favoured integration with Indonesia. So the circumstances were different.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek in any way to qualify this Government's very long-standing expression of concern and unhappiness about the circumstances of the Indonesian annexation-we made that clear in 1975; we have made it clear ever since-but there does come a time when the reality of an annexation or an absorption of this kind has to be accepted. That time came for this country some years ago.</PARA>
<PARA> We have taken the point that the human rights situation in East Timor can be much better advanced and much more usefully advocated in an environment where Australia does have a working relationship with Indonesia, and one that accepts the reality of the inevitable. It may be that had the international community responded with much more vigour and enthusiasm to the situation in 1975, as indeed to innumerable other international incidents over the Cold War period, the situation would be different. But that is the circumstance as we now confront it and that is the reason why we draw the distinction we do.</PARA>
<PARA> The important thing is to look now and in the future at each one of these cases absolutely on their own merits and not regard the appropriateness of international action as being governed by what may have been an inappropriate international response in the past. There were many inappropriate, inadequate or ineffectual international responses in the past. Thankfully, we are moving into a new environment where the possibility of effective international response is very great. The occasion for that, the case for it and the justification for it in the case of Iraq is self-evident, and nothing should deter us from accepting that reality.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report in the paper which Senator Loosley refers to on innovation in the food processing industry was prepared for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce by the Centre for Technology and Social Change at the University of Wollongong. It was a study which aimed to identify the characteristics of demand for new technology by firms in the industry and those factors influencing this demand. Not surprisingly, the report found that only a small number of firms in the food processing industry are strongly active in technology and export development, despite the apparent opportunities to expand the exports of value added food products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report concluded that it is essential that firms develop the capacity and commitment to formulate strategies for competitiveness and technological development internally rather than by external inducement through the provision of Government assistance policies and programs. On this basis, the report recommends that government action be aimed at improving management strategic planning capabilities and the ability to implement plans. Secondly, it supports the establishment of a research and development association for the industry, if it is found to be warranted. The report also recommends that these measures be supplemented by information on export and research and development initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA> Some recent actions by the Government go some way to meeting the report's recommendations, and food processing activities have now been given high priority under the existing grants for industrial research and development initiatives. In addition, the international trade enhancements scheme administered by Austrade should be of particular benefit to larger food companies, particularly in countries such as Japan. Also, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce is introducing a national initiative for the food processing industries involving various agencies and aimed at increasing awareness of the importance of strategic planning and improving manufacturers' strategy and planning capabilities. I agree that the establishment of a research and development association has some attractions and is an approach that has been considered for some time. But such an organisation would have to be private sector driven, and it is not clear yet that sufficient support is coming from the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I was making is that there is very much a lack of credibility in the person asking the question, which of course goes to the heart of the matter. We have before us today a question claiming probable evidence of a cartel, apparently linking my Department. In the previous question we had on my Department, there was a probable case of a disabled toilet on a mezzanine floor which was not built there. But that did not stop a press statement going out. In the question before that, we had a probable case of Comcar going to private hire companies and, once again, facts asserted that were not correct. Today we have probably a similar situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer will probably get an answer to this question by the end of the week. I will examine whatever evidence he might have. I say to him-this is a consistent line from our side of the Parliament-that if there is evidence the Government will act. But his track record on raising questions in this Parliament is as good as his record as an economic manager in his own company. He should pay his bills and stand up with economic credibility.</PARA>

I ask the Minister: in view of the Australian Customs Service charge at the rate of $270,000 per annum faced by Compass Airlines, which is directly attributable to a lack of gate facilities at the domestic terminal in Perth, does he stand by his claim, made twice in the Senate on 19 September, that new airlines are not having extortionate demands placed on them?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received a report from the Committee on Toxicity of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which came to a conclusion concerning urocanic acid which is present in some cosmetics. I believe that it is important that the public record be set straight because there has been some fear engendered among some users of cosmetics in relation to claims about the carcinogenic effect of urocanic acid in human subjects. The Committee concluded that it should recommend that the use of urocanic acid in cosmetics and sunscreens be phased out as a matter of prudence, but it also made it clear that harmful effects had not been demonstrated in relation to humans. I believe that that is true but, nevertheless, some experiments were carried out on mice which gave rise to the cautious recommendation that I have outlined to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of that particular recommendation, I have asked the cosmetics industry to recall from sale any cosmetics including the ingredient urocanic acid. I have made that decision, as I say, as a matter of caution and prudence rather than of absolute necessity, but that was the advice received from this expert Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is no cause for undue alarm or worry on the part of those who may have used a cosmetic with this ingredient. Four cosmetic suppliers have already withdrawn from the market lines containing the ingredient and I believe that there is no need for overly legalistic reaction on my part. I have asked the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to make further arrangements with the cosmetics industry and cosmetic retailers to withdraw from sale the items concerned and to recall any products now being held in stores, on cosmetic counters and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee on Toxicity found that evidence on the subject was inconclusive and harmful effects on humans had not been proven. But as a matter of prudence, it suggested that a phase-out occur. This is why I have undertaken, with the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, a process to ensure voluntary recall to eliminate any potential risk. I am confident that, given the level of public concern, we will have the full cooperation of the cosmetics industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley asked me about the colloquial name for urocanic acid. The honourable senator would know from her medical background that urocanic acid is the colloquial name. I cannot recall the full scientific name. I think it is 4-imidazole acrylic acid. If I am wrong, I am sure that the honourable senator will correct me in a supplementary question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer the Minister to the Auditor-General's criticism of the administration of the Department of Social Security's (DSS) telephone rental concession scheme. Is this scheme, which does not ensure that only eligible people receive the concession or that the correct amount of concession is received, indicative of a social security system that is, to use Senator Richardson's words, `in advance of literally any country in the world'? Given that some 20 per cent of the scheme's $46m annual expenditure may be being paid to ineligible persons, does the Minister believe that, to use his words again, `informed people would consider this scheme to be a model for social security policy and administration'? Considering that the Auditor-General found that the administration of the scheme had not improved since 1983, does the Minister include this scheme in his claim that `there is not the slightest doubt that the integrity of the social security system has been enhanced substantially'?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stopped attempting to take down all those questions. I will give a general answer. There are three criticisms in the Auditor-General's report. The first is that ineligible people may be using vouchers worth up to $8m per annum. The sample used to derive this figure was 100 vouchers out of 3 1/2 million used. I do not think the figure is right. The Auditor-General and I, therefore, are in disagreement as to the extent of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another criticism was that the responsibilities between the Department of Social Security and Telecom are unclear and neither organisation is willing to fix the problem. Both Telecom and my Department, which share responsibility for the voucher scheme, recognise the problems. That is why the Government has been taking action to improve and review that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security responded promptly after seeing the report in draft form on the issues relating to its responsibility. Staff have been reminded of what is required and there is more specific checking of subscriber status. Procedures for the issue of replacement vouchers, which I think is one of the big problems with the scheme, have been substantially tightened up.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, during Budget discussions this year Cabinet asked relevant Ministers to report back to it with proposals for a better scheme. The Department of Social Security is discussing with the Department of Transport and Communications what that better scheme might be and will report back so that a new scheme for beyond 1991 can be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> The third criticism appeared to be that inadequacies in the scheme have been reported as far back as 1976-77 but no action has been taken on them. A number of actions have been taken on them and on the telephone rental concession, including introduction of the voucher system itself in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to measures already put in place to address the concerns raised, I can assure the Senate that there will continue to be action to improve the administration of the concession. I remind Senator Patterson that out of $23 billion, this is a scheme of some $40m. It does require tightening, and it will get it. However, it does not undermine either of the statements from which she quoted.</PARA>

<PARA> The need for the Parliament to enable employers and employees to make voluntary agreements to determine the conditions of employment in their own work place without the intervention of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion states the essence of the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties in this Parliament. It is one which we have been pursuing now for a number of years. The policy was first published in its present form in May 1986, although we had been developing it for some time prior to that. A little after the publication of this policy, the employer and the employees at a meatworks in the Northern Territory, at a place called Mudginberri, entered into a voluntary agreement rearranging the award conditions that applied to that meatworks. This agreement, covering conditions of employment, was reached voluntarily--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator Michael Baume</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not only to their great satisfaction, but also to their great benefit because the agreement returned to the employees of that workplace a better financial result, and to the employer it delivered greater productivity. There could not have been a better example of the necessity-quite apart from the desirability-of the policy we announced over four years ago, which we have continued to support and inform the people of Australia about as much as we possibly could ever since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During that time there have been a number of examples where the rearrangement of working conditions by agreement would have been very beneficial to employees but it has not been possible. Certainly, developments under section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act, which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) was talking about yesterday, have allowed that to be done with the formal agreement of the Industrial Relations Commission. There has certainly been a great deal of movement in the industrial relations world towards the result which we have promoted in our policy. But now we have the case in Victoria involving SPC Ltd which, like the Mudginberri case, is another classic industrial relations case. It is interesting to note that the now shadow Minister for industrial relations, John Howard, who was the architect of this policy and who has been, I suppose, the driving force in the development and the promotion of this policy, called for 1,000 Mudginberries in 1986. That is now starting to be seen. It will recur. The Shepparton case is another classic and major example of it. </PARA>
<PARA> But, unlike the situation in 1986 where perhaps this was seen as a very radical, innovative and controversial policy, the fact of the matter is that last week a Morgan poll was taken on the attitude of Australian voters with regard to the agreement entered into by the employer and the employees of the Shepparton Preserving Company. The result of that poll of a large sample across Australia was that 77 per cent of Australians support the right of the employees to enter into such an agreement with their employer for whatever particular reason they may have. In this case it was to save their jobs. In other cases it might be and probably will be, in many cases, to improve their pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The poll showed that 77 per cent of Australians now support that right; in other words, they support the policy that this Opposition has been promoting so strongly for the last 4 1/2 years. But even more interesting is the fact that 67 per cent of Labor voters said that they supported the right of employees to enter into such an agreement, and 66 per cent of Australian Democrat voters supported that same principle. Indeed, only 4 per cent of unionists questioned in this poll thought that the Government should make any decision in relation to these matters at all. Only 4 per cent of union members believe that government should have any role in determining the result of a case of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition's policy is firmly based upon a voluntary agreement between parties. It is not based on settling a dispute. It is about an agreement being made between the employer and, as they see fit, individual employees-not necessarily all of the employees although, in many cases, that will be the case. This completely distinguishes the Opposition policy from that which the Government espouses and which Senator Cook espoused yesterday in relation to agreements under section 115 within the whole framework of the industrial relations system when settling a dispute of that kind. The policy is one whereby the parties themselves enter into an agreement. Certainly, our policy allows the employees to appoint agents, which would include their union, to give them advice and maybe to negotiate on their behalf. Under our policy, there is no exclusion of the role of unions. It will be for the employees themselves to decide whether they want the union involved. They will not have the intervention of the union imposed upon them or the intervention of the Government, through the Industrial Relations Commission, imposed upon them. It will not be able come in as a big brother and say, `Yes, you can do this. No, you can't do that'. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the Opposition's policy is one of voluntary agreement, and the Minister should note that it is voluntary agreement. Yesterday in answer to a question he expressed concern that this could lead to victimisation in certain circumstances and said that, clearly, the umpire needs to see that each of these deals is fair and that we do not find a situation where there is victimisation. Far from the superior Big Brother notion expressed there by the Minister, clearly Australian people today are quite capable of making these decisions. If they want help, they can get it. They feel that they have the right to make the decisions-not governments, not industrial relations commissions and certainly not unions. Those bodies are there to help and advise-not to make the decisions. They are not there to do the Halfpenny trick, as in the SPC case, when he tried to bulldoze his way in and get his way with the employees. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the whole basis of our policy. It will deliver greater productivity to Australia. It means that sensible, flexible arrangements can be entered into. If parties have to go to the Industrial Relations Commission, they are going to have delays, costs and rigidities imposed upon them, when really they want a more flexible and productive result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be grateful if at some stage Senator Durack could table the document from which he quoted showing the poll results. We hear about these results but we never see the document. I would be interested to know whether in that poll a question was asked to the effect, `If management has made a series of bad investments and caused a company to suffer loss, should it be exclusively the right or the obligation of the employees to take wage cuts to bail it out?'. If that question were asked-and I guess it was not because we have not heard of it from the Opposition-we would get an objective view of the circumstances of this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present in the period of recession, for whatever reason, some companies are facing difficulties. There is existing flexibility within the current system to have trade-offs where those are required. If trade-offs take place, that must be done by consultation with all parties. If we exclude one of the parties, it has a perfect right to object. The forum in which it should object is the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is a trade-off, it must be done through the proper processes of the law. It must go before the umpire, who will say whether it is fair or not. If people advocate particular deals and say that those deals are fair, I ask them, and the Opposition, to tell us what they are afraid of. If they reckon this is a good deal, why not take the matter to the umpire and let the umpire say so? If they have confidence in this deal they will be prepared to come forward and let it be subject to judgment. The nub of the issue is that they do not want to undergo independent judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is enterprise flexibility in the existing wage system. It is embodied in the accord. The Department of Industrial Relations runs a work change program aimed at trying to generate higher productivity and profitability in the workplace by bringing together the partners-the management and the owners on one side and the workers on the other-to work out how best to set goals for that enterprise, how best to generate higher productivity and greater competitiveness for that enterprise, and how to share the rewards equally, evenly and fairly between themselves for the efforts that they put in. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the current system. That system is there; it should be used. I do not leap to judgment about whether the deal done at SPC Ltd is right or wrong. I note that the Opposition does, but I am not as intimately familiar with all of the affairs of that company as to cause me to accredit to myself the right to make a judgment. What I do say is that that right exists with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and the Industrial Relations Commission process is the process which should be gone through to judge it. That is not simply my view. It is also now the view of Mr John Carboy, the Managing Director of SPC. On the morning program on Channel 9, when asked a direct question on that matter by Elizabeth Hayes, the interviewer, he said that he would have done it differently now that he knows how the industrial relations system operates. In hindsight, he said, he would have gone through those processes. So, before one champions a particular cause, one should come to the facts of the matter, understand what those facts are and relate to those facts in the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> What this urgency motion does is a most scurrilous and unprincipled thing. It does not attack the Government; it does not attack the union movement; it does not criticise employers; it does not say that the workers were wrong: it attacks the umpire. It says, `The umpire has no place; the umpire is out of court; it should not apply; the umpire has no standing'. </PARA>
<PARA> I look at Senator Winston Crane on the other side of the chamber, who just last week asked me, as a Minister of this Government, to intervene and to tell the umpire to do certain things in a particular dispute. He wanted intervention in that dispute. I was asked yesterday by Senator Durack, who has propounded this item, whether I would intervene in this particular dispute. I am not going to intervene in this dispute, as I was not going to intervene in the other dispute. The Government is not butting in. The Government is not saying, `We are Big Brother; we know best'. We are simply saying, `If the deal is fair, then you have nothing to fear from submitting it through due process to the umpire for it to be determined as fair'. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of conciliation and arbitration was founded in this country in 1904 by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It has served this country well. It is highly regarded by the community. Although it is criticised by the practitioners, they support it. It is passing strange that the party that aspires to be the government of this country should now want to undermine the central institution which guarantees good industrial relations outcomes in this country and which puts workers on an equal footing with employers in going before an impartial authority experienced in industrial relations and, in a layman's court where one does not have to be a lawyer to state one's case, to argue what is right. It vests in those experienced practitioners who sit on the bench and have knowledge of this field the right to answer the most vexed question in industrial relations, a question which is essentially a matter for value judgment: what is fair in these particular circumstances? It asks the bench to determine that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers have one view; workers have another. Someone has to decide it. It can be decided by strike action; it can be decided by lock-out; it can be decided by muscle, if we wish. But in this country we have a civilised system. It is decided by arbitration, and it is decided in a way and in an ethos aimed at lowering the level of industrial disputation and removing conflict from the workplace and from industry. That is the system that the party which aspires to government now wants to throw over. </PARA>
<PARA> I make three criticisms of this urgency motion. It is short sighted, it is dangerous, and it is derelict in the duty the Opposition owes to this nation. It is short sighted because, while the bargaining powers in times of unemployment rest with employers, the wheel will turn. Next year at this time, with economic recovery under way, the bargaining power will shift back to the unions. Will those opposite be asking me, when the unions have a stronger bargaining power in the workplace, to allow those deals to go ahead? On the record of those opposite, of course they will not; they will be asking me to restrain the unions' activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants freedom now when the bargaining shares are on one side but it does not want freedom in future when they are on the other. There ought to be the restraint of the umpire in all circumstances. Do not be short-sighted; do not follow the course that the Fraser Government went down of double digit unemployment, double digit inflation, massive wage outcomes and low and negative economic growth. That is the experience of the past. The Opposition should learn from its past; it should learn about regulation and stability. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion is dangerous, too. As I said in Question Time earlier this week, we have managed in times of high economic growth to get moderate wage outcomes. But we were criticised on polling day. People have said-and Senator Kemp is one of the most recent to say it-that real wages have fallen. Well, real wages have fallen but real living standards have risen under this Government. That is an indisputable fact. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the statistics, one sees that there has been an 11 per cent improvement in real household disposable income per capita over the life of this Government. If honourable senators opposite do not want moderate wage outcomes and if in a period of recovery they want the law of the jungle to apply, they should support this motion. They would then free everyone from the shackles of having to conform to a system of regulation, reasonableness and arbitration. If honourable senators opposite want to free people from those shackles, they should face up to their responsibility when there is recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to see this economy recover in a steady, regular and sustained way. That requires control over wages policy as much as it requires control over the other levers of economic management. Honourable senators opposite would dispense with that. No wonder the judgment of the electors at the last election was, `If you do not have a wages policy, you do not have an economic policy and you cannot govern'. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion is also a dereliction of duty. The Party opposite aspires to government yet undermines the institutions through which a government can regulate industrial relations. I want the next speaker from the Opposition side to give a declaration of support for the rule of law in industrial relations. I want to hear that speaker say, `We support the law and we ask people to conform with it. We advocate that you go through due and proper process and proper arbitration'. If honourable senators opposite are not prepared to uphold the rule of law in this country and declare their support for the institutions able to deliver it in industrial relations, they are bankrupt, they do not deserve to be in government and they are derelict in their duty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is apparent from what we have witnessed in the past 20 minutes that industrial relations will be one of the prime themes of the next two or three years, leading up to the next election and beyond. It was only last weekend that Mr John Howard, the shadow Minister for industrial relations, suggested that within 18 months of the Opposition being elected we would probably be confronted with a double dissolution on the issue of industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question inherent in this motion of urgency is whether, as Senator Cook has so assertively stated, the umpire has any relevance and whether he will be called upon to make judgments in matters of prime industrial disputation. In the alternative model proposed by the Opposition, no standing is given to the umpire or to the place of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Therein lies the fundamental difference. The Government's model has been reinforced as a result of legislation enacted in this chamber about 10 days ago. In other words, the model endorsed by the government of the day is the law of the land. That is the model prevailing at the moment. The Opposition is telling us that it has no truck with that model, that it will pursue immediately, with great dedication and commitment-and good luck to it-the alternative model. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are witnessing an example of the alternative model in operation-an alternative model operating in a very positive context and climate. I refer to a cooperative in which workers, who have part ownership, sit down with management and formulate propositions about their future in a very responsible way. That is a technique and an approach to industrial relations which I suggest is totally acceptable to everybody in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) said yesterday in answering a question, that approach is inherent in the present legislation. In section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act, there is acknowledgment of the fact that that is the best way of doing things. The Opposition is telling us that that is the only way of doing things and that in the final analysis those outcomes are irrevocable, beyond criticism and must be acceptable, irrespective of whether they begin to dismantle, undermine and erode fundamental standards, awards and conditions that have been hard won over a period of decades. In this context, the outcome may be fine. The consequences of the Opposition's model will be big winners and big losers. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want proof of whether or not deregulated labour produces big winners and big losers, we should look at the outcome even within the present model. Look at the change in the salary structures of executives in Australia over the last 18 months to two years. I have cited in this place over and over again the example of the managing director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia getting a 100 per cent increase in salary overnight. We have those particular outcomes for the big winners but, by heavens, I am fearful for the tea ladies at Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. I am fearful for the people who are, under the alternative system, not able to bring themselves together into larger combines than the enterprise will allow. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition would see unions 10-strong; it would see 10 weak people walking in, confronting a powerful, strong management and attempting to negotiate with it, and the outcomes would not be as positive and beneficial as those glossy outcomes that the Opposition was advocating and waving around in front of us as being the inevitable outcomes of the alternative model. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not happen to agree with Senator Kemp. Opposition members cannot accept the fact that people can legitimately hold other points of view. They accuse us of selling out and of dealing when we negotiate with a government of the day and arrive at sensible outcomes for legislation. They call that selling out. It is emotive rubbish, and it has to be seen for what it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that we are seeing here today propounded in an urgency motion what we predict will be the outcome of the alternative model-that is, the divide and conquer mentality, which requires people not to enlarge their organisations or to unite much beyond the enterprise level, and it is argued that inevitably the best outcomes will result from that. We do not believe that the best outcomes will result in all cases of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> If the workers are part owners, as they are at SPC, if the management is receptive, as it is at SPC, the outcomes are likely to be admirable. The Australian Democrats argue that those outcomes should be taken somewhere where they will be looked upon and judged as to whether they are in the best interests of the community at large; whether they are in the best interests of those who may not have as much power or who are not in as favourable circumstances as those at SPC. </PARA>
<PARA> John Howard was quoted as saying, `Give us a thousand Mudginberries'-give us a thousand situations of war, picketing and confrontation as a model. He would argue that that is the method we should use to put into the hands of Australian householders their assured income. We simply argue that there is only one way to ensure that the average Australian and the households of average Australians will be serviced with an adequate minimum income and will be guaranteed to work in safe conditions-conditions which are appropriate for the 1990s-and that is to have in place a centralised model supervised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; strong and independent of the Government and the unions; open-doored and open-minded; and fair and just. </PARA>
<PARA> That is exactly what we tried to assist this Government in enacting in this place approximately 10 days ago. It was the Democrats who pursued the interests of small organisations and individuals and who moved a whole series of amendments in pursuit of those principles-amendments which were opposed by the Opposition at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be very clear: the Australian Democrats are quite firm in their conviction that deregulated labour with small intensively divided unions will not produce outcomes which are in the best collective interests of Australia as a nation, of our economy, of Australian households, and even of individual Australians. It might seem to be appropriate at SPC today, in hard tough times, to let go hard won conditions and awards, but who is going to get them back? Who is going to be the arbiter? Who is going to be the umpire to ensure that those hard won awards, which are our minimum standards of living, are ever going to be obtained again if the divide and conquer model and mentality are put in place and laid on us over a period of two, three or five years? The hard won achievements of the last five decades or even eight or nine decades will be progressively eroded because individual workers believe that in the short term it is in their precise interests. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said in this brief debate-it has only been a debate in the community for the last week or so-that the SPC workers do in fact have the right to negotiate. Of course they have the right to negotiate about their own work circumstances, but they do not have the right to throw away the awards and conditions of people right across this country because they will not go to the legitimate umpire who is in place by the laws of the land. We simply do not accept the fact that it is inevitable, as the Opposition would argue, that enterprise bargaining will deliver better outcomes to Australian workers. We have grave fears that it will not. The big winners will be the people who are represented on this side of the chamber. The people in this country who are earning $200,000 and $300,000 a year have not made the sacrifices of the last four or five years that have been carried by the average Australian worker. The judgments have been supervised and imposed upon those workers by the Industrial Relations Commission. It should be quite clear to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and to those listening to this debate that we believe in a fair, just--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say is that Senator McLean does not have a clue what he is talking about. He spent the whole 10 minutes talking about disputation. That is not what this debate is about. The debate is about voluntary agreements between employers and employees. We have got the situation where unemployment is escalating beyond belief. We have been told that 10,500 people became unemployed last week, on top of the rising unemployment that we had last month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is saying that employers and employees have no right to come to an agreement on how to save both their jobs and their businesses. We have a recession that Mr Keating has acknowledged he deliberately engineered, and he tells us that he has got it under control. With 10,500 people unemployed last week? Some control! We have the highest number of bankruptcies ever in Australia. Yet the Minister's headlines in the Sydney Morning Herald on 13 December read `Hands off worker awards, says Govt'. That is just lovely, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelty says that, when people are trying to reach a voluntary agreement, the employees have said that they are happy to take a cut in conditions so long as the bosses take cuts too. He says, `We have to protect the work force from themselves. We cannot allow that to happen'. The arrogance is absolutely unbelievable. Mr Kelty knows better than any of the workers who are about to lose their jobs and who have trusted the employers on many occasions. The Government is forcing these voluntary agreements to go through a tremendous number of channels before they are finally rectified or agreed to and then only if the umpire agrees. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make it perfectly clear because neither Senator Cook nor Senator McLean-Senator McLean has the rudeness to walk out the chamber-will acknowledge that the situation that presently stands is one of the options that can remain under our policy. However, if the employers and the employees want to come to an agreement and do not want to have to go through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, then they are quite at liberty to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In our policy we say that if the employees want to be represented by a union or any other agent to negotiate with their employer, then they are entitled to do so. We will not allow the situation to occur where an employer would screw the workers down; that is not part of our policy. I also stress that in Australia at the moment because of this Government's wages accord there is a lack of productivity, which has resulted in the present decline in the living standards of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Power Brewing Co. Ltd because it is a very good example. The employer says, `If there is a productive work environment, people can be employed at a much better rate of wages'. The employee says, `That is fine, that suits us, it is a wonderful idea'. Ray Dempsey of the Trades and Labour Council of Queensland says, `You are a minority group who want secret sly deals and we will not allow it; we will not pander to you'. That is just lovely union work, is it not? The Government has stressed that it will not allow these situations to exist by the legislation it brought in last week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Freedom for employees and employers to negotiate what they like, freedom from interference by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, freedom from inflexibility and rigidities, freedom from the shackles of awards through voluntary agreements, everyone will be better off if we have freedom-that is the utopia that the Liberal and National parties opposite would have us believe. It is the sloganing of revolutionaries with sweeping rhetoric and unsubstantiated claims. It is a big lie and a big con. It is fatally flawed for three reasons that I will outline today: under the Opposition's system there would not be equal bargaining power; we do not know who or what is an employee; and there would be no supervision of the process that the Opposition insists would improve our standard of living in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to equal bargaining power, if an employer is allowed to bargain without any restrictions whatsoever with his or her employees, the employer is flanked by legal advisers, security firms and fancy public relations (PR) companies. We do not see any cutting of costs in those areas in the SPC Ltd case. The ultimate strength of the employer is to hire and fire. If that is what is allowed to occur at a workplace, in most workplaces in this country the employer will be dominant. He will be dominant because the bargaining unions will be so small-they will average no more than 10 or 15 employees in a union-that they will not have lawyers, security firms or PR firms. They will not even have the right to strike under the policy of the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>

Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber have suddenly discovered freedom, but it is freedom in one area only.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no wonder that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and Senator Sherry, whom we have just heard, have reacted so strongly against the voluntary agreement established between SPC Ltd and its employees. It is that agreement which makes this urgency motion moved today by the Opposition so timely. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The need for the Parliament to enable employers and employees to make voluntary agreements to determine the conditions of employment in their own work place without the intervention of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The SPC agreement is yet another nail in the coffin of the industrial relations club, of which the Minister is a life member, signalling its inevitable demise. It has demonstrated what I have been saying for a decade and what has been Liberal Party policy for at least five years: the best industrial relations is achieved when negotiations are undertaken at individual workplaces between employers and employees, making the present role of trade unions, employer organisations and that industrial dinosaur, the industrial relations club, largely irrelevant. We see the Minister and the union movement insisting that this agreement, voluntarily and logically agreed between consenting adults, should have to be ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission. His argument that workers, irrespective of the choice they make for themselves, require protection from rapacious employers is nothing more than rhetorical scaremongering. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in creating images of nineteenth century sweatshops instead of a twenty-first century flexible and streamlined industrial relations system, which Australia desperately requires if it is going to be able to compete in the world, demonstrates the utter bankruptcy of the Government's approach to industrial relations. There is no evidence of SPC being rapacious. Nor under the Liberal and National parties' industrial relations policy, which strongly endorses voluntary agreements, would there be scope for rapaciousness, as I will explain in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The real reason behind this Government's insistence that all agreements be ratified by the Commission is simply to protect the vested interests of the industrial relations club, to protect the power and privilege of union officials and to protect the power and privilege of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is neither necessary nor practical for voluntary agreements to be ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission. If the employer and employees at each of Australia's 750,000 or so small and medium-sized businesses reached voluntary agreements, how long do honourable senators think it will take for these to be ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission if that was required? It would take years. That alone demonstrates the nonsense of the Government's position. Or is the Government promoting a commission hearings-led recovery from recession, creating non-productive jobs for all the advocates, research workers and other hangers-on in the system?</PARA>
<PARA> A key plank of the coalition's industrial relations policy in relation to voluntary agreements is the requirement that agreements must provide for the relevant minimum award rate of pay calculated as an hourly rate. In other words, there will be no sweated labour under our policy; a fair rate of pay will be mandatory. The extras will be voluntarily negotiable-hours of work, overtime rates, holidays, productivity bonuses, profit sharing agreements and so on, as has been the case with the SPC deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy also guarantees that employees may appoint agents, such as a trade union or an expert individual consultant negotiator, to represent them and negotiate on their behalf. One SPC employee claimed last week, `We want the union to do what we want'. This aspect of our policy, to guarantee a choice for employees to appoint agents on their behalf, will ensure that that is the case. Unlike this Government's laws, which through the `conveniently belong' clause and the requirement for a minimum union size of 10,000 prevents employees having a real choice between unions to represent them, the coalition will allow such a genuine choice, requiring unions to offer real service and expertise to employees to attract members. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia desperately needs an industrial relations system that promotes industrial harmony and cooperation between employers and employees. Voluntary agreements will encourage direct negotiations between employers and employees and will weld communication between them based on their mutual interests and the uniqueness of their enterprise. It is not acceptable to preserve a centrally determined award at the expense of jobs. We must lay to rest the Henry Bournes Higgins' awards of 80 years ago. </PARA>

<PARA> There have been discussions here today. It might be as well to look at what the High Court of Australia has to say about this issue. After all, that is the body which, standing above all, reaches conclusions on the facts as they are presented. In Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union of Australia v. Melbourne Corporation, Mr Justice Isaacs, who later became the first Australian born Governor-General of this country, and Mr Justice Rich said:</PARA>
<PARA>This, which is the irresistible conclusion from a broad survey of the stream of industrial effort, is emphasized by the views of Mr Sidney Webb in a recent work. The ``industrial revolution'' for a long time made the workman's labour a mere marketable commodity to be bought at the lowest price that individual competition between workers would permit. The degradation and suffering that ensued, the revolt against the system, the repression of illegal acts, the amelioration of the law, the organization of labour, the gradual recognition of collective bargaining, the introduction of private conciliation and arbitration as well as of industrial laws securing better conditions for workers, are all well-known historical facts.</PARA>
<PARA>Their Honours were at pains to point out that if the only thing that a worker has to sell is his labour then he is subject to that competition which has the effect of forcing his and her wages and conditions down to the point where the fearsome results that their Honours talk about result. The problem for the argument advanced opposite is to explain why that would not occur again if there were not some organisation that enabled the workers, as Senator Sherry has so eloquently said, to have some equality in the bargaining position with their employers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a ramification to that, their Honours in the later case of McGuire v. Union Steamship Co. of New Zealand, in talking about workers compensation, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Next, as to the history of the measure. The pressure of the disability of workmen was constantly increasing. The advancing complication of industry in many occupations vitally altered in practice the relative positions of employer and workman. In connection with another but cognate branch of the law, we have recently made reference to this change.</PARA>
<PARA>If we sacrifice the part played by unions in industrial relations there is the threat that we will sacrifice their part in maintaining safety in industry and getting fair compensation for workers who are injured. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the Opposition understands the full implication of what it says. The implication is there in that case: not only is the workers' industrial strength prejudiced but so too is his and her ability to get fair compensation for the injuries they receive at work. Finally, the Industrial Relations Commission says that unions--</PARA>

Firstly, I suggest that Senator McLean reads our policy-I am quite happy to give him a copy-because he would find out just how wrong he is. The second point is that the Minister threw down the gauntlet and said that we did not stand for upholding the law. I point out in this chamber that in my experience-as he well knows-not only have I been involved in legal cases against the union movement but also against employers and the Government, of which he is a member. I make it quite clear that when we talk about upholding the law his Government is not above board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One cannot let the references to Mud- ginberri go by without comment. Senator Cooney obviously does not understand what happened in Mudginberri. The award under which Mudginberri was operating, established before Commissioner MacKenzie, was the Northern Territory meat award. I want to point out to this chamber that Mudginberri was always terminal. Its termination was hastened very greatly because after the Mudginberri dispute got through the courts there was an increased effort, which was facilitated by this very Government, to have the buffalo which were to be supplied to those works shot out through the tuberculosis and brucellosis program. That is on record and I want to reinforce it right here and now. To talk about Mudginberri being a failure in terms of this debate is absolutely and totally inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate has been brought on because of a productivity agreement with regard to SPC Ltd. What is it about? It is about preserving jobs, preserving an Australian company and sharing in the profits. I want to ask some questions about this. I want to ask where the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is. Why is he not speaking out on behalf of the workers? Is it not ironic? He fought for his job last week. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission was not involved, but I bet the Australian Council of Trade Unions was. Where is the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook? He has left the chamber. All we hear from him is a warning to SPC not to break the rules. We hear continual reference to the umpire, an umpire which has been totally disregarded in industrial relations in this country for many years. Mudginberri highlights that, as does the current situation with the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, Wally Curran and the meat dispute. We talk about an umpire which one side obeys and the other side ignores. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Minister not bring an emergency Bill before us-a Bill for commonsense in industrial relations; a Bill which allows management and employees to agree on how they will operate, which allows for productivity increases, which allows for profit sharing and which allows for enterprise agreements to be established on the shop floor; a Bill which allows management and employees to protect the enterprise; and a Bill which protects the jobs of people in the enterprise. I particularly want to note section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It says under `Certified agreements':</PARA>
<PARA> If the parties to an industrial dispute . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is no industrial dispute with SPC. The parties sat down and worked out the best way to preserve their position and their jobs. We on this side of the chamber will sit here all night if necessary to ensure that commonsense can operate in the industrial relations arena to enable employers and employees to make voluntary agreements without the intrusion of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the unions or employer organisations. But it would destroy the Minister's union bosses' power base, his preferential clauses for unionists and his beautiful big unions. It would introduce voluntary unionism and create enterprise unions; it would make the Australian Democrats, who sold their souls last week when they assisted the Government in getting its Industrial Relations Bill through, look silly. Where is Bill Kelty? He is only interested in enshrining union power. What of John Halfpenny? He would sooner throw 300 jobs on the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at why genuine enterprise agreements and genuine enterprise unions cannot be established in Australia. It is because we have enshrined in legislation that the players must be the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and big unions. Let us look at the situation in Western Australia right now. The front page of the West Australian reports 450 companies which will go broke. Would they not love the opportunity to sit down and work out an arrangement whereby they could survive in their jobs?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two areas that I want to consider in the time that I have today. I intend to consider the proposal submitted by Senator Durack on the ground of whether it is desirable for the Australian industrial relations system and I also wish to look at some of the more disturbing aspects of the dispute currently occurring at SPC Ltd. I will start with the SPC dispute. The Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Howard, said in the Herald-Sun today about the dispute:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essential facts are quite straightforward. Due to the recession and the huge problems of the canning industry, the company, SPC, is doing badly. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard was half right. The essential facts are straightforward. But he managed to get them wrong. In yesterday's Australian Financial Review, SPC's new chairman, John Corboy explained what the essential facts were. He blamed the company's poor financial state on poor decisions of the previous board, all of which showed a business flair more closely associated with companies like Elders IXL Ltd or Bond Corporation than the local cannery. The results were similar: a debt ridden company servicing the banks. That is a far cry from the portrayal of the company which the Opposition and Mr Howard favour and which the media has, in all but a few cases, accepted without question-that of a local company in a bit of trouble, with workers and management pitching in to save it from the horrible recession of the Hawke Labor Government, a sort of `Mr Smith goes to Shepparton'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is truly wonderful what a good public relations firm can do these days. SPC, despite its parlous financial state, seems to have enough money to pay for International Public Relations Ltd (IPR) to do its public relations. IPR is, just by the way, a firm which has been described by the Minister as having New Right connections. I understand that it is accommodating enough to brief journalists on appropriate angles to adopt in reporting the story. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only can SPC afford to pay for a public relations firm; it can also afford to commission a Morgan gallup poll to prove to all and sundry that popular support is on the company's side. At this rate, SPC might have to renegotiate its agreement with its workers by Christmas to reduce labour costs further to pay for all this recent expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that appeals to me more than any other is that there is no question that SPC is in a financial mess and that this situation has existed for some time. Last year, for instance, a $2.3m loss was recorded. What austerity measures were implemented then? The directors recommended that their fees be increased by 7.5 per cent. Average weekly earnings rose by only 6.3 per cent in that year. Overall, directors' fees during the year rose from $289,023 to $368,683, an increase of 27.6 per cent. Honourable senators will not be surprised to learn that those austerity measures failed, so the workers are forced to wear it. </PARA>
<PARA> Did the company use the processes which have so recently and successfully been used by a number of different enterprises, including Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and ICI Australia, to vary their awards? No. SPC called a meeting of its permanent employees and rushed through a deal. There was no input from the seasonal workers, who will lose about $25 a week because of this. There was no consultation with the unions involved. So now we have a blue and the Opposition sees its chance. It finally has a practical example for its four-year-old industrial relations policy. Hewson is on a plane before someone can say `enterprise bargaining'. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make two brief points about the policy. First, the Opposition apparently thinks that the Industrial Relations Commission is an inappropriate body to approve variations of awards and that only parties involved should participate. They want, in effect, to kill the umpire. The Opposition must come to terms with the fact that the industrial relations system is not made up of level playing fields. In some situations the employers have the upper hand-for instance, right now in Shepparton. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating an urgency motion put down by the Opposition:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Parliament to enable employers and employees to make voluntary agreements to determine the conditions of employment in their own work place without the intervention of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the key words: `without the invention of the Industrial Relations Commission'. My comments will be made on the basis of this urgency motion and the words that are used therein. I will not be referring to the comments that have been made thus far by speakers from the Government, the Opposition or the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I feel that the Opposition probably does not mean to support the precise wording of the urgency motion. The last time I really heard such a proposition put very strongly was in the 1970s. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, when there was low unemployment and high demand for labour, this call for workers and employers to decide their conditions without reference to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it was then, was made by the Communist Party and the hard Left. They were the ones who were calling for the Arbitration Commission to cease interfering in the relationships between employers and employees. They were the ones who wanted the shop committees to be the determinant factor and then to come up with agreements with employers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, that was at a time when the balance was in favour of the workers because of the low unemployment situation and the high demand for labour. I well recall the arguments that occurred in the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the State executive, of which I was a member at that time. We stood for an orderly system of industrial progress, which meant that there should be an umpire. </PARA>
<PARA> That was envisaged by the founding fathers of the Commonwealth in the Constitution. Section 51(xxxv.) of the Constitution clothes the Commonwealth Parliament with the power to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. The system of conciliation and arbitration found favour initially with the trade union movement because of the problems the trade union movement had then, because workers were exploited in the early part of this century. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the system of conciliation and arbitration is deeply embedded into national consciousness as being worthy of protection, preservation and improvement. I am concerned with the last part of this urgency motion which indicates that people can do away with the intervention of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on important award matters. This could give rise to another demand, if not for the abolition of the system, then for the complete undermining of it. I remind the Opposition that the only time the system was put to the test electorally was in 1929 when the Bruce Government went to the people on a platform of destroying arbitration. It was the Bruce Government that was destroyed and the Labor Government, standing for the protection of the system, was elected. </PARA>
<PARA> I have grave questions on the policy of the Government at this stage in respect of the amalgamation of unions. I have expressed those in another debate, but I believe--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Honey Research Council on its annual report and the work it does in trying to increase commercial returns to members of the honey industry by improving the production, processing, storage, transport and marketing of honey and other bee products. Although not much in the public eye, the honey industry is quite impressive, as total recorded production of honey for the 12 months to the end of June this year was 22,619 tonnes, with exports totalling 12,637 tonnes. This is slightly down on the figure from the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> The domestic scene in the honey industry, I have to admit, is becoming quite exciting. The range of honeys on the Australian market is staggering. Created exclusively from a combination of bees, flowers and sunshine, honey is one of the few truly natural foods remaining. Australia's long hours of sunshine and its great selection of native trees and ground flora have given us a marvellous selection of unique floral honey varieties. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because the beekeeping industry is relatively small in size and number, it is often ignored by government. It is not a large industry and it does not have a lot of money. We therefore have to be ever vigilant to keep an eye on ensuring that beekeepers stay in business and have them look after the agricultural crops that we need them for so desperately. A healthy beekeeping industry is absolutely essential. For example, as the report notes, the industry is very much tied to circumstances out of its control. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Council has identified the loss, or potential loss, of traditional nectar and pollen sources as the single major problem confronting the honey industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This erosion of the resource base has a number of distinct and unrelated causes including clearing for forested country; clear felling for timber production; uncontrolled burning; biological control of salvation Jane, blackberry and thistles; rural dieback; and conversion of Crown land to reserves or national park status. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, it is in Australia's interest to maintain a viable honey industry and it therefore worries me that, according to the Australian Honey Board, the decline in real incomes of Australian honey producers continues to be of concern. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The main influences on price remain the level of the world bulk market for honey in US dollars, the Australian and US exchange rate and demand on the domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA>It states further:</PARA>
<PARA>Domestic operating costs continued to grow as a result of inflation and high interest charges. </PARA>
<PARA>It is vital, therefore, under such adverse conditions that we do all that we can to maintain the strength of the industry by watching the effect of economic factors and monitoring the importation not only of honey produce but also of diseases. Of concern to many in the industry is the importation of honey from countries where the chalk brood disease is endemic. This disease is of some concern to beekeepers and is regarded as a serious exotic disease by the Australian beekeeping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, however, in reply to a number of questions in the Senate on this issue by some of my colleagues has dismissed these concerns by saying that internationally chalk brood is not regarded as a major infectious disease of honey bees. Of course it is not. Nearly every country in the world has it and nothing is being done about trying to get rid of it. But I say to the Government that Australia does not have it and our beekeepers do not want it. It is quite a nasty complaint and it affects the effectiveness and profitability of beekeeping. The beekeepers of Australia deserve to be given more support. They deserve to be supported as an industry in their own right and for what they do for agriculture generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that there is no doubting the importance of the Honey Research Council and its work. I commend it for the tremendous job it is doing in addressing the research needs of the industry, and I have very great pleasure in taking note of this report today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to fill the Senate in on a remark which was passed by Senator Bjelke-Petersen a moment ago on honey. She mentioned in passing that the task of apiarists has been made more difficult because of the loss of sources of nectar. Among the sources which she mentioned was salvation jane. Honourable senators will recall that a vigorous campaign was waged by apiarists against the biological control of salvation jane because it is indeed a good source of nectar and quite a good source of honey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is not generally known, and what I should like to put on the record, is that salvation Jane contains a class of very toxic agents called pyrollizide alkaloids. Those alkaloids are known liver toxins and are potent carcinogens. Indeed, when bees collect the nectar from salvation Jane and take it back to the hive to turn it into honey, those pyrollizide alkaloids turn up in the honey in quite significant concentrations. </PARA>
<PARA> It was certainly of great distress to me to see that during the several years in which the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation was attempting to introduce biological control of salvation Jane-which is also very toxic to a number of animals, particularly horses, because of its liver toxicity-apiarists were fighting for that particular resource and the public was not being informed that honey from that source contained quite significant amounts of these alkaloids and therefore posed a cancer risk for people eating that honey. So we need to be aware that even with a substance as natural as honey-to pick up Senator Bjelke-Petersen's words-there are a number of natural products which do carry risks, and honey happens to be one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the biological control of salvation Jane has been introduced. While that might reduce the flow of honey, it will not be detrimental to Australians in general because, presumably, the honey they are getting now from other sources is safer to eat. This is a very useful object lesson to put on the record. Very shortly we will be debating the therapeutic goods regulations. Much of the lobbying which is going on in relation to that legislation is to the effect that natural products are automatically safe and good and should not be regulated in any way. Honey collected from salvation Jane is just one example among many of a `natural' product consumption of which carries with it a very significant risk of developing cancer. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>During this year the water storage levels in the Snowy Mountains scheme have increased considerably. Following release from storage, the Murray River system received 1.269 gigalitres and the Murrumbidgee 1.408 gigalitres. </PARA>
<PARA> The Snowy Mountains scheme is probably the biggest engineering project that Australia has ever undertaken. It was the first big project after the Second World War. The scheme has been of immense benefit to the Australian economy not only in terms of the production of electricity but also in terms of the amount of water made available for irrigation purposes in agricultural regions. I visited the scheme about two years ago and I could not believe the size of it. I was amazed at the foresight that Australia had in 1948, so soon after the war, even to think of undertaking such a project. The earthmoving machinery that was used then would have been manufactured either prior to or during World War II and would not have had anywhere near the capacity of modern plant. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt whether a feasibility study carried out on such a scheme today would ever get past the drawing board stage because of the restrictions imposed by environmental and radical groups. I am strongly of the opinion that such a scheme would not go ahead today. </PARA>
<PARA> Water from the scheme irrigates land extending from Gundagai right out to Griffith. I estimate that it irrigates an area of approximately 150 kilometres by 200 kilometres. As such, it must rank as one of the major irrigation systems of the world. Nowhere in the world have I seen such a large area of good agricultural ground which lacks only sufficient rainfall. The production of electricity and water for irrigation is certainly a memorial to the people who thought of this scheme in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay tribute to the founders of the Snowy Mountains scheme and the people who brought it to fruition. I notice that a reunion was held on 17 October 1989 to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the scheme. Two and a half thousand present and former workers turned up at Jindabyne for a picnic. This, no doubt, was a fitting way to celebrate such an occasion. As I said, the scheme is truly a credit to engineering in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion I am drawn to look at the figures that relate to Commonwealth Government expenditure in Queensland. It was only yesterday that the Vice-Chancellor of the Queensland University of Technology said that higher education in Queensland was underfunded by at least 3,000 places. The Commonwealth's paper in 1988 said that Commonwealth funding of higher education in Queensland fell short by something like 4,000 places. There is a definite need for a greater contribution to higher education funding in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic in one way that I rise to speak on this report today because it was only yesterday that my sister, who finished high school this year, received her tertiary entrance score. She was one of the lucky ones because she received a score sufficient to get her into the course that she wishes to study. The thing that concerns me is that tertiary entrance scores are going up year after year. It is much more difficult now to get into, for example, law, advertising or journalism than it was eight years ago when I left school. I am very concerned that it will become increasingly difficult for next year's high school students or students another seven or eight years down the track. This is a matter that is of great concern to me, as I know it is a matter of great concern to many students and parents. </PARA>
<PARA> When we debated this matter in the Senate some two weeks ago, I asked the Parliamentary Research Service to do an analysis of Commonwealth expenditure on higher education as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The analysis shows that in the last year of the coalition Government expenditure on higher education was 1.01 per cent of GDP. Yet it has shrunk to 0.81 per cent of GDP under a government that says it is interested in making Australia a clever country. This shows the sad fact that under the Australian Labor Party, under Hawke and Keating, funding of higher education has in fact shrunk if it is measured in terms of the investment of this nation's production into the production of the future. I believe that is a sad indictment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take this opportunity to raise the matter of a separate university campus in Cairns. At the moment there is no dedicated university campus in Cairns, and it is a matter of much concern to the students who are forced to study there. The Government's own figures show that the participation rate in higher education in north Queensland falls substantially below the national average. While in north Queensland the participation rate is 12 per 1,000, in places like Canberra it is 30 per 1,000. It is very clear that there is a desperate need for a separate campus in Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government on building projects for higher education. In fact, there are three building projects for James Cook University. One involves $195,794 for general purpose academic buildings; another $500,000 for a library extension; and the third $500,000 for contributions to students' residence. Those are all very important, but I want to know why there is not an item in that report that says `Expenditure on a campus site for a university in Cairns', because it is sadly lacking at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The student numbers in Cairns justify a separate campus site. I believe that many members of the Government benches would probably recognise the fact that a separate campus in Cairns is desperately needed. We have a catchment area there of something like 175,000 people, yet the university is forced to share a site with the college of advanced education. This is not satisfactory. There is much potential in Cairns for very specialised courses that will add to the employment prospects of young people in the Cairns area, especially in areas such as hospitality, rainforest research and marine biology research. This will never become a reality while the Government refuses to fund the separate campus which is so desperately needed by the people of Cairns. It is a long way to go from Cairns to Townsville, and any suggestion that it is possible for people to just travel down to Townsville for their afternoon elective is ridiculous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on its annual report for 1989-90 and commend it on the vital part it plays in the lives of most Australians. However, there are two issues I would like to raise about programming decisions that the ABC has made in the past year, both of which I feel, as a mother and a grandmother and as someone who is from the country, are uncalled for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only last August I raised one of these issues in Question Time, namely, the proposed cuts to certain children's programs. I am pleased to say that I was reassured that the Corporation does not intend to axe the program Play School but it has, unfortunately, axed other quality school education programs. I find it amusing that the Corporation boasts on page 34:</PARA>
<PARA> Children's programs are strongly Australian. Play School has become increasingly multicultural . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is all well and good, but what about its other programming cuts? After almost 60 years on the airwaves, ABC radio broadcasting to schools is to cease. After 30 years, a large part of the ABC's excellent television programming for schools is also to be axed. The reason, as ever, is money and the chief losers will be children. I regret this very much indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has stopped buying educational programs from overseas and stopped making local programs except, thankfully, for the very popular programs Behind the News, Asiawide and For the Juniors. Radio singing programs for children, from which the ABC sells about 200,000 accompanying song books a year, will be scrapped, as will the preschool radio program Ticklepot which has won three international awards. It is ironic that these cuts to aids to learning should be made during the International Year of Literacy. On page 24 of the report the ABC boasts of its contribution to the international literacy year by claiming that:</PARA>
<PARA>Radio National supported the ABC's contribution to international literacy year and a radio promotion distributed to over 300 commercial and public stations advertised the ABC's starter kits for adults with literacy problems netting more than 3200 requests for the free package during the three month campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>Yes, difficult and painful decisions had to be made on the areas in which money could be saved and, yes, children's programs are expensive because good children's radio and television require more care than do most programs for adults. But, given the concerns about the level of violence in society, it is inexcusable to reduce further the already small range of good television programs for children. </PARA>
<PARA> The cuts will cause particular hardship to children and teachers in isolated rural schools and those living in poorer areas. Country people for whom the programs have helped to compensate for a lack of resources in small schools have also found them useful in helping to alleviate their social and geographical isolation. If program cuts are essential the ABC board should look at the cutting of children's programs as the last, not the first, resort. The ending of these programs is a destructive decision which is made more ironic because it has happened in the International Year of Literacy and at a time when we are trying to be the clever country. I believe these comments are very worthwhile indeed and I have pleasure in supporting the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have circulated an amendment in my name, which is in three parts. In drafting these amendments and coming up with this set of words I hoped to create a situation whereby students would be able to indicate on their enrolment forms their desire, on any grounds, to choose whether to join any campus-based association and whereby it would be up to the institution or various associations within the institution to furnish information about their services and activities in order to encourage membership. A related amendment would ensure that the students are given full itemisation of the annual student services fee at the time of enrolment so that they knew what they were letting themselves in for. On that enrolment form students could elect whether or not to join any association. Students who chose not to join any association would not contribute to its funding and therefore would not subsidise activities of which they disapproved. Under this amendment, students would still pay the full student fee and this would go into a fund for services and amenities, but it would not be for the benefit of any association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further amendment to the proposed new section 107a would, instead of supporting the imposition and collection of fees for student organisations, actually prevent State interference in the imposition and collection of fees for the provision of student services and amenities as determined by the institution. There has been a considerable amount of input into this particular amendment, which is seeking to do those things which I described. During the process of drafting this amendment we were given information to the effect that it would be quite difficult to achieve our stated aims. Other information was given to the effect that no matter which way we drafted the amendment it would be very difficult to achieve those aims and that in fact the amendment would achieve different aims from the ones we had set out to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> It has now reached the stage where the amendment which has been circulated in my name, because it would operate immediately, would create a situation whereby the institutions would not be able to comply with the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 if it was passed, because they would be unable to comply with the measures that we require in this amendment, that is, giving the enrolling students all of this information, because in fact universities are enrolling students now. I see that as a minor problem-perhaps an administrative one-which could be rectified. But other problems are associated with this matter as proposed in our amendment and, as disappointing as it may be for me, I propose to withdraw the amendment. I am attempting to make the point that this amendment is something which we hold very dear. The Australian Democrats want to be able to devise a scheme whereby students are able to choose whether of not they will join a political association on the campus. But it appears that we are not able to do it at this stage and I therefore withdraw the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>1. Clause 3, page 2, proposed paragraph 107a (1) (a), lines 5 and 6, omit ``that represents the interests generally of students at the institution'', substitute ``or body that provides services and amenities for students at the institution''. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Clause 3, page 2, after proposed subsection 107a (1), insert the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA>  ``(1a) A payment under this Act to a State for the purpose of financial assistance is granted on the conditions that the State will not, in respect of the year to which the payment relates, make any payment to an institution unless:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the institution permits students at the institution a choice as to whether they become or remain members of any club, society or other organisation associated with the institution; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the institution provides to each student at the institution, at the time of enrolment or re-enrolment for that year, a complete breakdown of the way in which amounts raised by fees (including fees for an organisation that represents generally the interests of students at the institution) will be spent during that year.''. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Clause 3, page 2, proposed subsections 107a (2), (3) and (4), lines 8 to 21, omit the subsections. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition sees this Australian Democrats' initiative as certainly superior to the unamended Bill. Earlier today, I indicated privately to Senator Bell that the Opposition would support his amendments. They will certainly enable students to make a clearer choice. We have argued all along that this Bill is intolerable to the Opposition because by coercion the Government is seeking to gain the Parliament's approval to deny choice to students. I could speak at some length, even 15 minutes, to give the kinds of reasons that I had supposed Senator Bell was putting forward in support of his amendments. I appeal to Senator Bell, Senator Powell-to the Democrats generally-not to be bluffed by this Government, but to stick to their guns and support an initiative that they have rightly taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Bell's remarks on the practical consequence of enrolment requirements on education institutions in 1991. This is a practical procedure that can be sensibly worked out. The first amendment seeks a change in the definition with regard to students at an institution; that is, any body `that represents the interests generally of students at the institution' will be substituted by `or body that provides services and amenities for students at the institution'. That can be argued. No evidence has been brought before us that would deny that amendment. The Government has been applying some undue pressure upon the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I wish to record that the Opposition's position is to reject this Bill entirely. Our support for the Democrats' amendments is on the ground that they are much closer to our position of maximising choice for students than is the Bill unamended. Accordingly, I have moved the three amendments originally circulated in the name of the Democrats. </PARA>

The accusation has been made that the Australian Democrats have been leant on in some way by the Government. That is an outrageous accusation.

Our major concern is that, on a closer inspection of the amendments and not being able to amend them further to our satisfaction in the time we have available, if we were to move these amendments we would be moving down the path of the Opposition's agenda. That was the view I arrived at in my office a few minutes ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It did not surprise me at all when Senator Teague moved these amendments. That is positive proof that we made the right decision. These amendments advance the Opposition's agenda to a degree which is unacceptable to us. We want more time, which is not available to us today. Therefore we are not moving these amendments in the committee stage, even though they have been circulated. We are prepared to continue to work towards our own agenda to provide genuine choice, but not to destroy the student union movement or, if we refer to earlier debate in this chamber, the union movement in general. </PARA>
<PARA> We know what the Opposition's agenda is and we are not prepared to go down that track. We are prepared to continue the work. This is the last week before Christmas, we are in a guillotine situation and time is not available. We have just had a romp by the Opposition, a union bash in this place. If we had extra time available to debate this substantive legislation, maybe we could have come up with the right sort of proposition. The Democrats have worked hard, as have Senator Bell and his staff. We will continue to work hard not to advance the Opposition's agenda or the Government's agenda but, in this specific case, to advance the interests of tertiary students throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That so much of standing order 142 be suspended as would prevent further consideration of the Bill, or the stage of the Bill without limitation of time. </PARA>
<PARA>I do so pursuant to contingent notice of motion No. 24, standing in my name on the Notice Paper. This is essentially to provide time for the Committee to consider the question currently before it. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Senator Bell is indicating that there is not sufficient time at this stage to tidy up the amendments so as to give effect to the clear intention that has been indicated by the Australian Democrats on this matter. They have said in a previous debate that their intention is to ensure that certain freedom is allowed to tertiary students. They had indicated that arrangements would be made for the preparation of amendments to give effect to that. Now we are told that in the last day the drafting facilities that are available to them have not been sufficient to enable that to be done. If that is the case, then I suggest that we should give them the time and the facilities to ensure the preparation of the amendments. That is the reason I move this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite obviously, we need now to report progress and sit to consider this matter again on the next day of sitting. I think that would give sufficient time to get together sufficient parliamentary draftsmen to ensure that the intention of the Democrats is properly reflected in amendments that can be put before the Committee. I think the situation with which we are faced at the moment is entirely unsatisfactory, given the fact that we were not promised but given an indication on the previous States grants legislation that an amendment would be coming forward. So I urge the Committee to adopt my motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Senator Harradine's motion, as usual we can rely upon Senator Harradine to bring to the chamber a degree of experience and fair consideration. He has done so again on this occasion. I thank him for attempting to contrive a situation by which this matter can be brought to some sort of resolution. I just make the point that it is not a matter of needing half an hour, an hour or a couple of days to resolve this problem. This amendment, which was originally circulated in my name and which has now been moved by Senator Teague, has in fact been a couple of months in the genesis. In that time, the negotiations which have taken place with the Government and the Opposition have been extensive and quite far-reaching. As a matter of fact, not 20 minutes ago the shadow Minister for education, Dr Kemp, spoke to me on the phone from Sydney and pointed out the inadequacies of this amendment as it stood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot continue proper negotiations in the time available. Senator Teague may be able to pursue that. But the negotiations necessary to be undertaken with the Government and everybody else to get this amendment passed by the Senate would, I think, be fairly fruitless. So I say to Senator Harradine, through you, Mr Chairman, thank you very much for attempting to bring this amendment on. I think there is more to it than that, and I think we would only be wasting further time of the Senate if this matter were pursued now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 seeks to extend the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation. The Federation was deregistered by legislation five years ago in April 1986. That deregistration will expire in 1991. This Bill extends that deregistration for another five years from April 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition will not be opposing this proposal by the Government. The reasons for this measure are set out in the second reading speech and are notoriously well known throughout Australia. The Builders Labourers Federation at the Federal level has not met its obligations under the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It has in fact pursued a campaign of intimidation, thuggery and general disruption of the relations between employer and employee in the building and construction industry. Its record is such that it deserved to be deregistered many years ago-not as recently as 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were in government, we commenced proceedings to effect deregistration of that union through the ordinary legal processes. We were frustrated in our efforts to achieve that result. It was on foot and still being pursued when the present Government was elected in February 1983. By that time, the Cain Government in Victoria had already been elected and had pulled the plug on that State's participation in the joint Federal and State effort to achieve deregistration through due process. When the Hawke Government was elected, it abandoned those proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years later we have the Government back in this House directly seeking this fast track method of deregistration by the Parliament. So there has been a complete turnaround. In fact, the Government turned around its attitude on this subject further than we would ever have expected it to by using the pretty draconian method of parliamentary deregistration rather than the proposal we were pursuing of deregistration through the due processes of the Act. Nevertheless, the Opposition did support and still supports such a procedure because it firmly believes in the result, namely, the deregistration of this rogue union. </PARA>
<PARA> We have some concerns about this piece of legislation. Firstly, its effect at the Federal and State level could well enhance the position of the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia (BWIU), which has the major coverage now in the Federal area and is extending its role very strongly in the States. That union's industrial record is not a good one. It perhaps does not equal that of the Builders Labourers Federation, or the BLF, as it is better known. Nevertheless, its activities have resulted in a royal commission in New South Wales because of concerns about its power in that State. The BWIU is also seeking to extend its power in other States, particularly in Western Australia, where it has proceedings on foot to gain coverage. The legislation could stifle the ability of the Western Australian State-registered BLF to resist that intervention in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has made some efforts to meet that situation. The Bill was amended in the other place to enable some delay in its effect. The Opposition welcomes that. I would like the Minister in his reply, if he has the time, to explain more fully exactly what he has in mind and what he hopes the result will be in Western Australia. It seems to us that the Western Australian BLF-the State registered body which has been permitted to continue; it is not affected by the deregistration of the Federal body-should have the right to put up a case to resist the attempt to take over its role in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Minister is hoping some result will be achieved in respect of those proceedings. I would be particularly concerned to know what they are. However, the Opposition will not be opposing this Bill because of that, although we believe that those proceedings ought to be allowed to proceed. Although the legislation extends the right of a State-registered association to resist those sorts of proceedings in the future, ironically it does seem to prevent those that have already been commenced from continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also widely extends the definition of non-registered associations, the members of which may have had a close association with the BLF in the past, may be having a close association with it now or may have a close association with it in the future. These provisions are no doubt necessary to stop a backdoor method of a majority of existing members of the BLF in the Federal area getting around the deregistration of the existing union. I appreciate that such associations are required. But I point out that the net has been cast very much wider than under the previous deregistration Act. It will be very much more difficult for any rival union to the BWIU to get registration at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this legislation and the amalgamation legislation, it looks as though the BWIU is set to become a mega, monster union throughout Australia. That in itself has real problems as far as we in the Opposition are concerned. Those matters perhaps should be ones for another day and another debate, particularly in view of the short time available to me. With those comments, I indicate that the Opposition will support this measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Durack has said that this legislation is somewhat draconian but that he will support it. It would be fair to say that he is not alone in being alarmed about the Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. As with much of the legislation that goes through Parliament, it is a question of balance. He spoke about the activities of the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia. I hope that was not a precursor to a suggestion that the same sort of penalties be imposed upon that union or any other union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation should be seen as a very isolated piece of legislation. There is no doubt that there is a penalty imposed here. It is clear that it is a penalty to extend the period of deregistration for a union. As a matter of convention, the penalty should not be imposed without proper process. It is not simply a matter of a convention; it goes to the very heart of the way we see ourselves as a society. Penalties should not be imposed without there being due process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a risk in imposing a penalty without some sort of process preceding it. That precedence will be set up and the fabric of the society in which we exist will be affected adversely in some way. The test of a humane, tolerant, decent and just society is not whether it deals with the beautiful and the young and the supposedly good according to the proper process but whether it does so with the ugly, the ageing and the supposedly bad. It is easy to be fair to those with whom we have empathy. It is much harder, and accordingly much more necessary, to be fair to those who stir no feelings of sympathy within us. The true test of any process and the true test of any society is how it deals with those people that the predominant balance of society says should be treated in a harsh manner, in an adverse way. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not set up those proper processes there is a danger that a wrong can be done. Even in this case, where the evidence seems to be so overwhelming against the Builders Labourers Federation, one has only to read the judgment of Mr Justice Beach in the decision that he handed down in Melbourne on 15 November 1990. That was the case of Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd and Others v. John Sector and Others. In his judgment he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Pausing at this point, I should say that the dispute has been categorized in certain quarters as a dispute between Leightons and the Builders Labourers Federation (the BLF). Based upon the material before me, I do not accept that this is necessarily so. Members of a number of unions, including the BLF, are involved in the dispute. It seems to me that the dispute may well have been so categorized simply to lend colour to it and make it more notorious than it otherwise would be. </PARA>
<PARA>What I want to draw from that is that when we jump to conclusions, when we assume a situation lies a particular way on what seems to be overwhelming evidence, we should be concerned to ensure that there is some sort of process imposed between an initial reaction and a final judgment to ensure that that initial reaction is right. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am arguing here, and what I want to put on the record in the light of Senator Durack's statement, is that it is the position of the Government that as a matter of course it desires to see that a proper process is put in place and used before a penalty is imposed. It is a question of civil liberties, and civil liberties have a lot to do with process. Process seems to be a dry instrument at times. Our sessional orders, the orders of the Senate generally and the rules of the various courts, are there for one purpose, that is, to ensure that people get a fair go. The only way that can be done is to set up particular processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, will be supporting the Bill, but it does so conscious of the problems that exist in legislation such as this. It is not to be seen as a precedent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's position is that the conclusions drawn from the earlier proceedings are still fresh. Those conclusions were drawn on evidence at that time. The Government sees those conclusions based on that evidence as being sufficiently fresh to justify the proceedings it has now taken. Senator Durack may dispute that. The point that we have to take from this particular Bill is that it must be isolated because it does contain some fearsome precedents.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill we are debating now-the Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990-is an extraordinary Bill. This Bill will prohibit any application for registration by the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) or any other non-registered association for an extra period of five years, until 14 April 1996. In other words, the Bill will exclude the Federation from the normal processes of application which we have devoted so much to formulating-the very processes that Senator Cooney has said are so important. This will take this particular application outside of that context and treat it separately. In that sense it is an extraordinary piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is extraordinary in other respects as well. It will expand the definition of `non-registered' to proscribe retrospectively to 14 April 1986 the entitlement of any State branch of the Federation or any other association constituted by the persons who would have been eligible for membership of the Federation prior to deregistration to apply for registration until 14 April 1996. In other words, it has a retrospective dimension to it as well. Over and over again the Senate stands, faces and addresses the principle of retrospectivity and says that legislation should not be retrospective. This legislation is extraordinary in the sense that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will move amendments in the committee stage of this debate in an attempt to remove that retrospective aspect of the Bill. The amendments will be defeated by the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government. They will make this Bill retrospective. They will make this set of circumstances special, despite standing here for days, only a matter of a week and a half ago, and putting in place the very fair, just, adequate processes which Senator Cooney has identified as being so essential in a democracy. Now this Bill takes this case outside that set of fair, adequate, just processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing the Bill does is provide the right to State registered branches of the Builders Labourers Federation, the builders labourers union, to intervene in the proceedings before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to seek use of the Commission's powers under section 111 (1) (g) (ii) and (iii) of the Industrial Relations Act and to make objection to the applications part of part IX of the Industrial Relations Act to be heard in relation to that objection. In other words, it cuts across; it uses special powers to create a special lever on applications by one of the State branches of this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to cite the extraordinary double standards that are being brought before the Senate here today in this set of circumstances. Last week we stood here and argued at length about the needs of small organisations to receive just procedure. Here today, during the debate on a matter of urgency which focused on the plight of small organisations, the Opposition argued vigorously that we must acknowledge the requirements of small organisations, although it will not allow them to be taken off to an umpire to make judgments. The Government, on the other hand, has attempted to put in place, with our help, the Industrial Relations Commission, which was strong, fair, able to deliver and able to make decisions on behalf of the community at large. But in this set of circumstances we have decided to take this small organisation and judge it separately and we have decided that the Parliament will make the judgment here and now in a special Bill. We cite that as being an extraordinary double standard and a contradiction of the logic and the principles that we attempted to establish in principal Bills here less than two weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to operate to remove the rights of the registered State branches of the Federation in respect of any procedures before the Industrial Relations Commission that were commenced before this Bill will receive royal assent. The Western Australian branch of the Builders Labourers Federation was described by Mr Howard to me as one of the more reasonable branches. In other words, there was an acknowledgment of the fact that builders labourers right across Australia should not be thrown in the Gallagher bucket and basket, that there are members within the Federation which are capable of behaving responsibly. I think even the Federation itself acknowledges that it has that diversity within itself. One of the branches has procedures before a Federal court in the form of an application to register. Those procedures will be cut across retrospectively and the Federation will be denied due process. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be attempting in our amendments to remove the retrospective dimension of the Bill, but I would anticipate that those amendments will be defeated, as I say, by a combined vote of Opposition and Government. It is an extraordinary contradiction when we think back to the debate, and the vitriol of the debate, concerning the principles in industrial relations which we have debated here today and to the intensity and the division between the camps when we were debating the use of a fair, just process to resolve questions of registration and non-registration. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not in any way endorsing the behaviour of BLF branches anywhere. The Industrial Relations Commission would have made that judgment not so long from now if we had given it the power, the authority and the confidence to do so-if we had allowed it to exercise the very power, authority and confidence that we extended to it through the legislation a mere few days ago. I know for a fact that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Government are embarrassed by this contradiction. I am not too sure that the Opposition is embarrassed by it, but I know there is a great deal of embarrassment about this obvious contradiction. It is important that the Australian people are aware of the fact that these contradictions do and can exist in this place and, above all, that they are aware of the fact that we are the ones who are attempting to resolve and to refute these contradictory processes. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that this Parliament-in other words, a combination of the Government and the Opposition in this Parliament and certainly not the Democrats-rather than the Industrial Relations Commission will play the prominent role in deciding who enjoys what rights and at what time in relation to registration. That is the effect of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney used the expressions `some alarm' and `a question of balance'. There are also questions of principle. There is indeed a need for alarm. Just yesterday the Minister appealed to the Opposition to allow the SPC Ltd case, which we were discussing earlier, to go to the umpire. `Let it go to the umpire', said the Minister. That is what the umpire is there for. Today the Minister spoke about the need for the umpire and pleaded with the Opposition to acknowledge that principle of the umpire making decisions, whether there is thuggery, whether there is irresponsibility or whether we have a group of people seeking to register a union that should not be entrusted with that utterly important responsibility. It is the job of the Industrial Relations Commission to arrive at that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the agreement that was arrived at earlier about how much time was available to me, it was agreed that I had nine minutes. I have used my nine minutes. I am citing this incredible contradiction. I am appealing to the Opposition to support the Democrats in their amendments, which will at least remove the retrospectivity clauses of this legislation and allow at least one branch, which has an application before the Federal Court, to have that heard. It is the least we can do. We regard this Bill as being a travesty in terms of the principles which it does not adhere to and we dissociate ourselves from any behaviour of the Builders Labourers Federation anywhere. That is not the point. We profoundly dissociate ourselves from the fundamental contradiction which is taking place here now and with the retrospective dimensions of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Opposition does not oppose the Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill, the main purpose of which is to deregister the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) for a further five years and thereby in effect prevent the union from seeking re-registration until 1996, there are nevertheless good reasons for concern about aspects of the legislation. One area of concern is that the Bill goes further than that and seeks to preclude the remaining registered State branches of the BLF-and, indeed, any group of builders labourers-from applying for Federal registration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That concern is warranted, even though no organisation in Australia's trade union history has, I believe, ever matched the Builders Labourers Federation in ignominy, notoriety or just plain thuggery. This union has been a rogue union. It has had a bunch of scoundrels-quite accurately described as hoodlums-at its helm. It has had a sad history of violence and thuggery and as a union has been dominated by its Federal Secretary, Norm Gallagher, who is in charge of its Federal management committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The BLF has been federally deregistered twice-once in 1974 and again in 1986. The union re-registered in 1976 and when the Australian Labor Party won Government in 1983 the new Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, withdrew deregistration proceedings against the BLF which Prime Minister Fraser had begun the previous year. However, the activities of the BLF were too much even for the self-proclaimed world's greatest Prime Minister because subsequently this Labor Government deregistered it again in 1986, and prohibited any application for re-registration for a further five years; that is, until 14 April next year. </PARA>
<PARA> While this legislation to further extend the deregistration must pass, its consequences offer no real joy for Australia's industrial relations. The outcome from extending the deregistration of the BLF will be such that the Building Workers Industrial Union (BWIU) and the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors will be the winners. This unholy alliance will benefit no-one except these two organisations and both will continue to combine to extract monopoly rents from developers through the subcontractors and the tradesmen who work under the `no ticket, no start' regime unique to the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of Government action to break that cartel-indeed, it is reinforced by the Government's mania for union amalgamations-there is little hope for a more cost efficient industry to develop. It is certain in the history of trade unionism in this country that no union has been more irresponsible in its behaviour than the union formerly registered under the Federal Act as the Builders Labourers Federation. It has certainly brought much discredit upon itself through its efforts to bring the construction industry in Australia to its knees on numerous occasions through the use of vile and often violent tactics on individuals, property and organisations throughout Australia. It is worth recognising again that a previous Liberal Government originally sought to deregister this organisation, whereas the new Prime Minister in 1983 and the former Premier of Victoria, John Cain, acted to delay deregistration proceedings against them. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, years later, it falls to this Labor Government to extend the deregulation which it felt compelled to initiate in 1986. The BLF is but one of a number of union organisations which need to be taken completely apart and thoroughly cleansed. In that regard it is matched by the Building Workers Industrial Union, which has more or less taken over where the BLF left off and has possibly a worse track record than its predecessor, the BLF. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales, appointed by Premier Greiner, is long overdue and should very closely investigate the disgraceful tactics used by the BWIU and others within the construction industry. Although this Bill does extend the deregistration of the BLF, and therefore achieves some benefit to the construction industry, it also unwittingly supports the continued existence of the BWIU, a huge, powerful and unwieldy union that is strongly opposed to the Opposition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a crime but it is certainly an unwise approach and is detrimental to Australia's economic development. To oppose this Bill would be to support Norm Gallagher and all that he represents and would certainly ensure a resurgence of disruption and militancy throughout the construction industry, which was evident when the BLF was in full cry. We want to avoid that, obviously, in terms of establishing a rational approach to industrial relations; in particular, we want to avoid outbursts of violent behaviour by unionists and try to achieve a reasonable approach to industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australians are most definitely sick and tired of hearing about another picket, another round of thuggery and further bouts of violence in the sphere of industrial relations. This Government talks about enterprise bargaining, as does the Australian Council of Trade Unions, but it is only this Opposition which is fair dinkum about the introduction of enterprise bargaining. This legislation, in allowing the BWIU to continue in place of the BLF, really does nothing to develop a more rational and enterprise-based approach to industrial relations because it allows the industrial relations structure to head in the opposite direction in the establishment of mega-unions. Undoubtedly the BWIU will become one of the 20 mega-unions. </PARA>
<PARA> This union will not confine itself to the construction area but will encompass membership within the mining and engineering industries as well. It is quite absurd when one considers that one union will represent these three major industries. There will be no hope for achieving a cost competitive resource or building development industry in Australia in that situation; there will be no hope for bargaining based on enterprise. The real winners of this legislation will be the Building Workers Industrial Union. The only way to attack the rotten core of the construction industry, before it takes over other areas, is to end the monopoly on the supply of labour held by the unions in the building industry, and that means abandoning compulsory unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> The aspect of the Bill which is of particular concern is the measure of retrospectivity. Any proceedings before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission commenced before the Bill receives royal assent will come under the operation of the Bill. This will no doubt affect the Western Australian branch of the BLF, an organisation which has a better reputation than its currently deregistered Federal namesake. That State branch is currently seeking to secure Federal registration under this Bill, and those procedures will be completely destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this legislation will go some way towards addressing the problems which plague the construction industry, it does have the disadvantage of strengthening the hand of the Building Workers Industrial Union in the construction industry and extending its power into mining and development projects. It has the disadvantage that it will, in effect, neuter State branches of the BLF, which are more responsible than their Federal counterpart. It total, it reflects the Government's inadequate approach to industrial relations, the real reform of which must await the election of a coalition government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia, too, I understand. I am glad to see that this legislation makes it very clear that the State registration of the Builders Labourers Federation is to continue in those four States. Indeed, in my State of Tasmania, that development was recognised last year when the State Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation, Jim Bacon, was elected as Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. That was welcomed not only by trade unions but also by employers and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in that State. The officials of the Builders Labourers Federation in my home State, Bobby Devine and Jack Gill, are well known for their dedication and commitment to the rights of workers. I certainly reject the inferences and sweeping generalisations that are made by honourable members opposite about hoodlums, violence and thuggery, because that is not the approach of those officials to industrial relations in my home State; as, indeed, it is not the approach of the overwhelming majority of officials in this organisation or their rank and file members around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also glad to see a positive provision in the legislation that allows the registered branches of the Builders Labourers Federation in the four States, by leave of the Commission, to appear before the Commission in respect of legitimate industrial matters. The building industry is notorious for its exploitative employment characteristics. The industry is seasonal with a poor safety record and has subcontracting on subcontracting. There is a need for a strong union in the building industry. I reject again the sweeping calls by senators opposite for the smashing of the Australian trade union movement and its breaking down into enterprise trade unions. In conclusion, the Builders Labourers Federation has a slogan, `Dare to struggle. Dare to win', and it is with great regret that I say-although I do not mean it in any offensive way-that it has dared to die. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that several of the speakers in this debate on the Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill have limited their remarks because of the time constraints. I also acknowledge that some of them would have said more in greater detail than they have. I will be brief in reply, answering directly the points that they have raised. I want to answer, though, as comprehensively as I can and start with the contributions of my colleagues, Senators Cooney and Sherry. I am sure that Senator Sherry, who was a union official, will forgive me if I emphasise in my remarks the comments made by Senator Cooney, who as a barrister and solicitor worked and practised for some time at the industrial Bar in Melbourne and nationally and speaks with some legal as well as industrial relations experience on this point. I note his remarks particularly about fairness and the proper process. I acknowledge-and I think it is appropriate that I do so-his remarks as an expression of conscience and of views strongly felt. However, I do not deny the strength of conscience and view of Senator Sherry, who similarly has a long and quite respected history in the Australian union movement. Those views therefore have to be taken into consideration when they have observed the Caucus solidarity necessary in a vote such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now concentrate on a few of the points made by Senator Durack. He asked me to reply specifically only to one point, and that was the ability of the Government, given the amendment to our original Bill that Mr Willis put through the House of Representatives, to proclaim at a later time, if we so choose, that section relating to the applications for registration by State registered branches of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) to become a Federal union. </PARA>
<PARA> The best and clearest way I can explain the position of the Government is to say that, in essence, I behold three separate personalities which are referred to as the Builders Labourers Federation. The first is the Builders Labourers Federation as an organisation which is unregistered but exists nonetheless as a proper organisation. It is registered in one sense under the New South Wales trade union Act in that State, but it exists irrespective of whether it is registered in the Federal industrial relations system. Nothing in this Bill can touch that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the dinner break I was answering a question put to me by Senator Durack in his contribution to the second reading debate. I had noted the three personalities that the organisation known colloquially as the BLF has. The first is the organisation itself. The second is the Federal Builders Labourers Federation as such, which was a federally registered organisation with State branches. This legislation is aimed at that organisation. The third personality is the builders labourers federations in each State, which are registered under the State jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation, by its enactment, complements legislation in New South Wales and Victoria, meaning that effectively the organisation does not possess registration at either Federal or State level in those two States and does not possess registration at Federal level in any state of Australia, leaving therefore the organisation in existence unregistered and the State registered organisations in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill we provide that the State registered BLFs, registered under their State law, cannot apply for Federal registration. We have done that because we believe that there is sufficient cause to worry that, if they were to do that and succeed, it would be a back door method for the Builders Labourers Federation-the organisation led by Norm Gallagher that we are proposing to deal with under this legislation-to re-emerge. However, by virtue of this legislation we are providing that, where their interest is affected in any Federal proceeding, they have the right ordinarily to appear in that Federal proceeding to protect their State interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of contention that has arisen is that there is an application by the Builders Labourers Federation of Western Australia for Federal registration. That application is being heard in the Federal Commission. It is being heard concurrently with an application by the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia (BWIU) to extend its constitution to cover classifications of `builder's labourer' in the other States. We are proposing in our amendment not to proclaim that section of our legislation which would wipe out that legal action. As I comprehended Senator Durack's question, he asked why we were doing that or he wanted me to provide more background as to why we were doing that. At the moment, talks have been actively--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will bring my remarks to a swift conclusion. I, in my capacity as Federal Minister, have stimulated talks between the BLF in the States-that is, representatives of the Queensland, South Australian, Western Australian and Tasmanian builders labourers federations-and the BWIU and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those talks are being actively followed at the present time, and in the circumstances I think it is appropriate that we not proclaim that section of the legislation. If we believe or apprehend the strong possibility of a threat by the back door to take the application that is being heard by the Western Australian Builders Labourers Federation for Federal registration-if we apprehend an effort to re-establish the Builders Labourers Federation, the organisation we are dealing with in this legislation, by that means-obviously that would be a situation in which I would consider the application of proclamation. I must say that there is no immediate threat of that possibility as we operate now, although it is prudent to clothe ourselves with a power in the event that it might arise to enable it to be exercised should it be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a second reason. There is a possibility of a negotiated outcome between the organisations I have referred to. Although in recent times that possibility is a little reduced from what it might have been a couple of weeks ago, it is still sufficiently alive for the Government to want conscientiously to explore that possibility. That possibility offers an amic- able and negotiated outcome to the legal conflicts between the BLF and the Building Workers Industrial Union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a package of Bills-the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)-which have taken a long time to get to the chamber but which in many ways present a very valuable opportunity for the Senate to canvass some very important issues in the field of social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1990 Budget starkly underlines the fundamental differences between the approach to social security that now distinguish the major political parties in Australia. This Government sees welfare as a passive response to economic and social disadvantage, in many instances providing virtually permanent income support for many relatively able-bodied citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> This can be seen from the $2.7 billion increase in social security spending for the current financial year, taking the total outlays to $23.7 billion, which is in many respects simply topping-up in various categories. For example, there is a $900m or an 11 per cent rise in age pension payouts; and a $1 billion or a 31.8 per cent rise in unemployment benefit-a figure which is probably fast becoming irrelevant. The extra almost $1 billion in age pensions enables the Government finally to limp across the line in achieving its long-awaited target of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Even this massive outlay masks the failure of the Government to come to grips with the ageing of the population. Despite forgoing revenue of $4.3 billion last year on superannuation tax concessions, we still have 1.3 million persons-or 77 per cent of those of age pension age-wholly or partly dependent upon the age pension. We still have very serious poverty traps in place. The income test free threshold at which pensions begin to be reduced will finally be indexed in line with the consumer price index from July 1991-a belated and in many respects token response. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Cass's recommendation was that the income test be 15 per cent of average weekly earnings, which would now equate to $74.65 per week. Mr Howe's proposal to index the present low base of $40 per week from July 1991 has been described by a range of interest groups-particularly one that came recently to my mind, the Western Australian Public Service Retired Officers Association-as tokenism at its most insulting. They refer to Mr Howe's statement in the Better Opportunities-Social Security booklet that in 1988 the average amount of non-pension income was $42 per week. This makes a mockery of the Government's rhetoric about enhanced opportunities for self-help, when the current system takes no account of the declining value of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of the budget consists of other big ticket items such as assistance to unemployment and sickness beneficiaries, up by $1 billion; assistance to the disabled, up by $35m; and assistance to families with children, up by $311m. The amount currently spent on sole parents-which is more than $2.5 billion-is more than is spent on family allowances, yet the enhancement of the jobs, education and training (JET) scheme will cost $2.2m, to be spent mainly on bureaucrats, in order to save something in the order of $0.5m in revenue. In other words, virtually nothing is being done in order to encourage sole parents to get back into the work force. So far, less than 5 per cent of sole parents have voluntarily participated in the JET program, and of these only about 50 per cent have been within the Government's own categorisation of labour market disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Bills, replete as they are with more targeting such as the deeming of gifts, loans and cash, the imposition of a liquid assets test, the introduction of an assets test on family allowance, the amnesty and, above all, the data matching and tax file number regimes, constitute the high-water mark of this Government's boa constrictor approach to welfare. It is a series of penny-pinching initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Although in many instances the Bills are quite rightly designed to reduce the potential for abuse, correct administrative inconsistencies and maximise pensioner returns, they wholly fail to come to grips with the need to provide substantial incentives to wean people away from welfare, provide meaningful workplace alternatives and provide practical advice to pensioners. In these respects they are sadly lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is the lack of serious intent. For example, consider the remarks of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, on the Sunday program on 14 October last. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be very difficult for us to try and upgrade training for the unemployed . . . I am not certain there is room in the system for more expansion even if you could find the money. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Social Security there shows a total failure to understand the consequences of labour market inflexibility, which makes it so difficult for unemployment beneficiaries, invalid pensioners and sole parent beneficiaries to get back into the work force. Look at all the anguish, heartburn and back-tracking over deeming, to save a miserable $8.7m this year-now $7.6m, due to the latest Richardson back-down-part of which is squandered by way of a Public Service Union trade-off with the appointment of 40 more totally unnecessary, barely trained financial information service for pensioners advisers at a cost of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest single antidote to poverty is a burgeoning economy and plentiful employment opportunities. Of the Government's much vaunted 1.6 million jobs since 1983, only about half have been full time. The figure has served to distract attention from the fact that unemployment has been stuck at more than 6 per cent throughout the term of the Hawke Government. Now, even that relatively positive indicator has been thrown out of the window by the Government's scorched earth strategy. This is the state to which that consummate political artist, Paul Keating, has brought us: prime bank rates of over 20 per cent; an annual current account deficit of $21 billion for the last financial year; $157 billion in gross foreign debt; and swelling dole queue numbers which in Victoria, for example, have risen by more than 72 per cent over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the efforts of a shonky used car salesman who refuses to see that the wheels have fallen off and persists in trying to flog a very sour and soggy lemon to increasingly irate consumers. The fact is that the recession which we had to have would have been quite unnecessary if Mr Keating had had the vision and political will to champion micro-economic reform, labour market flexibility and real privatisation. It is little wonder that Australia is the object of ridicule and condescension amongst many of our South East Asian neighbours. Ask Harry Lee about our national backbone. </PARA>

<PARA> This Government has simply been too gutless to make real reforms and has been content to hide behind the blunt instrument of monetary policy. This has had the presumably unintended consequence of promoting a massive redistribution of wealth from the battlers to the rich. So much for social justice! The major effect of the hand of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) being stuck on the monetary lever has been to slow private capital investment to a trickle because of the impossibility of profit making based on rates of interest double, and sometimes treble, those of our major trading partners. The Government's favourite weapon for tackling poverty seems to be bagging archbishops. It is noticeable that the putative leader did not speak up at that time and showed not the slightest interest in welfare or welfare reform, as even Senator Richardson conceded in Question Time the other day. In fact, we have heard absolutely nothing from him on welfare. The man who despises shopping malls where most ordinary mortals have to buy the necessities of life blithely spends $5,000 on a VIP flight to watch a game of football played by a team about which he knows nothing and cares less. He is simply an opportunistic carpetbagger bitterly resented by hordes of long-suffering Collingwood supporters, including myself. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, let us look at the token, leisurely and irrelevant gestures made by this Government in two critical social security areas-unemployment and dis- ability. The invalid pension will be replaced from 1 October 1991-how slow can you go?-by the disability support pension requiring a minimum 20 per cent level of medical impairment which, as Senator Richardson so graphically conceded in Question Time not so long ago, even he does not understand, and an assessed inability to work full time. This is presumably the outcome of grovelling to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It will mean that an ability to work part time will simply be ignored and the disability payments will become a proxy for unemployment benefits. This heroic measure will save $14.7m in 1991-92 and will not even operate in this financial year. Why? According to Senator Richardson it is because these things take time. The Government has only had seven years to come up with this strategy. Perhaps another reason why savings will be so low is that in the first year of operation of the disability support pension only 2 per cent of existing invalid pensioners will be reviewed. So much for the active employment strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The sickness benefit will become the sickness allowance, initially limited to 12 months but capable of extension for a further 12-month period. About the only change seems to be that there will be an early referral to rehabilitation. Otherwise, there would seem to be precious little review of current recipients to attempt to understand why numbers have risen by over 35 per cent since Labor came to office-well in excess of the population growth rate of something in excess of 10 per cent. Since 1970 the number of people on sickness benefit has actually risen by over 811 per cent. Unemployment benefits will be replaced from 1 July 1991-again I ask why the hurry-by the Jobsearch and Newstart allowance. How this renaming can save $79.4m in the current financial year is therefore beyond me. In other words, the whole scheme is irrelevant. It has been blown out of the water by the current massive deterioration in the labour force. The Budget estimate looks very sick indeed. The figure of 475,000 by June 1991 has already been overtaken by the latest figures showing that some 498,000 people are in the dole queue and almost 700,000 people are out of work. Given that the Budget estimates rise by approximately $80m for every 10,000 additional unemployed, any savings at all that might derive from the shuffling of the welfare pack will be completely drowned by the increase in new numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives that have been announced constituted by the three Bills that we are currently debating also deal with another notorious example of thinking after the event. The family allowance proposal, hastily conceived without any adequate data available at the time, without any proper consultation-it was drawn up, as Senator Richardson has said, before the extent of the rural crisis became apparent-was finally amended by the Government in line with the general views of the National Farmers Federation. Around 80,000 families would have been affected by the proposal, when 86 per cent of farmers already have assets in excess of $300,000. That initiative was not mentioned prior to the election, as is the case with many of the Government's proposals. It would seem that it was simply trotted out in the Budget without any proper consultation or analysis. We had the ludicrous spectacle of Senator Richardson telling the Australian last weekend that the Government went to the National Farmers Federation. He said that the Government would help the Federation any way it could, offered to get some statistics and basically advised it on how to reshape its request. If ever there was a ludicrous--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must have a look at it. At the moment, I confess that I am stuck with the national dailies. The Australian gave me the most amusement because it made it patently clear that in the time that this Minister has been in charge of social security, or ought to have been in charge, there have been a whole range of backdowns and backflips. For example, there was a lot of big talk on restricting the payments of overseas pensions. We ultimately saw savings forgone of something like $52.5m over a three-year period. Then there was the backdown on the $2.50 charge for pensioner prescriptions where an additional $50 was given to pensioners up-front to help them with extra payments. According to the Minister, none of this was apparently foreseen or predicted, but according to Messrs Howe and Staples, the issue was explicitly canvassed in the Expenditure Review Committee and rejected. They made their concerns known to the public by way of the leaking of a letter of advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a watering down of the original assets test of the family allowance proposal, with savings forgone of $24m; a backdown on tighter assets testing of family allowance supplements and Austudy, which cost another $58m over two years; a watering down of the original 10 per cent deeming proposal, with savings forgone of $7.6m. On the original liquid assets test proposal, there were savings forgone of $5m to $10m. That was another decision bitterly opposed by Minister Howe. In total, the current Minister's backdowns have cost the Government approximately $150m. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not much doubt that we have seen a new approach to government which basically involves, whenever there is a whiff of grapeshot, diving for the trenches, caving in to any interest group that might potentially have a vote up its sleeve. There is no regard at all to protecting the integrity of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on an issue which my colleague Senator Patterson will no doubt be developing at some length. It relates to the reasons why we have felt it so necessary to ensure, in relation to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill, that we protect two fundamental rights: the right of the public to privacy protection, an issue that has been totally ignored by the Government and which has been most unwillingly foisted upon it; we are also very anxious to ensure that the Parliament retains control of the process, and that is why we will be intro- ducing a sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious reason why there has been so much concern about the privacy implications is, I suppose, the sort of appallingly cynical admission of guilt made by Senator Richardson and the deafening silence of the Treasurer, which confirmed the original suspicions that promises about confining the tax file number to the tax system were simply jettisoned through political expediency-designed no doubt at the time to lull the community into a false sense of security. But it is now clear that the Government always intended what it is now proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into any detail about the notorious admissions made by the Minister for Social Security in the Sydney Morning Herald. Suffice it to say that the quote `few things are immutable' speaks for itself. The Minister says the reality is that every time a change of policy is announced in a Budget one goes back on something said before and that every Budget from every government contains changes. If that is not the Watergate defence recycled, I do not know what is. Inoperative statements apparently can be simply discarded whenever it suits him. That is precisely the reason why we are so concerned about privacy implications and why I think it has been necessary to have taken the trouble and effort that we have. I congratulate Senator Patterson in particular for the assiduous nature with which she has pursued a number of these very important aspects. I will have more to say on the details of these Bills during the committee stage. Suffice it to say that these Bills represent merely a pale imitation of what a real welfare policy ought to be about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin tonight by looking at some of the positive features in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), including employment entry payments which have been extended to recipients of sole parents' pension; the introduction of the fixed set disaster relief payments; the extension of the remote area allowance to people living in special zone B, as defined under the Income Tax Assessment Act-and I add that this is something for which the Australian Democrats have been calling for some time-extension of the carers' pension to include carers who live adjacent to those that they are looking after, which again is a long overdue measure; the quarantining of the recently introduced pharmaceutical supplement from the social security payments themselves. In fact, this was an amendment that the Australian Democrats moved, but which was negated, at the committee stage of previous legislation. We are very pleased to see that the Government has taken that on board at this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to address first the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, which is a very tough piece of legislation. It contains some extremely tough measures that expose the Government's rhetoric about its commitment to the more disadvantaged constituents. It is yet another example of the Government's willingness to make the unemployed, the sick, the aged and the rural poor bear the brunt of what is now a very costly flirtation with so-called economic rationalism. The headlines we have all seen in the papers in the last few days read: `Unemployment expected to increase again'; `Unemployment rising'; `Unemployment hits three-year high'; `Dole figures rocketing'; and `Jobless may rise to 10 per cent'. That headline referred to something said by Senator Walsh. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week we saw some 6,933 more persons added to the dole queues, some 4,500 the week before and nearly 6,500 the week before that. The Government's estimate has been well and truly exceeded. Half the companies in Australia have retrenched or reduced some staff this year. The Westpac Banking Corporation alone has decreased its staff by some 1,500. At the same time, we see in this climate that the importation of chocolates has risen some 139 per cent and that the importation of caviar is up 25 per cent. So some people in this country are certainly doing very nicely. This legislation does not attack these people but is causing much of the hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> I just pause briefly to look at the changes that have already been made both to this legislation and other pieces of social security legislation that we have seen this year. Time and time again, there are softening measures and small adjustments, and it is very pleasing that the Government is listening to reasoned argument put forward in particular by the lobby groups. However, we have to keep asking ourselves why it is that the Government legislation needs these changes. Is it because the Government is not consulting with or listening to those people in the community who are hurting the most? I think we must conclude that the social security policy is being designed by economic rationalists who do not know or care what their policies are doing to people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not get its policies right first go until it begins listening to the community. It needs to ensure that the people who are dealing with the portfolio have some empathy with those in the community that the Department of Social Security is supposed to be assisting. But let us be clear: there is no need for some of these draconian, very cruel, measures in the first place. The community is not fooled: it knows that it is bearing the brunt of bad economic decisions and the failure of this Government to curb corporate excesses of the very worst kind. The community is suffering because it knows that this Government and the Opposition prefer to give benefits and concessions to the wealthy rather than make necessary concessions and changes which will benefit the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The other option-and I guess a rather cynical one-is that perhaps these mistakes are deliberate and we are really to end up with what the Government wanted all along: `Make the policies tougher and tougher and then give back a little bit to create the impression that we are really not bad guys after all and are listening to the pressure groups'. One hopes that that is not the scenario, but one does begin to wonder. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to deal as quickly as I can with the various clauses of the Bill to which I will move amendments as we proceed through the committee stage. Firstly, in respect of deeming on cash in accounts: this issue has caused enormous concern among pensioners and has already been dealt with extensively in committee. We have had numerous letters from anxious pensioners who are fearful of the consequences of these moves and those who are angry that the Government has taken action in this fashion against them while failing to close tax loopholes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be clear about this measure. It is essentially discriminatory as it will apply only to certain assets held by certain groups in the community. It is well established that the loss to the community in taxation revenue from taxpayers not using their assets to best advantage is significantly larger than the additional social security pay-outs to pensioners and beneficiaries who are mistakenly investing their assets at low or minimal rates of return. I believe pensioners are entitled to ask why the Government does not deem a minimum rate on return of all assets owned by pensioners, beneficiaries and taxpayers. Why indeed? Could it be that the Government thinks pensioners are easier targets than wage and salary earners, executives, company directors or whatever, who will perhaps kick up more of a fuss and are able to be more organised than pensioner lobby groups?</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have some sympathy with the Government's aims. There is a long history of pensioners' savings being used to the financial advantage of banks. It is also true that if many pensioners are able to get the right advice and have access to the right information, they will be better off, but there are a number of problems in relation to those who are poorly advised, less well off, frail, disabled or simply not able to cope with the great difficulty of arranging or rearranging their affairs at a stage in their lives when they thought they had everything already organised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, despite its rhetoric, is not prepared to take on the banks to ensure that they do not misuse their position in relation to their pensioner customers. Pensioners are a rather blunt instrument with which to try to encourage the banks to get some re-regulation. Some products are already coming onto the market which still treat the first $2,000 as in effect a free loan to the banks and provide the 10 per cent on anything above that figure. We believe that is grossly unfair and goes against the Government's intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> We also note a considerable lack of independent financial funding advice. There are simply not enough services extended to people for independent advice about how to make best use of their available funds. In effect-and this has been put to us by a number of pensioner groups-this measure targets the poorer and the more frail pensioners because they are the very people who cannot access advice and are already using strategies both to reduce tax and to minimise their pension entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not move these amendments tonight, but the Democrats attempted to amend the legislation to reduce the interest rate from 10 per cent to 8 per cent or, preferably, 7 per cent. Interest rates have fallen again today and we believe that by the time this legislation is enacted next March the Government will have to come to the understanding that it simply will not be possible for the majority of-certainly not for all-pensioners and beneficiaries to get the 10 per cent at call. As I said, we moved the amendments at the committee stage, but they were negated by a combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned with the level at which the threshold is set. If the interest rate is to remain at 10 per cent, it will be extremely difficult for pensioners and beneficiaries to get that rate of interest unless they begin tying up their money. The Democrats believe having only $2,000 at call is unsatisfactory. Pensioners have pointed out to us that they need to keep reasonable funds available to cover emergency situations and to make them feel economically viable. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with pleasure that a mistake was apparently made at the time the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill were redrafted to take on board some amendments that were made in the House of Representatives. These mistakes mean that married couples will now be treated as individuals in their own right. I believe that this is particularly important for women. Normally, one would not be pleased when government drafts- people make errors, but on this occasion I wish to congratulate them most sincerely on behalf of all married pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats had indeed sought through amendment to have separate thresholds for individuals and married beneficiaries of $5,000 and $10,000. While acknowledging the need for some form of legislation, the Democrats would have preferred to see the carrot rather than the stick approach. If pensioners had been able to earn more than their $40 a week, many would have chosen freely to invest their money in higher earning accounts. If they had been assured of some sort of provision by way of a seniors card for all those over retirement age, many would not be so worried about losing their fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, at the time this legislation was before the Committee we tried to change it with some amendments. Through the amendments we were attempting to raise the level to $65 a week for single pensioners and $90 a week for married couples, with an extra $30 a week for each child. If these had been initiated and accepted by the Government a considerable time ago, we believe that tonight there would not be any need to start forcing pensioners, in what we believe is a rather draconian measure, particularly for aged pensioners, to actually go out and seek that 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment I wish to concentrate on tonight relates to voluntary organisations-charitable groups. They have for many years relied on low interest or no interest loans for the carrying out of their charitable services. In particular, we are concerned about those organisations that provide aged care. Again, we moved amendments in committee and these were negated. We have taken on board some of the Government's concerns. The main concern of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) was that the amendment was too broad. We have therefore redrafted the amendment, and hopefully it will be reconsidered tonight. We believe that what the Minister has come up with is far too narrow in that it limits funds for exempt organisations only to capital works and does not include welfare services. </PARA>
<PARA> As we see more and more people feeling the bite of the recession, welfare agencies are having to assist greater and greater numbers of people, and they simply do not have the resources to do this. The Government has said that it is not able to help at this point in time, but these agencies are desperate. All they want to be able to do is at least to continue to have access to money lent or invested with them by concerned citizens who, unlike the Government, have a social conscience. As for the Opposition calling for privatisation for welfare, here is an opportunity to support this amendment and to encourage private citizens to support charitable and voluntary organisations. Hopefully, it will consider this later tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> To move on to the liquid assets test, we note again that the Government has made some changes. For example, the threshold is now $10,000 if there are dependants. But again we look at the figures and at the headlines, and we know that we certainly are in a recession. We have increasing unemployment, and what does the Government do? It makes it even more difficult for those people who have been retrenched through no fault of their own to obtain income support. </PARA>
<PARA> We have listened to some reasons as to why this measure was introduced, but we do not believe that it will be catching those people it is aimed at. It will be catching many average Australian families. There are already adequate means of testing whether a person is genuinely unemployed, such as work tests. There are sickness benefits for people who are genuinely sick, but they must have a doctors certificate from an authorised medical practitioner. There are adequate income tests. There are assets tests for both these benefits. Persons with annual leave or termination payments are already required to wait up to four weeks before becoming eligible for any benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this is a very callous and unnecessary measure that will cause most harm to low income families, and it is a disgrace that the Government can contemplate this with such apparent equanimity when it acknowledges that it is its economic policies that are causing the increased unemployment. The Government should be encouraging people to save, not discouraging them. This measure will also be particularly harsh on seasonal rural workers. </PARA>
<PARA> We draw the Minister's attention to the Victorian Council of Social Service (VCOSS) report of April this year titled Off the Street Begging and the Australian Social Security System which looked at recipients of emergency relief in Victoria. The VCOSS report estimated that 30 per cent of Victoria's pensioners and beneficiaries were forced to request emergency relief during 1987-88. The report found that unemployment beneficiaries and sole parent pensioners were overrepresented amongst emergency relief recipients. It also found that current waiting periods for pension and benefits were causing significant hardship with around 50 Victorian individuals and families per week seeking emergency relief while waiting for unemployment benefit. The report says that the Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, and other Government Ministers:</PARA>
<PARA>have failed to acknowledge to date . . . that current Social Security arrangements under Labor are forcing large numbers of Australians to rely on emergency relief. </PARA>
<PARA>Those numbers, as I mentioned in a question last week, have escalated considerably. In its conclusion, the report says that there are obvious areas where inequities remain in the social security system that the Government continually refuses to address. It points out that severe hardship continues to be caused by the complexity of the payment system and an increasingly tightly targeted eligibility criteria. I stress that this proposal before us tonight does nothing to reduce the existing inequities and only serves to increase the hardship for those people who least deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will propose an amendment that will simply delete this clause altogether. We did move this amendment in committee but it was not accepted, due to the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government. However, individual Democrat senators feel so strongly on this issue that we wish to vote on it again. I will be moving the amendment in Committee of the Whole tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to the assets test on the family allowance and the family allowance supplement (FAS). These proposals have caused an interesting series of comments, including some changes in the positions of both the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party, which we welcome. The Budget announcement originally put a $300,000 limit on the family allowance assets test. The family allowance supplement was reduced to $200,000 and we are very pleased to note that that has already been changed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I stress that the rural crisis is unparalleled in postwar Australia. Since World War II our rural communities have never seen the range of circumstances coming together to cause such severe problems that they are now facing. The common cyclical problems have all merged together. With high interest rates and other Government policies such as free trade-ideological suicide, I guess one could call it-many farm incomes have dropped to zero and below. Most farming families are excluded from the benefits available to other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation comes at a very bad time for rural Australia. Figures of income from unincorporated farm enterprises-which represent most farm family businesses-show a near bankrupt scenario, falling more than 80 per cent from $1,106m in the three months to June to $230m for the September quarter. Worse results are expected for the next two quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> There had been suggestions that farmers should borrow against their farm, especially those who need income support at this time. We argue that this is exceedingly difficult, especially for young farmers, many of whom already have highly encumbered properties. With equity levels falling below 75 per cent, the actual viability of the farm is endangered. To have a notional salary of 25,000, farmers need assets of over $833,000-that is, if they are going to get the 3 per cent return this year that we are now told they are most unlikely to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The farm is not an investment that can be called upon when needed. It is not cash in hand and the capital is in fact often not even realised. It is passed from father to son and on to his sons. So, the actual cash in hand is never realised. For many rural women, the family allowance has been the only cash in hand that they can rely upon regularly. </PARA>
<PARA> Few farming families now qualify for the family allowance supplement under the assets test, although most of them would certainly qualify if they had to face only the income test. If we look at the recent report that has come out on the family allowance supplement, we see that for many people FAS is just a short term payment until such time as the family's total income can increase. Results from the survey show that the FAS payment is being used to pay for basic necessities such as clothing, food and school expenses for children. These are the benefits that the Democrats would like to see extended to all farming families who need them. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I wish to make on the assets test on the family allowance and the family allowance supplement concerns the considerable difficulties that farming families now face when they need their properties assessed for Austudy. The Democrats do not want to see these difficulties extended to the family allowance. It is an issue that we will be taking up next year. We are proposing that the assets test on the family allowance be abolished altogether and that the assets test for the family farm of registered primary producers be removed for the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that the Opposition will agree with this amendment, as it did when it voted on it in the Committee. We hope that the Opposition will reconsider tonight the amendment to the family allowance supplement, which we also put at the committee stage but which at that time it was not able to support. We believe that even in the couple of weeks since the Committee met we have had considerable ongoing reports of the incredible difficulties that rural families are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other miscellaneous measures in this Bill. The reduction in rent assistance is unnecessary. It is a mean measure which will have the effect of reducing rent assistance for people paying less than $85 a week rent. It is very harsh on single pensioners and beneficiaries, who will still be paying a very significant proportion of their income in rent. I will not be speaking on the other legislation tonight. Senator Powell will be dealing with the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 forms an important part of several pieces of legislation associated with data matching. The implications of these pieces of legislation are pretty profound. I feel that it reflects very poorly on the Government and the Australian Democrats that such limited time is available to debate such important and far-reaching legislation as a result of their unholy alliance to gag debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lees obviously had a lot of serious concerns about the legislation that she wanted to raise. It is ironic that she took 20 minutes to raise some of those matters. They obviously could have done with even greater attention, yet she and her Party have assisted the Government to gag debate in greater detail on this package of such important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, which are outlined in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, can be split into two sets. All the provisions of the first set of proposals are essentially aimed at limiting avoidance of the veterans' affairs assets income test. For example, the Bill provides that income will be deemed to have been received from deprived assets at a minimum rate of 10 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, this Bill also provides for the assessment of income on loans made by veteran pensioners with a minimum return of 10 per cent assumed. Changing economic conditions mean that a deeming rate of 10 per cent may well be too high. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has pledged:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think I could survive in my job, nor could the whole integrity of the deeming provisions survive, if they were to disadvantage people because we maintained an artificially high rate. I can give you an absolute undertaking that we will not. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's pledge is absolutely vital if service pensioners are not to be unduly burdened with an unrealistically high deeming interest rate. My colleague Senator Walters will tonight be speaking on these deeming provisions in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 24 of this Bill deals with the second set of amendments. It allows the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs to ask for the tax file number of any person eligible for payment under the Act. The pensioner will not be eligible for payment if he or she does not provide the number. Significantly, any eligible persons will also be required to provide the tax file numbers of their spouses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition expresses serious misgivings about difficulties which may arise as a result of eligible persons being required to supply the tax file numbers of their spouses. Consequently, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, which was passed earlier today, adds to the provisions contained in clause 24 of this Bill. The Secretary to the Department will have the discretionary power to waive the requirement for a statement of the qualified person's spouse's tax file number if he is satisfied that the person does not know that number and that it would be unreasonably difficult for that person to obtain it. At the very least this is a minimum provision to improve the provisions in this legislation before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax file numbers are to be used for the purposes of detecting incorrect payments or false or misleading declarations of income. As it pertains to the veterans community, the Department of Social Security will be the central matching agency and will assist in the detection of any service pensioner also in receipt of any Department of Social Security payment, any disability pensioner in receipt of a Department of Social Security payment who has not declared the disability payment as income, and any service pensioner whose income is known by the Australian Taxation Office but who has not declared it to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on the public record the concern of the Opposition at the need for disability pensioners to provide a tax file number at all. Their pension is not taxable. It is not counted as income in assessing the rate of service pension. It is counted as income for the purposes of assessing the social security pension and it is here that the Department justifies the collection of the tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns raised by the Opposition in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when considering the data-matching Bill have resulted in the intended use of the tax file number in payment matching being dramatically reduced. With respect to disability pension and matching with the Department of Social Security, the Government will ensure that the tax file number will now be used only as a means of last resort for identification purposes. This is an important concession although, given that it is now claimed that the circumstances in which the tax file number will be used as a tie-breaker in payment matching will be exceptionally rare, it is to be doubted whether the administrative costs associated with the collection of tax file numbers from disability pensioners is justified by the savings associated with its use. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to service pensioners, initial savings projections have already been significantly modified since the data-matching Bill was first introduced. Initial savings estimates for the Department were in the order of $120m over the next four years. Subsequent figures have indicated that savings will be significantly less than this-somewhere in the order of $95m over the next four years. The fact that projected savings have diminished so much in such a short time leads one to question what the real savings will be over the next four years. We await that with enormous interest. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the vast majority of veterans would not oppose measures seeking to ensure that revenue fraud is curtailed. The Opposition supports the philosophy that only those who are truly entitled to benefits should receive them. I would caution, however, that the tax file number scheme should not be uncritically accepted as the panacea for all ills associated with fraud. Only this week in the Senate we had an Auditor-General's report which gave alarming indications of minor fraud on the Department of Veterans' Affairs which seems, to date, to have been unacceptably attended to by the Department. There remain too many questions associated with the use of tax file numbers which have not been satisfactorily answered. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, in any provisions of this nature the right to privacy of individuals must be of central concern. The Government has not properly addressed our concerns. Evidence from a wide cross-section of the academic and social welfare community has borne this out. Tonight my colleague Senator Patterson will give much greater attention to the details of our concerns on privacy. The measures which the Opposition will be introducing with respect to the data-matching Bill may go some way towards restoring the confidence which veterans and members of the wider social security community can have of a proper balance being struck between the protection of their fundamental liberties and the detection of those who seek to defraud all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to direct attention to one particular aspect-the extension of the use of the tax file number-of this package of Bills: the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. That aspect is critically important for the privacy of ordinary Australian citizens and adequate protection of that privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before turning to the specifics of the legislation before us and the history leading up to it, I want to make some brief remarks about privacy. Sometimes, regrettably, the privacy issue is lost in the general point scoring and dubious claims associated with this kind of debate, but we must not lose sight of the central point or of its overwhelming importance. The issue of privacy is necessarily one of competing principles. It is concerned with the role of governments in the private lives of its citizens. It is directly relevant to the balance between citizens' autonomy and control over them. It always emerges in the ongoing competition between efficiency and the price society is prepared to pay for that efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> In this important area of human rights, Australia has always lagged well behind the United States, for example-that great bastion of free enterprise-in developing protections under the law for privacy. We had to wait until 1988 for privacy legislation to be passed in this Parliament. Even then, the resulting Act is, in the view of the Australian Democrats, an inadequate example of its type. Limited in scope and weak in its application, the Privacy Act should have been a far more robust creature than it is. Of course, if the Government and the Opposition had supported the Australian Democrats' amendments at the time, it would have been. A mere year passed before the Parliament had to consider and finally pass further legislation to deal with private sector credit reporting agencies because the original Act failed to cover the private sector. Beyond the particular credit reporting area, of course, it still does not. </PARA>
<PARA> The imperative need for privacy protection, apart from its inherent importance as a human right, has been compounded in recent years by rapid developments in sophisticated information technology and the enormous potential for the compilation of centrally held and accessible personal and other information on ordinary people. `Potential' is probably the wrong word really because the actuality of massive databanks is already with us in both the public and private sectors. The capacity for intrusion by the State and its agencies into the lives of ordinary citizens is enormous. It is a growing trend and is driven by the technology which is making it possible. In this context the nature of the erosion of our precious privacy is insidious, scarcely visible at times, and to be guarded against with great vigilance. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's record on privacy is, frankly, appalling. First, it tried to foist on us the Australia Card proposal. Hardly surprisingly, the Australian people were not convinced by Government assurances that the benefits of the Australia Card outweighed the dangers. Thwarted in that attempt, the Government then introduced an extended tax file number system. However, it had learned one lesson from the Australia Card fiasco: the Australian people did not want an identification numbering system at all. Sensitive to that attitude in the electorate, the Government gave assurances that the tax file number system would not be extended to other Government departments. For example, on 3 June 1988, in response to a question in the House of Representatives, Mr Keating, the Treasurer, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have no intention now or in the future of extending the basis of the tax file number to do anything like some of the Australia Card tasks.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 September that same year, when presenting the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax Files Numbers) Bill 1988, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>No other government or non-government agency will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system, nor will it be able to use an individual's tax file number for any registration system of its own.</PARA>
<PARA>The history of Government actions since that time has shown that its assurances are worthless. Even before the current proposals emerged, problems were evident. As has been ably demonstrated in an extensive analysis by Dr Roger Clarke, an acknowledged information systems expert at the Australian National University, the initial scope of the tax file number scheme was wider than had been commonly understood and additional uses have accumulated through what is known as function creep. I will not detail the analysis here for those who are interested, because it is well documented in the Hansard record of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of 19 October 1990. Suffice to say that the analysis is a telling indictment of this Government and its credibility on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us tonight in legislative form the Government's latest proposal in relation to the extended use of the tax file number, allied with its far-reaching data matching proposals in the third Bill in this package. These Bills embody the Government's announcements made earlier this year. In February it was announced that sole parent pension recipients, family allowance supplement recipients and new family allowance applicants would be required to supply tax file numbers and those of their spouses to the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> It was then announced in the Budget that the requirement to supply tax file numbers would be extended from the original three classes of benefits to all remaining social security payments, as well as Veterans' Affairs and Students Assistance Act payments and those falling under the first home owners scheme. As if that is not bad enough, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has also introduced legislation to permit the matching of client information by the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Community Services and Health, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's repudiation of its explicit and frequently repeated promises to restrict the use of the tax file number to tax related matters is now complete and its credibility on this issue is destroyed. On November 9 the Minister for Social Security admitted to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA>One must concede that the Government has gone further in this Bill than it announced it would some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>This remark may deserve some sort of dubious prize for honesty, but it also ensures that the Australian people will not now accept the Government's assurances in relation to its future intentions. Even more chillingly, the evidence of the Minister to the Committee made clear the extent to which the Government's approach is technology driven. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The main reason why we have gone further is that we can get the technology to do something that we could not obtain several years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>This attitude conjures up some quite terrifying prospects and adds profoundly to the concerns of the Australian Democrats about the Government's assurances for the future. There is no doubt that information technology will increase in sophistication and potential invasiveness at a hitherto unprecedented rate. It appears that this Government, on the basis of the Minister's own words that I have just quoted, would give the highest priority to using that technology, regardless of the cost to individual privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say at this point that I do not dispute the claim that the Government's proposed system increases efficiency. But that brings me back to my earlier question: what price is society prepared to pay for increased efficiency? Furthermore, the Australian Democrats question even the need for more efficiency. It is well documented, and often proudly vaunted in this chamber, that Australia has an extremely well-targeted social security system. To a great extent, these measures are aimed squarely at the recipients of social security benefits and pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> One often hears anecdotal evidence of massive rorts, and the Government has extrapolated from other guesstimates to claim large potential savings from this proposal. But it cannot have it both ways. To the Government's credit, the system is already well targeted. In fact, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report on debt recovery is but one example of this, showing that less than one per cent of overpayments are the result of fraud. Further, to intrude into the lives of this country's most vulnerable class of people is quite outrageous. To do so in a way that flies in the face of the principle of privacy protection is absolutely unacceptable to the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will argue that protective safeguards are being implemented at the same time, and to a certain extent that is true although they need to be far stronger, as we will be discussing in the committee stage. He will also argue, quite irrelevantly, that the Government is not establishing a huge central databank. I remind the Senate that a central databank is quite unnecessary to compile data on an individual as long as one has the means to link information about that person in different databanks. This is precisely the facility the tax file number will provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the safeguards being provided is not the issue-quite apart from their inadequacy. The real issue is the installation of a system which, once in place, would be as hard to unscramble as the eggs in an omelette. The already massive and interconnected surveillance system-including the provision of tax file numbers in the private sector, for example, bank accounts and employment-is being just as massively extended again by a government which has shown scant regard for either the principle of privacy or truthfulness about its intentions in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Tragically, it appears that the Opposition intends to support the Government in this exercise. As the Australian Privacy Foundation said, the Opposition will be the Government's accomplice in ignoring the privacy rights of Australian citizens and its moves to strengthen the Privacy Commissioner's powers are, in that context, hypocritical. Despite the Opposition's sound and fury over the issue in recent weeks, it has shown its contempt for the constituency which will be most affected, Australia's most disadvantaged, and revealed its desire to have such far-reaching powers at its disposal when it occupies the treasury bench-and Senator Watson nods his head vehemently at that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Opposition will move amendments in the committee stage, and the Australian Democrats will be happy to support some of them and move some of our own, the fundamental issue is clear. The Opposition will support this scheme and the Australian people will not be fooled into believing that the Opposition is any greater a supporter of privacy protection than is the Government. I will also be most interested to hear Senator Alston's reasons for supporting a full inquiry some weeks ago and now backing away from that when I am to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, the Australian Democrats reject this unacceptable proposal. We will oppose the relevant clauses of the social security Bills and the entire data-matching Bill. At the very least, the relevant clauses in the social security legislation and the entire data-matching Bill must be referred to a Senate select committee for proper inquiry into all the Government's data surveillance plans, and, accordingly, I will be moving that by way of an amendment to the second reading motion. Such an inquiry must include a full cost-benefit analysis. To bring in this extended scheme without a proper inquiry is quite unconscionable, and the Australian people-particularly social security recipients-are entitled to such an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearings were useful but their limited scope was inadequate to deal with the implications for such a far-reaching scheme. I remind the Senate that the existing tax file number system was established only after an exhaustive Senate committee inquiry which heard 48 witnesses, received 95 written submissions and recommended that the tax file number system be strictly limited to taxation purposes. To move away from that without an equally extensive inquiry is unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the Australian Privacy Foundation, the Australian Democrats reject the extended use of the tax file number on both pragmatic and principled grounds, but primarily the latter. The questions of competing principles that I raised at the beginning of this speech have not been addressed by the Government, and we know that any assurances it might offer are worthless-the evidence is there. The same dangers apply to these proposals as four years ago with the Australia Card. The Australian Democrats will not accept these threats to privacy by the conversion and perversion of the tax file number system into a multipurpose identification system, and nor will the Australian community. Therefore, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, and that the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990, clauses 27, 29, 30, 35, 41, 42, 51, 52, 57 to 60, 82, 88, 89 and 95 to 99 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and clauses 9, 10, 11, 24 and 37 to 42 of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 be referred after the second reading to a select committee, the powers, composition and reporting date of which will be contained in a separate resolution, for inquiry and report''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the Australian Democrats joined with the Australian Labor Party in forcing a guillotine in the last sitting week of the Senate, we are limited in our speeches and have each agreed to speak for 10 minutes. Indeed, the Government has given us only 3 1/2 hours to speak on the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, and the second reading speeches are meant to take only part of that time. Of course, we have the committee stage to reach but the Australian Democrats have overspent that 10 minutes and that has restricted the rest of us to very short speeches. It is for that reason that I intend to keep my remarks solely to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I will speak to the Government's original Bill, although I believe that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has had second thoughts and intends to put through a few amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, we have the deeming provisions. Pensioners-both single and married-who have just over $2,000 in the bank are deemed to be earning 10 per cent whether they invest their money or not. As Senator Lees said tonight, interest rates are coming down. Indeed, they came down again today and there is no possibility that the pensioners will be able to get at call their interest of 10 per cent for the $2,000 or whatever figure the Government has amended it to. It is just not possible for them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We now come to family allowances. As we all know, the Government some time ago commissioned a paper to be written by Bettina Cass. Some time ago in this place I spoke about the commissioning of this report. Bettina Cass was commissioned to put forward to the Government the income support that families with children should have. She went through it very clearly. I will read a few of the comments she made. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for families is based on the fundamental conviction that children are a highly valued social resource, on which the future living standards of the society depend. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is appropriate for the social security and taxation systems to redistribute income to families in recognition of the increased costs which they bear in carrying out the essential and socially valuable tasks of child-rearing. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . at any level of family income people with children incur greater costs and have greater needs than do people without children at the same level of income. The objective is to provide universal support which will increase the disposable income of all families so as to offset, at least in part, the additional costs of raising children. </PARA>
<PARA>She also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . wages do not take account of employees' varying family responsibilities. Universal family allowance payments increase the real incomes of people with children, an objective which the wages system does not address. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the headings reads `Family allowances in Australia: recognising the costs of children in all families'. This was written in 1986-before the Government got its hands on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government commissioned this report and then, even though Bettina Cass's main recommendation was that family allowances not be income or asset tested, promptly introduced an income test. It is now attempting to introduce an assets test on families, as Senator Lees has pointed out, at a time when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has deliberately engineered a recession that has particularly affected people in the bush. He engineered that recession through wages accords and high interest rates. People in the bush with high assets but no income, particularly those in the wheat, wool and horticultural areas, will have a very rough time in the coming year, and Government is introducing an assets test. However, we will come to the amendments later. In addition, the Government has reduced the assets test for those on family allowance supplement.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps even worse is what it is doing to people on unemployment benefits. As I said in a speech earlier today, last week alone the number of people unemployed rose by 10,591. These are not just figures, but people. Ten and a half thousand people were added to the unemployment lists in just the last week-1,500 people a day. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Government intends to do with those who, unfortunately, through this engineered recession-the one Mr Keating keeps telling us he has under control-have to rely on the unemployment benefit. Those in receipt of the unemployment benefit already have an income test of $60 a week. On top of that, they are already subject to an assets test. On top of this, the Government is going to impose a liquid assets test. The Government intends to make sure that people with $5,000 in the bank or in any other liquid assets do not get the unemployment benefit for a month. That is completely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that this measure is needed to stop people who have lucrative seasonal jobs from receiving the unemployment benefit. But that will not catch them. People who organise their lives will put their money under the bed. They will not put it in the banks. We all remember a very eminent person who warned the people of Australia that, when Labor got in, they would have to put their money under the bed or the Government would rip it off them. How true that statement was. This is just what the Government is doing. Those people will put the money under the bed. If they have a paltry $5,000, the Government intends to make sure that they use most of that up before they get the unemployment benefit. As I have said, the Government is changing its mind and it will increase that amount. It is a paltry amount. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address my remarks to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I remind the Senate that Labor used to claim to be the Party of the battler. Yet its policies have often failed to do much to assist those most in need of help. The assumption that the worst off will always do better under Labor is now seen to be untrue. Lower and middle income earners have suffered most from Labor's economic mismanagement, with their real disposable income and their share of the national income reduced. Labor's spending initiatives and redistributive taxation have not brought with them equality or prosperity, only inflation, debt, high interest rates, unemployment and bureaucratic interference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This evening we are debating yet another example of Labor's redistributive taxation and bureaucratic interference in a number of aspects of the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). These Bills make numerous changes and will affect the entitlements of various social security beneficiaries, and will also require many beneficiaries to supply their tax file number and that of their spouse as a precondition for receiving payment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want specifically to address the issue of the assets test on the family allowance. The legislation sets the assets test threshold for the payment of family allowance at $500,000. At Budget time the threshold was to be $300,000. The family allowance supplement will be indexed, and the threshold will be increased from $322,750 to $347,500. Again, a threshold of $200,000 was announced in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we already see much evidence of the detrimental effects of an assets test on other benefits such as Austudy and assistance for isolated children. They have already created hardship for some Australian families. Like many other senators, I have had many representations from people who have already been hurt. We accept the fact that many rural people have assets, but they do not have liquidity. They cannot say that they will pay their bills with their stockyard. Perhaps they could pay them with the sale of stock-that is, if they had some stock, or crops, that were of some value. The problem is that no money is coming in and parents need actual cash to cope with the expenses of raising a family. Denying rural families these allowances will preclude many young people in rural areas from receiving the same opportunity as those who live in the cities. There is no doubt that some Australian families are already suffering, and their hardships would be increased by the denial of financial assistance with a test on the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has stated that these changes will principally benefit farmers in rural communities. If it really wants to help farmers, small business people and communities in rural areas, because of the severity of the rural downturn and the deterioration in incomes, it should abolish the assets test altogether-which the Opposition will move for in an amendment to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Government really appreciates the difficulties being experienced by the rural and farming community. Originally, child endowment was not assets tested or means tested; neither was the rebate for dependent children. Now it seems that family allowance is seen merely as a welfare measure put in the same category as unemployment and sickness benefits. Instead, it should be seen as an investment in the next generation of Australians. There are few better investments than in the young children of the families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In our immigration program we pay to bring in children from other nations. It would surely be far better for us to support Australian families and to encourage them to bring up Australian children in the great traditions of our national way of life. These days it appears that Government policy is emphasising much more the provision of child-care centres and extra places. Indeed, we ought to encourage children to be raised within the traditional family units of our nation where child-care is seen as a worthy career and an honoured role. There can be no doubt that a dollar spent on family allowances is a far better investment than a dollar spent on child-care centres. The Government has abused the family allowance firstly by means testing or income testing it, and secondly, through this legislation which seeks to make the payment of it subject to an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no appreciation of what the family allowance is and what it means to families throughout Australia. Indeed, the Government did not seek to amend its original proposals until there was a considerable outcry about the injustice and the insensitivity of these arrangements, particularly during a massive rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Even some Government members eventually acknowledged that there was a very real problem. The Australian Labor Party member for Grey, Mr O'Neil, said many farmers might be assets rich but income poor, particularly with this year's rural downturn. In many cases people in rural areas will not be earning any income. I think this is a complete indictment of this Government. I suggest that, if the Government really wants to help farmers who have been hit hard by the rural downturn and by the deterioration in farm incomes as a result of the Government's own economic policy, it would not even think of introducing a test on the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance is a very important source of income for many farmers. It is not appropriate to have a test which has a very different impact depending upon where people live. By the very nature of farming and small business, liquidity is a major problem. For country people, particularly, the assets test is a most inaccurate and unfair system of determining a family's financial status and ability to make ends meet. It seems to me that the Government believes in helping people in the cities, not in rural Australia where, unfortunately, so few live now. </PARA>
<PARA> In Paul Keating's Australia, farmers are on their knees at the bank manager's table after years of negative income. This action is in keeping with Labor's general attitude of contempt for rural Australia. Messrs Keating and Hawke talk loudly about social justice but rural people, apparently, are not part of the social justice program. What have country people done to be treated in this way? It is bad enough that this Government chooses to beat farmers and small business men. Its economic policies have already been ruinous to anyone trying to contribute to the productivity of the nation. Already, farm children are significantly disadvantaged. Without question, they have reduced opportunities for education, health services, cultural experience and, of course, future employment. That is bad enough, but this proposal would deny them some of the basic necessities of life at a time when many are living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The same lot has befallen many of the small businesses around Australia. As we have been told many times in this Senate by my colleague, Senator Boswell, many small business people are facing the threat of bankruptcy. I remind the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) that, as is the case with farming, assets in a small business are not equivalent to income. Because of the discriminatory nature of the test on such families in such bad economic times, they will soon be among the most disadvantaged in today's ever depressing outlook for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for these reasons that the Opposition will be opposing any sort of assets test on the family allowance. It can only further disadvantage those children of families who are already in difficult financial circumstances. I remind the Government that it is one thing to be efficient in the outlay of taxpayers' money by the Department of Social Security and quite another to achieve a reduction in outlays at the expense of families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990. This Bill raises very complex and difficult issues involving, among other things, clashes of important principles including the need to protect the revenue while, at the same time, ensuring that an individual's privacy is not compromised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs held five hearings and heard evidence from a variety of outside organisations including the Australian Privacy Foundation and the Australian Council of Social Service. The Privacy Commissioner made some useful and valuable contributions to the Committee's considerations. I would like to record in this chamber that I believe the Committee worked very effectively which is in no small measure due to the abilities of its Chairman, Senator Cooney, and the intelligent approach of my colleagues including Senator Vanstone, Senator Alston, Senator Patterson and Senator O'Chee whose questions helped draw out the difficult issues which were raised by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The data-matching Bill will, amongst other things, allow the relevant agencies to transfer sets of client data to a matching agency set up within the Department of Social Security. It proposes to regulate the conduct of data matching programs by requiring that agencies substantially follow a six step framework as set out in the Bill. It has to be stated that by bringing this Bill into the Parliament the Government has broken the promises it made regarding the use of the tax file number scheme. The Australian Privacy Foundation, through Roger Clark, very effectively outlined the series of assurances that the Government had given on the limited use of the tax file number. In June 1988 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have no intention now or in the future of extending the basis of the tax file number to do anything like some of the Australia Card tasks.</PARA>
<PARA>In September 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>No other government or non-government agency will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system, nor will it be able to use an individual's TFN for a registration system of its own. </PARA>
<PARA>The response of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, to these accusations was little short of astonishing. In the committee stage of the Bill, Senator Vanstone asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What has changed since these commitments were given?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson made a new contribution to political theory by replying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . everytime in a budget process the Government announces a change you could define it as going back on an undertaking. All Governments of all persuasions do it all of the time. They have to; that is what the budget process is all about. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an astonishing view of the Budget process. I am sure that it is a view that Senator Collins, who is at the table, will certainly not endorse when he stands up to speak. Given the performance of the Labor Government and its disgraceful record of broken promises across a whole range of issues, it comes as little surprise to people on this side of the chamber that Senator Richardson should hold this view of the Budget process. It is worth making the point to Senator Richardson that Budgets should be largely about honouring promises, not breaking them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson gave two reasons for the Government breaking its promise with regard to the tax file number. As he says, the main reason we have `gone further' is so that we can now get the technology to do something we could not obtain several years ago. The second reason for the broken promise was to cut $1 billion off government expenditure in the last Budget. Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA>So if you make that decision you have to examine ways of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA>If the reason for breaking a promise is to save money it again helps to explain the easy manner in which this Government breaks its promises. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are numerous ways in which money can be saved without breaching solemn undertakings which have been given to the public. For example, Senator Richardson could have examined the Economic Action Plan of the coalition which effectively identifies $2.8 billion in savings which the Government could have put into effect without breaking its solemn promise. Senator Richardson also gave another reason for the broken promise-to make these savings without impacting on honest people. We applaud the desire to avoid impacting on honest people. It was the Opposition's intention to ensure that this legislation does not intrude on important principles of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not argue that the Government is not aware of the privacy problems. It has attempted in this Bill to institute measures which would protect privacy considerations. We believe these measures are simply not adequate. The amendments which will be moved by Senator Alston will ensure that the privacy principles are buttressed in a number of very important and significant ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimate of savings made by the Government through this broken promise is $65m in the first year rising to over $300m in subsequent years. One of the major concerns of the Committee was to analyse whether the Government was in effect introducing an Australia Card. There was a very vigorous debate between the Privacy Foundation and the Privacy Commissioner. Mr O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, tabled two important documents before the Committee in which he analysed the arguments put forward by the Privacy Foundation that the Government was, in effect, introducing an Australia Card. These documents were carefully read by members of the Committee. Mr O'Connor summed up the differences between the Australia Card and the extension of the tax file number as proposed in this Bill. The views of the Privacy Commissioner are set out in the Hansard of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing on Monday, 3 December. Mr O'Connor said that the differences are at two levels, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it was important that the Australia Card took the form of a card. Sure, it bore a number, and a number was a key element of the scheme . . . its administration was to have a universal impact and to be fairly intrusive at the point of registration.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that he thought other differences were also significant, and again I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The significant distinctions appear to lie in the health care area, that is, Health Insurance Commission, Department of Health, and then in the census, death, epidemiological area, where it was proposed that those authorities would have access to the national births deaths and marriages register. I think we all know separately that a small but significant group in the community is constantly challenging aspects of the practice of the Bureau of Statistics. I spent, I think, the first six months of last year looking at those complaints quite consistently. Then we had uses proposed, on the final version of the scheme-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australia Card scheme-</PARA>
<PARA>in the immigration area and in the passports area, and again under the final version to the births, deaths and marriages register. So it was being used as an identity authentication device. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the assurances of the Privacy Commissioner, the coalition is concerned by the extension of the use of the tax file number and believes that these extensions must be counterbalanced by upgrading the role of the Privacy Commissioner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the restraints of the guillotine, I will restrict my comments to the extension of the tax file number system and the setting up within the Department of Social Security of an eligibility checking facility for Commonwealth income support agencies. The Government's attempts to put these two proposals into a workable legislative form have been nothing but disgraceful-sloppy and indecisive. The Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill all reveal additional pieces of the Government's tax file number jigsaw. They extend the mandatory provision of tax file numbers to clients of the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the first home owners scheme, and outline how these tax file numbers will be used to crosscheck data provided to the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Community Services and Health. There were 50 Government amendments to the original data-matching Bill one week after it came to the Senate. The Bill came into the Senate on the Thursday night, and the following Friday 50 amendments were faxed to my office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As Senator Kemp says, that is disgraceful. In fact, there were so many changes that it was decided to break the Senate's Bills curfew and draw up a new data-matching Bill incorporating the amendments. This Bill is about the privacy of Australians and the extension of a tax file number. What do we have? We have legislation brought into this place that has 50 Government amendments before it even sees a day in this chamber. Despite all these changes, the Government still cannot strike a proper balance between identifying fraud and protecting the privacy of honest citizens. My staff member and I have spent hours and hours, as no doubt have the members and staff of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, examining this Bill in haste. The Bill was brought in at 8 o'clock on Thursday night. The next Friday morning we were supposed to be looking at this Bill in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) assured us that tax file numbers would be administered exclusively by the Australian Taxation Office for tax purposes. They were designed solely to help reduce tax evasion, he said. They would not apply to benefits where tax instalments were not deducted, nor would they apply to exempt pensions, such as invalid pensions. Finally, he said, the Government had agreed that the tax file number system would be completely voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> Within two years, all of these assurances have been torn to shreds. They are not worth the paper they have been written on, if they were ever written on paper-and, anyway, we have learnt what Mr Keating's assurances mean. As clause 93 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill states, the tax file number is to be used to facilitate the administration of any Commonwealth legislation under which pensions, allowances, benefits or other payments are provided. These Bills make providing a tax file number a prerequisite to the payment of all government benefits, including social security and veterans' affairs pensions, which have no connection with the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> We are haunted by the suggestion made to the 1985 Tax Summit that the way to introduce the Australia Card was by staged implementation. That is how the Government would introduce a national identity scheme. This would be desirable, a good way to do it, because it would minimise adverse public reaction: we'll bring it in by stealth and what we will do is bring it in at the end of a session and hold a gun at their heads and tell them various things about what is going to happen and how much money will be lost if we do not bring it in. </PARA>
<PARA> What is Senator Richardson's reaction to the change and the turnaround in the promises that the tax file number would not be extended? We have heard him tonight, `Nothing is immutable'-Senator Richardson has learnt a new word- `we have kept lots of promises and we have broken some. That is what the Budget process is all about'. That is not a normal part of the Budget process, and Senator Kemp has gone into that in much more detail. The Government gave firm assurances about a matter of principle that had evoked adverse public reaction-that reaction to the Australia Card was unsurpassed in the 1980s-and yet this is another one of the Government's long line of broken promises. </PARA>
<PARA> We still cannot believe what the Government says about tax file numbers and data matching. On 9 September, in an answer to a question I asked, Senator Richardson told the Senate that the Tax Office would provide the Department of Social Security with data-matching details relating only to Social Security clients. He really was not on top of it and he had to slide, during the next few days, into a bit more detail. But then that was not what was going to happen. It is untrue that it was going to provide the Department of Social Security with only DSS data-matching details. Steps 2 and 3 of clause 7 of the Bill confirm that the Tax Office will give Social Security details relating to all of the agencies involved in the data matching-and that was what was denied in that first question. </PARA>
<PARA> Then on 10 October-as I said, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) was slipping along because he was beginning to get a small grasp of what it was all about-the Minister claimed that all the data from the data-matching process would be destroyed within 90 days. But he was wrong again. He had not paid attention to the detail. He has not got on top of his portfolio, as we know. On the contrary, the Bill allows source agencies to retain the data indefinitely. In his first second reading speech, the Minister claimed that the guidelines in the schedule would be replaced by the Privacy Commissioner's general data-matching guidelines when they were finally released. The Bill simply does not allow for this takeover. The Minister has concocted a misguided idea that the stricter guidelines will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the latest and maybe the most deceitful backflip of all. In the hearings, Social Security was adamant that the data matching would be precise and that any discrepancies derived would be conclusive. I have here-and I have not got the time to go through them-Hansard quotation after Hansard quotation after Hansard quotation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Senator Crichton-Browne. I have example after example of senior people in the Department saying, `This will be precise. When we get a hit, it will be a hit. When we get a match, it will be a match. It will be definite'. However, the Bill no longer backs up this assertion. Originally, the Bill allowed Social Security to return to the source agency any data that `showed' that something might be untoward. Then in what the Minister referred to as `a minor drafting change', the word `show' suddenly disappeared and `suggest' appeared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might seem to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, a minor change, but let me tell you that that minor change has caused great stirrings in the Department, great stirrings even to the point that we have the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) writing to the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, about it-about one little word. But what the Minister said was that it was `a minor drafting change'. </PARA>
<PARA> Because `suggest' did not reflect the claimed certainty of the data-matching results, the Opposition sought to replace it with the word `indicate'. Well, all hell broke loose. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, treading delicately through this legislation, as it had to because of the policy implications-and, having been a member of that Committee, I know how difficult it must have been-actually talked about this in its second report. It said it was concerned that `show' had been changed to `suggest'. However, we had the gall to suggest that we would move an amendment to change it to `indicate'! Next thing the Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Opposition claiming that $150m a year would be lost. He plucked out of the sky a rough estimate of where the agencies might get mismatches in their dragnet fishing operations. When Dr Hewson replied, an answer came back not from the Prime Minister but from the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not accept that the debate about `indicate' and `suggest' is merely one of semantics. The Government regards this as a fundamental issue going to the heart of the data matching program. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, you know in your heart of hearts, even if you cannot admit it outwardly, that the Minister on the one hand said that changing the word `show' to `suggest' was a minor drafting change but, on the other hand, when the Opposition wanted to change it from `suggest' to `indicate', said he did not regard the debate as merely an issue of semantics. He said that the Government regarded the matter `as a fundamental issue going to the heart of the data-matching program'. I wonder about the Minister and whether he is capable of discerning fact from fiction. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the clause as a whole, one finds that, with our amendment, it would say, `indicate that the person might have been in receipt of an overpayment' and `might' have done something else; it does not say `indicate that the person is in receipt of an overpayment'. Anyway, all hell broke loose. The Government had an army of bureaucrats to add up the figures-although as far as I am concerned they did not add up. But we have conceded that it might have lost $150m a year. I am concerned about the privacy of those social security benefit recipients-the veterans and students on Austudy, who today do not have the freedom not to belong to a union. I have suggested, and the Opposition has agreed to it, that we put at the end of our amendments a requirement that the matching agency and the source agency come back to the two Houses of Parliament and justify what they have been doing. They should show us how accurate they are and tell us how many false positives and how many positive positives they get, because from evidence presented to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs one would have thought that almost everyone was going to be a positive hit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has openly admitted that this data matching is driven by money and technology. Senator Powell addressed this issue, and I think it is something about which we must be very careful. We have seen it in the Health Insurance Commission. That is an issue I shall address because it will not go away. As technology develops, we will have bureaucrats saying, `Oh, we can save money. Don't worry about privacy'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; `We can probably save money; let's go ahead with it'. We must be vigilant about this matter. Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I both were afraid, on the committee inquiring into higher education, about the technocrats not understanding the ethics of their professions. That is what we have to be concerned about. That is the issue we are discussing today-the core of a Senate report which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) dismissed out of hand. We are looking at the heart of the issues. People see something as convenient and easy and they forget the social issues that go along with it. On 10 October the Minister claimed that the scheme would take $400m from the pockets of cheats and bludgers. The explanatory memorandum for the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill says that the whole data-matching package will generate savings of $290m in 1991-92. However, the Department of Social Security (DSS) believes that it will achieve $290m by itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 29 November, the Minister claimed annual savings of $350m. We know that these are all gross figures and not really savings at all. I have identified costs of over $14.3m for the first financial year which put a sizeable dent in the estimated savings of $65m. The Minister is known as the chief numbers cruncher but I think this is taking his job beyond its limits. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Social Security estimates are based on the assumption that a 2 per cent residual of clients are illegitimately receiving benefits but are not being identified by present monitoring techniques. The 2 per cent is based solely on a survey of 10,000 family allowance clients undertaken between June and October 1989. The sample is totally unrepresentative of DSS's client population in terms of how much they are paid, why they are paid, how often they are monitored and the methods that they use to cheat the system. </PARA>
<PARA> DSS has also referred to risk based reviews and accelerated claimant matching results as evidence that the residual is at least 2 per cent. This is also a rubbery guesstimate. When I asked bureaucrats, the senior public servants, how they got these figures, they said, `Well, a lot of it is based on experience'. There is no breakdown of savings from each of the three types of matching, namely, identity matching, income matching and double payments. There is no estimate of the percentage of the 2 per cent residual that would be picked up by data matching. No account is given for welfare clients who have not lodged tax returns for the last financial year and who are not legally required to do so. Also, we have no figures at all for the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has openly admitted that the use of tax file numbers as an identifying link in this data-matching exercise is technology driven. Social Security has found computer technology that can high speed parallel match large amounts of data obtained from a number of sources. However, this technology requires a highly structured matching key, such as a tax file number. As representatives of the Department said at the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing on 9 November, Social Security believes that the matching cannot be effectively carried out without using such a key. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has put the cart before the horse. The tender for the matching will go out after the legislation is passed, yet the Bill has been specifically framed to accommodate the technology earmarked for the data matching. Already a number of computer companies and some computer experts have told me that they can do the data matching without using a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> Had we had the time and had due process been given to this legislation, a Senate inquiry would have had the chance to ask questions of those experts. I am not a computer expert and I do not pretend to be, but I have learnt a lot in the last two months. We would have had the opportunity, on behalf of the Australian public, to examine this properly and in much more detail, not as it has been done here-brought in on a Thursday night and debated in the Committee on a Friday. It is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> Except for a representative of Australian Associated Press, there is not one person in the press gallery. I do not suppose that other members of the press are watching the proceedings on television or listening. They are not interested in this issue, which is about the privacy of Australians. I believe that the Health Insurance Commission will be next. Someone will say, `Oh, we need the tax file number for the Health Insurance Commission'. Then it will be, `Oh, it is stupid to have a tax file number and a Medicare number. Why not have a single number'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not convinced that the tax file number is an essential element of the data-matching proposal; it is certainly not essential enough to warrant the Government reneging on its 1988 assurances. The Department assures us that a fair and open tender will be conducted. I will be watching that very closely. That may be true, but the very specific nature of the legislation may well disqualify tenderers whose technology does not require the use of the tax file number as an identifying link. </PARA>
<PARA> How conned we will be if it is found that the tax file number is not needed for the data matching and is only being used because the Act was drafted to accommodate technology that the Department had earmarked to do not only this task but management information system tasks as well-all because Canberra bureaucrats are locked into a particular system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is as keen as the Government to stamp out welfare fraud. However, the Government stands condemned for the deceitful and unethical way in which it has handled this data-matching proposal. It has unashamedly turned its back on its 1988 tax file number assurances without even proving the necessity for the tax file number in the data-matching process. It has put the Privacy Commissioner on a false pedestal, whilst realising that the Privacy Act `statutorily muzzles' him from speaking his mind on an issue about which we know he is very concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst claiming how privacy conscious it is, the Government has presided over a massive watering down of the draft data-matching guidelines. I will address these privacy matters in the committee stage of the Bill. Over the last two months we have witnessed intolerably sloppy drafting, pie in the sky estimates, and a Minister whose lack of understanding of this issue has been evidenced time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA> Data matching can be a very effective weapon against welfare fraud, but it is not the only weapon and nor is it the only solution. If the Government is serious about stopping fraud, it must also make a concerted effort to improve the efficiency of its other monitoring and recovery procedures. Yesterday's tabling of the Auditor-General's report on the telephone rental concession scheme is testimony to this fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be but five minutes because much of what I might have been tempted to observe has been presented in a very articulate way by both Senator Alston and Senator Patterson. The reason I bothered to rise is that I believe that, of all personal human rights, privacy perhaps goes to the central core of human nature's desire for some certain limits against intrusion. Once that basic right is abrogated in any way, when that right is eroded, then we begin to erode all other rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all agree that whatever the circumstance there is nothing more personally offensive to our soul than to have our privacy threatened-whether it be by way of our conversations being unlawfully listened to or whether it be as a result of what we judge to be private information being exposed to improper public scrutiny. Of course, in principle, it is sensible to have the means to trace payments and claims histories and to have the facilities to cross-match information. However, let me remind the Senate of what the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said on 1 September 1988 in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>No other government or non-government agency will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system, nor will it be able to use an individual's tax file number for any registration system of its own. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps my words were prophetic. As I now cast my eye back, I see what I said in this Senate during the introduction of the tax file number in its original form. On 10 November 1988 I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Once introduced into Australia government will find it hard to resist the temptation to expand its scope and to encompass transactions it was not originally meant to regulate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about comments to the effect that the system is now, in all respects, voluntary. I have some difficulty with this notion, given the pecuniary penalties involved in not quoting one's tax file number. I suggest that the system operate with the assistance of a certain amount of compulsion.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to observe:</PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience in particular demonstrates that legislation of this kind, even if originally limited in scope and intent, will quickly escalate to cover the fields of human transactions and dealings. The Australian Privacy Council calls this `function creep'; that is, a substantial confinement of the uses of the identification system to taxation purposes is a constraint which will be eroded by the incremental addition of functions for which the tax file number will become an essential adjunct. </PARA>
<PARA>How absolutely true. I quoted examples of the United States of America and Canada, where the tax file number was set up for one basic reason. They found, as I think Senator Patterson mentioned, that it was a great convenience and a great temptation for other government departments to want to embrace it and the information contained therein. </PARA>
<PARA> It has taken absolutely no time for this Government to recognise the merit and benefit in terms of financial savings of expanding the use of the tax file number. In 1988 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended in relation to the tax file number legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . be strictly limited in its terms so it applies only in relation to taxation purposes and those purposes be so framed as to prevent a progressive extension of the ambit of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson would tell us that the Government has kept the word of its commitment. The present guidelines provide, inter alia, that the tax file number is not to be used for cross-matching information for `non-tax purposes'. The Government notionally stays within its guidelines simply by progressively widening the scope of the objects of the tax file number in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In other words, it simply broadens the definition of taxation purposes. The Privacy Commissioner then obligingly broadens the tax file number guidelines accordingly. Perhaps such manoeuvres by the Government would be more difficult if the Privacy Commissioner had greater independence and an ability to report directly to the Parliament other than through his annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the question of what taxation is, a substantial degree of legal fiction is now involved. The guidelines currently state that the Department of Social Security is administratively responsible for taxation law. The Budget provisions make all government benefits taxation matters, even where the benefit is entirely non-taxable. So the Government, by using this word `taxation', comforts and soothes itself by arguing that it is still strictly within the parameters of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say just two things about my specific privacy concerns. Firstly, data matching is a random technique which involves an arbitrary investigation of a whole class of persons without reasonable cause. Information collected for one purpose is matched for another purpose without the consent or knowledge of the person involved. In this regard it should be observed that data matching is to be applied retrospectively in the sense that the information which was disclosed prior to the announcement of this program is to be included in the matching program. There can be no argument as to consent or knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I find it passing strange when I look back on the landscape of this Government and those amongst it who used to consider themselves the great civil libertarians that Senator Zakharov might have once been a good example, but now is just a remnant, of somebody who cared about these matters. There was a time when she would have been most indignant about the pervasive influence that government has on one's life, the amount of information that is available to governments--</PARA>

Everybody is cheating until the Government can satisfy itself that they are not.

There should be some minimum remedies both for negligent matching, resulting in any kind of detriment to beneficiaries, and for owner authorised use or disclosure of information exchanged pursuant to the data-matching exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not attempt to answer every point raised in the second reading debate, given that many points will be raised in the committee stage. However, I would like to go over a few. Senator Alston's contribution at the beginning of the second reading debate consisted largely of an attack on Government economic policy, which is not worth refuting now. His reference to my alleged backdowns beggars the imagination. I find it extraordinary that he referred to the family allowance assets test. He said that the decision was hastily conceived and amended when the Government knew the full story. The reality was that the Government took the decision in June. It was announced in August, but during the four to five months from when the decision was originally taken the rural crisis got much worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When fully appraised of how bad the rural crisis has become the Government either takes false pride in a decision taken on one set of parameters and refuses to admit a change, or when the parameters change the Government addresses that change and alters the decision. That is what happened. The Government, in changing the original Budget proposal for a family allowance assets test, was able to forgo $25m in savings and I am accused of a backdown. Yet on the very same provision the Opposition proposed to abandon it altogether, forgoing a further $57m on top of the $25m forgone by the Government. The fact is that when it comes to backdowns on this issue, Dr Hewson could not even front his own Party room and allowed his shadow Minister to get rolled instead. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to the pharmaceutical changes, we were also accused of some enormous backdown because of the $50 up-front payment to pensioners. That was money to which they were already entitled under the Government's announcement in the Budget. It was merely brought forward. There was no new money and no suggestion of an extra payment. Money was merely brought forward to ameliorate any effects. In terms of a backdown on the chronically ill, again one ought to be able to admit that if people are chronically ill and are going to suffer hardship from a decision, then a very minor amendment can be the right thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees, while welcoming many changes, was particularly concerned with the deeming provisions. Senator Newman correctly quoted from something I had said earlier about the Government varying the decision on the 10 per cent interest rate. I intend to speak with members of the Senate committee during the course of this week on the direction of that debate and consult with them again prior to Parliament resuming in February, when an announcement can be made on what rate will apply from March. If the 10 per cent is not available at call to people right around the country, with a minimum of fuss and bother, then that amount would be changed. </PARA>

I would not dare suggest that-not complete, anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When there are negotiations with agencies-not to mention the Privacy Commissioner-in Senate committees, then numbers of amendments are obviously possible. It is not the case in the Senate that the Government has the numbers to crunch through anything it likes, and therefore amendments to Bills the size of this one-and this kind of dimension is rare-occur every single year. There is nothing terribly unusual about these. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from our figures being proved to be rubbery, as Senator Patterson has said, they have stood up to the test every single time they have been examined. Even the amnesty figures, which I thought were underdone, finished up coming out almost exactly right; I only hope we can have a debate on tax file numbers in 12 months time because the Government's Estimates for this will prove to be underdone. We will get more out of tax file numbers than we have put in the Budget; they are very conservative figures indeed. None of them are rubbery. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains changes that will affect social security recipients for years to come, but the most important thing is that all fraud in the system that can be eliminated will be eliminated by this measure, by the use of computer technology which has only come onto the market during the last six to nine months.

<PARA> ``(c) notwithstanding any other law or provision to the contrary, the power referred in (b) hereof shall not be capable of delegation.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment provides for an action to be commenced within 12 months of the date on which information is received but then provides a mechanism by which agencies can get extensions of time, essentially self-executing, because they will simply apply to the relevant secretary to the department. We believe that that is an effective way of ensuring that there is some control over discipline exercised, that it is not too difficult to obtain extensions while in the ultimate the agencies themselves, through the secretaries, will be accountable. </PARA>

That is why we move the amendment in that form. It does not preclude the collection and assembling of material. </PARA>

<PARA>The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), in his second reading speech or, might I say, in various drafts of it, waxed and waned about whether there would be any further guidelines following those currently attached to the schedule. Therefore, we wish to make it clear that we regard what is there at present as interim guidelines. We wish to put a discipline on the Privacy Commissioner in terms of time so that he can address his mind to the current draft set that applies to Commonwealth administration and then specifically decide whether those guidelines or any narrower form ought to apply to this Act. In that way, we will have the matter specifically addressed by the expert rather than simply leave it to the Government as a matter of discretion to judge whether or not it thinks there is a need for it. </PARA>

<PARA> ``13a (1) A breach of Part 2 of this Act or a breach of the guidelines referred to in section 12 constitutes an act or practice involving interference with the privacy of an individual for the purposes of section 13 of the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) An individual may complain to the Privacy Commissioner about an act or practice in relation to the operation of this Act which may be an interference with the privacy of the individual. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment inserts an additional clause 13a after clause 13. The object of the exercise is simply to ensure that the provisions in the Privacy Act that enable breaches to be dealt with will encompass a breach of this Bill. In those circumstances, it would allow for the various rights and remedies that are provided in the Privacy Act to apply to this Bill. At the moment there seems to be a gap that would not allow for injunctions to be obtained, damages awarded or, indeed, any proper investigation carried out of a breach of an individual's privacy under this Bill. For that reason we want to bring the two together. </PARA>

Without wanting to traverse Question Time today, perhaps we will be able to see which of the many predictions about revenue saving will come to pass.

We are very much concerned about the Government's cynical disregard of its previous promises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While amendment No. 14 actually covers a fairly wide range of matters, essentially it aims to provide the Privacy Commissioner with a degree of independence that we do not believe is there at the present time. There are some misconceptions about what might be involved. We do not propose that the Privacy Commissioner be part of the Executive or part of the Parliament as an officer of the Parliament, but rather that he be a statutory officer appointed by the Parliament. The current Privacy Act allows for an interim appointment to be made or for an acting commissioner to be appointed in the event of that position becoming vacant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our proposal would simply enable the Parliament to make a judgment. That is not something that should be shied away from. In many respects, it ought to be welcomed. One would think that the Government would follow the same path that it currently follows in relation to the appointment of High Court judges, that is, to consult with the States. In this instance, the Government would consult with Opposition parties in order to ensure that it put forward a candidate of high calibre. I would have thought that a government acting responsibly would have nothing to fear from that. Any Opposition that chose to reject that nominee capriciously would rightly incur the wrath of the community. Therefore, I would have thought anyone would be very reluctant to oppose such a nominee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition sees this amendment as simply a mechanism for ensuring that in future the Privacy Commissioner remains, as best he can, more responsible to Parliament and able to report directly to Parliament and to have a direct line of appropriation so that he does not have to rely on the continuing goodwill of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, as he does at the moment. I hasten to say that no difficulties have been experienced by him in that regard to date, but there is always the possibility that the Government might squeeze the Commission, which would then feel compelled to put the squeeze on the Privacy Commissioner. Our amendment would simply enable him to have a line allocation of his own. </PARA>

<PARA> I am not confident that we will have the support of the Australian Democrats on this. It is a matter of regret that they do not appear to be willing to go down this track. In many respects it is a new approach, but I think, given the concerns that the Democrats share for the ways in which this Government has been forced to face up to the privacy considerations virtually as a last resort in order to get this legislation through, this might have been the opportunity to regard the Privacy Commissioner--</PARA>

It would be, in our view, odd to pick out the Privacy Commissioner from the range of human rights and equal opportunity commissioners and leave the other commissioners with a different status. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, it would not necessarily give strengthened or clearer functions to the Privacy Commissioner, as we are proposing to do via our other amendment and as has been initiated by the Government's amendment. We do worry that appointment by both Houses of Parliament could lead to the sorts of problems that one sees in the appointment of Supreme Court judges in the United States of America. In essence, we believe that the amendment I will be moving subsequent to this one takes us down a much better path, so we do not support the thrust of this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We do, however, support some sections of this amendment and I will identify those sections by naming their headings. The sections of this amendment the headings of which I read out will be supported by us, and I ask the Committee to accept that as an amendment to Senator Alston's amendment. I cannot do it by numbers because some of the sections do not have numbers and some have duplicate numbers. We are prepared to support the sections of this amendment headed, `Principal Act' and `Interferences with privacy'; the section at the bottom of page 5 headed, `Functions of Commissioner in relation to interferences with privacy'-with the exception of section (d) (q); the section on page 6 headed, `Report following examination of proposed enactment'; and, also on page 6, the section headed, `Report following the monitoring of certain activities'. I apologise to the Committee, but there did not seem to be any other way to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Committee can accommodate accepting those headed sections as supported by the Democrats and therefore able to be passed, I would so move to amend Senator Alston's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> The deficiencies and the lack of clarity in relation to the Commissioner's present powers were revealed during the committee process that led up to tonight's conclusion of the debate.

We would much prefer him to express considered views through the Parliament and elsewhere and, generally, in many ways contribute to discussion by presenting papers, speaking at forums and doing all those normal things that can be done.

<PARA> The Government amendment is a more reasonable alternative which will enable proposed enactments, proposals for data-matching, and the like, to be the subject of a report by the Commissioner. The agencies then get 60 days to respond to that Commissioner's report.

<PARA> The guidelines as they appear in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990 are a watered down version of the draft guidelines that the Privacy Commissioner released in public debate in October this year. There are a number of fairly sloppy situations where, for example, the protocol is outlined, as is the technical standards report. The program protocol has to be presented to the Privacy Commissioner. Nowhere does it say that the program protocol or the technical standards report have to be enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have addressed other issues in these amendments. For example, we have ensured that the public is fully informed and that the clients of the source agencies know the purpose for which the information they are giving that agency will be used; that is, in data matching. We have tried, in consultation with the Department, to put in an amendment which will not place undue demands upon the Department, yet give attention to the privacy concerns of the individuals who are providing information. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue we addressed was legislation to strengthen the power of the Privacy Commissioner. In this Bill he is only able to request agencies to provide information. We will give him the power to require such information, which strengthens his powers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last amendment there is a requirement that the matching and source agencies will have to report to the Parliament six months after the first data matching cycle has commenced. I put the Government on notice that if, in the opinion of the Liberal-National parties, these reports from the source agencies and the data matching agency are not adequate, then we will move a motion-I am sure that we will have the support of the Democrats-that the legislation be referred to a select committee for examination so that it fully examines the data matching program prior to the sunset clause coming into effect. We will not be doing this at the eleventh hour; we will do it with due consideration and hopefully we will have the information before us as will be required in that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of these amendments are acceptable to the Government, but some are not. Amendment 15 on the program protocol requires the disclosure of material prepared for Cabinet. That is a worry. Amendment 17 does not seem to us to make any great sense. It is not descriptive of an individual's rights. The Bill confines agencies to conform to all matters referred to in the protocol. I cannot see any need for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amendment No. 18 contains the vague term `reasonable steps'. I worry about the use of it, but it is not a great problem. Amendments Nos 19 and 20 are not a great problem. Amendment No. 21 permits the Privacy Commissioner to change the terms of the technical standards report. It will also make non-compliance with the change a breach of the data matching guidelines and subject to remedies under clause 13. This means that an agency could be taken to have breached the data matching guidelines because the Privacy Commissioner has changed the standards without the agency even knowing. It is also highly doubtful whether the Privacy Commissioner will always have access to the expertise sufficient to ensure that those imposed changes are practical. We are dealing with highly technical and complex standards. I do not believe that that is necessarily the Privacy Commissioner's area of expertise. Amendment No. 22 also concerns the technical standards report. That report details how matching will be done technologically and how security will be ensured. Again, it is not prescriptive of the rights of any individual. Of course, the Bill obliges agencies to follow the standards laid down. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment that concerns me is amendment No. 26. This amendment provides for an additional guideline requiring a source agency to delete information about action taken against a person as a result of a data match when that action is complete. There is already in existence a disposal schedule in accordance with the Archives Act under which destruction would occur within a set period after a person ceases to be a client. We believe that to be an adequate protection. The other amendments are acceptable. I think some of them are unnecessary, but none of them interfere with the integrity of the Bill. The Government opposes the amendments that I have just referred to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to page 5 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, clause 5 (q), which is a re-definition of `prescribed student child'. The Government has taken that measure to overcome a position that I raised in this chamber as far back as May of this year. I raised a case of a person who was living in Port Arthur in Tasmania; that person had appealed against the removal of family allowance when her child reached 16 because she was receiving a boarding allowance for a student child under the assistance for isolated children (AIC) scheme. I asked the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) whether he had noted that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal said that, because of the technical interpretation of section 81 of the Social Security Act, the appellant's appeal could not be upheld but that her case was `a reasonable case' and that it seemed `unreasonable that receipt of AIC . . . should disqualify receipt of family allowance'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a fair amount of toing and froing about that matter; in the end, when the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 came before the chamber on 29 May, I moved an amendment to give effect to the views of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and to have the matter rectified. The Minister responded by indicating that this was a very important question, that there was a question of justice involved and that, as Minister for Social Security, he was concerned that any injustice should be rectified. He indicated that, so far as the Government was concerned, he believed that this was a matter that should be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that the Minister has rectified the problem, but he has done so in a manner that has not taken account of the fact that the person who was affected and whose case actually highlighted the injustice has still not received a payment. I refer the Minister to the comments that he made in respect of this matter when I moved the same amendment to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill last session. On 29 May 1990 the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a problem with the drafting of Senator Harradine's amendment which, I think, renders the Committee incapable of agreeing to it. Senator Harradine's amendment proposes an amendment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>the Minister described the problem, and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is feasible that an amendment with the same effect as Senator Harradine's could be drafted, but this would not be an easy task. It would be quite a complicated one, and I do not believe that we would be able to achieve that tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>If one goes back to-</PARA>
<PARA>and he mentioned the case-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . from which this arose, it should be noted that when Senator Harradine raised this matter in the Senate I said that it was the only case of its kind. I think that there are 2,300 children in receipt of assistance for isolated children. This is the only time that a case of the kind that Senator Harradine has mentioned has come up. If we could wait and draft the section properly, we may well come up with the results that Senator Harradine wants without causing any extra unintended consequences of the kind that he has said tonight he wishes to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, the Minister gave an assurance that the matter would be dealt with and that, as far as he was concerned, the person concerned would be reimbursed. I cannot pick it up from the Hansard but the Minister will recall that that is what he said. I was given the very clear impression that the person concerned would be reimbursed. It seems to me only just that this should be the case, particularly as I then went ahead and withdrew the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Opposition and the Democrats had indicated that they were prepared to view the amendment favourably, but then I withdrew it on the undertaking by the Minister that action would be taken to remedy the injustice. This is only part of the action and what remains to be done is for the Government to make sure that there is some act of grace payment. I believe that there is a precedent for the case of the person concerned because it appears to fall into a generally recognised category for an act of grace payment in that it drew attention to an anomaly and led to the legislative change that is taking place tonight. I appeal to the Minister to honour the undertaking that he gave on the previous occasion and to take action in this case. </PARA>

Like Senator Harradine, I have forgotten when he first raised the matter but it was some time back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In November this year I signed a letter to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in which I strongly advised that an act of grace payment would, on this occasion, be appropriate.

The wheels of the Department of Finance sometimes turn slowly. I only wish they would turn that slowly when they are seeking some money off us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Defence Force Development Committee considerations leading to procurement decisions occurred in August 1984, November 1985 and April 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The prime contract was let on 29 May 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The planned cost of the prime contract (initially for 14 aircraft) was $A179.275m (September 1985 prices).</PARA>
<PARA> An option to purchase an additional 25 aircraft was exercised in May 1987, at a further cost of $A288.421m (September 1985 prices).</PARA>
<PARA> The planned completion date for the contract as of May 1987 was September 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) No sub-contracts have been let by the Commonwealth; however, many have been let by the prime contractor, United Technologies Corporation. Information about these sub-contracts is Commercial-In-Confidence between the prime contractor and the sub-contractors.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) An eight month delay has been caused by slower than expected assembly, inspection and test (AIT) of the aircraft by the main Australian sub-contractor, resulting, in part, from early under-estimation of the size and complexity of the task.</PARA>
<PARA> A project cost decrease from $A749.750m (April 1987 prices) to $A708.581m (April 1990 prices) has resulted from rationalisation by Air Force of logistic support requirements in the project, and the effect of exchange rate changes, particularly in FY 1987/88 and FY 1989/90.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Payment of monies against the contract is tied to physical milestones (over 80 in all). The final milestone payment is due to be paid in February 1991.</PARA>
