<TITLE>Sydney Airport: Third Runway</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectively showeth that the Federal Labor Government is procrastinating over the decision on the third runway at Sydney Airport. An immediate decision to construct the third runway is essential to ensure that regional air links are maintained to Sydney Airport. Continued access by rural airlines to Sydney Airport is essential for business purposes in the Sydney Central Business District (CBD), to connect with interstate and international flights, for essential legal, health and welfare services, and to encourage decentralisation.</PARA>
<PARA>And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The Port Hedland/Marble Bar road is in terrible condition;</PARA>
<PARA> As far back as the early 1950s the people of Marble Bar were promised an all weather road;</PARA>

<PARA>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA> - gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association;</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>I am introducing this Private Member's Bill to remedy a major deficiency in the Broadcasting Act. The Bill would close the loophole in that Act which allows the incidental advertising of tobacco products on broadcast media. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of great regret to me that it has proven necessary to introduce this Bill. Earlier this month, I moved amendments to Government legislation to close the loophole but both the Governments and the Opposition-with the honourable exception of Senators Baume, Herron and Archer-saw fit to oppose those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Various unconvincing arguments were advanced by those who opposed the amendments, ranging from the suggestion that now is not the right time to close the loophole, even though it should be closed through to the longstanding furphy about freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA>All honourable Senators are aware of the support for this measure from medical and consumer organisations who will not desist in their efforts to have it passed by the Parliament. I, too, will continue my efforts, as evidenced by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time I moved my amendments, I outlined the undeniable reasons for supporting this measure and I want to reiterate those reasons in relation to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will be aware-if they are not I will make them aware-that the so-called direct advertising of tobacco products was phased out of the Act between September 1973 and September 1976, but that advertising, which was defined as `accidental or incidental' to broadcasting remained permissible. I understand that this innocuous sounding caveat was an eleventh hour amendment successfully lobbied for by the tobacco industry. That was before the Australian Democrats either existed or had representation in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I also believe that few parliamentarians at the time could really have known just how effectively that loophole in the Act would be exploited. Following the passage of that legislation in the 1970s, the tobacco companies set about buying out Australian sport and, by 1980, the Anti Cancer Council of Victoria tells us, the tobacco industry owned every sporting event worth having-high profile televised events such as tennis, cricket, Rugby League, Australian Rules, horse racing, golf, soccer, ballet and opera: the list is almost endless. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1989, the tobacco industry spent an estimated $20m on sporting sponsorship, of which $12m went to sporting bodies and $8m to promotion, through this loophole in the Act. This is no act of sporting philanthropy on behalf of tobacco companies. It has been a deliberate and highly successful effort to gain access to the broadcast media, access facilitated by the loophole which was retained at the time of the amendment in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of studies have shown just how much television coverage cigarettes have received since the so-called ban in 1976. The Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria estimated that the televising of test cricket over the summer of 1980-81 gave the sponsors Benson and Hedges at least 72 hours of coverage. This included 40,000 exposures of the name Benson and Hedges on a single channel. Things have not improved. A recent report has shown that during one day's play of a Benson and Hedges-sponsored cricket match televised from Sydney in 1988, the television spectator would have seen the Benson and Hedges name or logo clearly for a full 88 minutes of that one day's coverage. </PARA>
<PARA>Equally concerning are the Grand Prix events which feature vehicles predominantly sponsored by tobacco companies. An analysis of television coverage received by Marlboro's Formula One racing car in the Adelaide 1989 Grand Prix show that the Marlboro name gained prominent exposure for up to 36 per cent of broadcasting time. There are other statistics of this nature which have been circulated to all senators and members. I also commend to the attention of all honourable senators a report-a very well documented study-by Donald Martin circulated by the Australian Medical Association. There is no question that the tobacco industry has deliberately sought to circumvent the intention of the Act as it stands. This has been revealed in a number of court cases. An example is the contract between Rothmans' Winfield and the New South Wales Rugby League which was revealed during the Federal High Court case in 1985. A number of clauses in the contract ensured maximum exposure and assistance from the League in gaining high quality exposure, and that exposure was specifically for Winfield cigarettes. Interestingly, there was also an escape clause. The company had the right to terminate the contract if the kinds of advertising and promotion it sought through its sponsorship were restricted or banned by government or any other authority. Not surprisingly, the judges in that case in 1985 agreed that ``the sponsorship arrangement was intended as an advertising opportunity rather than an act of sporting philanthropy''. </PARA>
<PARA>The same court case examined the contract struck between Benson and Hedges and the Australian Ballet. In this contract an incredible 75 per cent of sponsorship money was earmarked for advertising and promotional purposes, leaving the remaining 25 per cent of the funds to be used at the recipient's discretion. In another High Court case decided only in February this year, United Telecasters-Channel 10-was convicted for broadcasting a cigarette advertisement in the form of a Winfield spectacular, a dance extravaganza featuring the Winfield name and logo that took place just before the beginning of the 1984 New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final. Yet more evidence was stacked up in that case against Rothmans. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, in the much publicised Mr Fix-it trial, also earlier this year, in which a former Rothmans executive was tried for fraud, in his summing up of the evidence the judge stated, and I think it is worth quoting: The company's main concern in all this . . . would seem to have been to circumvent the ban placed upon the advertising of tobacco products on television not only by having events assume the company's brand name but also by ensuring that the advertising signs were transmitted on television. No one seems to have questioned the legality of all this, a question which perhaps would now have to be reconsidered in the light of the High Court's decision, the Department of Public Prosecutions v United Telecasters Sydney Limited (which was decided only on 15 February last). </PARA>
<PARA>I could continue to lay before the Senate other examples of a multitude of breaches of the Broadcasting Act, which we are considering today. In short, the legislation-if it is intended, as it says, to ban the advertising of tobacco products-is not working. It has been found before the High Court to have been breached on a number of occasions. It is clearly time for the Parliament to act in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>My Bill seeks simply to remove the so-called incidental advertising provision. Material which is genuinely accidental to broadcast would continue to be permitted. It comes as no surprise to the Democrats that our proposal has met with strong tobacco industry opposition. The tobacco industry's arguments in defence of its actions and position and of continued advertising through sponsorship are fatuous in the extreme. I am reluctant to bring its arguments before the Senate as I do not want to give the industry any particular credibility. But as we will be hearing them in the future, as we have in the past, until I imagine it believes the Democrats' resolve has crumbled, which probably will not be until hell freezes over, I suppose I should take the opportunity briefly to refute at least some of the arguments. </PARA>
<PARA>The tobacco companies ask us to believe that their advertising has no effect on children and that it is merely to encourage brand loyalty, or to persuade existing smokers to swap brands. They claim that restriction of their access to electronic media via sports sponsorship is an incursion on their right to free speech. The industry also threatens the demise of sport as we now know it in this country should we amend the Broadcasting Act in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>I will take each of those particular claims in turn. With total smoking prevalence declining in Australia by about one per cent a year bringing about an estimated annual reduction of smokers of about 120,000, for the tobacco industry to remain viable, clearly it must recruit new smokers. We have very good evidence which shows that children are influenced by tobacco sponsorships. The Australian Cancer Society conducted a national survey in 1984 to measure the smoking habits of Australian schoolchildren. In an interview last week on a radio station in another State, when I sought to quote this survey I was accused of quoting surveys from vested interests. In this debate I would much prefer to quote surveys from the Cancer Society whose vested interests, I would suggest, are positive, than to quote surveys from anyone connected with the tobacco industry whose vested interests are material at the very least, and damaging at the very worst. </PARA>
<PARA>This survey was conducted in 1984 to measure the smoking habits of Australian schoolchildren. As well as finding alarmingly high smoking rates among schoolchildren the study also identified different brand preferences in different States. It is interesting to look at them. In New South Wales and Queensland, far more children smoked Winfield where Winfield received high exposure through sponsoring the major winter sport, rugby league. Escort was favoured among South Australian children where it sponsored the Australian Rules Escort Cup. Escort was not one of the leading brands anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In Victoria, Peter Jackson was the most popular brand, followed by Winfield. Both of these brands are heavily advertised, or were at the time, through the Victorian Football League in a number of forums and in particular on television. </PARA>
<PARA>The freedom of speech argument is a favourite of the tobacco industry. In this context, freedom of speech means the freedom to advertise a highly dangerous and addictive product that killed in excess of 18,000 Australians in 1987. Frankly, I believe that a more important freedom is that of children to be free of advertising pressure to adopt smoking. Recent media reports of a British study state that over 90 per cent of teenagers who smoke three to four cigarettes a day are trapped into a career of regular smoking which typically lasts for some 30 to 40 years. The report from the Australian Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare on drug problems in Australia, chaired by Senator Peter Baume in 1977; the Better Health Commission, established by Dr Neal Blewett in 1985; and, only last year, the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, have all endorsed the view that there is no place for tobacco advertising in the Australian community. At the end of last year, through the all party support for my private member's Bill, which placed a ban on the print advertising area, we saw that even the Parliament as a whole had finally come to the view that it was time for us to act again federally for the first time since the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA>If tobacco advertising has been a blight on the print media, then it is equally a blight on the electronic media in spite of the Act as it stands which nominally places a ban on that advertising. It is naive to regard the forms of advertising as different entities. Tobacco sponsorship is tobacco advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at the tobacco industry's threats about the certain decline and fall of Australian sport as we know it in the absence of tobacco sponsorship. I make it very clear that my Bill does not prevent tobacco sponsorship of anything. In Canada, the Canadian Government has simply banned tobacco sponsorship of sporting events. If the tobacco companies wish to respond by withdrawing their funding of certain sporting bodies, I suppose that will show us that the arguments we have put about sponsorship being advertising are very clear, but I do not believe that should hinder the passage of these amendments in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that honourable senators will be aware of the very successful health promotion foundations that have been established in Victoria and South Australia, funded by purpose-built levy mechanisms on wholesale sales of tobacco products and providing considerable support and replacement sponsorship to sport and other health-related activities. </PARA>
<PARA>A mere one per cent of revenue from the Federal excise on tobacco would provide $12.5m, sufficient to replace current tobacco company expenditure on sport sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Federal excise on tobacco products is currently under review. I also believe that submissions are being made to Cabinet at the time that we engage in this debate and I commend those submissions to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, under the terms of this Bill, sporting and other organisations would be free to continue to accept sponsorship from tobacco companies if they wished, subject to legislation enacted at State level. Tobacco companies would be permitted-as they are in the United Kingdom and West Germany-to use their colours, they simply would not be allowed to display trademarks, brand names or logos. As I said, that happens in Europe. In those countries tobacco companies have demonstrated that they are quite able to comply with that level of regulation, and it is the utmost in hypocrisy for them to say in Australia that the livelihood of Australian sport would be threatened. If we allow ourselves to fall for that argument, I suggest that we are succumbing to precisely the blackmail that the tobacco industry always intended, and the tobacco industry will not only have bought sport, but government or the Parliament as well, with the exception of the Australian Democrats who are putting forward these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators may be aware that one recent parliamentary report does not recommend the ban of tobacco sponsorships for sport-that is, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its second report on an inquiry into sports funding and administration. This report does not favour a ban on tobacco sponsorship which, as I have already said, is not the purpose of what we are proposing to do with the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to conclude that a complete ban on the accidental and incidental televising of cigarette products is not realistic on the grounds that it would be an impossible piece of legislation to enforce. I agree with that. That is precisely why in the amendments I am putting forward I am proposing to continue to allow accidental broadcasting of tobacco advertisements. `Accidental' means just that-accidental. If an event is being filmed and somebody wanders past with a Marlboro tee-shirt on, that is not the fault of the organisation involved. It is not my intention to devise troublesome legislation that would be open to vexatious litigation; indeed, I think I have already demonstrated that litigation is exactly what is happening with the legislation as it currently stands. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators of the level and strength of support in the general public for action in this area; indeed, support specifically for the amendments which the Australian Democrats will be moving. As I said, there was all party support for a move in the print media a few months ago. It would be inconsistent in the extreme of both the coalition and the Government to fall away at this stage from a public health move of major significance and to close what is a dramatically damaging loophole in some legislation which is clearly the Federal Government's responsibility. There can be no claims that this is not within the responsibility of the Federal Parliament. Quite clearly it is. This Bill goes forward with the strongest endorsement from medical and health groups, as well as from a range of wider community groups. State governments are increasingly taking what action is open to them within their jurisdiction with, I regret to say, the notable exception of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>It is up to us, as Federal legislators, to meet our responsibility to support the landmark work that has already been passed in Victoria and South Australia, that is in passage in Western Australia and is being proposed in other States, and to push those States that are being laggardly in this process. </PARA>
<PARA>Tobacco related illness, death and disease are costing our community dearly. The Democrats are putting forward a very sensible rational proposal. There is no economic and, certainly, no moral argument for not taking this step. I tell the Senate that as I move amongst young people, and I do that as its being of the highest priority when I am not in this place-I visit their schools and talk to them in every other environment in which I can-I find that it is a matter of very great concern to young people that there is such a close link between sport and drugs and even an apparent or accepted dependence of sport on drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>We make a lot of song and dance-indeed there are some people in this chamber and in the other place with whom it seems to be an absolute obsession-about drugs in sport. Tobacco is a drug. I might be corrected, but I think that of the legal drugs, it is the only one of which we could say that there is no safe dose. I do not know about all the illegal drugs, but we could probably say the same thing, based on our present knowledge. Tobacco is certainly a grossly damaging substance. The very fact that it is legal is irrelevant in this debate. As for those people who say, `Why don't you just ban tobacco smoking?', we know that would not work; we know that all that would create is a black market and quite probably even more peer pressure on young people. We have a responsibility to take the pressure off whoever it is and not allow the promotion of a product which we know costs our community so dearly-over $2 3/4 billion a year at least. </PARA>
<PARA>The health bodies, such as the Australian Medical Association Ltd, the Heart Foundation, the Asthma Association, the anti-cancer councils and a whole range of other groups, are putting their voices so strongly behind this move because they are the ones who have to cope with the damage that is created in our community. Amongst us in the Parliament are people from the medical fraternity who know very well the gross damage which tobacco causes. I make a plea to them, in particular, for leadership within their various parties on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not commend anything more strongly to both sides of the chamber. We owe it to our young people and to their future. If we cannot bring ourselves to take this action for them, at least we should take it on the basis that we need not be spending $2 3/4 billion, largely out of the health budget, which we could put better into the other activities by way of government expenditure. This Bill corrects what we believe is a gross deficiency in the Broadcasting Act. I commend that action to both sides of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the mechanisms available to parties dissatisfied with determinations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission pursuant to section 81 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, section 25Z of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and by the Privacy Commissioner pursuant to section 52 of the Privacy Act 1988;</PARA>

<PARA> (c) whether, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution relating to the conferral of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, alternative, less costly, procedures can be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That these issues be considered in the context of the Committee's current reference on the cost of legal services and litigation, as a discrete part of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate a short statement in relation to the reference in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON</PARA>
<PARA>LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Statement in relation to new terms of reference</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Privacy Act 1988, the Privacy Commissioner can investigate a complaint about an interference with privacy and then make a determination. </PARA>
<PARA>The determination might dismiss the complaint, or find the complaint substantiated and make a declaration, for example that the act constituting the interference should not continue or that any damage or loss suffered should be redressed or compensated, or that any further action in the matter would be inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Commissioner can determine rights between private parties, but he is unable to enforce his determinations because he does not exercise judicial power. This is a constitutional limitation on the exercise of the Commonwealth's judicial power. It is not simply a question of conferring such power on the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>During the Committee's hearings in October on the Privacy Amendment Bill, there was discussion of appeals from determinations of the Privacy Commissioner. The problem that was discussed by the Committee was the difficulty of a party, in this case a credit provider, subject to a determination of the Privacy Commissioner, but unhappy with that determination. If the party were to continue with conduct contrary to the Privacy Commissioner's determination, it would be up to the Privacy Commissioner or the person who made the original complaint to bring an action in the Federal Court to enforce the Privacy Commissioner's determination. At the most, the credit provider could seek judicial review of the Privacy Commissioner's decision, but far from being an appeal, this review would be narrowly based, for example, on an alleged lack of natural justice or irrelevant consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The minister rejected the proposal that AAT review be provided in relation to determinations of the Privacy Commissioner. He said it would impose `an unnecessary additional burden upon complainants'. He pointed out also that the AAT itself is subject to the same constitutional limitations as the Privacy Commissioner in so far as it lacks judicial power and therefore the power to make binding decisions. Enforcement action would have to be taken in a court. </PARA>
<PARA>Review by the AAT was considered to be inappropriate also because of the role of the AAT. It reviews decisions of Commonwealth agencies; it has not to date had a dispute resolution function. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite his rejection of the suggestion that such an appeal mechanism should be incorporated in the legislation, the minister acknowledged the concerns that had been raised by Committee members and also the</PARA>
<PARA> somewhat intimidatory prospect of having to pay a considerable sum of money to get into the Federal Court for a de novo hearing by way of being the only means open to review of [the] Privacy Commissioner's determination . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He undertook to consult with the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in drawing up suitable terms of reference which would enable the Committee to investigate the question of appeals in more detail. It was considered this was a matter appropriately dealt with in the context of the Committee's larger inquiry into the cost of legal services and litigation. </PARA>
<PARA>Because similar issues arise in relation to other decisions that may be made under the Commonwealth's human rights legislation, the terms of reference have been drawn in such a way as to include those decisions, namely, decisions under section 25Z of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and section 81 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>S.55(1) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 provides: ` `(The duties of the Parliamentary Joint) Committee (on the National Crime Authority) are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to monitor and to review the performance by the Authority of its functions.''</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent subsections provide for reports by the Committee to both Houses of Parliament on the performance of the Authority and impose on the Committee the duty to examine the Authority's annual reports and to report on them to Parliament, to examine trends and charges in criminal activities, to inquire into any relevant question referred to it by either House of Parliament and to report on it.''</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 2 expressly states that the Committee may not (a) ``investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity'' or (b) ``reconsider the findings of the Authority in relation to a particular investigation.''</PARA>
<PARA>The important aspects of S.55 are firstly the clear duty placed upon the Committee to monitor and to review the Authority's performance and the prohibition in paragraph (2) (a) on investigating a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly this section has been drawn so widely as to hamper any reasonable attempt by the Committee to fulfil its duties. </PARA>
<PARA>It is one of the objectives of my private Senator's Bill to remove the unreasonable component of this restriction by omitting the words ``a matter relating to'' from S.55 (2) (a), so that the Committee is now prohibited only to investigate a relevant criminal activity or to reconsider the findings of the Authority in relation to a particular investigation, thus giving the Committee reasonable scope to fulfil its duty to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The other major provision of the National Crime Authority Act which has hampered the work of the Committee is Section 51 which prohibits a member of the Authority or a staff member to disclose any information acquired in the course of his or her work with the National Crime Authority. The suggestion has been made that this prohibition also covers the provision of information to the Parliamentary Committee in the course of exercising its duty to supervise the activities of the Authority, thus making the Committee virtually a `lame duck'. </PARA>
<PARA>These problems have been the subject of considerable discussion within the Committee and between the Committee and the Authority. In fact, the problem of Section 51 was first raised in the first Annual Report published by the National Crime Authority in 1986 and has made a regular reappearance since then. </PARA>
<PARA>It could be argued that in part the implementation of these provisions depends on the quality of the working relationship between the Parliamentary Committee and the Authority and that if there is a high level of trust one can expect that adequate information would be provided. However, clearly this is not a sound basis on which a relationship between two legal entities in this sensitive area can be based, and indeed there is evidence that at times such a level of trust was not present. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that a situation has now been reached where this impasse needs to be resolved, and while it has been argued that Parliamentary privilege would override the secrecy provision and that the Committee would be entitled to receive any information it sought from the National Crime Authority, the resolution of such a conflict would take considerable time, time which could be spent much more productively pursuing the substantive work of both the Authority and the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>To ensure that the secrecy provisions of Section 51 do not apply to information sought by the Committee, Section 3 of my Bill declares that they do not apply to the Committee. In turn, this immediately raises the necessity to ensure that members of the Committee do not disclose either in their report to Parliament or otherwise information which could be prejudicial to the safety or legal rights of persons identified in that information, which prejudices legal proceedings whether or not those proceedings have commenced, or which would disclose the operational methods of the Authority in a manner prejudicial to the operations of the Authority. To cover these exceptions, the Bill provides that the Committee may not disclose such matters in a report to Parliament provided they have been taken as evidence in camera and provided the Authority has supplied a certificate to the Committee certifying that the information in question is covered by one or more of these exclusions. The Bill thus creates a situation of checks and balances which will enable the Committee to fulfil its obligation to supervise the Authority without jeopardising the work of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>To cover the possibility that either the majority of the Committee or the Authority oversteps the intended boundaries of these exceptions and either declares evidence to be in camera, when this would not be justified, or, in the case of the Authority, provides a certificate in accordance with a mistaken perception of the need for secrecy, the Bill provides what is in effect a right of appeal to a Justice of the Federal Court who would decide the matter on objective criteria and determine whether the information sought is in fact covered by one or more of the exceptions in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions contained in this Bill are the result of considerable consultation between members of the Committee and in particular, with Senator Crichton-Browne, who has previously moved an amendment to ensure that the Committee may obtain the information it requires. Earlier drafts of the amendments contained in the Bill have been submitted to the Attorney General, to Mr Justice Phillips, the Chairman of the Authority and to members of the Committee. Encouraging comments were received from Senator Michael Tate representing the Attorney-General, and from the Chairman of the Committee, Mr E J Lindsay MP. However, in the absence of a definitive response, I thought it would advance the debate and the resolution of the current impasse if I introduced the Private Senator's Bill now, thereby making it available for further discussion and public comment. </PARA>
<PARA>It is abundantly clear that the current evaluation of the purpose and performance of the National Crime Authority cannot be completed effectively unless the means are found to remove the shackles which currently prevent the Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority from carrying out its statutory duty ``to monitor and review the performance by the Authority of its functions. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report:</PARA>
<PARA>  The management and operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and whether that Department is fulfilling its role to protect and advance Australia's foreign policy interests, and that in particular the Committee examine the following:</PARA>

<PARA> (f) implications for Australia's international image of management and morale problems. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not intended that the motion be dealt with today, but I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement which briefly sets out the reasons for the reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Reasons for the Reference</PARA>
<PARA>In his introduction to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)'s first Corporate Plan on 7 May 1990 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, stressed the ``high priority'' the Hawke Government accorded foreign affairs and trade issues which he described as being ``fundamental to the nation's security and economic well being.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister further stated that, ``The Government looks to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to advise it and to implement its decisions within the portfolio in a professional and efficient manner.''</PARA>
<PARA>During much of 1990 the ability of the Department to fulfil this role has been called into question by a series of public allegations of financial irregularities and mismanagement, by at least 16 leaks of highly sensitive classified materials, and by damaging industrial disputes and work bans both in Canberra and at Australia's overseas missions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate cannot but be concerned at the implications of these serious allegations and leaks, and by the further indications of malaise and poor morale among officers of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>1990 has been marked by serious allegations of ongoing and widespread maladministration and financial irregularities within the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Allegations have been made of incompetence, rorts and ``cronyism'' across a range of administration areas, for example in the administration of tuition fees, boarding schools allowances, general education entitlements and travel allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>Allegations have also been made that senior officers of the Department have been involved, that their actions are carried out with impunity, and that ``cover ups'' are carried out to avoid detection. Further allegations have been made that systemic problems exist which prevent detection. </PARA>
<PARA>These allegations have been made to the media and to Members of Parliament by individual officers as well as a group within the Department calling itself the ``Officers Revolutionary Council.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Department has set up internal fraud reporting and detection systems, the effectiveness of which some officers have commented upon unfavourably. </PARA>
<PARA>An Auditor-General Report (No. 15 1990) tabled in the Senate on the 17th December 1990 found inter alia-</PARA>
<PARA> - That allegations of maladministration and impropriety within the Department were still being investigated by the AFP and the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> - That there was a large number of long outstanding debts. </PARA>
<PARA> - That procedures for handling disciplinary case were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> - The procedures for acquitting advances were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> - That cost effective fraud control arrangements were not yet fully in place.</PARA>
<PARA>LEAKS</PARA>
<PARA>Since July there has been a sequence of leaks of highly sensitive documents and cables originating in or which have been passed through the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>In all cases copies of the actual documents were in the possession of members of the media. Some of the documents bore SECRET and TOP SECRET security classifications. Two had the most sensitive ``AUSTEO'' (For Australian Eyes Only) classification. </PARA>
<PARA>All received wide coverage in the media. </PARA>

<PARA>There have been suggestions that the leaks were aimed at drawing attention to serious management/staff problems within the Department.

<PARA>These include allegations that under the Hawke Government, different standards are applied to senior staff and junior staff and staff in the Minister's favour. </PARA>
<PARA>If substantiated, there are serious implications for the ability of the Department to work effectively to promote and maintain Australia's international relations interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The serious industrial relations problems in the Department since June this year have not contributed to boosting staff morale.

<PARA>Industrial action taken included bans on overtime work, delays in the processing of visas and passports, refusal to collect remitted revenue, and refusal to reply to correspondence from Ministers and Members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The PSU members were joined in their industrial action by other officers responsible for overseas missions communications, including all classified and unclassified materials. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate would be concerned to note that communications between the Department and many overseas missions were entirely cut off in June this year, except where management performed those tasks. </PARA>

<PARA>The recent industrial disputes, problems with overseas living allowances, leaks of confidential documents and allegations of maladministration and impropriety have done damage to Australia's international image. </PARA>
<PARA>The vast majority of DFAT officers are competent and dedicated professionals. Service overseas in Australian interests involves family and social dislocation not well appreciated by the Australian community. Grievances of these officers require a more sensitive assessment than the Minister has been prepared to give. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister and the Government having failed to properly address the issue, it is in the national interest and that of Departmental officers that the Parliament intervene and provide a forum for proper investigation and report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting President, may I add my congratulations to you on the honour accorded to you today of taking the chair at the beginning of the sitting. It is very well deserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill 1990 has as its purpose the conversion of the Superannuation Funds Investment Trust, commonly known as SFIT, from a statutory authority into an incorporated public company. It will also allow the Commonwealth Funds Management (CFM) to compete with private sector schemes for additional funds. It transfers SFIT's management and investment trustee functions in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund to a joint employer-employee board of trustees. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are intended to achieve greater efficiency and a better performance from the new Commonwealth Funds Management by putting it on a more commercial footing. The Opposition endorses this sentiment and direction, and it is for this reason that we are supporting this Bill before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> We do, however, have a number of concerns at the Government's approach to these goals. It always seems to believe that the corporatisation path is the way to commercial reality and that nothing else needs to be done. In fact, that path is strewn with problems, unless the other matters and aspects that ought to go with corporatisation are fully thought through as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), when explaining the reasons for introducing this Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA>To be able to compete successfully with the private sector for GBE funds, and attract new clients, SFIT needs to be allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is an admirable sentiment but the structure of the CFM is not consistent with this objective for various reasons. For example and most importantly, the CFM will have a statutory monopoly over the funds of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme (CSS) and the public sector superannuation scheme (PSS) until 1 July 1995. The Commonwealth superannuation scheme has of itself over $5.8 billion under management and is by far the largest, as I understand it, Australian superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very real difficulties, I believe, in allowing the CFM to compete on a commercial basis with private sector firms if it maintains advantages from its association with the Commonwealth. In this respect I think it must be queried as to why the CFM will retain control of the substantial resources of the PSS and the CSS for five years. The control over these funds gives it an unfair advantage over private sector funds which do not have guaranteed control of substantial assets. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that the five-year term was decided, fairly arbitrarily, to ensure that there was not a mass exodus of funds from SFIT and to give the Government breathing space to consider its longer term position. This is a matter that was debated during the autumn session when the Superannuation Act 1990 was passed and I do not therefore propose to pursue it further other than to point out that the new CFM will have an unfair advantageous position over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I think is worth noting is the fact that the Government is also to provide the Commonwealth Funds Management with access to a $20m guarantee for working capital purposes which carries no penalty and is available again until the 30 June 1995. One would hope that that guarantee will not be required to be acted on but it does, nevertheless, give the fund a competitive advantage that is not available to other superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of board representation is also a matter to be noted with some concern. The Minister for Finance claimed in introducing the Bill in the other House that it will be important that the board members have suitable investment experience and business acumen. We would certainly agree with that sentiment. Yet the Bill gives the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) the right to appoint the employee representatives on the board and there appears from the Bill to be no provision whereby the other unions who control funds may be able themselves to appoint representatives. Perhaps Senator McMullan may wish to comment on that in any remarks he makes, but that certainly appears to be the case. Again, it puts the ACTU in a very powerful position, particularly in relation to other unions. Not even the Australian Public Sector and Broadcasting Union, whose members actually contribute to the fund, have a say and certainly not the industry's experts, but the Government's joint venture corporatist partners in the form of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of board appointments, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed memorandum and articles of association will provide for the Minister responsible to have the power to appoint and dismiss the CFM board of directors. Also, the Minister responsible for CFM will be able to issue guidelines to the board. </PARA>
<PARA>That power of the Minister could well be interpreted as an implicit Government threat to the board to act in the Government's own policy interests or be sacked. That bears no reality, of course, to independence in the commercial world. More importantly, I believe it raises serious matters of propriety and fiduciary implications. There would have to be a question to ask as to whether that places the members of the board in a conflict of interest situation. Again, I think that is something that the coalition will certainly be monitoring very closely and something on which Senator McMullan may wish to comment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that this new corporation be entirely owned by the Commonwealth Government and that its shares not be able to be transferred to anyone other than the Government or the Minister. That proposal, as I understand it, came in at the end of the debate on this matter, which was guillotined, in the House of Representatives. At that time, the Opposition spokesman in the House of Representatives had not been given any notice of it and he reserved the coalition's position on it. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the only way that the CFM can genuinely compete and operate in the private sector is if its management and ownership are also reflective of the private sector. We do not believe that the CFM should be owned in perpetuity by the Government. We are opposed to the Government's proposition which seeks to prohibit share transfer other than within the Government. Whilst we will not divide on it, I formally state the Opposition's opposition to that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to a more general matter, the concerns that I have expressed are all the more serious given the huge sums of money involved. Superannuation savings that Australia will have amassed by the year 2000 are estimated to be something of the order of $600 billion. Much of that will be union controlled funds. These funds will, therefore, have the necessary resources to have an enormous impact on investment activity in Australia and the direction of that activity. The role of the CFM in this will be very important. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is of great importance that the operations of superannuation funds, and in this case the CFM in particular, be directed in such a way as to maximise the efficient allocation of these huge resources so that we can advance our overall standards of living in this country. It is very important indeed that those funds not be directed into activities or particular areas for purely political reasons or reasons other than the most efficient use of that huge pool of savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The shift in the 1980s into superannuation is a welcome move. With the control of these enormous resources moving into the hands of unelected and unrepresentative officials, particularly of trade unions, unless there are very important and very carefully defined rules of operation of the funds, and unless steps are taken to ensure that there is no conflict of interest between getting the best return for shareholders or contributors to the funds and the use of funds for other purposes, we can look forward to very significant problems. I hope that will not arise but it is something that is exercising the minds certainly of the coalition and I think of many other people throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those comments, I conclude with putting on the record that we believe that the only solution to achieve the goal of the Minister or the Government and our stated goal of proper commercialisation of the CFM is to privatise it. The coalition has taken the decision to do just this when it returns to government. We have taken that decision in the last few weeks. The CFM has been added to the list of the previously announced government business enterprises that we will seek and take action to privatise when we come to government. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporatisation, which this Bill enables for the fund, should be seen, we believe, as just the first step on the road. To the Government, it would appear that corporatisation is the end of the road. That is a very clear distinction, I think, between the Government's approach to this whole matter of government business undertakings and the coalition's view. That is a debate for another occasion. It has already been discussed a great deal and will be discussed a great deal further in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that we can get maximum efficiency from business enterprises by continuing to have them owned 100 per cent in the public sector is a view which has been shown quite clearly in many other examples around the world to be not the way to go to get the greatest maximisation of the resources, use of the resources, of the nation, and the Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd fits into that category as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said those things, I repeat that the coalition does not oppose this Bill. We hope that the corporatisation of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust and its conversion into Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd will act in the interests of the contributors because that, of course, is the basic objective of any superannuation fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate today is discussing the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill 1990. The Bill proposes to convert the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT)-which is the statutory body which is the trustee of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund-into a public company and, secondly, to transfer the trustee function of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund to a joint employer-employee board of trustees, to be known as Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 2. The trustee of the new Commonwealth superannuation scheme is, of course, known as the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill will formally split the functions of trustee and manager, which are currently both performed by SFIT. SFIT will retain the management function only and will be converted into a public company. The new company will be 100 per cent Commonwealth owned initially. The Government did move an anti-privatisation amendment in the House of Representatives. However, it is defective because it does not cover the issue of new shares. I shall be moving an amendment to fix this loophole later in the committee stage. Given that the Government agrees that there is no problem, we hope that it will see its way clear to support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I sought an interview with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) during the last week but it proved impossible because of his busy schedule. The amendment I shall be moving is very clear-cut and simple. It simply says that no shares may be held in the company by a person other than the Commonwealth, a body corporate established for a public purpose by a law of the Commonwealth or a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussions with ministerial and  departmental staff, an alternative was offered because it was stated that the objective of our amendment is indeed shared by the Government. The alternative that was offered was an undertaking by the Minister to amend or to undertake to insert in the memorandum and articles of association of a company a condition which says that shares may not be issued unless this is authorised by the two Houses of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a very cumbersome, circumlocutory and legally somewhat doubtful proposition. It could well come adrift on the way. I do not frankly like the concept of making the action of a public company dependent on an event outside, be that the decision of two Houses of Parliament. I believe that the amendment that I will be moving is clear-cut and simple and I would hope that the Minister has had the opportunity to consider it in detail and that he will see his way clear to support it. As I said, if the objectives are indeed aligned then it is a very clear-cut way to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also announced, on 13 November 1990, that it had decided to privatise Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd (CFM) when it gets into government. This was today confirmed by Senator Short in his address. We believe that this is a wrong move. At the very least, the Opposition should consider consulting the hundreds of thousands of superannuation fund members whose money is to be invested by CFM. Given the recent history of dubious business practices and bad investment decisions made by the private sector, why should the fund members not be asked whether they want their funds managed by a private or a public sector entity? The Australian Democrats do not subscribe to the furphy that is being put around that public management of necessity must be bad and that private management of necessity must be good. I would submit to honourable senators that it is indeed a question of management rather than ownership-but, in this case, management goes with ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from this, there is also the question of fiscal prudence by the Commonwealth Government. The public sector superannuation schemes are defined benefit schemes. The Commonwealth  Government pays the difference between CFM's returns on Commonwealth contributions and the obligated benefits. Thus, it is in the Commonwealth's interests to maintain control to maximise returns-especially long term returns-to minimise the Commonwealth's costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason to maintain public control is to promote responsible investment by superannuation funds. Senator Button is proud, and rightly so, of the recent initiative he and the Government managed to persuade some large institutions to create. The Develop Australia Fund is a step in the right direction in terms of guiding just a small proportion of our superannuation moneys into profitable but necessarily long term investment. The decision to corporatise SFIT is in direct contrast to the initially announced Government position in Reform of Commonwealth Superannuation, released by Senator Walsh on 15 October 1989. This document stated at attachment E5 that SFIT will continue to be constituted as a statutory authority. There has been no official explanation of the corporatisation decision. The trustee in funds management function could have been separated without adopting a corporate structure. The right to compete with private sector funds managers could have been granted to SFIT without a corporate structure. Perhaps the Minister could explain this to the Senate. Indeed, during the last five years SFIT has achieved above market average rates of return-and this with a portfolio approaching $6 billion. If it is not broken, why fix it?</PARA>
<PARA> CFM will continue to be the sole investment manager of the two Commonwealth superannuation schemes, but only until 30 June, 1995. The shield of the crown immunity will not be available to CFM Ltd. However, the Commonwealth will guarantee the first $20m of money initially borrowed by the company, which is defined as borrowings prior to 30 June, 1995. The usual continuity of employment provisions are contained within the Bill and the Australian Democrats welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA> At least with this Bill the Government has not repeated the disgrace of the last corporatisation-that of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories-although there is still obviously a contingent privatisation here. We believe that the Commonwealth Government is to be commended on its statement that it wishes to retain Commonwealth control and ownership of this fund, and I look forward to the Government's support for my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank both parties for their support of the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Bill. Firstly, I will deal with some of the issues raised by the Opposition. Then I will refer to Senator Spindler's amendment because we will not have time to deal with it in a normal committee stage discussion. I will be very brief in dealing with the privatisation issue, although I regard it as very important not only in my capacity here representing the Minister for Finance, but also because I, with my colleague Senator Reid, have the honour of representing more public servants, more members of this scheme, than anybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard it as a very important part of my representative responsibility to those people also to say that I and the Government are totally opposed to the idea of the privatisation of Commonwealth Funds Management Limited (CFM). I believe that the interests of the people who have contributed, and the interests of the Commonwealth as the employer of those people which has made contributions on their behalf and has obligations to them, including obligations under a defined benefit scheme, would not be preserved in the manner that I would find acceptable by a consideration of privatisation. It is a debate we will have subsequently as a matter of substance when the Liberals proceed to further debate on it or at a time of the Government's choosing. Today is only a time to say that I am totally opposed to that point. I believe that it is ideology getting in the way of logic. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short also raised the question of the short term monopoly for CFM until 30 June 1995. The first thing to remember is that some part of that is absolutely essential because until 30 June 1991 we have the intertwining of the two major Commonwealth schemes as they evolve. It is very difficult at the moment-if not, I suspect, impossible-to say what is the exact size of each of the two schemes. So until 30 June 1991 we cannot disentangle the two. Then I think an appropriate transition period is relevant and necessary, but I do support the view that there should be a time limit to that period. Four years seems a reasonable one and it certainly will put a lot of pressure on CFM to perform. That limited appointment will keep its eye on the game because it will know that at the end of four years the trustees will have to look at whether CFM should continue to be the funds manager. It obviously would be terribly important to it in a corporate sense, but also a key element in its capacity to persuade other people that it should be the funds manger would be undermined significantly. Were it to lose its principal client it would clearly be undermined in its competition, so it would be a spur to it to perform very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue of importance that has been raised relates to the Commonwealth guarantee of initial borrowings, but the Senate needs to be aware that any commercial enterprise, CFM or otherwise, will require working capital to enable it to meet day to day expenses, whereas fixed working capital is currently derived solely from the superannuation fund against which it charges all of its expenses. The only assets it has are the assets it has as trustee. It does not have assets as manager. If those two functions are distinguished, then CFM has no assets as such or-to put it another way-the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) has no assets in its own right which it can transfer to CFM. So it would be without working capital and perhaps without the capacity to secure a loan for such purposes. There is a limited guarantee both in terms of the amount of money and the time over which it will operate. It will apply only to amounts borrowed prior to 30 June 1995. I do not think anybody would be concerned in terms of protecting taxpayer interests about the capacity of CFM to meet that loan, so it is simply a mechanism to facilitate it achieving loans that it might not otherwise be able to get. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that Senator Short raised was the question of union participation. It seems to me that there is some con- fusion here. CFM's board of directors is quite separate from the board of trustees which is responsible for administering the Commonwealth schemes. CFM's board will be provided for in the memorandum and articles of association, and it is important that those board members have investment experience and business acumen. The existing members of SFIT will be eligible for appointment to the board. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, it is true, will be making nominations to the boards of trustees administering the Commonwealth schemes. In the past these have been employees of the Commonwealth and its authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the essential points of Senator Short's to which I wish to respond in the time available, although there are other matters, he said, that might have in other times warranted further debate. We could both claim that there are other things we could all have said in debates, but I think that goes to the essence of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take this opportunity to respond briefly to Senator Spindler so that we can then dispatch the Bill. The Government will not be accepting the amendment to be moved by the Democrats. As Senator Spindler said, we already have a clause prohibiting transfer of Commonwealth shareholding to persons outside the company. It is true, and accepted, that by itself it does not prevent the company from creating new share capital which could be issued to persons outside the Commonwealth and, therefore, undermining the purpose of the clause. We share the objective, but I reiterate to the Senate the Minister's assurance that the matter of a new share capital will be addressed by the inclusion of a specific restriction on new share issues in both the memorandum and the articles of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought and received assurance that this restriction can and will be framed in such a way as to necessitate the amendment of the legislation to authorise new share issues to non-Commonwealth interests. The Companies Act and the Corporations Act do enable such entrenchment provisions and we will be taking advantage of those entrenchment provisions. Therefore, the privatisation of CFM would not be possible without amendment to the legislation by the Parliament. The protection that Senator Spindler seeks and which my Party seeks will be provided adequately through this mechanism and, therefore, the amendment, although its purpose is understood, is unnecessary and we will not be supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating now a package of three Bills, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1990, the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill 1990 and the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill 1990. I will address my remarks only to the first of those three, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation Bill. My colleague Senator Newman will be addressing her remarks to the remaining two Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1990 provides for the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC) business; the transfer of goodwill and physical assets, plant and equipment, to the purchaser, CIC Insurance Group; and the abolition of the Corporation itself after the sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The CIC Insurance Group is Australia's fifth largest general insurer. It is owned jointly by the Norwich Insurance Company of the United Kingdom and the Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company, with a minority equity holding by the Chiyoda Insurance Company of Japan. Those three companies carry an AAA claims paying ability from the Standard and Poor's rating group. The Bill also includes details of the continued government guarantee of all existing insurance policy holder obligations and relevant employment arrangements for the staff of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The HLIC was established by the Liberal-National Party Government in 1965 to make home ownership possible for more Australians, particularly low income earners. That is something that this Government, through its cripplingly high interest rate policies, has done a great deal to destroy in recent years. The HLIC annual report, tabled in this Parliament last week, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>With interest rates at record high levels for the whole of the financial year-</PARA>
<PARA>that was the year to 30 June 1990-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and the threat of unemployment growing, the demand for home ownership loans fell to the lowest level for many years. The new home buyer found the deposit gap difficult to breach and the affordability problem almost insurmountable. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think one could find a more damning indictment of the impact of the Government's policies on housing than that quote from the Government's own housing corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The HLIC has been very successful in achieving its goals. Last year it posted a record profit and was the largest mortgage insurer in Australia. I take this opportunity to congratulate the staff and management of HLIC over the past 25 years. They are to be congratulated for their achievements. I trust they will continue their good work in the private sector, as is about to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has long supported the privatisation of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. For this reason, we support the Bill. It has been a long road to the privatisation of the HLIC. The Fraser Government started the process back in 1979 and it has taken a long time to come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> The major component of the income from the sale of the HLIC will arise from the realisation of the investments the Corporation holds in its books. These investments will be transferred to the Government as part of the residual assets and liabilities when the HLIC is wound up. According to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) when introducing this Bill, more than $100m is expected to be credited to Consolidated Revenue in the current financial year from the sale of HLIC and the disposal of the residual assets. However, he said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The overall return to the Commonwealth from the sale and the associated abolition of the HLIC is estimated to be around $80m in net present value terms . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, the difference between the current $100m and the $80m net present value arises from the Government's commitments to meet over time the policies entered into by the HLIC before the date of sale, and also to pay for the ongoing administration costs of those policies. Provisions for both of these obligations are expressly contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government first announced the proposed sale of the HLIC in its August 1989 Budget. It has subsequently been reported that all six of the originally interested parties dropped out because they would not pay the $50m to $60m the Government was said to be seeking at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the investments of the Corporation are valued at cost at $114m and the Minister said that the Commonwealth will receive more than $100m after the transaction is complete, it raises the question of how much, if anything, CIC is actually paying for the goodwill of the Corporation. Perhaps the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), in summing up the debate on this subject, can enlighten us on this because some confusion has certainly been evident in the press and, indeed, in Government ranks, particularly in publicised correspondence from Mr Langmore, the honourable member for Fraser, to the Minister. There is some confusion which I think needs clearing up. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that apparently no-one thought the HLIC was worth $50m to $60m as an intact body last year must certainly raise some doubt as to the current net value being around $80m. As the potential liability on policy obligations has risen in the past 12 months due to the major downturn in the economy and subsequent increases in mortgage defaults, the value of the HLIC would have been expected to have fallen, not risen, in the last six to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague in the lower House the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) made the following comment on this Bill during the debate in that place:</PARA>
<PARA>It is understood that the level of claims against the HLIC is rising, particularly in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>This was subsequently substantiated in the HLIC annual report which said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>Defaults in Victoria increased by 29 per cent during the year-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, during 1989-90:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and it is this State that is certain to cause the Corporation the greatest concern in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report contained other interesting comments as well which, as I said earlier, amount to a very strong indictment indeed of the Government's economic policies. At page 8 the annual report says:</PARA>
<PARA> A disturbing trend emerged during the year which indicated that around 52% of all claims paid during the year came from loans written in 1987-88 and 1988-89, with 28% coming from loans written in 1988-89. These figures indicate that many marginal borrowers who either purchased homes when interest rates were low or purchased homes at the top of the boom are finding great difficulty in meeting repayments. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the restrictions on time, I will conclude with the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the affordability problem and the general lack of confidence in the future is preventing many families making the decision to purchase their first home. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter on which the Opposition has been pressing the Government for many months-that is, the devastating effect on the home market, particularly for new home buyers, young families and single income families. The prospect of buying their own home and being able to meet the interest payments and commitments has put housing out of the reach of huge numbers of young, and not so young, couples in Australia. It is a great indictment of the Government that its economic policies have had this devastating effect on home buyers, particularly on young families, in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite repeated requests, the Minister has refused to make available actuarial advice he received earlier this year on the question of future potential obligations of the HLIC. I hope that the Minister, in his response to this debate, will be able to comment on that and, in particular, provide some of that information. I believe it is something on which the Parliament ought to be advised. </PARA>
<PARA> More information on the details of the sale, and exactly how much of the funds the Government is actually going to receive from CIC, the purchaser of HLIC, I believe, also should be made public. I hope that the Minister will be able to be more forthcoming than his Government has been to date. I repeat that the coalition supports this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now cognately debating three Bills. The first is the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1990, which the Australian Democrats oppose. This is a privatisation Bill and, from our fundamental position, we are opposed to it. Senator Spindler will speak to this Bill very briefly. The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill 1990 and the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill 1990 must certainly be welcomed by those in the defence forces and they are welcomed by the Australian Democrats, who will be supporting them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators are probably aware that my family had a defence life for about 20 years. I assure the Senate that one of the most burning questions associated with being in the Services in this country is housing. The Government is to be congratulated on taking a step in 1988 which has proven to be extremely successful, that is, the establishment of the Defence Housing Authority. As a member of the defence subcommittee one travels around visiting defence establishments and speaking to personnel in the Services, and there is no doubt at all that the establishment of that Authority was a major, very positive step. The two Bills which I am addressing now-those relating to service housing-are a continuation of that very positive development. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that for a number of years it was extremely difficult for service personnel to purchase homes, not only because of their mobility but also because of a number of factors which virtually made it impossible for them to be home owners in this country. Senator Short has quite correctly stated that most young Australian couples these days are finding this difficulty. This has been compounded for anybody in the Services over many years, and it is good to see legislation which is quite clearly and very effectively directed towards resolving those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill is one which I believe quite generously and realistically provides a support mechanism to those in the Services which will now enable them to make a decision to purchase a home and to no longer be disadvantaged. Not only is this important for those who are actually the members of the Services themselves but also especially for their families. It is a life of turbulence and frequent posting, and one of the things that one has sacrificed is the family home in the sense of identifying with it as one's own, and everything that goes with that in the sense of family. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Government on bringing down these Bills, and on formulating and structuring them in the way that it has done. This Bill provides generously for anybody who makes a positive decision to be a home buyer and a service person at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill 1990 simply acknowledges the fact that there is a lot of adjustment flowing from the establishment of the Defence Housing Authority in 1988, and the impact upon that of the ownership and relative responsibilities of State and Federal governments. This Bill simply adjusts, by agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, to accommodate for the impact of the establishment of the Defence Housing Authority in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support these two Bills. We commend them to the Senate and we welcome the fact that they provide service people with the opportunity to become home owners at favourable rates because the assistance Bill provides subsidy and opportunity for service people to elect between two positive options. I am quite sure that people in the Services now no longer need to see themselves disadvantaged in terms of opportunity for home ownership, and the Government is to be congratulated for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are currently debating the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill 1990 and the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill 1990, and I wish to speak to both of those Bills this morning. It is a measure of the Government's interest in the welfare of defence personnel, as a result of the gag by the Government and the Australian Democrats, that I as the Opposition spokesmen have been given only 10 minutes to speak on the important issue of defence housing. Both these Bills put in place very necessary defence housing reforms. One Bill brings in a new subsidised loan scheme for serving defence members which will assist them in purchasing their own homes. The other Bill brings in new arrangements for the ownership, upgrading, repair and maintenance of defence houses formerly owned by the States under the Commonwealth and State housing agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is because of the lack of time that I will speak only briefly to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill as the Opposition welcomes its passage. Agreement has been reached with all States except South Australia to renegotiate this agreement. Under this agreement 7,000 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement houses will be returned to the States over the next five years for use as public housing. The remaining 7,000 houses will be transferred to the Defence Housing Authority, which will have the right to sell or upgrade the houses, and the responsibility for repair and maintenance which in the past was not readily forthcoming from the State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Housing Authority record on speedy repair and maintenance is already recognised as being a very good one, and I hope that the Defence Housing Authority continues to put the needs and wants of defence personnel above all else. It is important that, in its purchasing of Defence Force homes, the homes are located where there are good public transport and community facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill. This Bill gives effect to the introduction of a new scheme providing home loan subsidies for members of the Defence Force who enlisted after 14 May 1985. On 17 August this year the Government announced that the National Australia Bank Ltd had won the tender to run a new defence service home loan scheme. The 72-year-old defence service home scheme, which currently provides a $25,000 loan at 6.85 per cent over 25 years, was sold to the Westpac Banking Corporation in 1989 and will continue to run alongside the new scheme. Essentially the new scheme gives eligible members access to a portable subsidised housing loan of up to $40,000 with an interest subsidy to the member of 40 per cent of the monthly average of the interest payable over a 25 year term. </PARA>
<PARA> Pre-1985 enlistees will also be eligible for the new loan scheme if they have not already taken a defence service home loan. To do this they must formally relinquish that previous entitlement. This Bill will make amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act to facilitate this. This Bill provides for payment of a housing loan subsidy to the National Australia Bank which is to be paid into the loan account of the subsidised borrower. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill includes, as a schedule, an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank, giving the bank the exclusive right to participate as lender under the scheme. How will it operate? The National Australia Bank will pay the Commonwealth a franchise premium of $42m on 15 May 1991. The bank will then pay to the Commonwealth a commission payment each year, the amount of which will be based on the number of subsidy commencements which have occurred in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence will be responsible for meeting the ongoing monthly subsidy payments payable to the National Bank and for the administrative costs associated with the promotion of the scheme. The Department will also be responsible for assessing applications for entitlement certificates and other approvals and payment of subsidy. The Department of Defence will be subject to fringe benefits tax in relation to the subsidy. The interest rate for the subsidised loan will be the lower of the average of the housing loan interest rates of the five largest home loan lenders or the National Australia Bank home loan interest rate, and the member will pay the remaining 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> One welcome initiative is that two members who are married can add their loans together and take an $80,000 loan. This is not possible in the old scheme, meaning that a service couple are not able to both take their entitled loan for the same home. This is a ridiculous and unfair situation and it is about time the Government rectified this anomaly in the old scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> We also particularly welcome the fact that the provision for loan portability will allow a top-up back to $40,000 each time the loan is transferred. In the old scheme, the amount that can be transferred decreases with each transfer. Even a $40,000 loan does not adequately reflect current market values. It has to be recognised that people will need to be taking a second mortgage if they want to buy a house. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, known as the Cross report, recommended that any new defence home loan should be indexed to keep in line with market values. The Government has decided not to index the $40,000. Inevitably, this will lead to a devaluation of the loan as has occurred so badly with the old scheme, and the Government should be condemned for failing to take up the Cross report recommendation. I only hope that it is not 18 years before indexation is introduced, as was the case with the defence orphans pension until recently. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed that the new scheme will act as a retention measure, providing an incentive for members to stay longer in the service because the subsidy is payable for a period which is directly related to a member's years of service. The attempt at encouraging retention of personnel by restricting payment of the interest subsidy to a period equal to a member's years of service beyond six years means that a serviceman leaving after 10 years is eligible for only four years at a subsidised rate. This is a considerable reduction of the 25 years subsidy for the earlier scheme, and one might say yet another erosion of the conditions of service of defence personnel. What presents at first sight as a considerable improvement on the old scheme has substantial warts, and this is one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme does not provide ade- quately for reservists, either those who come in for a year or two on full time duty or those who serve for a short period on operational service, such as the Gulf forces. For example, regulars and reservists who have had less than six months effective full time service prior to going to the Gulf will not be eligible, nor will a sailor if he is injured and has to leave the Navy with less than one year's service after return from the Gulf. In addition, this loan will not be available to the vast majority of reservists, who rarely serve on full time duty in the integrated force for the necessary six years qualifying period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only reservists on full time duty or reservists at war who are forgotten in this scheme. It seems that some regulars will be disadvantaged too. Members who have purchased a house or started to build a home after receiving assurances from the Services that they will have a second posting in the same location, and then get posted away before the house is completed and a subsidy commenced should be eligible for subsidy. They will not be. </PARA>
<PARA> Our most serious concern, however, relates to something much more basic and disturbing. This Bill effectively removes the defence home loan as compensation for war service. No longer does war service entitle one to such a loan. The only benefit that those who serve in war will receive is a waiving of the six-year accrual time. The Minister has told me, `The legislation was not designed with operational service in mind. In the past, it had been a matter for the Government of the day to decide on the specific conditions that should apply to a particular instance of operational service, and in my view we ought to retain this flexibility by avoiding rigid legislative provisions'. What rot. </PARA>
<PARA> Right back in 1918 this Parliament passed the War Service Homes Act, which has operated down the years to recognise Australian servicemen's war service by way of home loan assistance. That Act became the Defence Services Homes Act in 1973 and will now apply only to those who enlisted prior to May 1985. Yet the purpose of the loan has always been to provide returned soldiers with the best and cheapest housing possible. In general, eligibility was confined to persons who had embarked for active service outside Australia, their widows and certain widowed mothers, but in 1920 it was extended to include persons who had enlisted for active service outside Australia even though they did not leave Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has told me that a sailor injured in the Gulf deployment and discharged from the Navy with less than one year's service would not be eligible for the subsidised loan. A sailor who joins the Navy, does six months training and is injured on the first day on a ship in the Gulf will get no war service loan. The Government has abolished this historical commitment knowingly and with its eyes open. I find that totally unacceptable, and indeed dishonourable. Even now as we speak in this chamber the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) are all at the docks in Sydney greeting the men whose war service loans they have just snitched. Some welcome!</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is not opposed by the Opposition, but we condemn the Government in the strongest possible terms for removing the entitlement to a war service loan for our service men and women. The Minister claims that this scheme is needed as a retention measure, and we support such measures, but it is no excuse for turning home loan assistance on its head and thereby abolishing an entitlement which our service men and women have had since 1918. The Government must take urgent action to restore war service loans for our young people who serve their country in war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall confine my remarks to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill. In contrast to the other Bills in this cognate package, which the Australian Democrats support, I find that the best way to characterise this particular Bill is that it is a disgrace. It is destroying a small but extremely successful and useful public enterprise. There is absolutely no justification in our view for the decision to abolish the Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Corporation was established 25 years ago by the Menzies Government. Since that time it has repaid the initial capital to the Commonwealth and currently has assets of around $120m. The Corporation insures lenders, that is banks, against losses on loans secured by mortgage, both residential and non-residential. Since 1985, the Corporation has been allowed to insure approved dealers in the secondary mortgage market, and since 1987 has been allowed to enter into certain reinsurance contracts. The Corporation is guaranteed by the Commonwealth but is self-financing. It pays all Federal and State taxes and has paid over $44m in dividends and special payments during its lifetime. With a market share of some 55 per cent, the Corporation is the dominant mortgage insurer in Australia and consequently has considerable market power. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason alone, the Corporation should be kept in public ownership to maintain a genuinely competitive market. In the past, the Corporation has thrice resisted attempted price increases in the industry which would have occurred if the Corporation had not been a public body looking after the interests of home buyers. That is the really appalling thing-that mortgage insurance is most necessary for so-called marginal borrowers. Obviously, these are people who must struggle to get their homes-the so-called battlers. Indeed, the Corporation was established to assist those people who are not regarded as good risks by financial institutions. Perhaps they are prone to lose employment or have a physical problem which may affect their income earning potential, or more likely they are simply low income earners without much prospect of increasing their incomes. There is absolutely no doubt that the price that these battlers will face for their mortgage insurance will rise. Yet the Minister effortlessly predicts, `With its strong international backing, the CIC Insurance Group is expected to provide effective competition to the other existing private mortgage insurers, thereby helping to ensure that premiums are kept low'. But who has an interest in keeping premiums low? Future home owners will pay for this decision, and the Government knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is not only home owners but also taxpayers who will lose. In the usual fashion, we have been given virtually no information regarding the details of the sale. No figure other than `an expected net present value of $80m' has been announced by the Government. The full financial detail which the Government is providing to Parliament to make this major decision is, `Well, we expect to get about $80m'. There is no mention of the sale price, of estimated future claims, or of the discounting factor used to arrive at the present value figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has just announced its results for the last financial year. The gross operating profit was a record result of over $15m. Why is the Government abolishing this institution? Who are the purchasers of the Corporation? They are foreign insurance companies. So the business of a dominant market player which affects low income families in Australia has not only been privatised but also sold to foreign interests. We used to hear a lot about the Government's commitment to industrial democracy, to worker participation and ownership and moving towards a genuine partnership between staff and management. What has occurred in this area in the case of the Corporation? The Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) stated in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Equitable treatment of the present employees and their continued welfare has been a major consideration for the Government in developing the staffing arrangements associated with the sale. </PARA>
<PARA>What a joke. We have received correspondence in my office from Corporation employees who for months have been worried about the future. At least, if the Corporation itself were privatised, the Government could have guaranteed continuity of employment, but the Corporation is being abolished. The Minister assures the Corporation staff:</PARA>
<PARA>The great majority of the present HLIC staff and management will be able to continue their careers in mortgage insurance on terms as good as or better than at present. </PARA>
<PARA>In plain English that means some of the staff will be sacked, with no voluntary redundancy packages, which is the usual practice in these circumstances. They will simply receive redundancy pay and bleak prospects given the current job market. Furthermore, those who do not want to work for the new owner will just be sacked and no redundancy will be paid. The Corporation is a successful business and its employees deserve a better go than that proposed by the Government and gleefully accepted by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> The tragic thing about the direction which Cabinet has taken, against the wishes of the great majority of its members, is that it legitimises the position of the Opposition on the question of privatisation. There is now absolutely no difference between the old parties on every major issue. The Australian Democrats totally reject the Bill and will vote against it on the second reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler began his contribution by telling us that in 1985 the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC) was able to extend its activities into insuring dealers in the secondary mortgage market. The point is that when the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation began during the Menzies era there was no secondary mortgage market. Indeed, the whole idea of mortgage insurance was only in its fledgling stages. It was necessary for the government of the day to make a decision to set up a government corporation to enter the field and to pioneer efforts in it. There is no question that the HLIC was successful in doing so. It meant that during that quarter of a century many low income earners were able to get themselves housing loans from banks that they may not have been able to get otherwise. That was a legitimate purpose-a government corporation set up by a conservative government-and one that we would all support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But in looking at the size of government and in looking at what is appropriate for governments to run and not to run, one would have to say that in the 1990s the mortgage insurance industry is now well-established. There are many players in the game. There is now a market for those dealing in secondary mortgages and the reality is that the Government does not need to pioneer anything in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In making the decision we have made, we ensure a return to the taxpayer. Senator Spindler said that in plain English this means that some will get sacked. In plain English it means exactly what the Minister said-the great majority of staff will be retained on as good as or better conditions. That is what it means. That is the kind of guarantee that most employees in Australia would love to have. If one could give a guarantee to every firm in Australia at the moment that the great majority of its employees-no matter which industry they are in-would be retained on as good or better conditions, I think the applause around Australia would be deafening. I do not believe that the staff are being disadvantaged. It has been a prime concern of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As one sits around the Budget Cabinet discussions and looks at where governments can prune and where governments can save, here we have managed to keep a government enterprise going. Senator Spindler said that it is being destroyed; far from it. It goes into the hands of the private sector where, if anything, its opportunities to grow will be greater. Any idea that it is being destroyed is just not true. There is not a skerrick of evidence to suggest that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats act in this manner out of prejudice and not out of intellect, which is unusual because usually they do try. The Democrats need to break the cycle and not say that they are opposed to any suggestion ever of the Government moving out of any enterprise. Any thought, by the way, that the Government is going to run mortgage insurance better in this day and age than the private sector is, to my mind, a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been given some answers to comments by Senator Short. He referred to the likely return to be derived from the sale of certain of the HLIC's business assets and the vesting of its residual assets and liabilities in the Commonwealth. It remains our position that the Government expects to obtain more than $100m in the current financial year from this process. I think that was the original estimate; so there is no change at this stage from what we would expect. As Senator Short indicated, the bulk of those funds will be obtained from the realisation of the Corporation's investments after its abolition. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in his press release of 30 October, the overall return is expected to be around $80m in net present value terms after allowing for claims on existing policies of mortgage insurance which will have to be met by the Commonwealth in future years. The estimate of the number of claims to be made in future years is considered to be realistic and the Government sees no reason to change its estimate of the overall return in the sale process. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that Senator Short mentioned was the actuarial advice. While I do not have a note on that before me, my recollection is that the Minister said at the time that that was confidential, commercial in-confidence type information and was not to be released. I understand there is no change to that position. So, the Government will not be releasing it. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the other two pieces of legislation which affect the defence forces. As Senator McLean correctly pointed out, over the years one of the great problems has been that service life has tended to discourage home ownership. With this new scheme we seek to reverse that trend and encourage home ownership by service personnel. This new legislation establishes a form of home loan subsidy for members of the Australian Defence Force and  approves an agreement with the National Australia Bank Ltd for that subsidy-where the Commonwealth will pay the National Australia Bank a subsidy of 40 per cent of the average interest bill over the life of the loan, and the National Australia Bank will make available loans up to $40,000. The National Australia Bank will pay the Commonwealth $42m on 15 May next year and an annual commission based on the number of clients. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Newman has written to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) about the problem that she sees with reservists. The first point the Government would make is that this was a scheme which was primarily established to make sure that full time service personnel were helped. They were always the priority from the concept of the scheme coming into being. The subsidy is based on the number of years of service after an initial six years of full time service; unless, of course, there has been a posting to the Gulf when the six years will be waived. </PARA>
<PARA> `Reservists who are posted to the Gulf are less likely to gain loans because they will not have much full time service necessary to build up that subsidy entitlement', is the kind of claim that Senator Newman makes. If one has a scheme which is a retention measure for full time defence personnel, one wonders what else one would expect. It is about increasing permanent numbers in the Defence Force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not. There has been criticism of the loss of war service home loans. The Defence Service Homes Act provides only for specific benefits for specific operational areas. That has always been the case. There is no commitment now, nor has there been any in the past, to provide loans for service in any future war zone. That has simply not been the case ever before-not when the honourable senator's predecessors or my predecessors ran the show.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We cannot abolish something that did not exist. In any event, there are far better benefits, such as tax free salaries and allowances for operational service, for persons who are posted to war-like areas. For example, those deployed in the Gulf have a daily amount paid to them. Maximum subsidised loans-$25,000 in the old scheme and $40,000 in this scheme-are not indexed. The new scheme provides for an evaluation of the scheme in a three to five-year cycle, including the incentive effect of the loan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The benefits under the old scheme have risen dramatically. Since the limit was set in 1982, market interest rates have risen, whilst the rate paid by borrowers has remained the same. In short, this new scheme is a vast improvement on the old one and I am sure it will achieve its aim of keeping full time defence personnel in the forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition basically supports the thrust of these amendments to the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1990, which provide for advance notice for owners of land subject to a notice of intention to include the place in the National Estate, make minor amendments to the procedures for inclusion or removal from the register of the National Estate and to alter the basis for grants for National Estate projects. These were basically announced on 18 November 1988. It has taken the Government until now to get them to this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, as the thrust of the legislation is to improve the status and effectiveness of the Australian Heritage Commission, the Opposition, while agreeing with that thrust, nonetheless feels that the Government has not done a good enough job. It is vital to increase the status and standing in the public's eye of the Australian Heritage Commission and what it does. Of course, its task is of major importance and has had, and continues to have, the support of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA> The Heritage Commission has played a significant role in the preservation of the National Estate since 1975, despite the fact that some of its actions have generated controversy and criticism. There have been complaints, particularly from sections of the rural sector, that the Heritage Commission has been used-or one might say misused-by pressure groups. But much of this criticism and complaint emerges basically from misunderstandings of the role of the Commission, which is basically advisory, or the misuse of the Commission's advice basically by those people who at times can put an added gloss on statements from the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important indeed for the Commission's status and standing in the community to be as high as possible. That is why we are moving some amendments which we believe improve perceptions of the equity with which the Commission deals with people. While in the community there are concerns-and some quite soundly based-that the Commission does not deal totally fairly with everyone, there will be these resentments, which should not exist in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why at this second reading stage I would like to discuss the broad thrust of the amendments we want to move. The Bill excludes Australian Airlines Ltd from the effectiveness of the Act. That seems extraordinary. Australian Airlines, among all the competitive government business enterprises that compete in the marketplace, is selected to be exempted from the requirements of the Act. As explained to us in a committee, this was done on the basis that there has been a level playing field for Australian Airlines in competition with the other airlines, which are privately owned and do not have to meet the requirements of the Act. This rests very uneasily with the assurance by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and by the Heritage Commission that no commercial disadvantage is involved in being bound by the Act; that in fact it is simply on `an advice to the Government' basis. The Government cannot have it both ways. If there is no commercial disadvantage-if it is not a disadvantage to be listed-why on earth is Australian Airlines exempted? There is simply a logical gap in the Government's thinking on this score. </PARA>
<PARA> We have some concerns about the way that the Government does not observe the requirements of the Act. Had we been able to devise an appropriate amendment to require a government to be bound by its own Acts, we would have done so. We saw the extraordinary situation in the case of the Paddy's Market redevelopment. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) disgracefully ignored the requirements of this Act, thumbed his nose at it and did so in secret. It emerged that he had entirely disregarded the requirements of the Act only when he gave foreign exchange approval to a foreign based development; only when, in a court case, the facts of his ignoring the requirements of the Act became clear. A judge made a damning comment on the Treasurer's total and arrogant disregard for the requirements of this Act. Unfortunately, it is very hard to draft an amendment requiring the Government to be bound by the Act when it is in the Act itself. I guess Mr Justice Wilcox's decision will change the atmosphere. Maybe now the Government will feel that it should be bound by its own Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments we shall move, once again, are directed to increasing the public perceptions of the fairness of decisions made by the Heritage Commission by requiring it to take into account the economic impact of registration on the National Estate. There are those people who, quite properly, express concern that one of the major factors influencing people's views of the merit of listing, that is, the economic impact of so doing, is presently excluded by the law itself. I am talking about pragmatic effects. That has generated a perception in the community that the Australian Heritage Commission adopts a one-eyed view of these things. Our amendment to require it to take into account the economic impact simply is to increase public perceptions of its fairness. That will enhance the status of the Heritage Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We also want a clear limit on the time in which the Heritage Commission has to deal with submissions. At the moment, applications can basically be hanging over a property owner for an unlimited time. The Minister has the capacity to extend the time limit under which the Commission must act for as long as he likes. We do not believe that that is proper. It can generate a lack of enthusiasm to resolve matters. In committee we heard the objection that sometimes the delays are caused by the protesters-the objectors-themselves. If the objectors themselves are mucking around they do not deserve to receive protection of this objection process. What interests me is that most of the objectors who do delay are in fact government instrumentalities. Maybe by putting a limit on it the Government will smarten up and deal with these matters quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> We also want to provide an avenue to deal with one of the major aspects of the legislation which I think is very important: that is, to provide people whose properties are proposed for entry on the register with the right to access information and to guarantee that right of access. It is all very well for the Government and the Commission to say, `It is our intention to provide it without cost', and so on, but there is no absolute requirement on the Commission to provide the sort of information that people normally have to get under a freedom of information (FOI) application at some cost. There is no provision for the Commission to provide that fulsome information which an FOI application would provide at no cost. We intend in the committee stage to move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Clause 8, page 6, paragraph (h), at the end of the paragraph add ``and substituting the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(5) Any owner or owners (or the nominee of any owner or owners nominated in writing), of a place which is proposed for entry or entered in the Register, shall have the same right to inspect, as would exist under an application lodged under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 except at no charge, all papers or documents held by the Commission relevant to the nomination, assessment, evaluation and decision that the place should be entered in the Register.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This will protect the privacy of those people who make recommended nominations. Under the Freedom of Information Act, there is provision for adequate privacy. I regret to say that under our time sharing arrangements I have no further time but I commend the Opposition's amendments because they are aimed at enhancing the public status of the Australian Heritage Commission, which has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill. It is the product of an extensive process of review and consultation. We believe that it will formalise a number of significant changes to the Australian Heritage Commission's powers and operations. The Democrats' stance on this Bill arises from our strong support for the Commission and for its rigorous work. We believe that an important measure of the integrity, and indeed the health, of our nation is the reverence which we accord to our cultural and our natural heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We therefore believe that the Commission's tasks of listing places on the Register of the National Estate is of enormous importance, particularly at a time when reverence for our heritage is so often swept aside in a push for profits. It is well known that the Commission has been the subject of controversy in recent times. The forestry industry complains that the environment movement and the Commission itself have deliberately blurred the distinction between the National Estate and national parks in an attempt to win greater protection for National Estate forests, which they claim do not deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem is that the National Estate has no real protection. It dismays us that proposals to exploit and to degrade vast tracts of native forest can be justified by the forest industry as well as by State and Federal governments as being in the national interest. It is to address this problem that I will be moving an amendment to the second reading motion to call on the Government to ensure that corporations and State, Territory, and local authorities are bound to consider prudent and feasible alternatives to any development proposal which would degrade the National Estate in the way in which Commonwealth authorities already are. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that the National Estate should be better protected, consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. In the case of the National Estate forests that protection would come from a shift to plantations as the primary resource base of the timber industry. Unfortunately, the political tide has turned against the Commission and the National Estate. Sometime next year this chamber may be called on to debate so-called resource security legislation which, after a forest zone has been declared available for logging, would exclude the Heritage Commission from offering advice which could help preserve natural values. Such legislation would be a major victory for those who are committed to neutralising the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are aware that the Opposition will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage, based on amendments already debated by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts two weeks ago. The Democrats will not be supporting those amendments. Two of those amendments are particularly significant in that they would compel the Commission to consider the economic impact of decisions to list places on the Register of the National Estate. This has long been Opposition policy but we believe that it is neither necessary nor practical and would be a distraction from the Commission's primary task of identifying our national heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no shortage of economic analysis in support of development proposals in this country. The resources available for identifying natural and cultural values are by contrast woefully small. The Democrats support the Bill and we wish it a speedy proclamation. We remain concerned, however, that its passage will do little to stem the corporate tide which is rapidly eroding our heritage. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) recognising the importance to our cultural, environmental and economic well-being of the National Estate, and the threat posed to it by unsustainable development practices; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) noting with concern the campaign by some Government ministers to dilute the Australian Heritage Commission's already limited powers to protect the National Estate;</PARA>
<PARA> calls on the Government to:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1990. I endorse the comments of my colleague Senator Michael Baume. In dealing with the matter before us, it is my intention to move an amendment to the definition of an owner as it applies to Crown land. Part (b) of the definition of `owner' in section 3(c) of the Act relating to Crown leaseholders discriminates against exploration in the mining industries in that it will create a situation where they not be notified of heritage listings. This was raised in the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts but I was not satisfied with the answers that were given then. It is my view that in terms of the operations of the Act it is desirable that all landowners or land users, in terms of the definition of leaseholders, be notified. I do not believe that it is the difficult problem that was outlined to us because a register is kept of all leaseholders. I emphasise that we are talking about the prime leaseholder, not secondary leaseholders or arrangements that are made by a leaseholder with other people. As such, I wish to move an amendment to take out that discrimination against one of our major resource industries. It will allow the Act to operate in a better way. It will create more harmony. I believe that discrimination or any inequities in the operation of an Act in the longer term are undesirable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, the amendments outlined by Senator Michael Baume on behalf of the Opposition have been discussed at some length at a committee which you chair. I outlined the Government's position on them. I do not propose to redebate all of them but I will refer to two in particular. The first relates to the amendment which suggests that the Australian Heritage Commission should take into consideration economic matters when making decisions for National Estate listing. That is something which the Government cannot and will not accept. That represents an insidious attack on the very basis of why the Commission exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The role of the Commission is to look at the significance-usually the environmental significance-of the special places of this country. When it comes to making an economic assessment, when it comes to judging the worth of a mine or a timber operation, there are any number of ways in which that will come to the fore. There are government departments whose specific responsibility it is to make sure that Australia knows all about it. Private industry comes forward all the time and does it. But one wonders what the relevance of the value of a forest operation or of a mine in a National Estate area would be if a commission sat down to determine its natural significance. That goes to the heart of the Commission's functions. It is something that the Government cannot possibly agree to. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to Senator Crane's amendment concerning owners. I think the best way to kill off the Heritage Commission is to put burdens on it that it cannot possibly meet. What Senator Crane is suggesting in his amendment requires the absolute cooperation of State governments and local authorities in determining who the holders of various kinds of leases might be. It has been my experience that the Commission often does not get that kind of cooperation. This is not a matter of conservative versus Labor politics. There have been some State Labor governments which have been very slow to cooperate with the Commission in a range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There is just no point in putting a burden-a requirement-on the Commission that it cannot meet. I know that the Commission will live up to a range of provisions in this Bill which make it obligatory for it to notify certain people and to have specified periods of notice. That is only putting into practice what was already happening, but it does allay some of the fears that have been around. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just seen Senator Bourne's amendment. I understand that she is trying to help Ministers who, perhaps, have a different view from other Ministers. This is not the way to help them. Her statement that the tide has turned is simply wrong. That will be demonstrated over the course of the next few months. As they say in the classics, keep the faith. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment calls on the Government to include the activities of corporations, State, Territory and local authorities within the ambit of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. That cannot be done. We just have to accept the fact that the Commonwealth does not have that kind of constitutional clout. While the amendment may be well-intentioned, I do not think the Government is in a position to agree to a constitutional impossibility, no matter how well-intended it might be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, I was looking at the very last of the Liberal amendments.

I emphasise that the Australian Democrats support 100 per cent the principle behind this amendment, but we will be maintaining the position we have held on three pieces of legislation; that is, until the Comcare legislation is amended to cover people over the age of 65, we do not believe that we should be putting them in a position where they will possibly need to seek an extensive appeal provision in order to receive compensation. We have been attempting since the Government supported this in a previous Bill-I believe it was last week-to get written assurance from the Minister guaranteeing that the Government will amend the Comcare legislation to cover people over 65. We have not been able to get this assurance. The Democrats put on notice that if we do not have this assurance by February, we will be moving, through a private member's Bill, to make the necessary alterations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In closing, I wish to note that there is one piece of the picture missing. If the Opposition and the Government are to be consistent in their concerns relating to drug use in sport then they need to look at the most commonly used drug and that is tobacco. They had an opportunity last week to support us in removing the last loophole-a loophole which sporting organisations are being pressured through. We will not stop the drug companies putting pressure on the sporting organisations to get sponsorship unless we close that final loophole. I note that Senator Powell has a Bill that she will be dealing with in February and we look forward to the Senate's support for that. </PARA>

<PARA>I am astounded at the hypocrisy of the Australian Democrats on this matter. It is absolute nonsense to claim that because Comcare has not been changed yet by the Government an intolerable situation should be allowed to continue whereby more and more governmental agencies bring in this age limit-this ageist, discriminatory limit. The Australian Democrats know perfectly well that there are plenty of government boards that do not have this discriminatory age limit and which survive quite well without Comcare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats know that the Australian National Gallery has Mr Gough Whitlam, aged, I think, into his seventies, as its Chairman. There are plenty of them. I do not mind the Government resisting the forces of progress- after all, that is its consistent position-but I find it intolerable that the Australian Democrats would continue to display this nonsensical hypocrisy, no doubt because they have done some sort of deal with the Government, and refuse to join with the Opposition in getting rid of and preventing the extension of this ageist discrimination against these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the same thing in the debate on the National Maritime Museum Bill. The Government, by accident, when Senator Tate was being reasonable in a sea of unreasonableness on his side, accepted it last week in respect of the pharmaceutical legislation. I urge the Democrats to recognise that they are continuing and improperly maintaining ageist discriminatory legislation. The coalition believes this amendment is right and should be supported. Senator Crichton-Browne will move the amendments standing in his name. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 67, page 26, after subclause (4), insert the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4a) For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to the effect of any other law, it is declared that this section does not affect:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the presentation or submission of a document, or the giving of evidence, to a House or a committee; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the operation of a lawful order of a House or a committee.''. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 67, page 27, subclause (5), before definition of ``court'', insert the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `committee' means a committee of a House or of both Houses, or a subcommittee of such a committee;''. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 67, page 27, subclause (5), after definition of ``court'' insert the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `House' means either House of the Parliament;''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 67 is a standard secrecy provision which honourable senators will find sprinkled through about 300 Acts of the Commonwealth. I would like to draw attention to a rather bizarre legal opinion given by the Solicitor-General in respect of the same set of words in the National Crime Authority legislation that purports to suggest that any witness appearing before a committee of the Parliament who discloses information within the terms of the clause will find himself subject to a penalty of two years in gaol. That is a bizarre interpretation because section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act starts off with words to the effect, `So as to clear up any doubt.'</PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 provides absolute immunity from any prosecution for any disclosure to anyone who appears, whether voluntarily or by subpoena, before a parliamentary committee and gives evidence; and quite rightly so. A simple fundamental principle contained in the Charter of the Bill of Rights of 1651 provides that people who appear before the Parliament will be immune from any prosecution as a result of what they say. This pretty simple and fundamental provision is enshrined in Parliamentary Privileges Act; that is why the Act is there. The Solicitor-General has given a bizarre opinion that this is not the case. My amendment is a declaratory amendment which does nothing other than declare and re-state the position as it is. Hence the reason for this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of the Australian Democrats-although I am certain they understand this-my amendment does not provide for the public disclosure of anyone who tests positive. It is simply to give immunity. For instance, if the chairman of the new authority were to come before a committee and asked in camera to provide the names of athletes who might have tested positive, this amendment would stop him going to gaol for two years. That is all; it is not for public disclosure. That is the purpose of the amendment. It is a declaratory amendment which, frankly, under normal circumstances, one would not expect to have to move. However, because the Solicitor-General has given an opinion which the Attorney-General said he will accept as policy, we are required to move these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will quickly outline the Government's position on these amendments. In respect of the amendment relating to the aged, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is considering a report prepared by his Department on the issues raised by the review and on possible measures to overcome instances of age discrimination. It is understood that the Attorney will issue a discussion paper within the next couple of months, which will be followed by a series of consultations and possibly by legislation sometime during 1991. Might I say that I am delighted to have an expression of confidence by Senator Baume in Mr Whitlam's capacity. It is something like 15 years overdue but is no less welcome for that. We are indebted to that Christmas spirit which no doubt inspired it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the privacy matter raised by Senator Crichton-Browne, the Government's resistance to this has, I think, been well articulated in other places. In the event that there is media speculation about a particular athlete, there is a safeguard in the legislation to enable the issue to be raised in Parliament. Provision has been included for the Minister to request the agency to notify him or her whether a competitor's name has been entered on the register. Under those circumstances, we believe there is no basis for pursuit of this amendment at this stage. </PARA>

Senator Baume told us yesterday that amateurs have been cheating in sport. It is not only the amateurs who have been cheating.

If the Government had put something in here that it was moving towards cost recovery, as it expects other industries around Australia to do, Senator Michael Baume would have had no need to move this amendment.

I seek leave to incorporate that response in Hansard and to move a motion in relation to that response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has approached the Report with great interest, and find much in the findings and recommendations with which we can readily agree. We welcome the thoughtful, imaginative and forward-looking approach taken by the Senate Committee and share its view that our relationship with India has much to offer. The friendship between our Prime Minister and the former Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, successive Ministerial visits from both countries and contacts between officials have confirmed this and provided an impetus for the relationship which is entirely consistent with the thinking reflected in the Report. </PARA>
<PARA>The relationship has been important to both countries since India established independence, and is by no means static. There have been periods of activity, but also periods of relative neglect. We do not always see eye to eye with India, and there are times when, as mature democracies, we have agreed to differ. But our political dialogue with India is relevant, we share objectives and concerns on important global issues and, as the Committee found, there is room for development. As the Prime Minister's visit in 1989 and the subsequent Ministerial and other visits have shown, the Government shares the view that the time is right to invest the relationship with energy and vision. It is this Government's firm conviction that, this time, the revitalised relationship is here to stay. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report itself is timely. Significant changes in the international environment have helped make it so. The Report draws attention to the process of economic liberalisation which has been under way and which has attracted the attention of a number of countries. The institution of policies for economic openness has been one of the hallmarks of our own Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Our support for economic openness has been an important element in our efforts in multilateral trade forums, and we look for likemindedness in our friends. We welcome increasing access and openness in India, and I believe that our commercial interests in India will continue to be productive for both sides if they are matched by a continuing Indian liberalisation effort. We hope that the new Government under Mr Chandra Shekar will continue the trends set by his two predecessors in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report has also served to highlight matters of concern to those Government Departments dealing with aspects of our relations with India. The Government acknowledges that there has been a need for a coordinated strategy in dealing with India. We are all familiar with the tension in the bilateral relationship which followed the Government's decision to sell its obsolescent Mirage aircraft to Pakistan. It is certainly our strong desire to avoid such setbacks in the future, and I am confident that the lessons learned from this episode, relating especially to the need for careful coordination, have not been lost on those concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the Committee's report may have under-valued the progress made in the relationship with India in recent years and the role of the Government in assisting or facilitating this effort. In summary, the Australia-India relationship of the 1990s has seen:</PARA>
<PARA>* a 200 per cent increase in total two way trade between 1983/84 and 1989/90 in dollar terms;</PARA>
<PARA>* an Australia-India Joint Business Council;</PARA>
<PARA>* a Joint Trade Committee;</PARA>
<PARA>* a Joint Working Group on Coal;</PARA>
<PARA>* a $A35 million, three-year development co-operation program and a treaty to facilitate it;</PARA>
<PARA>* a Joint Ministerial Commission,</PARA>
<PARA>* an umbrella agreement fostering cooperation in science and technology, under which a number of projects is being pursued in fields such as space science and monsoon meteorology;</PARA>
<PARA>* a range of bilateral defence exchanges;</PARA>
<PARA>* a Mixed Commission which is actively promoting cultural and political exchanges; and</PARA>
<PARA>* a significantly expanded political agenda, which includes regular bilateral disarmament talks. </PARA>
<PARA>The process of developing the relationship has generated an unprecedented level of importance which is reflected in the Department's corporate plan. The Department now coordinates the Officials' Working Group on India, an interdepartmental committee which, apart from monitoring and coordinating the operational arm of our relationship, also has productive links with key groups in the private sector. At a time when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, like the rest of the public sector, is operating under tight resource constraints, an officer at Deputy Secretary level in my Department is spending much of his time on the development of our commercial relationship with India, and staffing at the High Commission in New Delhi has been increased. Further, the Department's public affairs program in India has been tailored to support our export drive. The establishment of the Australia Abroad Council will ensure improved coordination and a sharper focus of that public diplomacy effort in India, in the context of increased emphasis on the Asian region generally. I would also note that our level of funding for cultural activities in India in the coming year, while less than ideal, nonetheless represents an increase. </PARA>
<PARA>Having made these points, which I think clearly signal our intentions with regard to the relationship, I must point out that a good working relationship requires two willing partners. It has been gratifying for the Prime Minister and for me to have been assured, at the highest levels, that India shares our desire to develop the relationship, and we confidently expect that the new Indian Government will continue to reciprocate our efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>Underpinning the new level of attention, and providing its strategic direction, are a range of long term projects with well defined objectives. The major focus of the enhanced relationship agreed upon by Prime Ministers Hawke and Gandhi in Canberra in 1986 has been commercial. In the six years to 1990, bilateral trade has increased by well over 200 per cent and is fast approaching the $A1 billion mark. During the Joint Ministerial Commission in 1989, the Indian and Australian negotiators reached an agreement to work towards doubling the two-way value of trade by 1992. We are on the way toward meeting that objective. </PARA>
<PARA>What we must appreciate is that the concept of bilaterally balanced trade is not necessarily an indication of a healthy trading relationship. We must ensure a fair share of the benefits from the growth in bilateral trade while working towards reducing the present imbalance. To this end we have set a target, in consultation with the Indian Government, whereby one per cent of our total imports of engineering products should come from India. This agreement was made subject to the quality and price competitiveness of the Indian products. Since that decision the Market Advisory Service of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has spent a total of $A300,000 on promoting Indian engineering products in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We now also have in place an extensive array of bodies or forums designed to promote the economic relationship between us. We have the Australia-India Joint Business Council, the Joint Trade Committee, the Joint Working Group on Coal and the Joint Ministerial Commission. We have results to show for this: the Piparwar open cut mine and the Karwar naval base consultancy are important successes for Australian companies and showcases for Australian expertise and technology. </PARA>
<PARA>These kind of achievements require a dexterous use of diplomatic, marketing and financial resources. I believe we are using them well. Through DIFF we have been able to offer an attractive mixture of aid funds and commercial export finance. It is not mentioned in the Report, but the grant aid component of the Piparwar project-$A60.3 million-was funded under DIFF. Our ability to offer concessional finance can often make a difference in helping Australian firms with initiative and tenacity to establish themselves and their products in the Indian market. </PARA>
<PARA>It is possible that the limited penetration of the Indian market described in the Report reflects an establishment of Australian business priorities occasioned by the genuine difficulties and costs encountered in overcoming existing Indian trade barriers. India, for all its large size and growth in GDP, actually imports fewer goods than does Australia, and this shows the difficulties faced by Australian companies in establishing a bridgehead for Australian goods in India. Nonetheless, the fact that some Australian companies have succeeded in doing business in India shows what is possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Looking to the future, we will be hoping for further progress in trade liberalisation in India and, consistent with the Report's recommendation, we should encourage the Government to make swifter progress in relaxing trade and investment controls detrimental to our interests. Indeed, much effort is, in fact, already devoted to that objective-officers are persistent in raising questions with appropriate Ministries, as well as through multilateral channels such as the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>We will also be encouraging our private sector to make the most of opportunities as they arise. In 1989, Austrade strengthened its presence in New Delhi, and I look forward to continuing an even closer cooperation between its representatives and those of my Department there. There is likely to be a qualitative increase in the commercial intelligence available to the public and private sectors as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION</PARA>
<PARA>An important element in our enhanced relationship with India is our agreement on a new $A35 million development cooperation program over three years, beginning in 1990/91. This is grant aid, additional to the assistance provided under the DIFF scheme. The program has the potential to play a significant role in encouraging mutually beneficial links between Australia and India. The program will be focussed on sectors upon which India places development priority and in which Australia has comparative advantage. These include mining and energy (with an appropriate environmental focus), telecommunications, food technology and railways. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to report that the High Level Officials' Consultations were held in Canberra in October and that an Agreement on Development Cooperation covering the new program was signed. Agreement has been reached with the Indian Government on a number of project design and feasibility studies planned to take place this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE</PARA>
<PARA>The Government broadly endorses the analysis of India's military capabilities and objectives set out in the Report. We understand the historical factors that have helped to fashion India's perception of its strategic environment. India, in the four decades since Independence, has fought a number of wars. It still has disputed borders and faces some serious separatist and insurgency problems. We are also aware that our own position, as participants in a long standing alliance, is somewhat different from that of India. </PARA>
<PARA>We would not wish to give the impression that we are unable to understand India's circumstances. We recognise that India must be able to protect its long coastline, its scattered island territories and its off-shore interests. India's strategic circumstances mean that it needs to maintain a certain level of military capability. We also readily acknowledge that while India's military build-up has enhanced its power projection capability in the South Asia region, this does not constitute a threat to the security of Australia or South East Asia. We would, however, emphasise the need for openness and dialogue to allay any regional concerns that may arise from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that there was little reference in the Report to the strengthening of the bilateral defence relationship. We engage in a range of visits and defence staff exchanges, and have re-established the Defence Attache position in New Delhi. These measures will contribute to a better comprehension of and means of dialogue about India's defence preoccupations, and thus to a better understanding of India's strategic concerns and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Nuclear proliferation pressures in South Asia will continue to warrant the attention of the Government. We have made our concerns known to both India and Pakistan on this issue. The dialogue has been strengthened through bilateral disarmament talks held at Prime Ministerial instigation. I also pursued the issue during my visits to both countries earlier this year. Our position remains clear. The Government believes it would be in the interests of all nations if both India and Pakistan were to demonstrate conclusively that they were not pursuing a nuclear option. This could be done by their acceding to the NPT or, at the very least, placing all their nuclear facilities under full scope safeguards applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is worth pointing out that Australia maintains links with India through the Regional Cooperation Agreements under the umbrella of the IAEA. </PARA>
<PARA>INFORMATION AND EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's recommendations for the establishment of an Australia-India Council, and an Indian Studies Centre deserve particular attention. </PARA>
<PARA>I support the establishment of an Australia-India Council. It would undoubtedly prove to be a catalyst in the development of our relations. Similar arrangements in the cases of China, Japan and Indonesia have proven profitable. I accordingly intend to seek funds for the Council, as a new policy proposal in the coming budget. It should be noted, however, that in the difficult budgetary environment the Government continues to face, the proposal will have to compete with other pressing priorities, and the Council's establishment in 1991-92 cannot at this stage be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the proposed India Studies Centre, I agree in principle but must make the point again that a decision can only be made in the budgetary context. The Minister for Education, Employment and Training has recently commissioned, through the Asian Studies Council, the production of a national strategy document for the study of India, to be completed in the coming months. One of the tasks of those devising the national strategy document will be to consider the recommendations of the Report. The results will help inform the Government's decision on the proposed Centre. I would appreciate further comment from the Committee as to what it envisages the form, role, location and structure of an Indian Studies Centre might be. I also note with interest the Committee's intention that an Indian Studies Centre attract private sector support in the long term. I would be interested in indications from the business community as to the feasibility of such an arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report highlights the crucial function of education in developing the relationship by providing an expert base, as well as a better informed community. Much has taken place toward that end. The Asian Studies postgraduate Scheme and the National Asian Languages Scholarship Scheme aim to increase Australian expertise on Asia. A series of awards for study in India have been made for 1990 and 1991. The establishment in 1990 of the Indian Ocean Peace Studies Centre, to be jointly managed by the University of Western Australia and Curtin University of Technology also helps us in moving towards the goal of a better informed Australia. Under the Targeted Institutional Links Programme, Murdoch and Curtin University have received grants to strengthen their ties with Indian institutions in areas of priority for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In the context of improving two-way information flows, informal links and understanding generally it should be noted that the recently established Australia Abroad Council, an advisory body of 30 prominent Australians representing all relevant government agencies and the private sector, now has the task, the commitment and discretionary funds of $A1 million to project Australia's image overseas more effectively. The Council has a particular interest in education, science and technology and sport and will be focusing on the Asia-Pacific region. I hope and expect that the Council will pay particular attention to India, including facilitating an expanded programme of visits from India. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to Immigration, an issue touched upon in the Report, I can comment that during 1989/1990 there was a 74 per cent increase in migration applications, and migrant visas issued rose by 32 per cent. Liberalised procedures for assessing Indian professional and technical qualifications will also boost the number of applicants eligible for migration to Australia. The recent enhancement of staffing of the Immigration section in Delhi will allow for an increased capacity to respond to Indian interest in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendations made by the Senate Committee offer valuable pointers for the future direction of the relationship. Many of the areas identified by the Committee as being ripe for progress are of course beyond the Government's authority, but those recommendations for which the Government has responsibility are addressed in the attached document. The release of the Report itself has provided further impetus for our relationship with India and I am pleased to have been able to report some progress. I look forward to being part of its continuing evolution. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SCHEDULE OF RESPONSES</PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.33. 6.34. 6.35. 6.37. 6.38, 6.41. 6.45, 6.48</PARA>
<PARA>6.33 With due regard for the above considerations, the Committee recommends the establishment of an Indian Studies Centre to provide advanced academic study of a range of Indian related disciplines. The development of this Centre should be based on a thorough analysis of the needs of the Australian Government and the business community. In establishing the Centre, the Committee recommends maximum use of existing academic resources. In particular, Indian Studies Centre should overcome the existing problem of loss of institutional memory on India as individual universities change their priorities away from Indian studies or as Australia's older academics specialising in India retire. Such a Centre would become the country's register of expertise on India in other Australian institutions or enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>6.34 The Committee believes that future development of Asian studies in Australia should recognise the need to pursue a two-track approach-the first involving support for advanced studies in humanities (history, literature, languages, arts and social sciences); the second involving support for commercially related, applied studies. Government, educational institutions and the commercial sector should work actively to develop the two elements in tandem, with a creative and innovative approach to promoting interaction between the academic and applied streams. Studies in support of trade and collection of basic data on Australia/India trade should be an important part of the Centre's activity. </PARA>
<PARA>6.35 The Committee believes that the long-term funding of an Indian Studies Centre should be undertaken on a partnership basis between government and commercial enterprises, particularly large public corporations. The relatively new Australia-India Business Council may be able to play some role. In fact, the development of an education policy, duly accompanied by appropriate funding, could be regarded as an integral part of the Council's trade promotion program. </PARA>
<PARA>6.36 The Federal Government as an important user-at least in theory-of expertise on all of Australia's major Asian neighbours should take a strong lead in developing a more solid basis for future Australian knowledge and study of India. The Committee believes that the Australian Government should, through relevant organisations such as the Asian Studies Council, commit itself to strong funding support for an Indian Studies Centre for an initial fixed term such as five years. The main user departments, such as Foreign Affairs and Trade, Defence, and the Office of National Assessments, must have training and information requirements that an Indian Studies Centre would satisfy and which are not now being fully met. </PARA>
<PARA>6.37 The level of funding required would be several hundred thousand dollars per year over and above current costs of existing Indian studies courses in the universities. The Committee believes such a funding level could be easily met within existing levels of appropriations by the relevant departments through minor adjustments in priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>6.38 The Committee envisages a need for the development of innovative funding and endowment arrangements for a new Indian Studies Centre. The provision of direct commercial support for specific specialisations in advanced study in the humanities in Australia is extremely underdeveloped, and, as a consequence, many areas of foreign commercial and government policy analysis suffer. </PARA>
<PARA>6.41 The mechanism by which a new Indian Studies Centre is created would be the concern of the relevant organisations but the Committee believes that a free-standing Centre, affiliated with a major university, would be the most desirable model. A new corporate body formed around representatives of major interested parties would appear to be the management arrangement most likely to guarantee long-term private sector funding (and use) of the Centre. </PARA>
<PARA>6.45 No time should be lost in establishing the new Centre if it is to begin operating as a driving force in the development of Australian expertise on India, particularly in commercially related aspects. For this reason, the Committee does not regard it as premature for interested parties to begin studying and planning for the Centre immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>6.48 The Committee believes that education policy in Australia has not kept pace with the increased Asian share of Australian trade, tourism, cultural exchanges and security preoccupations. In this respect, the Committee endorses the recommendations of the Ingleson Report for an expansion of Asia related content in general curriculum design for humanities subjects at all levels of education. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Asian Studies Council, an advisory body to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, has commissioned the production of a national strategy document for the study of India. A draft structure was provided to assist in addressing areas of particular concern to the Council, including consideration of the recommendations of this Report. The completed document will be available early in the coming year. It is possible that such a centre could operate as a ``think tank'' for organisations which either do not have the specialist resources or the time to devote to issues relating to the area. It could also provide useful services to relevant departments currently dealing with a range of issues where conditions or activities in South Asia are relevant, eg, trade, nuclear disarmament, chemical weapons, strategic planning, zones of peace, narcotics, environments, on a fee for service basis.</PARA>
<PARA>The Asian Studies Postgraduate Scheme and National Asian Languages Scholarship Scheme aim to increase Australian expertise on Asia. Under the former scheme, three awards were made for study in India in 1990 and six for study in 1991; under the latter two awards were made for study in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian understanding of the strategic context in which India operates will be enhanced by the establishment of the Indian Ocean Peace Studies Centre, jointly managed by the University of Western Australia and Curtin University of Technology. The Centre was set up by a grant under the National Priority Reserve Fund in 1990. A conference to be held by the Centre in early 1991 on ``Prospects for Peace in the Indian Ocean'' will be addressed by speakers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the United States and will be attended by officials from a number of Government Departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Targeted Institutional Links programme, aimed at broadening Australia's educational interaction with Asia beyond traditional aid objectives to activities more rigorously assessed for mutual benefit, enables Australian higher education institutions to apply for funding to strengthen ties with their counterparts in the Asian region in priority areas for Australia. Murdoch and Curtin Universities have received the grants listed below under the current round of funding to strengthen their links with Indian institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government anticipates that arrangements such as these will have positive and long term consequences for Australia's relationship with India. </PARA>
<PARA>* Murdoch University received contributions towards links with the University of Jadavpur, Calcutta, the Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Madras, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in the fields of energy technology and data processing. </PARA>
<PARA>* Curtin University of Technology received support for a research exchange programme with Delhi University's Delhi School of Economics and Institute of Economic Growth and for postdoctoral research fellowships in petroleum geochemistry with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India. </PARA>
<PARA>* India was one of the first five countries (with Pakistan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand) eligible for linkages under the Targeted Institutional Links Programme. </PARA>
<PARA>* The Government notes that the West Australian Geoscience and Technology Institute has established an impressive range of links in India and has offered to share its experiences with other Australian firms interested in developing the Indian market. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.43, 6.45, 6.46</PARA>
<PARA>6.43 The Committee is aware of the interest in the academic community and government in a broader South Asian perspective for a new Centre, so that it would include study of Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, rather than focus exclusively on India. However, resource priorities would appear to exclude development of such a broad focus for a new centre. Existing discipline-based studies (such as political science or development economics) could be expected to provide some coverage. Foreign academic resources can also be relied upon. </PARA>
<PARA>6.45 No time should be lost in establishing the new Centre if it is to begin operating as a driving force in the development of Australian expertise on India, particularly in commercially related aspects. For this reason, the Committee does not regard it as premature for interested parties to begin studying and planning for the Centre immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>6.46 Apart from the creation of a new Indian Studies centre, there are a number of avenues in the educating of Australians about India that the Committee believes should be pursued more vigorously. These include teacher and student exchanges, industry training in Australia of Indian nationals from Indian state corporations, conferences and symposia, trade union exchanges, and trade fairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the Committee's findings. As noted in my Response, the Committee's recommendation for the establishment of an Indian Studies Centre is being presently considered. The Government takes note of the points regarding its ambit, and would comment that although the priority of any such centre would naturally be India, any study of India would, of necessity, include study of its regional context. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.47</PARA>
<PARA>The advancement of Indian studies in Australia could usefully be accompanied by increased support for Australian studies in India. Australian public bodies have some role to play here and, while needing to consider the prerogatives of the Indian Government, are free to undertake a range of initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Jawaharlal Nehru University has expressed interest in providing a base for an Australian Studies Resource Centre and the Cultural Relations Branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is examining this possibility as well as the feasibility of establishing an Australian Studies Centre in India. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional investigation of means of increasing support for Australian Studies in India could be carried by the Australia Abroad Council, on which the Department of Employment, Education and Training is represented. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.49</PARA>
<PARA>One of the biggest obstacles to the fostering of advanced Studies of Indian affairs, and Asian studies in general in Australia, is the lack of professional rewards available to people with advanced qualifications in the field. For example, people with Master's degrees or Doctorates in Asian studies can receive almost no recognition, compensation or employment in government or industry significantly different from that received by people without such specialist qualifications. Some Asian studies specialists are able to obtain employment in their subject areas for several years but are, for the sake of promotion, eventually forced to work in areas not specifically related to their field of expertise. At the same time, government and industry regularly observe a deficiency in Asian expertise within the country. The Committee therefore urges employers across the country to review their recruitment and incentive policies for people with specialist skills in Asian studies. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government appreciates the point made by the Committee. However, in recruitment, the Government is obliged to strike a balance between its needs for specialists and generalists. Recruitment in relevant Departments does follow foreign and trade policy trends, but as a small country, we do not have the kind of structures available to allow specialists to make careers exclusively on the basis of a particular skill. Inevitably, and in the interests of an efficient and effective Government service, specialist officers will require broader management and policy skills to advance beyond a certain level. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIA-INDIA COUNCIL</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.52, 6.53, 6.55</PARA>
<PARA>6.52 The Committee recommends therefore the immediate establishment by the Australian Government of an Australia-India Council. The aims of the Council would be to raise Australian expertise on India; to raise awareness of India in Australia and of Australia in India; to identify gaps in the relationship and focus attention on these through appropriate initiatives and to organise support for and otherwise encourage a broad range of contacts between state and private organisations, governments, and people in the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA>6.53 The Council should initially comprise leading members of Australian business, academic and governmental organisations who have strong expertise in Indian affairs. The Council should be established by an Order-in-Council, with members to be appointed by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA>6.55 The Council would be responsible for providing some financial assistance to support innovative projects aimed at promoting longer term Australian goals with respect to India. In order not to dilute its resources or its goals, the Council should in the Committee's view support projects which are likely to have a ``strategic'' impact on relations between the two countries or on Australian expertise on India. The Council could build on areas where cultural exchange already has a prominent profile as is the case with cricket. An eminent practitioner of the sport could be considered for a position on the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade supports the establishment of an Australia-India Council, and will seek funds for the Council in the 1991-92 budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts that Councils such as that suggested by the Committee can have an excellent effect on bilateral relations. Our relationship with India is at a point where its development would be accelerated by the establishment of a Council. The Government also understands that its support for a Council will be welcomed by the Indian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>INFORMATION POLICY</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.58, 6.59</PARA>
<PARA>6.58 The Committee recommends that Departments and authorities review their basic intelligence capability in respect of India. The Committee believes that the sort of information and analyses that government Departments provided in submissions should already have been available in internal documents before the event and not been the object of a major research and writing task once the Committee called for submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>6.59 The Committee recommends that Australian Government departments regularly place in the public domain major assessments and information reports of a topical nature on the key countries of Asia. This already occurs to some extent through a variety of mechanisms, such as ministerial statements, answers to parliamentary questions, departmental information bulletins, and submissions to parliamentary inquiries. The interest shown by the general public through inquiries to this Committee's Secretariat for copies of departmental submissions is some evidence that public demand for certain types of assessments is not being met by other mechanisms. Assessments by the Department of Defence are in particular demand. Regular release of intelligence assessments of the security policies of our neighbours should make a worthwhile contribution to public attitudes and public debate on defence and security issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government can report that it keeps its intelligence base under review at all times, and finds it satisfactory. We are highly conscious of the importance of promoting an informed public debate on defence and security issues in Australia. The Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities (1986), The Defence of Australia 1987 Policy Information Paper, and my 1989 statement on Australia's Regional Security have made major contributions to this. In addition, frequent Ministerial statements and addresses outline the Government's views on specific issues. While India is undoubtedly a major strategic player in the Indian Ocean region, its capabilities and intentions do not affect Australia's area of direct military interest. Our primary concern is to avoid misunderstandings in our region about India's strategic objectives and the substantial expansion of its maritime capabilities. The Government believes that for Australia to speculate on this issue in the way suggested would be counterproductive, not least to maintaining positive bilateral relations. There is benefit however, in encouraging the Indian Government to be as open as possible in explaining the rationale behind its defence and foreign policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.60, 6.61, 6.62</PARA>
<PARA>6.60 The Committee recommends that government departments review the degree to which their existing analysis of Indian politics, economics and defence policy provides an adequate basis for assessment of long term trends across the range of policy issues. In respect of trade, the Government's data base and analysis should be more responsive to the demands of business. In particular, the Committee recommends that government agencies, universities and businesses review their information holdings on legal aspects of doing business in India.</PARA>
<PARA>6.61 AUSTRADE has made considerable advances in provision of market intelligence to Australian exporters in the last year through the establishment of a subscriber service computer data base, called TOP-Trade Opportunities, which incorporates not only information collected by AUSTRADE but also major international commercial data-bases. The Committee applauds such initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>6.62 At the same time, the processed intelligence-the hard assessment of particular commercial issues-is something that cannot be provided by a fact based data system. Human resources and constant reassessment are central to good commercial intelligence. The Committee recommends that the government agencies assess the quality of their commercial intelligence services from that perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>As is noted in the preceding response to the Committee's Report, resources devoted to India within Government departments have significantly increased. This includes the strengthening of Austrade and our Trade Policy function in Delhi. An additional Trade Commissioner (Engineering) has been added to the staff, charged with the assessment of opportunities for Australian businesses which could flow from Indian encouragement of the private sector and its manufacturing industry. These factors have made a considerable difference to our data base on India, which is growing steadily and under continual assessment to assure its relevance and quality. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is well aware of the need to meet the demands of business and its links with the private sector are solid. To that end the Government is pleased to acknowledge the roles that the Industry based bodies of AUSTENERGY, AUSTMINE and AGRITEC have played in developing a strategic approach toward India and improving market knowledge. My Department works closely with each of these bodies and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.64</PARA>
<PARA>Given the relatively undeveloped state of expertise on India in the relevant areas of government departments, the Committee recommends that departments institute a system whereby major assessment or policy papers would be subject to critical appraisal by at least one external expert. The establishment of a working relationship between government departments and experts-who could be given appropriate security clearances-is a normal practice in the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Most officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with substantive duties relating to India have considerable experience of working with that country, and several of them have served either in New Delhi or elsewhere in the sub-continent. During the past two years, an officer at Deputy Secretary level has spent much of his time on the development of our commercial relationship with India, and staffing at the High Commission in New Delhi has been increased. As well, the Department has an extensive range of contacts with the private sector, academic institutions and other government departments, and is thus the beneficiary of a wide range of views on India. Its dealings with these bodies, it is constantly engaged in testing its views against those of other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA>We would not wish to see this inhibited by formalising the arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.66</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also regards as unacceptable the practice whereby one government department seeks to publish a major document on a subject as important as foreign trade or foreign relations without first incorporating the information or assessments that all other key departments, or the relevant diplomatic missions overseas, might have to offer. The decision by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to publish its ``Trade and Commercial Development Program for Australia in India'' independently from and ahead of AUSTRADE's proposed ``Market Development Plan'' strikes the Committee as undesirable. The lack of regular access of AUSTRADE officials to briefing papers prepared in government departments is also a matter of concern to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The two reports referred to in the recommendation covered different areas of reference and had different objectives. Further, the report prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was cleared with AUSTRADE. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the emphatic policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to employ the most comprehensive research possible in the production of major documents, in full consultation with all relevant agencies. It is quite open with other agencies in its approach both generally and specifically. With regard to India, the Officials' Working Group provides an easy route to wide consultation. The Government is not aware that AUSTRADE has difficulty in gaining access to briefing material. If that had been the case, it is our expectation that this would have been raised either at the Officials' Working Group on India or taken up more formally. The Government expects a free exchange of relevant documents between all Government Departments and agencies. Indeed consultation between AUSTRADE officers and officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on India is active, and frequent. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.69</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee notes the statement in the ``Trade and Commercial Development Program for Australia in India'' that an appropriate Australian Overseas Information Service (AOIS) program will be developed as an integral part of Australia's overall strategy'. The Committee recommends that the relevant departments participate jointly in development of any AOIS plan for promotion of Australia in India. The Committee further recommends that AOIS activities in India be developed with the long term purpose of Supporting Australian exports and not be devoted to support of broader goals of propagandising to Indians the quality and unique features of the Australian way of life. The Committee does not believe that Australia can afford to devote its information resources in India to the imitation of the cultural export policies of more wealthy countries, such as the United States, France or Canada. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Australia Abroad Council, a body of 30 prominent Australians representing all relevant government agencies and the private sector, chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, has recently been established. The Council will operate as an instrument of public diplomacy. Its role will be to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on ways of projecting our interests overseas, with particular focus on the Asia-Pacific region. This will naturally include India. The Council has discretionary funds of $A1 million and a particular interest in education, science and technology and sport. The Council will coordinate, focus and further develop the international activities of those government and nongovernment agencies which help shape the projection of Australia overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TRADE</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.70, 6.71</PARA>
<PARA>6.70</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is strongly of the view that the main responsibility for development of export markets rests with the private sector. This view is based on the facts that the market-place decides and that business people are in the best position to respond to the market-place for their particular product. However, in the case of countries such as India, with a large public sector, the Australian Government has an important role as a facilitator. </PARA>
<PARA>6.71 Therefore, the Committee does see merit in the development by government agencies of marketing strategies built around the promotion of a wide range of particular sectors in India. At the same time, the Committee recommends that relevant departments, and AUSTRADE itself, could give more weight to sector specific strategies responsible to the global market-place in the development of country oriented strategies. The continued implementation over several years of a country specific plan in countries like India may not prove worthwhile in the longer term if the commercial prospects in the particular country for industries targeted in the country plan do not improve or even worsen. AUSTRADE has already made some progress in developing its sector export strategies, according to its 1988-89 Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government also believes that the main responsibility for the development of export markets lies with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRADE operational plans for individual markets have developed from the collective assessment of specific industry strategies based on market research by AUSTRADE overseas posts. These strategies are kept under constant review. The scope of these strategies has been considerably expanded since AUSTRADE appeared before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also makes an important contribution through its high level contact with Indian officials and others directed to establishing and maintaining a sound knowledge of the Indian economic system. </PARA>
<PARA>It also assesses the prospects for further liberalisation of the Indian market and the opportunities this may present for Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.73</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that the government function in support of trade must be based on maximum flexibility to respond to the specific demands of business as they arise in four specific areas especially: provision of commercial intelligence; liaison or dealing with state ministries or corporations in the host country on behalf of Australian commercial enterprises; export promotional activities; and provision of administrative support for Australian business people not yet acquainted with or established in the country concerned. The question of the long term desirability of government financial support for Australian exports through various rebate, loan or soft credit schemes is one which the Committee believes is worthy of thorough review. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRADE routinely provides business support to Australian commercial enterprises. Where resources permit, administrative support can be made available on a user pays basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also makes available information on relevant aspects of Indian economic policy through business and academic services and contact with exporters with an interest in India. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.75</PARA>
<PARA>One important function for AUSTRADE, and perhaps the ANZ Banking Group, in support of Australian exports to India may be active involvement in consortium development, especially in bringing together Indian investors, either state sector or private, and Australian businesses. AUSTRADE may well be the only Australian organisation, apart from the ANZ Banking Group, with sufficient exposure in India to set up long-term collaborations between Australian and Indian partners. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Following a successful collaboration with Grindlays in Africa, AUSTRADE is looking toward further collaborations and is interested in the proposal contained in the recommendation in relation to India. </PARA>
<PARA>DIPLOMACY</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.76, 6.77</PARA>
<PARA>6.76 Australia must recognise its own limitations in regard to its influence as a medium level power. Simply put, Australia must decide the relative priority it is to give to the fostering of Australian exports in comparison with the priority given to attempts to influence Indian thinking on its own security affairs. No other country will look to Australia's export performance in India but a number of far more influential countries, such as the United States and Great Britain, are already actively seeking to influence Indian economic and security politics in much the same directions as Australia. Australia must recognise the potential reactions it could generate by taking the moral high ground in relation to countries like India. </PARA>
<PARA>6.77 The Committee recommends that a large part of Australia's diplomatic effort in India be directed at encouraging the Indian Government to make faster progress towards relaxing trade and investment controls detrimental to Australian business. However, fundamentally important issues like Antarctica, chemical weapons, and nuclear proliferation should-in the Committee's view-still remain important in Australia's diplomatic priorities in India. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is interested in the Committee's comments but surprised at the separation of the two elements. It does not view them as divorced, and would instead argue that an enhanced trade and commercial profile tends to provide greater access in areas of political significance to Australia, such as regional security, Antarctica, and chemical weapons. Similarly, improved dialogue and understanding on the political side of the relationship helps to enhance the prospects for obtaining improved trade and commercial links. Our attempts to work towards a secure and stable region are likely to be assisted by the development and maintenance of as broad a range of positive links as possible. Further, it is the view of the Government that this recommendation does not sit comfortably with the thrust of the report which makes the point that, to enhance and develop the relationship, contacts must be made across a wide range of issues and mutual interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6.78, 6.79</PARA>
<PARA>6.78 The Committee recommends that in respect of countries such as India, which are not in Australia's area of primary strategic importance, the Australian Government should only develop a diplomatic position on their external policy or defence policy where there is a direct threat to our interests, such as that presented by nuclear proliferation, or a breach of international law. This would appear to be the practical implication of the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, in a speech on priorities in Australian foreign policy when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Priority in our foreign policy should be given to that which is not only important but achievable; . . . for a country of Australia's size and weight in world affairs . . . .it is not wise to have exaggerated ideas of influence beyond our station . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>6.79 The submission to the Committee by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was suitably modest in this respect. Nevertheless, at times the desire to lecture India on its economic and military policies appears to creep into Australian thinking. A tendency to blame the Indians for most problems in the relationship-in the absence of any real self-criticism of Australia's performance-is some indication of a disturbing sense of superiority adopted by some officials and other commentators who appeared before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government appreciates the recent historical factors that have helped to fashion India's perception of its strategic environment. Since Independence, India has fought a number of wars. It still has disputed borders and faces serious separatist and insurgency problems. We recognise that India must be able to protect its long coastline, its scattered island territories and its off-shore interests. India's strategic circumstances mean that it needs to maintain a certain level of military capability. </PARA>
<PARA>India is the major power in South Asia, and, although not of primary strategic importance to Australia, we share a common desire for peace and stability in the region. We readily acknowledge that while India's military build-up has enhanced its power projection capability in the South Asian region, this does not constitute a threat to the security of Australia or South East Asia. We would, however, emphasise the need for openness and dialogue to allay any regional concerns that may arise from time to time. The Government would encourage India in the efforts it has been making to ensure that regional countries have a full understanding of its reasons for increases or changes of pattern in its level of defence spending. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.80</PARA>
<PARA>For this reason, the Committee recommends that Australian groups or government officials seeking to influence Indian thinking on major policy issues, either in the commercial or security spheres, give more attention to the commissioning of in-depth studies which could support the Australian point of view by demonstrating to the Indian side what might be in it for them. If Australia cannot produce such studies, it is unlikely to get much more than a polite hearing. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Although it has not been the regular practice of the Government to undertake the commissioning of the type of indepth study described in the Report, it has produced considerable information, tenders, and specific information papers of this kind. Documentation produced in the lead-up to the Piparwar Coal Project is a good example. The Government expects that further such documentation will be produced as it is required. Nonetheless, we agree that it is important for Australia to be able to point to mutual interests in developing the commercial relationship, and that relevant documentation and reports should continue to focus on this commonality of interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6.81</PARA>
<PARA>Specifically, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government commission a study, either from its departments or private enterprise, on which it could base approaches to the Indian Government to correct one problem mentioned in Chapter Two of this report: the claimed artificially high shipping rates charged by the state owned shipping line on the west coast of India. Another subject worthy of some study by the Australian Government for discussion with the Indian authorities would appear to be the proposal of AUSTRADE for the establishment of a line of credit with a designated Indian agency for a particular industry, such as the fishing industry. The line of credit, held for example by a development bank in India, would be used to allow individual Indian clients who may not have sufficient resources or credit rating acceptable to a foreign seller to purchase the imported items-the presumption being that the process of recovery on default would be easier for Indian authorities than for Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Since the completion of the Committee's Report, the Indian state owned shipping line referred to in the recommendation has ceased to operate between Australia and India. Exporters use a combination of commercial ships for export, via Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of the proposed line of credit is still under discussion between AUSTRADE and the Indian authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I note that this is a very positive Government response to a very important and timely Senate report, and not before time in the Government's responding time in terms of a positive response from the Government. We have had a most unfortunate year, looking backwards on the last nine months in particular, in which the excellent growing relationship between Australia and India began with Prime Minister Rajid Ghandi's visit to this country in 1986 and continued right through until 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I include the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to India in February of 1989, the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in the middle of 1989 and a number of visits by other members of Parliament and me. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship was growing in a very positive way to the mutual benefit of Australia and India, when we had this disastrous decision that set it all back throughout 1990, that is, the Australian Government's inept and wrong decision to sell 50 Mirage aircraft to Pakistan at a time of tension pending the possibility of conflict between India and Pakistan. This has soured the relationship over the last nine months. It was, therefore, absolutely essential that the Government take this thorough Senate report very seriously and respond to its findings and recommendations which have been determined in a quite bipartisan way by eight senators concerning the Australia-India relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Our terms of reference related to trade, defence assessments and to the bilateral relationship generally. Today Minister Gareth Evans has incorporated the actual words of his response. Of course, the appendix to his statement, which is setting out, recommendation by recommendation, the Government's response to our findings in the Senate committee. I speak with two hats on: both as the Deputy Chairman of the Senate Committee that wrote the report and as a member of the Opposition keenly interested to see the best development of Australia-India relations and of Australia taking up all the opportunities that are now potentially to Australia's advantage especially and I think also to India's advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes that remain to me in this debate, given the time pressures of today, I wish to refer to some particular matters in the report, and I hope that I may be able to continue my remarks next session. The first paragraph of the response talks about the Government's great interest in the Senate report and its ready agreement with its thrust. It talks of the need to provide an impetus for the relationship and uses words that are entirely consonant with the Senate committee. The response talks about the relationship in measured and realistic terms and I must say-and I hope that this will be the last time that I have to chide the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade-that it is in great contrast to the Minister's remarks two months ago which were so paternalistic, emotional and overhyped in his attempt at self-defence for what was a very bad policy decision by the Government with regard to the Mirage aircraft going to Pakistan. But this report is careful, mature, and in the best traditions of a foreign ministry statement and a Foreign Minister's statement about any matter. I welcome the tone of the response and the carefulness with which it is expressed. The response contains the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>We are all familiar with the intention in the bilateral relationship which followed the Government's decision to sell its obsolescent Mirage aircraft to Pakistan. It is certainly our strong desire to avoid such setbacks in the future, and I am confident that the lessons learned from this episode, relating especially to the need for careful coordination, have not been lost on those concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome that statement. At long last we have put behind us the events of this year. We now look forward to learning from that experience so that there will be no repeat of anything of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> It happens that Australia Day, 26 January, is also the national day of India. Let us see that from the confluence of those national days next month that we have a positive relationship that is free of the difficulties of the past nine months. Given the important ministerial meeting in February or March, during which the Business Council of Australia will meet in India, one hopes that through this response and the Senate report we shall have the best foundation for those talks and all those that follow it to proceed in the most positive and effective way. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the Minister's acceptance of our recommendation that there be an Australia-India council. I know that it is his personal commitment along with that of the Senate Committee to see that established. It is up to budgetary circumstances to see that that is given precise effect. We urge the Government to support the Foreign Minister's acceptance of this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice in the response reference to the Centre for India Studies, and there is very positive acceptance of that recommendation in principle. There is also reference to the Asian Studies Council and to a subcommittee which has been commissioned to bring forward a national strategy document for the study of India. I was one of those who helped to form that set of recommendations and I know that what is said in the response is consistent with the Senate report in that regard. I look forward to seeing the Centre and the Council fully established. Finally, I congratulate all those in the Australian public who have shown a positive regard for the Australia-India relationship. I refer to academics, businessmen, and indeed even the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade itself in the way in which it has assisted the Minister in writing the response. It is a very happy day for all those who see the potential of this relationship. We certainly welcome this response. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ANNUAL STATEMENT ON THE AID PROGRAM 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</PARA>
<PARA>In its response, tabled on 20 December 1989, to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (JCFADT) Review of AIDAB and Australia's Overseas Aid Program, the Government agreed to make an annual Parliamentary statement on the aid program. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the first of these statements, which, broadly speaking, covers the aid program for the last twelve months. This statement complements, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information on the aid program to be found in the Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio Explanatory Notes (Budget Related Paper No. 6.8) and Budget Related Paper No. 4 on Australia's Overseas Aid Program. </PARA>
<PARA>An environment of change</PARA>
<PARA>The last twelve months have seen significant events and the emergence of new priorities, presenting challenges to the nature of Australian development cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps one of the most dramatic changes on the international scene has been the opening of Eastern Europe and renewed relationships between East and West. The rallying of donors to support the reconstruction of Eastern Europe has had implications not only for Australia's contribution, but for the relative priority and allocations of international ODA flows to countries in our Asia-Pacific region. There has emerged the prospect of new bilateral relationships with developments in Indochina and Afghanistan. In Indochina there is now the promise of a political resolution to the situation in Cambodia, while in Afghanistan, we witnessed the withdrawal of Soviet armed forces. Significant indications of reform appeared in South Africa, not least the highly symbolic release of imprisoned activist Nelson Mandela and legalisation of the African National Congress. Most recently we have seen the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the onset of the current Gulf crisis. International events include now the drawing to conclusion of the significant GATT Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, which has important implications for developing countries and donors alike. Also in recent years there has been a continuation of the trend of marked economic growth and development among the so called Newly Industrialising Countries in our neighbouring Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to changes in the global political framework, the international development cooperation agenda has thrown up a number of important issues to be addressed. While some of these are not new, they have at least emerged with new emphases. </PARA>
<PARA>Of major significance has been the increasing emphasis which donor countries are according the macro-policy settings within developing countries. Achieving a policy environment within developing countries conducive to maximising the effectiveness and sustainability of development activities may well become the focus of development cooperation in the l990s. Bilateral policy dialogue, or the discussion of macro-policy settings with recipient governments, is receiving recognition as the appropriate means to this end. </PARA>
<PARA>Foremost among specific issues influencing the international development assistance agenda has been the link between concern for the natural environment and sustainable development. In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development, chaired by G H Brundtland, issued its report entitled ``Our Common Future''. This report promoted the concept of sustainable development, meaning development for the satisfaction of the needs and aspirations of the present generation without compromising the ability to meet those in the future. Brundtland's report increased international debate on the role of development assistance in promoting sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA>Continuing world population growth, while a fundamental concern that has always received focus in international development assistance, is set to receive more emphasis in Australian development cooperation in future programs. This has stemmed in part from concern for the environment, with links being drawn between population pressures and global resource depletion. It has also been based on concern about the increasing number of people living in absolute poverty. This number has been estimated to stand now at about one billion people. This most pressing humanitarian problem is one to which Australia must respond. </PARA>
<PARA>Concern for equity in the aid program and about the lead time for impact of general development on particular target groups has also brought issues such as Women in Development to the fore in recent years. Other major subjects of current importance include the closer targeting of international assistance on the development of the private sector in recipient countries, and the response of aid to human rights, with particular concern centring on civil rights abuses. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian context</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian aid program has responded not only to the international agenda, but also to domestic developments. In recent years, pressure has been placed on the aid program with the restriction on resources in the face of difficult domestic economic circumstances. One of the major effects of this has been the imposition of stringency in the allocation of these resources, requiring sharper focusing of activities in pursuit of the aid program's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Against a challenging background, of both international and domestic developments, the Australian development cooperation program made significant progress on a number of important fronts. Some are highlighted below. While not an exhaustive coverage, it represents a cross section of key issues that have been addressed over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Aid Volume</PARA>
<PARA>The Government remains committed in the longer term to the UN target of an ODA/GNP ratio of 0.7 per cent, and to trying to raise this to at least 0.4 per cent in the shorter term. However, the need for overall budgetary restraint remains the dominant factor in setting the level of the aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1987-88, aid expenditure has been maintained at around the same real level. An exception was a one-off increase in 1988-89 to allow additional payments totalling close to $100 million to be made to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. (These payments had not been provided for in the Forward Estimates for 1989-90 and may not have been able to be funded by an additional appropriation in that year: a shortfall in total expected Government expenditure late in the 1988-90 financial year made it possible for the payments to be brought forward to that year, thus avoiding later difficulties.) In the 1990-91 Budget, aid expenditure was increased by 1.6 per cent in real terms, greater than the average increase in Commonwealth outlays.</PARA>
<PARA>The volume of Australian aid remains a high profile issue, signifying its importance among aid constituencies. Despite the achievements that the Government has made in maintaining aid expenditures in the face of difficult circumstances-and it should be acknowledged that the aid program has been well protected in comparison to some other areas of Government activity-the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, in particular, has been vocal in criticising these efforts. Recent criticism has centred on distortionary effects that the $100 million increase in payments to the Banks in 1988-89, and again in the current financial year, have had on year-to-year comparisons of aid volume. This has been disappointing, considering the information that the Government has shared with the aid lobby on the difficulties which the payments to the Banks, difficult to anticipate in their amount and timing, posed to Australian aid commitments. </PARA>
<PARA>Policy dialogue</PARA>
<PARA>Policy dialogue is the cooperative process by which development partners address the recipient country's policy framework. A country's policy framework forms the context for development investments and other assistance. The priority accorded to policy dialogue is in recognition of the fact that external resources can assist economic growth, poverty alleviation and broad development only if legal, regulatory and administrative policies are supportive. Policy dialogue can be undertaken bilaterally, or involve several parties including international financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Papua New Guinea program has been first in our efforts to develop a more sophisticated approach to bilateral policy dialogue. This is in recognition of the importance of PNG in the Australian aid program and the substantial flows of Australian aid resources to the country. It also recognises emerging concerns for getting the policy context right. This is a necessary condition not only for the effective utilisation of aid, but for the country's development overall. </PARA>
<PARA>As a base for policy dialogue, AIDAB has drawn on the regular economic analyses of PNG which it began in 1988. AIDAB has fed the results of this work into policy analysis and formulation, advice to Ministers and exchanges with the PNG Government. This investment has enabled a better understanding of how development programs fit in with wider economic strategies and also facilitated contributions by Australia to policy dialogue in the context of the World Bank Consultative Group on PNG. Importantly in the last twelve months, it allowed Australia to determine appropriate aid policy responses to the economic impact of the closure of the Bougainville mine and the recent sharp downturn in PNG's terms of trade. </PARA>
<PARA>PNG has embarked on a major program of stabilisation and structural adjustment, developed in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Australia's contribution included an additional $15 million in balance of payments support in 1989-90 and $3 million and $5 million in programmed activities in 1989-90 and 1990-91 respectively. Australia's coordinating with multilateral organisations in the structural adjustment program marked a major achievement against a key objective of Australia's development cooperation relationship with PNG, namely, to encourage the diversification of PNG's sources of external assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now planned to extend the work on the development of bilateral policy dialogue to the other major recipients of Australian assistance in the South Pacific. This is in keeping with the primary importance of the region to Australia. It is also timely, with many independent countries in this region now in a second decade of nationhood and facing new challenges. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1989-90 a World Bank economic review of the region was made possible under the special World Bank-AIDAB South Pacific Facility. The Australian-funded review was conducted by the World Bank for its Pacific member countries (except PNG): Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and Western Samoa. The aim was to examine development performance, assess economic prospects and address some of the major issues for development in the region. The review will hopefully provide a basis for better aid coordination and improved policy dialogue with the Pacific island countries. The review report was launched with much success in November 1990 at a World Bank seminar of island governments and key donors in Singapore. The meeting reached consensus on the appropriate domestic policies for an improved growth performance in the l990s and the need for more effective utilisation of ODA, including through improved aid coordination and greater policy dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA>New country programs</PARA>
<PARA>In March 1990, Australia welcomed the independence of Namibia and announced the commencement of a bilateral program of assistance. Australia made an initial commitment of up to $6 million over the three years 1990-91 to 1992-93, which will be drawn from the existing allocation for the Southern Africa program. The program will focus on food security, transport and communications, education and mining. The program is intended to support the stability of the changed political configuration in Southern Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>In New Caledonia, where Australia has been providing assistance to the Kanak people in recent years through nongovernment agency channels, the offer of twelve training awards in 1989-90 through the New Caledonian authorities marked a significant development in Australia's relationship with the territory. A further twelve awards have been offered this financial year, again for intensive English and vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister announced in early 1989 development cooperation programs for India and Pakistan, to commence in 1990-91. The programs will emphasise the building of mutually beneficial economic linkages through contributions to economic development. The India program is expected to amount to $35 million over a three year period. Despite some delays on both the Indian and Australian sides in reaching agreements on program priorities, substantial progress was made in the development of the program during 1989-90. The inaugural High Level Consultations between Australia and India were held in October 1990 at which Australia expressed the hope that delays would be overcome. Design of specific activities is continuing, with a focus on energy, mining, telecommunications, post-harvest food processing and railways assistance. The Pakistan program will total $15 million over the same period. Its sectoral focus will be in mining and mineral processing, telecommunications, post-harvest food processing and livestock development. </PARA>
<PARA>New directions in traditional programs</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the expansion of the development cooperation to the countries above, there were some significant new directions within existing country programs in 1989-90. These directions aimed at refocusing the impact of Australian assistance for the greater achievement of program objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>After difficulties in the Fiji program in the wake of the 1987 coups, the program was successfully consolidated in 1989-90. The current program, of an estimated $13.2 million in 1990-91, has been designed to ensure that it is of benefit to all communities in Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA>In Indonesia, a major new strategy of assistance for East Timor has been approved in principle. This follows the declaration by the Indonesian Government in January 1989 of East Timor as an open province, with status on par with other regions of Indonesia. The program aims to raise living standards and productivity in East Timor, building upon activities which have been successfully applied in other provinces in the Eastern Islands. These activities include water supply and sanitation programs and agricultural inputs in West Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>In the last fifteen months there has been progress in the political situation in South Africa, especially the lifting of the ban on key political movements and the release of Nelson Mandela. Australia has been active in encouraging the dismantling of apartheid. Complementing efforts on this front has been the provision of assistance to black South Africans in preparation for democracy in South Africa under the Special Assistance Program for South Africans. Supportive of these measures of assistance has also been the three year $100 million program of aid to Southern Africa which was pledged by the Australian Government in 1987. The successful completion of this landmark program was achieved in July 1990, delivering assistance to the (then) nine member states of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference (SADCC): Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. (SADCC now includes Namibia.) The program had also included assistance for the SADCC organisation itself. In May 1990, the Australian Government committed further assistance over the three years to 1992-93 for humanitarian and educational activities aimed at overcoming the impacts of apartheid. Assistance is expected to be close to $17 million in total, including $15 million allocated to activities identified in consultation with the African National Congress. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1989-90, Australia reactivated a program of development cooperation with Malaysia. This was precipitated by the decision taken in December 1988 to phase out the program under which private students from developing countries were subsidised a proportion of the cost of their education in Australia. More than half the number of students under the previous program came from Malaysia. This made the student subsidy virtually the sole source of Australian aid to that country. The new Malaysia program focuses on scholarships as well as activities in nuclear-based medical technology, narcotics control, energy and other infrastructure development. It establishes a relationship of cooperation with the Malaysian Government which reflects the country's level of development. </PARA>
<PARA>1989-90 was the first year of the Treaty on Development Cooperation signed between Australia and Papua New Guinea in May 1989. The Treaty established the principles, levels and forms of aid for the period 1989-90 to 1993-94. A central tenet is the scaling down of budget support in favour of increased project assistance. Consistent with its policy of achieving fiscal self-reliance, the PNG Government wishes to speed up this move away from budget support and discussions will soon begin towards this end. </PARA>
<PARA>The significant events in the program to PNG encompassed also an efficiency audit by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). The report of the audit, tabled in November 1990, recommended that AIDAB seek to influence the direction of aid provided as untied budget support. This was in view of the conclusion that PNG's development had been disappointing, despite the very large volume of assistance provided by Australia since PNG's independence. The report made additional recommendations to improve the delivery and management of project aid under the PNG program. While AIDAB generally agreed with the findings of the efficiency audit report, it considers that its assessment of Australia's aid performance does not adequately recognise the serious constraints to PNG's development. AIDAB believes that ANAO's correlation between the provision of budget support and PNG's poor social and economic indicators does not give due regard to the wider political and strategic considerations that influence Australia's aid policy. Nonetheless, the ANAO efficiency audit makes a timely and important contribution to public scrutiny and awareness of AIDAB's performance in carrying out the official development cooperation program with PNG. Its recommendations lend support to the two important directions of increasing policy dialogue and phasing out budget support operating within the program. </PARA>
<PARA>There were, of course, difficulties to be overcome in the delivery of some of Australia's aid commitments to various countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Due to political and social disturbances in Burma, Australian aid to that country was severely curtailed. Currently, Australia's only contribution to Burma is through the support of students who are completing their-studies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the events of June 1989, development cooperation activities with China in 1990-91 will only include those commenced or in the pipeline before 13 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>In early 1989, the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands wrote to donor countries, calling a halt to all programs of external assistance. Solomon Islands' objective had been to take stock of aid flows and review its development priorities. This was a significant interruption in the delivery of Australia's program to Solomon Islands. Resolution of the problems in late 1989 allowed the successful resumption of the program. </PARA>
<PARA>A new aid scholarship scheme</PARA>
<PARA>The new Equity and Merit Scholarship Scheme (EMSS), introduced in 1990, broke new ground in education assistance. For the first time, private citizens from developing countries were able to apply directly for Australian Government Scholarships. EMSS was an outcome of the 1988 review of Australia's overseas student policy, replacing in the aid program the previous subsidised scheme for private overseas students. It represents a significant heightening of the effectiveness of training assistance in the development cooperation program. </PARA>
<PARA>EMSS involves two streams of scholarships: equity scholarships for students of academic ability but of economically or socially disadvantaged circumstances, and merit scholarships for students of exceptional academic merit. Students from twenty four countries, predominantly in the Asia-Pacific region, participated in the first intake under EMSS in 1990, with 910 students commencing study in Australia under the scheme. The number of students under EMSS is expected to rise to around 2500 by 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>Environmental concerns and sustainable development</PARA>
<PARA>Environmental concerns have gained momentum on both international and domestic fronts. In Australia, the Prime Minister's major policy statement on the environment in 1989 included a statement on Australia's role in achieving sustainable development through the development cooperation program. </PARA>
<PARA>The main objectives formulated for the aid program in regard to sustainable development are to:</PARA>
<PARA>. ensure that ODA commitments by other Government departments to international environmental initiatives take full account of development priorities and objectives</PARA>
<PARA>. help develop a network of relationships, particularly among the countries of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, to facilitate their involvement in environmental activity</PARA>
<PARA>. assist in promoting Australia as a centre of environmental expertise and marketable technology.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's statement also announced a $20 million Environmental Assistance Program to be implemented over four years, commencing in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1990, the Government issued its response to the Report on Environmental Impact of Development Assistance by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. The Government undertook to ensure that the principles of sustainable development infuse the programming approach to aid delivery. The central approach adopted was to build a portfolio of development assistance activities and projects that are environmentally sound and contribute to sustainable development. In addition, environment-specific projects or programs will be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA>Poverty alleviation</PARA>
<PARA>AIDAB addressed the issue of poverty alleviation in 1989 and 1990 with a paper of policy and programming issues within the program. The primary purpose of the first draft of the paper was to stimulate discussion in the Australian community on poverty in developing countries, on how the Australian aid program tackles poverty, and how this contribution could be enhanced. The paper was provided to participants attending the 1990 World Development Debate, held in Canberra in August 1990. Discussion of these issues at the Debate led to a number of suggestions for change. Work continues in this area to follow up the comments received from the World Development Debate and written submissions from interest groups, and further to investigate program options for the incorporation of poverty alleviation concerns in the aid program. </PARA>
<PARA>Rapid growth in the Development Imports Finance Facility</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's mixed credits scheme, the Development Imports Finance Facility (DIFF), has expanded rapidly in recent years. In 1989-90, the scheme was reviewed. Among the major outcomes was the application of a ceiling on DIFF expenditure of $100m (in 1990-91 prices). The maximum size of a DIFF grant was reduced to $75m. This ruled out the so-called ``mega-DIFF'' proposals altogether, except for proposals then on hand. Changes were also made to DIFF guidelines to improve the assessment of the developmental worth of DIFF projects and create greater equity in its distribution among Australia's aid recipient countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Cooperation with the Asian Development Bank</PARA>
<PARA>In August 1990, a cooperation agreement was signed between Australia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This agreement formalises arrangements for cofinancing of development activities between Australia and the ADB and canvasses possible arrangements for a South Pacific Special Fund to be set up by the ADB. The agreement will assist Australia to build the same effective cooperative relationship which we have been able to build in recent years with the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased payments to international financial institutions</PARA>
<PARA>Over the last few years, contributions to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have increased significantly. The increases have resulted mainly from a reduction in the period of the draw-down of commitments made to the Banks. The result has been considerable pressure on the global aid budget and an upward trend in the share of the program delivered through multilateral, rather than bilateral, channels. Bilateral programs now account for 58 per cent of the program, compared with 68 per cent five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1990-91, payments to the Banks increased by around $100 million. While the Government provided an additional $30.7 million on top of the 1990-91 forward estimates for the aid program, a net shortfall of $70 million has had to be absorbed by cuts to other program components. As an example, the new Mekong Bridge to be built between Thailand and Laos has reduced the scope for new Australian development activities in both of those countries. The demands of payments to the Banks will continue to grow over the next three years, placing pressure on other parts of the program. </PARA>
<PARA>Emergencies and refugees</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989-90, AIDAB successfully completed a review of the role of rehabilitation assistance in Australia's emergency and refugees programs. New policy and accompanying guidelines were developed to enable the funding of activities which fall between (short term) emergency disaster relief and (longer term) development assistance funded through country programs. Such activities might include, for example, the provision of simple agricultural packs containing seeds and basic tools through to literacy and vocational training programs. This type of assistance goes further to meet the needs of those affected by short term or chronic emergencies, building on the very short term life-sustaining relief provided in immediate response. </PARA>
<PARA>Changing relationships with non-government organisations</PARA>
<PARA>The role of non-government organisations (NGOs) in the official aid program has continued to grow and diversify over the last twelve months. A major review of AIDAB's relationship with NGOs was completed in 1989-90. Among the key outcomes of the review was the introduction of funding of eligible agencies on a program rather than project basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The review has also introduced improved quality control through evaluation of NGO activities, which will feed into funding and other decisions on cooperation. The first of these has begun with a review of Australian assistance to Cambodia. This review will be important in planning any more comprehensive assistance to Cambodia in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Significantly, the review was instrumental in extending the opportunity for NGO involvement in the aid program. NGO projects are increasingly being incorporated into country programs. The volume of Australian ODA supplied through Australian NGOs totalled $50 million in 1989-90, representing a significant increase over a total of $34 million in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>Issues Raised in the Commonwealth Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>An important influence on the Australian development cooperation from the Australian side has been that of the Commonwealth Parliament in bringing to the fore issues which reach into the aid program. A number of these matters have already been mentioned above, but it is worth emphasising how significant the interaction between Government and Parliament on aid issues has been. </PARA>
<PARA>Throughout 1989 and 1990, several enquiries of Parliamentary Committees involved the Australian aid program. The most important of these was the JCFADT Review of AIDAB and Australia's Overseas Aid Program, the Government response to which was issued in December 1989. The Government accepted recommendations of the Committee in the areas of improving the efficiency in the use of staff resources, reporting and institutional arrangements, community involvement and accountability relevant to AIDAB and the aid program. The JCFADT report was also significant in raising issues of aid volume and the role of aid vis-a-vis human rights in recipient countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Other enquiries relevant to the aid program covered the environmental impact of development assistance, Third World debt, Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and with India. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1990, the Government's response to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts report on the environmental impact of development assistance was issued. This enquiry was timely in the context of international concerns for the environment. It marked the heightening of the concept of sustainable development within the Australian aid program. The Government undertook to ensure that the principles of sustainable development infused Australia's approach to aid delivery. Towards this end, a central approach of building a portfolio of development assistance activities that are environmentally sound was endorsed. In addition, the aid program was to allocate resources to the development of environmentspecific projects. This two-pronged approach is in keeping with international moves on the environment. Additionally, the Government undertook, in regard to multilateral organisations, to continue to support programs that promote development through environmentally sound means. Environmental issues cut across many sectors and interests in Australia. The Government response to the Senate committee's report highlighted the consultative processes between AIDAB and other agencies. AIDAB has also been successful in recruiting new staff to increase its base of environmental expertise in order to follow through the incorporation of sustainable development into the program. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last twelve months AIDAB made substantive submissions to two JCFADT reviews, on Third World Debt and Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. The AIDAB submission to the debt enquiry argued that while the countries most affected by external debt problems lie in regions outside Australia's focus (namely, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa), the debt crisis is relevant to Australian foreign and aid policy. Levels of debt are increasing in the Asia-Pacific region. Our relationships with international financial institutions necessarily involve Australia in the formulation of policy on the debt crisis. In this way, debt remains an issue of concern within the Australian aid program. </PARA>
<PARA>AIDAB's submission on PNG described the way in which the Australian program of development cooperation with PNG reflects the political, strategic and economic significance of our bilateral relationship, as well as the humanitarian concerns of the Australian community. It also notes that PNG's short term needs are to increase its absorptive capacity for external assistance, with the expansion of sources of aid, establishing the foundations for more broad-based growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>The past year has been a period of strenuous challenge and difficult choices. A stringent budgetary situation, together with obligations to the international financial institutions, have brought about a significant change in the multilateral and bilateral balance of the program. At the same time, Australia has responded to political and economic developments with the introduction of new country programs. These have placed even greater strain on ongoing programs. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, greater attention has been paid to global issues, such as the environment, and policies which affect the quality of development assistance. The incorporation of these new concerns has seen a definite heightening of the quality of Australian development cooperation over the last twelve months. These trends are set to continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. It was reported in yesterday's newspapers that the recently appointed Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, has resigned after less than six months in the job and is reported to be leaving within the week. This resignation follows last week's announcement of the resignation of the Managing Director of the Australian Trade Commission, Mr Lindsay MacAlister, as well as the departures of Deputy Secretary Alan Godfrey and First Assistant Secretary Rob Palfreyman. Can the Minister inform the Senate who is actually left in his Department and, given the low-key appointment of Mr Neville Stevens yesterday as Secretary, when the two Deputy Secretary positions will be filled? Finally, will the Minister tell us whether there are any other senior resignations from his portfolio in the pipeline, including his own?</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Bishop, as I said, has this capacity to string together a whole lot of irrelevancies and turn them into a conspiracy. It is true that Dr McIntosh, the Secretary to my Department, resigned. He did so to take up a position which I think is best described as chief procurement officer for the British Department of Defence. It was known publicly and certainly to me a few weeks ago that there was speculation about that position. Dr McIntosh had discussed it with me at the time he became Secretary, but at that stage it was not considered that there would be any firm offer from the British.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the Government's reaction to the devastating news of the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="6328" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Shevardnadze's resignation last night at the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies was disconcerting, perhaps even devastating news, as Senator McKiernan said, both for governments around the world and apparently no less for Mr Shevardnadze's colleagues in the Soviet leadership. May I say at the outset that I feel a keen sense of personal disappointment at the news of Mr Shevardnadze's departure. I had occasion to have a number of quite substantial meetings with him over the last two years, both in the context of the United Nations and the Cambodia peace process. I, like everybody else who came to know him, found him making an extraordinary impression as an outstandingly intelligent open-minded statesman and, at the same time, someone with an enormously engaging personal charm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Should Mr Shevardnadze's decision prove final, and there does appear to be only a very slim chance that it will not be, it will mean the loss from the Soviet leadership of a man who has made a very decisive contribution to forging the new cooperative East-West relationship and, indeed, a whole new global climate. In particular, he played a key role in Soviet policies which have seen the ending of Cold War confrontation in Europe, the conclusion of major arms control agreements, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and, most recently, the Soviet Union's support for the international condemnation of and opposition to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> We should also recall in bilateral terms that Mr Shevardnadze was in 1987 the first Soviet Foreign Minister to visit Australia; a visit that did give great momentum to developing a more constructive and fruitful bilateral relationship with us. It should also be acknowledged what a huge contribution Mr Shevardnadze has made domestically as a key supporter of the implementation of perestroika and democratisation, and in giving very strong personal and political support to President Gorbachev.</PARA>
<PARA> What are the implications of his resignation? So far as foreign policy is concerned, the early indications appear to be that Mr Shevardnadze's resignation does not signal any significant departure from the foreign policy line that President Gorbachev and he have pursued in recent years. President Gorbachev has given some very explicit assurances that this will be the case and there is no reason to doubt his sincerity in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> The question does, however, arise about President Gorbachev's capacity to continue to impose his will in the domestic political situation that is now unfolding. It is in respect of the domestic implications of the Shevardnadze resignation that there is, I think, occasion for some more immediate worry. Mr Shevardnadze described his resignation as a protest against the advance of dictatorship in the Soviet Union; a reference to the resurgence in recent weeks of conservative or, as Mr Shevardnadze described them, reactionary forces which are calling for decisive measures to restore order and to rein in the Soviet nationalities pushing for greater autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA> It is simply too early to make firm judgments about what precise impact domestically Mr Shevardnadze's resignation will have. The optimistic view is that it could act as a warning shot to galvanise the reformers. There does seem to have been at least partly an attempt by Mr Shevardnadze to do just that, by the style, forcefulness and the nature of his resignation speech. More pessimistically it could, on the other hand, signal the loss of a key reformer reflecting in this respect that conservative groups, which were seeking to pull back some of the hard won reforms of perestroika, may be gaining the ascendancy. We will just have to wait and see how this works out.</PARA>
<PARA> May I say, finally, that the Australian Government has welcomed the direction, obviously, of the political and economic reforms initiated under President Gorbachev which have been intimately bound up with the forging of a new cooperative relationship with the West. We hope that the strengthening of democratic processes in the Soviet Union, taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the various people inhabiting the Soviet Union, will continue. The Soviet leadership is facing enormous economic and political difficulties. While we understand the desire to ensure stability and order, we fervently hope that that will not be pursued at the expense of the progress that has been achieved in recent years, in creating a more open society with a much greater respect for human rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence-it seems to me to be an appropriate question to ask on the day when the Minister and Senator Durack have been joining in the welcome of the Navy frigates HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Darwin in Sydney. Is the Minister aware of reports that sailors on the ship, HMAS Brisbane, which is currently serving in the Gulf, have not received any mail since they left Australia in early November?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I apologise for not being here at the immediate start of Question Time. I am aware of some concern about delays in the mail being received by sailors in the Gulf. I understand that Senator BjelkePetersen has received constituent inquiries about this. However, that part of the honourable senator's question which suggests that no mail has been received by Brisbane is not correct. After some initial problems some months ago concerning, amongst other things, Customs examination of mail in transit through other nations, a generally smooth flow of mail both ways has now been established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As of yesterday, this was the situation: of 615 mail dispatches to the ships Success, Sydney and Brisbane and to the task group's medical and logistic elements, 550 dispatches have been received. Sixty-five dispatches are still in transit. Of some 85 mail dispatches from the task group back to Australia, 79 have already arrived. However, Senator Bjelke- Petersen is quite right to identify concerns about mail to HMAS Brisbane. It did suffer some bad luck. Some five bags of mail dispatched to catch the ship at Diego Garcia unfortunately arrived after that ship's departure. But at the same time I should emphasise that three-quarters of all dispatches to the Brisbane have been successfully received. Together with more recent mail sent to the Middle East, I am advised that the backlog will be cleared before Christmas-if it has not already been cleared.</PARA>
<PARA> The Navy places great importance on getting mail to sailors quickly and regularly. Mail from Australia is obviously important for morale; likewise, mail from the ships is naturally important to family and friends back here. The transmission of mail is a very public test of efficient organisation by the Navy and it does take the task very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the honourable senator's interest and I can assure her that the Government shares her concern that our military personnel serving Australia far away from home should receive the highest priority for their Christmas mail from their families and friends. I would also like to thank OTC Ltd which has made available for every sailor in the Gulf a phone call home for Christmas. I should acknowledge the role of OTC in that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That of course may be seen to be unrepresentative in terms of no sport having been played yesterday, as Senator Tate has just said. But if one was to look at Monday's press, after a full weekend of sport there is very little difference in terms of the statistics. The Herald Sun had three articles out of 41. In fact, a major achievement was attained by Australian women in sport on the weekend but even that was ignored by most of the press. Only one of the articles I could find reported that Australian sporting achievement-that world-rated weight- lifter, Debbie Smith, had set five new Australian records on one night, despite an injury. The article was notable, on the one hand, because it was accompanied by a photograph but, on the other hand, it was buried deep in the sports pages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To compare this with the coverage of male sport, all one has to do is look at the fact that Merv Hughes gets full back page coverage on all sporting pages across the nation by having his hair cut.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume said, the Government as well. The second part of Senator Crowley's question does in fact go to the Government's position on this matter. As Senator Crowley would note from her involvement and interest in this area, the Government is concerned about such discrimination. We have, amongst other things, a number of measures in place to counteract this sort of discrimination. As honourable senators would know, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has received many detailed submissions concerning the disparity of funding and prize money for women's sport compared with men's sport. As part of its inquiry it will be conducting a seminar in association with the Australian Sports Commission on 27 and 28 February 1991 to look at the whole issue in detail. Quentin Bryce, the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Commissioner, has been invited to advise the Committee on the potential which exists under the Sex Discrimination Act or other legislation to remove barriers to equal opportunity in sport.</PARA></TALK.START>

Noting the absence of any provision for equity of access to training under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act and the lack of provision for prosecutions under the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act, I ask the Minister: firstly, is it a fact that equity measures were rejected because of the perceived negative attitude of employers towards affirmative action? If this was not the case, why were such measures rejected? Secondly, how does the Minister intend to ensure equity in training programs for all employees-including low-skilled workers, women and disadvantaged groups? Thirdly, given that women comprise 42 per cent of the work force, only 12 per cent of senior managers and yet are the fastest growing section of our work force, how does the Minister intend to ensure that male-dominated companies will offer women courses or skills designed to advance their career paths?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Powell for her question. I do have some notes in respect of the issues raised by Senator Powell. The Minister advises me that it was not considered appropriate, at the commencement of the training guarantee, to add to the legislative requirements already being placed on employers by including references to equity of access to training for women or any other group. In Mr Dawkins's second reading speech on the Training Guarantee Act, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government is also concerned that low-skilled workers, women and disadvantaged labour market groups have access to training. While it has decided not to include specific training targets for such groups, it will be monitoring industry training behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the Government's intention to ensure that the provision of all training by employers, not just training offered under the training guarantee, is monitored to determine whether women are receiving an equitable share. We have already undertaken to review the training guarantee within four years. If it appears that women are not receiving appropriate access to training, the Minister assures me that he will take action.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell also referred to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1990 survey of employer training expenditure and the fact that that did not include a gender breakdown. I am informed that this was done to minimise the burden on employers, who generally do not keep records of training by gender. However, I am also informed that the ABS has conducted another very detailed survey on training received by women and other groups in the work force. The results of this survey entitled `How workers get their training' became available in July this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the Government's response to recent developments in South Africa, including the recent African National Congress (ANC) and public statements by the South African State President, Mr de Klerk? As a result, will there be any changes to the Government's sanctions policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that we continue to acknowledge that much has been done already and even more has been promised by the South African Government since President de Klerk made his path-breaking statement last February about a new era opening up in South Africa. We have seen, particularly over the last year, the unbanning of the ANC and other political movements, the release of key political prisoners, the return of a number of exiles, the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act and the commencement of talks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, in the context of examining the questions about the maintenance of sanctions pressure, it has to be appreciated just how much more remains to be done, quite apart from changing the Constitution itself, before one can really say that the process of change is genuinely irreversible. All but a handful of political prisoners still remain in gaol. The return of exiles has really only just begun. Violence in the townships, as we all unhappily know, continues unabated, while the evidence of security force complicity in that violence tends to mount. The promised review of security legislation has yet to bear fruit and the right of peaceful protest remains severely restricted. It is also the case that the most significant elements of apartheid legislation-the Lands Acts, the Group Areas Act, the Population Registration Act, not to mention again the Constitution itself-do remain on the books, although President de Klerk has undertaken to seek the repeal of the Lands Acts and the Group Areas Act when the Parliament resumes in February.</PARA>
<PARA> Significant further movement by the South African Government on these key issues-removing the remaining so-called obstacles to negotiations and making some further major progress on legislative change-will be very important in determining the question as to whether actual change, as distinct from intentions, has become irreversible.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as Australian policy is concerned, as the Prime Minister and I have constantly said, Australia is not looking to sustain our sanctions any longer than is necessary. It is important to maintain sanctions pressure as long as it is productive to do so. But as the reform momentum accelerates, we will be prepared to consider their phased relaxation. In this respect it is certainly possible to contemplate early movement on the question of academic and cultural boycotts. It is also possible to contemplate in this context movement on the sports boycott, at least in those sports which have achieved unified non-racial structures.</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing our position on sanctions we will continue to take into account both developments on the ground in South Africa and the views of others with whom we have been consulting closely. So far as developments on the ground are concerned we note with some interest that Dr Hewson, in his widely publicised call in the press this morning for lifting sporting sanctions, links this quite specifically to the repeal of the particular apartheid legislation that I mentioned. We also note in this respect that while the European Community has of course now lifted its voluntary ban on new investment in South Africa, it is also waiting for legislative action before implementing any further change in sanctions policy.</PARA>

So far as the views of others are concerned we will continue to give great weight to the views of the Commonwealth countries with whom we have been working in the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa, which is scheduled to meet again early next year, and we will continue to give great weight to the view of black South Africans, especially as expressed through the most representative black organisation, the ANC.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The final point of substance is this: it is also important, as well as closely monitoring the situation in this way, that we continue to step up our political as well as diplomatic contact with both sides of the South African political equation.

I am hoping to make some further substantial contact with the ANC while I am overseas in January to get a full evaluation of its present position in the light of the events of the recent national congress.

That was assented to by this Parliament some time ago. But it seems appropriate that any one living in this country who may have committed a war crime-against whom an allegation exists-should be capable of being subject to the law of Australia. The Geneva Conventions Act is not sufficient on its own to pick up all of the people who might be so accused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The War Crimes Amendment Act 1988, which was passed by this Parliament, was very limited in its scope, applying only to particular war crimes in a particular theatre between particular years.

This amendment Bill proposes that any person, anywhere, at any time who has committed any war crime should be subject to the provisions of the War Crimes Amendment Act.</PARA>

As a political party, we draw our advice, our views and our policies from a far wider region than do those opposite. The basic modus operandi of the Liberal Party of Australia is to elect a leader every couple of years and to give that leader a form of papal infallibility. The rest of the Opposition members toady and grovel to that leader so that they can get their shadow Cabinet positions, or not. The successful applicants are sitting on the front bench; the unsuccessful ones are sitting behind them. Arthur Calwell once said that the only two places where people do not have arguments or disagreements in this world-and this is no longer true-are in the cemetery and in the Liberal Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is it a fact that the wage-tax trade-off agreed by the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions provides for tax cuts which, with the tax cuts proposed in the 1990-91 Budget, come into effect on 1 January? Can the Minister advise the Senate what the wage equivalent increase will be from 1 January to persons on average weekly earnings?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="6336" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in 10 days' time the Australian Government will cut taxes for all income earners in Australia. They will benefit by receiving that tax cut. It means that their household disposable income will increase or-to put it another way-pay packets will get fatter without imposing any costs on employers. It will be of benefit on both sides of the fence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two elements to the tax cuts. The first is that a substantial tax cut was announced in the Budget this year. Then, of course, about four weeks ago we announced a wage-tax trade-off which added to the amount of tax cut that is being provided.</PARA>
<PARA> I am asked in the question to provide some illustration of the advantages the tax cuts will offer at average weekly earnings. A person on average weekly earnings would be on an annual income of $24,756. That person will receive a tax cut of $9.80. The wage equivalent of that-the wage that an employer would have had to pay had he paid a wage to that real purchasing power value-would have been $18.40. It amounts to a 3.5 per cent increase. A person on a full adult average weekly earnings with two children-according to annual income figures-would be on $30,012. The value of that person's tax cut is $12.20. The wage equivalent of that would have been $20.10. That is, again, equal to a 3.5 per cent increase in wages. As we can see, the tax cuts are of substantial benefit to people on ordinary incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the wage-tax trade-off, there is effectively for central wage fixing in Australia a 12-months wages pause. It means as well that aggregate wage outcomes for the year are down from 7 per cent to 6.25 per cent; that we are likely to undershoot our inflation target of 6 per cent; that we have in place an inflation circuit-breaker; and that living standards are being maintained while purchasing power is being increased.</PARA>
<PARA> This stands in stark contrast to the stated policy of the Opposition to introduce a consumption tax. According to the figures I have, a consumption tax of 15 per cent would impose an extra $12.2 billion tax surcharge on ordinary Australians without any indication of what compensatory mechanisms there might be.</PARA>
<PARA> We are, in fact, lowering the tax take. The Opposition, by contrast, has a policy which is very cloudy but the effect of which is to fuel inflation, push inflation rates right up and impose a higher tax on ordinary Australians.</PARA>

<PARA>What tangible support has the Minister's Department given to these Australian developed waste management technologies? If Australia has already shown itself capable of developing innovative and globally needed technology in this important area, is a foreign dominated multifunction polis (MFP) really necessary to further these sorts of developments? Is it not very likely that the imposition of an MFP will see these and other technologies taken offshore by foreign, rather than Australian, companies? Finally, would it not be wiser to spend the $2.6 billion marked for Government spending on MFP infrastructure on properly and more comprehensively supporting the proven cleverness of indigenous Australians?</PARA>

I do not have any answer because of the notice which Senator Coulter did not give me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to part one of the question, we have established a generic technology committee through the Grants Committee of the Industry Research and Development Board and declared waste management a generic technology. We have conducted a number of seminars with various companies and researchers in relation to these issues. It is, of course, an embryonic industry in Australia but there are some very good companies involved.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important, in dealing with the second part of the question, to make the point that this whole industry is a growing one around the world. The multifunction polis is not necessary in order to develop these industries, but it could be a very useful vehicle as environmental management issues have been seen as a key feature of the MFP and have been discussed with other governments as a potential area of Australian strength.</PARA>
<PARA> Is it likely that these technologies will be taken offshore? I hope so-but in the hands of Australian companies. Certainly, I think it would be sensible if they were taken offshore by Australian companies in collaboration with overseas companies, because that is the best way to do business in the international marketplace. With regard to the reference to $2.6 billion marked for government spending on MFP infrastructure, there is no such sum marked for government expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It was; it is Christmas. The situation is that they are capable of causing considerable difficulty, militarily and politically, in the environment as it presently exists in Cambodia. Although they have not hitherto been able to sustain more than hit and run guerilla attacks and have not had the capacity to seize and hold large tracts of territory or particular provincial towns; nonetheless, there is cause for concern in the longer run about an increase in Khmer influence-perhaps even ultimately a Khmer Rouge takeover of the country-particularly if there were to be an accompanying collapse of morale, discipline or order of administration, in Phnom Penh. Those two factors have to happen together and in a number of statements that I have made, I have indicated the complex balancing between those considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I have said about the marginal influence of the Khmer Rouge is simply this: if China can be persuaded-as seems certain in the context of a comprehensive settlement being reached but which is not at all clear and, in fact, is extremely unlikely if a comprehensive settlement strategy cannot be reached-to withdraw its support from the Khmer Rouge and withdraw from the situation on the ground then there is every prospect, and I say this with complete confidence, that the Khmer Rouge will be reduced to the status of a marginal isolated player. This will not happen immediately because they have got access to significant arms caches which will probably keep them going and making a considerable nuisance of themselves, as I have said, for another two or three years, but, in the longer run, there is a very strong intelligence basis for the assessment that they will be reduced to marginal status if that external arms supply source dries up. It is that combination of factors which explains the various quotes. If they are read in full in context, they are all entirely consistent with each other.</PARA>
<PARA> May I make the point just once more that I am perfectly happy to debate the pros and cons, the virtues, the difficulties, of the United Nations (UN) peace plan we have crafted and which is now accepted by the United Nations and, in effect, by all the relevant players. I am perfectly prepared to consider viable alternatives to that if there is any other way of achieving peace-an end to the civil war and the removal of the awful spectre of a resumption of Khmer Rouge authority. But I have to say that, for whatever reason, the Opposition has not, nor has anyone else, produced a credible alternative plan which will have the result, in particular, of taking all the external players, and in particular China, out of the situation. The substance of my very carefully expressed statement in this place on 6 December was just that.</PARA>
<PARA> We fear very much that any solution other than the UN comprehensive plan approach will be a recipe for civil war and endless ongoing disaster in Cambodia. That is why we believe that instead of being distracted by will-o'-the-wisps and bits and pieces of other ideas that the Opposition might have from time to time, it should focus its attention and support behind that comprehensive plan and help us achieve it and put it in place internationally-the state of affairs in Cambodia at this time is very delicately poised-instead of going on in the way it continues to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that the Committee on Violence was set up by the Prime Minister and Premiers as a result of the Hoddle and Queen Street massacres to try to find what were the cultural reasons underlying the prevalence of violence in Australian society. As a result that distinguished committee made several recommendations, most of which have certainly been accepted very readily by the Commonwealth Government. As to the immediate cause of the inquiry-those terrible massacres in Hoddle and Queen Streets-the question of gun control was looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the recommendations of the Committee was that semi-automatic quasi-military style weapons ought to be banned-ought not be allowed to be imported to Australia-and regulations to give effect to that particular recommendation were brought into effect yesterday. But, as to the more fundamental underlying causes of violence in our society, the most horrifying statistic in that particular report was that when one looked at the age groups most vulnerable to homicide in Australia, it was not the young thugs and hoons between 18 and 22 who might be involved in some sort of criminal violence or brawls or whatever; it was not the fragile elderly who might be hit over the head by an intruder; far and away, the age group most vulnerable to homicide in Australia are those between zero and one year of age-by far.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the household-the home that ought to be the haven and refuge from violence in our society-is for many Australians the place where they experience and learn about violence and, therefore, the Federal Government's major response to this report has instituted parent skills training centres. Four pilot schemes were established yesterday around Australia. I believe that we should try to get to those vulnerable families and help them with their parenting skills, particularly where an abused child becomes a parent and, therefore, is in danger of abusing his or her children, as it is shown that this violence goes on generation after generation. Where people do not have a particular role model that they can draw on we believe that this scheme of helping in these parenting skills projects will be a helpful contribution to changing the culture of violence in our society.</PARA>
<PARA> There are many other recommendations of the Committee which commend themselves to the Federal Government. I believe they also commend themselves to State and other organisations, including community and voluntary organisations.

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. As previously announced, any company which is not able to pay on time should contact the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) so that the Office can determine whether to extend the time for payment or to allow the company to pay by instalments.</PARA>
<PARA> A company approaching the ATO for an extension will have to satisfy the Commissioner that it is appropriate for him to exercise his discretion under Section 206 of the Act to grant such extension of time ``as he considers the circumstances warrant''.</PARA>
<PARA> The Act also provides a discretion to the Commissioner to remit the penalty imposed by the Act for late payment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner has set out guidelines for the exercise of those discretions in Income Tax Rulings IT 2569 and 2570.</PARA>
<PARA> Those rulings make it clear that the guidelines are provided to assist the exercise of the discretion, and are not taken as in any way restricting the exercise of the discretion.</PARA>
<PARA> Discretions, by their very nature, must be exercised according to the facts of each case and the judgements of the person exercising the discretion.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the rulings provide guidelines which assist taxpayers in understanding how discretions will, in general, be exercised. It is clearly inappropriate for extensions to be given lightly, as the ATO should not be capable of being used as a lending institution.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner's rulings indicate that, generally, a taxpayer does have to satisfy the Commissioner that insufficient funds are available to fully discharge the debt, or that payment would cause financial hardship, and that all avenues for obtaining the necessary funds have been exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the rulings also indicate that short term extensions, which might be required at short notice, or for only a very short time, may be provided where the Commissioner is satisfied that reasonable grounds are furnished, with closer examination being required where longer extensions are sought.</PARA>
<PARA> Where business operations are involved, the guidelines indicate that additional factors to consider include, but are not limited to, whether the difficulties which caused the inability to pay the debt are not permanent, and whether the business has good prospects of successfully trading out of its difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> Different companies may face different financial problems and the Taxation Office will need to consider each application on a case by case basis and on its merits in order to determine the term of the extension and the amount of late payment penalty to apply, if any.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding an inability to pay, companies are still required to lodge returns.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Generally, any arrangement that extends the due date will incur a penalty of 20 per cent per annum until full payment is made. However, the Commissioner of Taxation has limited discretion under section 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to remit all or part of the late payment penalties imposed. The guidelines for remission of late payment penalty are outlined in Income Tax Ruling IT 2570.</PARA>
<PARA> In that ruling it is a requirement for the taxpayer to demonstrate that the delay in payment was caused by specific factors which affected the cash flow and the taxpayer has taken reasonable steps to mitigate those circumstances to minimise the delay in payment. Factors beyond the control of the taxpayer may include strikes, unforeseen collapse of a major debtor or sudden ill-health of key personnel in a small business.</PARA>
<PARA> Mitigating steps may include a budget reorganisation to counteract the reduction in cash flow, attempts to raise additional funds from financial institutions and action by the taxpayer to protect the financial position where money is owed to the taxpayer.</PARA>

<PARA>MINIMUM PRICING POLICY-AMOXIL (AMOXYCILLIN)</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday Senator Herron asked me a question about the alleged unavailability of some brands of the antibiotic Amoxycillin.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, let me stress that the Government introduced a minimum pricing policy not a generic prescribing policy.</PARA>
<PARA> This policy is intended primarily to increase price competition amongst manufacturers with the objective of making substantial and ongoing savings to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) through increased incentives for manufacturers to offer lower prices:</PARA>
<PARA> thus addressing the concerns raised by manufacturers about the lack of price competition.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Amoxycillin, only the Amoxil brand of syrups have a premium. The tablets are not affected.</PARA>
<PARA> For the Amoxycillin range, Amoxil brand is the only brand which attracts a premium and prescribers have the choice of three alternative brands at the benchmark price.</PARA>
<PARA> One of these alternatives is Moxacin and the prescribing of this or any other brand is a matter for the medical practitioner.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Furniture removals are arranged on a national basis by the Transport and Storage Group of the Department of Administrative Services through a contract and business arrangement involving an approved panel of removalists.</PARA>
<PARA> Entry to the panel is obtained by meeting specific criteria and providing evidence of being able to meet particular standards stipulated by the Department. Currently there are some 100 approved contractors who undertake removals on an Australia-wide basis.</PARA>
<PARA> For each removal in a particular state quotes are invited from all eligible panellists and a contract is awarded with the lowest price being the common determinant. The exception to this might be, for example, where there are some reservations, at a particular time, about a removalist's ability to conduct a removal in accordance with the Department's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Department's conditions of contract and business arrangements the quoting process provides for all approved panellists to compete for work in a particular state each time a removal is required. The allocation of work flows from this process after quotes have been considered by contracts staff in the Transport &amp;Storage Group on a lowest price basis. The Department monitors prices on a continual basis and is able to readily obtain state by state comparisons.</PARA>
<PARA> Where there are indications of excessive prices being quoted or noticeable price increases it is taken up with the removals industry and the National Furniture Removers' Association (NFRA) which forms part of the Australian Road Transport Federation.</PARA>
<PARA> The NFRA is a representative industry body which the Department co-operates with at the national level in its removals business dealings. Recently, there has been cause to register concerns with the NFRA about price increases, although at this time of the year the normal trend has been for prices to increase.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the probability of a cartel operating in Brisbane and south-east Queensland the Department has no evidence to support such an allegation. If any information became available the NFRA would be informed and an explanation sought. The consequences would be severe if contractors were involved in such a process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have supplementary information to questions from three senators: one from Senator Kernot in respect of Aussat Pty Ltd; one from Senator Reynolds regarding Cape York Aboriginal Land Council; and one in response to Senator Walsh regarding the funding of legal action in regard to the Swan brewery in Western Australia. In order to save the time of the chamber, I seek to incorporate all of them in Hansard.

<PARA>STATEMENT BY SENATOR THE HON BOB COLLINS</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTER REPRESENTING THE MINISTER FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, 18 December 1990, Senator the Hon. Peter Walsh asked a question without notice relating to the funding by the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia of legal actions by both Mr Robert Bropho and Mr Corrie Bodney. I undertook to obtain additional information from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and to provide this to Senator Walsh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has now provided me with information in response to the Senator's question. I am advised that the former Department of Aboriginal Affairs provided a special grant of $50,000 to the Aboriginal Legal Service in 1989/90 to enable an appeal to be taken to the High Court of Australia concerning the future of the old Swan Brewery in Perth. The Commission has not been able to determine, in the time available, the exact amount expended in representing particular litigants in this legal action. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will, however, write to Senator Walsh providing these details.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission was able to determine, however, that Messrs Bropho and Bodney were represented in the legal action as a result of funding provided through the Aboriginal Legal Service, although they were not opposing litigants but joint plaintiffs. Separate representation was considered appropriate as each party had a legitimate interest in the legal action and there was conflict between Mr Bropho and Mr Bodney. Both Mr Bropho and Mr Bodney were represented in court for one day.</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Legal Service is an independent body and is able to commence or defend actions which it considers to be in the interests of its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission provides funding to the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia and these funds must only be expended within guidelines. The Commission does not believe that the funding guidelines were, in any way, breached as a consequence of providing legal representation for either Mr Bropho or Mr Bodney.</PARA>
<PARA>CAPE YORK SPACEPORT</PARA>
<PARA>SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION BY SENATOR REYNOLDS (11 DECEMBER 1990)</PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister indicate whether the Cape York Aboriginal Land Council will receive access to Government resources and advisers equal to that which proponents of the spaceport proposal will receive?</PARA>
<PARA>SUGGESTED RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been provided with the following information by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).</PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Commissioners of ATSIC at their recent meeting in Sydney declined to pre-empt any decision which regional councils may wish to make concerning possible financial support for non-statutory land councils.</PARA>
<PARA> The particular issue of financial or other assistance for the Cape York Land Council will need to be addressed by the recently elected Aurukun Regional Council when it becomes operational early in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of government financial assistance and other assistance for the Land Council from sources other than ATSIC will be a matter for individual ministers to consider in the context of their respective portfolios as and when the issue arises.</PARA>
<PARA>On 20 December 1990 Senator Kernot asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications a question without notice relating to the sale of AUSSAT Pty Ltd. In addition to the comments provided yesterday, the following has been provided by the Minister for Transport and Communications in answer to the specific questions relating to AUSSAT's debt.</PARA>
<PARA> Priority work is being undertaken by the second telecommunications carrier selection team in the Department of Transport and Communications to develop proposals for an orderly restructuring of AUSSAT's borrowing arrangements in conjunction with the sales process.</PARA>
<PARA> These proposals will provide safeguards for the interests of lenders.</PARA>
<PARA> One option to be considered is for the Government to assume AUSSAT's debt just prior to sale and to pay it out from the proceeds. There would be nothing unusual in such an approach and clearly the amounts owing to lenders must be met whatever the price received.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry into the effect on Australia of the political and economic reform in the Soviet Union has taken place at a time of extraordinary change and turbulence in the Soviet Union and in its constituent republics. Without question, these and the equally dramatic changes in eastern Europe over the past year mark a turning point in twentieth century history. In my forward to the report I refer to the volatile situation in the Soviet Union and the possibility of new unexpected events occurring there. Of course, we had the unexpected event yesterday of the resignation from office of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Shevardnadze. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes in the Soviet Union will have major implications for the rest of the world, including Australia. The Senate Committee believed it was important for the Australian Government to reassess its position in relation to the changes; hence, the inquiry was initiated by the Senate Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is based on 45 submissions from government departments, business people, academics and other interested members of the public. Among the witnesses were the then Soviet Ambassador to Australia, Dr Samoteikin, Dr Abel Agenbegyan, a senior adviser to President Gorbachev on economic matters, and Mr Gennadi Gerasimov, a USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee decided to divide its recommendations into two groups-namely, security and economics. The Committee concluded that Australia should make the most of the opening up of the Soviet economy and seek to develop closer economic ties with that country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee's view the Soviet Union has enormous economic potential. Just how quickly that potential is realised will have important implications for Australia. The Committee believes that Australia has much to offer the Soviet Union in terms of providing agricultural, mining and management expertise. Further trade opportunities could be developed through credit arrangements in addition to those which exist for wool and meat. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also recommends improved communication between Australian government departments and the Australian business community so that local businesses can be kept informed of possible trade and development opportunities as they occur in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> In immediate terms, the report recommends that the Australian Government provide food to the Soviet Union to help overcome its crippling food shortages. The Committee believes that the assistance should not be a handout but a transaction in the form of favourable terms of credit. The arrangement should, however, be made on the proviso that the Soviet Government not use force or economic blockades to deal with republics that want greater autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of security issues, the Committee has recommended that Australia review its security position to go beyond the Defence White Paper of 1987 and the December 1989 statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on regional security. This recommendation reflects the Committee's conclusion that the world has entered a post-Cold War environment with ramifications that go well beyond the European theatre. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that Australia should be working with the Soviet Union to improve the security of the Asia-Pacific region. Specifically, the Committee believes that the Australian Government should continue to press for multilateral dialogue on security issues for the whole region and that such talks should include the Soviet Union. Also the Committee recommends that the overall level of armaments in the Asia-Pacific region should be discussed as a regional issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we suggest that Australia could act as a regional negotiator to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Asia-Pacific region by bringing together the three nuclear powers with interests in this region. We will watch with great interest the historic endeavour of the people of the Soviet Union to create a new social, economic and political structure. We urge our Government to seriously consider the report's recommendations which the Committee believes will help Australia meet the challenges of these new times.</PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The main recommendations of the report are:</PARA>
<PARA>SECURITY ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA>1. A Cabinet review of Australia's strategic environment to supplement, and go beyond the Defence White Paper of 1987 and the Foreign Minister's December 1989 statement on regional security. This recommendation reflects the Committee's conclusion that the world has now entered a post-cold war environment with ramifications that go well beyond the European theatre. </PARA>
<PARA>2. That the Australian Government should also continue to press for regular processes of multi-lateral dialogue on security issues for the whole Asia-Pacific region. The USSR should be a part of this regional process-it has legitimate interests in the region and legitimate aspirations to be part of this region's efforts to promote its economy. </PARA>
<PARA>3. That the overall level of armaments in the Asia-Pacific region should be the subject of regional discussions. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Regarding possible nuclear proliferation, Australia as consistently supported initiatives to achieve a global nuclear non-proliferation regime. In line with this approach, the Committee recommends the review should thoroughly explore what measures Australia might take to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation in the region, particularly on the Korean peninsula and by Taiwan. More specifically the review should examine what scope there might be for Australia to act as a facilitator in bringing the three nuclear powers with a direct interest in the issue in the region, namely the United States, the Soviet Union and China together to address the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>TRADE ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA>5. That more effective channels of communication and a greater flow of information be established between government assessment agencies and departments, and the Australian business community. The objective should be to establish an active program for the regular dissemination of assessments on the USSR to important user groups within the community. </PARA>
<PARA>6. That the Australian Government, in collaboration with private business, seek to establish a high-level joint working group, comprising both Australian and Soviet Government representatives, business people and academics. Such a committee should analyse the evolving economic situation and identify potential trade and investment projects. Representatives of USSR Republics should also be included in the joint process as necessary to deal with specific issues of direct interest to Australian business in individual republics. </PARA>
<PARA>7. That credit arrangements (in addition to those already negotiated for wool and wheat) be considered for potentially significant Australian exports to the Soviet Union for the immediate future. These arrangements should not be confined to the Central Soviet authorities but should also be extended to individual republics. </PARA>
<PARA>8. There is scope for considerable expansion in Australian exports of technology and scientific expertise to the Soviet Union, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors. In pursuing these opportunities the Committee recommends that particular attention be given to joint venture possibilities including third parties such as Korean companies. </PARA>
<PARA>9. With regard to the high levels of controls still applied under COMCOM, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government work actively to ease the restrictions further in order to open up new trade opportunities for Australian exporters of high technology goods and services to the Soviet Union. An important opportunity to do so will be at the forthcoming meeting of COMCOM in early 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>10. That the decline in Australian university resources devoted to Russian studies be halted, and preferably reversed. One avenue would be for the representatives on the joint working groups proposed above, to explore ways of developing, along with private business, a long-term program for a steady increase in Russian studies in Australia. In addition, a student or senior scholar exchange with specific institutions in the Soviet Union, preferably both in Moscow and in the Soviet far east, should be established. </PARA>
<PARA>11. That members of ethnic communities in Australia with origins in the Soviet Union be encouraged to use their natural advantages, such as knowledge of language, to establish business contact with the Soviet Union and with its constituent republics. In particular, efforts should be made to remove obstacles, including any limiting regulations, and to facilitate such contacts. </PARA>
<PARA>12. The Soviet Union is desperately short of expertise to manage the transition to a market economy. The Committee recommends that the Australian Government draw the attention of Australian business to the possible benefits to be gained from offering management training to senior executives of their potential or existing business partners in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>13. That Australia's aviation authorities and Qantas should consider the potential trade and tourism benefits that would flow from further expanding agreements allowing Aeroflot to operate charter flights and to establish regular services, together with reciprocal opportunities for Qantas in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>14. The report notes the range of bilateral agreements signed by Australia and the Soviet Union at the time of Prime Minister Ryhzkov's visit in early 1990. The Committee recommends that there should be a sustained effort to implement those agreements and not allow them to gather dust. In particular, scientific exchanges in the area of monitoring major environmental changes such as ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>15. That the Australian Government look at a possible mechanism for involving the USSR in the Asia Pacific economic cooperation (APEC) process. At a minimum, it should ensure that the USSR is kept informed on the APEC progress. Consideration might, in the first instance, be given to some form of observer or other partial membership status for the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA>16. The Committee recommends that particular attention be given to devising effective means for Australia to contribute to international efforts to provide food to the USSR during the coming critical months. In line with the approach being considered by the countries of the European Community and Canada, such assistance should not be a hand-out but a commercial transaction in the form of favourable terms of credit. At the same time it should be made clear to the Soviet Government that the use of force, including imposing economic blockades, in dealing with the wish of some of the republics for greater autonomy, is unacceptable. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr President</PARA>
<PARA>The two reports I have tabled today are a report on Finance Minutes of the Public Accounts Committee and a report of the Committee's activities for the year 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Finance Minutes</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's Report 306 on Finance Minutes contains the formal responses to reports of the Committee which were received by the Committee during 1990. The responses deal with a variety of issues including the Management of the Antarctic Division, Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports, the Engagement of External Consultants by Commonwealth Departments, Safety Principles for Explosives and the Commonwealth's Offsets Program. </PARA>
<PARA>The presentation of this report is a means of making available to the Parliament and to other interested persons the responses to recommendations made by the Committee in its reports. The fact that the Committee has presented these responses in this report does not mean that the Committee will not examine them in greater detail in the future and it certainly does not indicate any reduction in the importance with which the Committee views its formal response process which is known as the Finance Minute process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that the overall process of accountability is aided by the prompt tabling of Finance Minutes. This gives parliamentarians and the public an opportunity to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the responses by Departments to particular concerns and recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Report of Activities 1989-90</PARA>
<PARA>The second report I have tabled, Report 307, is a report of the activities of the Committee for the year 1989-90. The primary purpose of this report is to inform the Parliament of the Committee's activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The report deals with the work of the Sixteenth Committee of the Public Accounts, which was chaired by the Honourable Member for Hughes, The Hon R E Tickner, MP, and also with the work of the current Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Of great interest to the Committee during the year were the presentation to the Parliament of responses by both the Government and the Auditor-General to the Committee's Report 296, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and the Parliament, Reform of the Australian Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA>I am heartened by the number of recommendations in Report 296 that have received a favourable response from both the Government and the Auditor-General. I note that both the Audit Office and the Department of Finance have begun working on drafting instructions for new legislation recommended by the Committee to replace the existing Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA>As the reports tabled by the Committee in 1989 covered a wide range of subjects, so too do the Committee's current inquiries. They include the Business Migration Program, annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities, Defence's supply computer systems, research and development in the public and private sectors, an account set up in relation to the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the social responsibilities of Commonwealth statutory authorities and government business enterprises. With each of these inquiries there is a focus on issues of accountability and value for money. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Committee I would like to acknowledge, with great appreciation, the contribution made to its work by the members of the Committee Secretariat and the Committee's advisers. Additionally, we thank all those who gave assistance during the year, particularly officers from the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I would like to say that I enjoy the work of the Public Accounts Committee but it is a hard working Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) tabled a statement in the Senate headed `Annual Statement on the Aid Program 1990'. This is a new initiative. It is a response by the Government to a report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommending such a course of action. As I was then a member of the Committee and part of that recommendation, I obviously welcome the statement as an addition to the public debate on the aid program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the statement has only just been made available, my comments today will be brief, but I hope that in the next year there will be opportunities to debate in more depth the Australian aid program. It is, of course, a significant part of the Budget-$1.3 billion. It is the subject of continuing debate in the community both as to the quantum and quality and as to the direction of the aid program. It is interesting to note that many Australians, apart from contributing to this through their taxes, also individually make donations to non-government aid organisations. I think it was suggested that over one million Australians make such donations and, therefore, it is a matter of interest and concern to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be brief and make only a couple of points on this occasion. The first is in relation to the Minister's statement concerning policy dialogue. This statement gives some prominence to policy dialogue, suggesting that it will be given an increased emphasis. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is cited as the first major priority for increased attention to policy dialogue. The view of the Opposition is that this is appropriate, and we believe in the importance of PNG to Australia. The fact that PNG has long been the biggest recipient of Australian aid funds indicates the importance of looking at PNG in this upgraded attitude of policy dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little surprised, I have to concede, because I asked the Minister in an Estimates committee hearing only a couple of months ago about the part of policy dialogue, that is, trying to influence policy outcomes at the recipient end. I asked him what the position of the Government was, and the reply came back:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a certain ritual quality that ought to be noted about a number of these incandatory paragraphs that appear from year to year and stay on the word processor from year to year. I think it is ever thus with annual reports of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, in the meantime the Minister seems to have had a new vision and upgraded the importance of policy dialogue. I am pleased to note that. I think that the statement, however, does gloss over continuing serious shortcomings in this area. I remind you, Mr Deputy President, of some that were referred to in the audit of the aid program of PNG. Mention is made later in the statement to the auditor of that aid program, but only briefly and only in relation to the major question of the lack of success in achieving economic growth in PNG.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the failure of the Australian Government to persuade the PNG Government to contribute funds in support of the major project to improve PNG constabulary is one issue that should be further addressed because, without allocation of funds apart from the Budget support from Australia, the project will not be able to achieve its objectives which, of course, is important for the improvement of the law and order situation in Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> The audit report also raises another important issue in relation to law and order: the effect of the centralised wage fixing system in PNG which, of course, has been borrowed from Australia, and the effect that this is having in leading to urban wages that are unrealistically high. I will quote from this report-this will, no doubt, be of interest to Senator Cook:</PARA>
<PARA>The gap between rural and urban wages doubled in the 1970s and has maintained since through the indexation system. This has encouraged rural urban drift, increased the reserve price of rural wages and contributed to urban unemployment and widespread law and order problems. </PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly an area in which the Government should be engaging in some serious policy dialogue. The Government, I suggest, should be urging the adoption of an appropriate wage system. Bearing in mind that 75 per cent of the population in rural areas in PNG live below the absolute poverty line, the interests of the comparatively well off minority in formal employment in towns should not be allowed to override the interests of the rural poor. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it adopted our system, we guided them and I am suggesting seriously to the Minister that it might lead to an outcome which I do not think he intended. This might be a good subject for serious debate at some future time, because this is an important issue. Some of PNG's problems have been inherited from us as well as benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Improved law and order is essential for the maintenance of Australian investment in PNG, which is in the long term interests of both countries. In that light I would remind the Senate that a most uncomfortable matter so far as I am concerned was the recent report of an intention to build what is called `secure' housing in Port Moresby for Australian High Commission staff. It seems to me that the construction of a `complex' sounds like a bunker, which is an admission of a pessimistic outlook by the Australian Government for the law and order situation in PNG. Perhaps some more frank acknowledgment from the Australian Government of its real assessment in this area would be helpful. Thus, I suggest that policy dialogue is important on a whole range of issues, but it is disappointing that there is no indication that the Government will carry out that policy dialogue to the extent that I have indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to mention briefly the fact that an insufficient proportion of the $1.3 billion that Australia spends on aid program is actually spent on bilateral programs. This was a debate we recently had in the Senate on the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill and I do not want to revisit that debate in any detail today. But, if we are to look at the aid program, in the Opposition's opinion the balance between multilateral assistance and bilateral assistance deserves further consideration. The bilateral share of the overall aid program has dropped from 68 per cent of the program to 58 per cent over the past five years. If the Government is doing this as a result of policy, it should indicate that to the Parliament. We do not know. We do not know whether it is simply as a result of having been locked into the multilateral program and that, with constraints on the total ceiling, it has had an unintended effect. If it is having an unintended effect, what are the consequences of it?</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the development import finance facility (DIFF) is mentioned, but only in passing. The Opposition's opinion is that the DIFF program requires greater community and parliamentary debate. In particular, has the program worked, bearing in mind those who argue that it is not good aid? Has it achieved its commercial objectives? There seems to be a hint of an assessment in the Minister's paper that the program is not achieving those objectives. I suggest that that is another issue that should be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> With those few comments, I conclude where I started. I suggest that issues concerning Australia's foreign aid, the best quality aid, whether it should be more regionalised, as the Opposition has been suggesting, and whether it should take account of factors such as the extent to which a recipient State spends on its own military needs rather than on the ultimate cause to which the aid is intended, again deserve further attention. I hope that there will be more opportunity to debate these matters in the course of the next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly on one of the issues which should be debated in future and which is of some concern to people in this chamber and to the wider community. I refer to the very substantial aid funds which have been granted to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) since this Government came to office. The figures which have been supplied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) show that, since 1983, $9m of taxpayers' funds will have been supplied to the ACTU for foreign aid purposes. The money which the ACTU receives goes to a range of bodies. One which seems to have done particularly well is a body called APHEDA, which stands for the Australian People For Health Education and Development Abroad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two brief matters I wish to raise, one of principle and one of policy. The principle is whether foreign aid moneys in very substantial quantities should be given to an organisation such as the ACTU, a wealthy organisation, the members of which have greatly improved their own benefits in the sense of power and privilege under this Government. There is an issue as to whether it is appropriate for taxpayers' funds to be used in this manner. If the ACTU wants to carry out foreign aid that is fine, and I have no argument with it, but my point is that the money with which the Council carries out this foreign aid should come from its own membership, its own unions, and not from taxpayers in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue concerns a matter of policy. Since I raised this matter in this place previously, the point has been made to me by members of the public and others as to whether we are seeing in some of these grants an attempt by the Government to run a two-track foreign aid program. There has been very great concern about some of the grants which have been made by APHEDA to various groups. In South Africa the African National Council has been given a grant and there are other grants to which I have already drawn attention. I would urge the Government to think very carefully about the way in which taxpayers' money is being used. I think that it is bad in principle for an organisation with a stated membership, an organisation which is large and which has plenty of its own resources, to use taxpayers' money for foreign aid purposes. The other matter is one of policy as to whether it is appropriate for some of the grants to be made to various bodies which are being funnelled through APHEDA. I am pleased to see that Senator Gareth Evans has said that in the coming months the development education program of APHEDA will be carefully reviewed, and we in the Opposition wait with interest to see the results of that review. In terms of the matters of principle and of policy, I believe that all honourable senators would be well advised to look closely at the amount of money which is being funnelled through the ACTU and how that money is being spent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is customary at the conclusion of the Senate sitting year, I would like to reflect briefly upon the year past and pay tribute to all of those who have made the smooth running of this chamber possible. The year 1990 has been an eventful one in many respects. Of note was, of course, the March election and the departure of some good friends from all sides of the political spectrum. Then we had the arrival of no fewer than 14 new senators who have all made their own particular mark upon the day-to-day life of the Senate. To all of those new senators, I hope that we have made you welcome and that you now feel at home in these often difficult surroundings. Of course, given that you have spent the best part of three months here, day and night, I am sure that you now feel that this is home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, we are saying yet another farewell today. Senator Peter Baume will not be returning to the Senate next year. Over the past 16 years, Senator Baume has been a tireless and dedicated worker not only for his Party but also for the Senate. I realise only too well that had the result of the March election been different, Senator Baume may well have been in my place today. I also realise that had he been, he would have done the Senate proud. His input into the work of the Presiding Officers' information technology advisory group has been absolutely invaluable to the Speaker and me. Indeed, Senator Baume has, on many occasions, shared with me his thoughts on the administration of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> One notable example of this was at a football game just before my re-election as President. At that time I said that I hoped he would run for Deputy President so that we could work together in a bipartisan way on the administrative problems of the Parliament. I was sorry that he did not run, but now I know why he made that decision. Peter, I wish you all the very best for your future career.</PARA>
<PARA> In September, I and a number of my parliamentary colleagues travelled to Zimbabwe for the annual Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference, the results of which I have mixed feelings. Whereas I suffered a personal disappointment, Australia's long held wish that we be a separate region from the South Pacific and New Zealand was finally achieved, giving this branch permanent representation on the executive committee. The work done by our colleagues at this important meeting was faultless. I would like to give a particular personal vote of thanks to Senator Bjelke-Petersen for her solid support during that conference.</PARA>
<PARA> The year 1990 has been another busy but productive one for the parliamentary departments as they adapt to the new Parliament House. We can really no longer call our building new, but nevertheless we constantly face settling in problems that continue to occupy much of the Speaker's and my time. We have been able to focus on streamlining the various administrations with some degree of success.</PARA>
<PARA> Following two reports from the Auditor-General late last year on Hansard and the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO), we have been able to effect substantial change within the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff (DPRS). The Hansard division has undergone major restructuring and reorganisation with the introduction of word processing, computer assisted transcription and electronic transfer of text to the Government Printer. As well, significant changes to the pay conditions and work practices of reporters were negotiated under the structural efficiency principle and industrial negotiations are continuing to bring about similar changes in other areas of Hansard. Both the amount and pace of that change has been very great. None of this would have been possible without the enthusiastic support, cooperation and commitment of all staff in the Hansard division. I would like to thank them all for the very positive manner in which they have responded to the changes which have taken place.</PARA>
<PARA> The Sound and Vision Office (SAVO) has not only continued to improve its services to senators but also, in cooperation with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, has taken Senate Question Time live to the people of Australia. This involves significant additional work and resources for SAVO. The result has been most worthwhile.</PARA>
<PARA> This year has been a testing and challenging period for the Department of the Parliamentary Library, with major program restructuring. The transfer of PISO to the DPRS in February was a major undertaking with widespread ramifications, particularly in the corporate services area. We are again grateful to the Auditor-General, John Taylor, who has agreed to his officers assisting us in further streamlining operations in the Library so that senators and members can receive an even better service from this valuable resource. I am grateful for the assistance and cooperation I continue to receive from all Library officers in helping us achieve these worthwhile goals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint House Department, with its many faceted roles, has consolidated during the year as it comes to grips with managing the building. The Speaker and I have been looking closely at the Parliamentary Catering Service to ensure that efficient, cost-effective service is provided to all. Honourable senators will be aware of the changes made to date and we will be giving them a further opportunity to express their views in a survey which is to be conducted in February next year.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the running of this chamber, I am very much aware of the current scrutiny of the conduct of Question Time. I take this opportunity to point out to honourable senators that the decline in the number of questions began in 1982-the first full year in which the then government did not have control of the Senate. However, I would also like to point out that this year has been the best since 1984 and is very close to being the best since 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> As we come to the close of what has been a long Budget session, I must pay tribute to the efforts of all the officers of the Department of the Senate who have so ably assisted in the functioning of the chamber. I am personally grateful for the guidance and assistance I have received from the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk Assistant. A most sincere vote of thanks must also go to the Deputy President, Senator Colston, who since his election has fulfilled the role of Deputy with distinction and dedication.</PARA>
<PARA> It only remains for me now to express my appreciation and best wishes to all of the staff of Parliament House who have played their part, both big and small, in making this a successful year. I greatly appreciate all of the support and assistance that I have received and I look forward to seeing all honourable senators back here in February 1991.</PARA>

It is very nice to see that Senator Austin Lewis is back from his travels. I have to tell you, Senator, that while you have been away the Opposition was flagging a bit. It is like bringing a new player off the interchange bench in the last quarter to see you come back and reinvigorate the side. We welcome that because I can tell you that while you were away, the old lags have behaved as badly as ever and the new ones have not learnt any good habits from them.

For that reason, I inadvertently mentioned him. But Michael Baume will keep. I look forward to making a speech about him at some stage, whether he is retiring or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This chamber arouses many strange passions-anger, humour, sadness, boredom. Peter Baume entered the Senate at the same time as I did. In all that time, the only passionate disagreement we have had has been about poetry. I think on two or three occasions, we have had passionate disagreements about poetry, and on nothing else. I have much more reason to respect Senator Peter Baume than he has to respect me. But I think that there is some mutual respect between us; I do not want to dole out the proportions. I have always had a great deal of respect for him. We worked together on many committees. If one reads about any of us in the Parliamentary Handbook we sound pretty one-dimensional. If one reads all the committees that Peter Baume has sat on and the functions and work that he has performed as a senator and as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia one sees a very long list indeed. All that represents is hard work. </PARA>
<PARA> But, of course, he has been far more to the Senate than that. I think it is true to say that he has been a friend to us all. Occasionally he has been a provider of pills to people like me when I have had a toothache. I think that everybody in the Senate has respected him. That is largely because Peter Baume has always been an issues man. Even today when he answered his last question, which took me back to his days as a Minister, he answered the question about an issue which has been of deep concern to him over many years, about which he has felt very strongly and on which he has been totally consistent. There have been other issues of a similar kind. Not many of us in this chamber-some of you will say in my case, regretfully-have ever resigned from a shadow Cabinet or a Cabinet or who have crossed the floor on questions of principle and Peter Baume is one of those. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I looked back at his maiden speech in this place. In those days he was a much more political man. Those opposite were all fussed up in the heat of 1974 with the sins of the Whitlam Government. He was swept away in that mood at the time in his maiden speech. But since then he has always addressed himself to issues and has been a rational, informed, intelligent debater of issues without base passion in terms in which he has dealt with problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter, I will miss you as a colleague and a friend. I am sure that I speak for most other senators-certainly all Government senators-when I say that. On behalf of the Government, I wish you every success in your new career, although in some ways it is a return to a lifelong interest which you have had. I am sure you will have a very fruitful life in that new career, which will prove to us all that there is life after politics and that people, after they leave the Senate, can make a very great contribution. Thank you for your friendship and contribution, and good wishes for the future. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Opposition senators, I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in thanking all of those people who have made our life a little easier in this place and who have provided services for us. I mention specifically you, Mr President. Thank you for your impartiality. In some ways it seems that your job is becoming more difficult as the Government seems to be under greater strain and Ministers are showing signs of being tired and emotional. In these stressful times, you are handling a difficult job with dignity that could be treated as a precedent by some on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank also the Deputy President, who in some ways came into the job in difficult circumstance. Particularly in the Estimates Committee, he showed a tolerance which has helped build goodwill. The Deputy President deserves a particular mention for that, as well as the temporary Chairmen of Committees, who have made our task easier. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all of those who provide services-the Clerks, Hansard staff, others within the Department of the Senate, committee staff, the Library, Comcar drivers-everyone, in fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I make particular mention of the role and function of the Clerks. I do that because of the rather unfortunate and sour note that was introduced into the Senate this morning in a notice of motion. The Clerks have a difficult job. They of course advise both sides. I guess any of us who have been to a football match always think that the umpire is on the other side. But generally speaking, he is not. If honourable senators feel that the Clerks are fulfilling their task by advising the other side, then they should recognise that that is part of their job. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember in the very recent past Senator Button being presented with a problem. He had a statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for which leave was not granted to be incorporated. I saw the Clerk lean over and give him a tip on how to get out of the problem, that is, by tabling the statement. My immediate reaction was, `Why should someone with Senator Button's experience need help in this way?'. But of course it is part of the job. From my observation and impression, in the nearly 10 years I have been here, the Clerks have been non-partisan, do an excellent job in difficult circumstances and help us all out when we ask for that help. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators-Hear, Hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I mention the management of government business. Each year, at about this time, we are told that it will be improved in the following year. We have been told it again. I hope that this time it is true. Really the pressures of the last few weeks have resulted from a shambles in relation to government business this session. The Government has set aside more sitting days in the first half of next year to try to work through some of the backlog. I simply say that with better planning there is no reason to get into the situation that we have had this year, which has the unfortunate effect of resulting in work of not the quality that we desire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that vein of looking at the Senate working better as a Senate, I commend the new system that we have adopted of referring Bills more often to the legislative general purpose standing committees for what are being referred to as `mini-inquiries'. There is no doubt, this being the first parliamentary session in which this system has operated, that there have been teething problems. But I can point to many successes already on the board out of that new system not only in producing better quality work, which should be a key objective of all of us but also giving those who have particular interest within the community in a piece of legislation the opportunity to contribute. I have noted that that is already being appreciated by the various interest groups and professional groups-as I said, those who have particular interest in a particular topic. I think that it will be a very major reform of this Senate. When we get through the teething problems and the system is working smoothly, as I am sure that it will, we will look back upon this as a time of worthwhile reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button mentioned Question Time. There is no doubt that Question Time is becoming more stressful. As honourable senators are aware, there is concern on this side of the chamber that there are not the opportunities to ask what we regard as a sufficient number of questions. Today was a bad example of what some of us feel is becoming a practice of insufficient questions, answers being unduly lengthy, statements being put down under the guise of questions without notice, which was never the intention of this parliamentary mechanism. It was designed to give an element of accountability of government Ministers to elected members of parliament. I hope that we can work through this difficulty of Question Time during the next session and the result can be more questions being asked and answered. </PARA>
<PARA> Television was mentioned. This is another reform which I know is regarded by some as a bit of a joke. This is another opportunity for the parliamentary process to be better taken to the community in an accepted medium. I have noted, as have many of my colleagues, the interest that it now seems to have engendered. Mr President, you mentioned that you are getting letters. We are all getting letters and other responses. That will ultimately have the effect that we want it to have: that the community will understand the processes of parliament and this democracy better and, hopefully, will therefore be more supportive of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are, as the Leader of the Government (Senator Button) said, standing here today particularly to mark the pending retirement of one of our colleagues. I also wish to join with the Leader of the Government to say a few words regarding the career of my friend and colleague Peter Baume. He is one of the lucky people in our society who will have three careers, it seems. His first, as a consulting physician, was one that I understand was outstanding. He then came to us and he can have the comfort of retiring from his parliamentary career knowing that he distinguished this institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps a touch of the motivation of Peter Baume was seen in interviews that he accepted at the time of announcing his pending retirement from here to go to his third career, that of a professor of community medicine at the University of New South Wales. In one interview he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It will allow me to continue and to develop further my interests in a range of health-related issues, including evaluation theory and practice, drug policy, health services planning, social inequalities in health, HIV and AIDS and other issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of us know of the work that Peter Baume has been doing in these areas. Drug policy has always been a field of great personal commitment to him. In recent years he has been involved with the issues relating to the scourge of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a sensitive attempt to help those who are suffering from that disease and to prevent its spread. This attitude and atmosphere of community service has been very much at the heart of Peter Baume's contribution to public life. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I shall just briefly put on the record some of his contributions within the parliamentary process as a Cabinet Minister and as a parliamentarian. The various portfolios he held in the Fraser Government included Aboriginal Affairs-for which his work is well known in the community-the health portfolio for a brief period, and the education portfolio. I remind honourable senators that Peter Baume served with distinction in the Whips field, both as a Deputy Whip and as a Whip. My colleagues who remember those days speak of him as a strict but fair disciplinarian. I think in many ways he is still very proud of his contribution as Whip and holds the position of Whip as one of vital importance to the smooth running of this institution. </PARA>
<PARA> His shadow ministerial responsibilities have included education and youth affairs, the status of women and community services. He has given outstanding service on committees, including four years as the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, participation on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, and involvement with the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a capable technician, and honourable senators on this side of the chamber will remember his handling of the very difficult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation not very long ago, involving over 40 hours of complex and detailed debate, which he led from our side. As Senator Button mentioned, he has served as an Acting Deputy President and as such was an acknowledged master of the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that record, I want also to put down a few personal thoughts on Peter Baume the man, my friend and my colleague. There is no doubt about Peter Baume's intellect. It has been of great benefit to our side of the Parliament and to the Parliament as a whole. There is no doubt about his passion and determination and there is no doubt about his courage, as Senator Button mentioned, in relation to one or two difficult issues. Peter Baume has come to us as a committed and dedicated Liberal. By that, I acknowledge his belief in the supreme dignity of individuals-each and every individual having the entitlement to be treated with respect and equally. As I have said, his record has been as a fighter for the underprivileged, for anyone who has been discriminated against. We can look at Peter Baume's work in relation to Aboriginals and in relation to AIDS as a couple of examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Philosophically, he has made clear to us-all of those he has sought to educate in various ways-the value of an interventionist role of government when it is necessary, particularly to help those who need support of government. Peter Baume has not hesitated to say that the Government should accept and meet that responsibility. I particularly acknowledge the work that he has undertaken in this place in the promotion of the interests of women and the equal opportunity legislation debate, on which he resigned the shadow portfolio. That was of great difficulty for Peter Baume, but it demonstrated the courage of his convictions. He may not be known by all as a great supporter of the family, but he is. He has been very lucky to have Jenny as both a friend and supporter as well as a wife. He has been a great supporter of democratic institutions and particularly of this Senate. That is why I say that he will be remembered as a distinguished senator. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I acknowledge his support for young people. His curriculum vitae shows that he was a patron of the Young Liberal Movement and other youth organisations, always wanting to help and advance the interests of young people. It has been a very fine contribution to public life, through the Senate and through the opportunity of government. I congratulate Peter Baume. I wish him well for the future. He has been a good friend to me and a good counsel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, on behalf of my Party, to contribute to the final debate in this Budget Session. Initially, I thank those who make this place work, albeit with enormous difficulty from time to time, and not necessarily with the full cooperation of all of us in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank you, Mr President, for your firm hand which has so often been needed-particularly during the last rather fraught weeks; and your Deputy who has shown, through this first session in his position, a similar firm hand tempered, I think, by a great sense of humanity and even a little dry wit from time to time. I look forward to the rest of his term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to mention the Democrats' great appreciation of the work and guidance of the Clerks. In our position in this place, holding the balance of power, nothing could be more crucial for us than that advice and guidance which is, of course, as Senator Hill has said, given to us all to do with as we will. We are the receivers of advice; whether we take it or not is entirely in our hands. We appreciate the advice that we get from the Clerks and the very hard work that they, along with many other people around this place, do. </PARA>
<PARA> I have often wondered, particularly in these last few weeks, how any of us physically cope with the sort of regime to which we subject ourselves. Most particularly, I think about it in the context of those-the Clerks, whom I have mentioned; the committee staff; the Hansard staff; the Library staff; the drivers and everyone else-who seem to have to revolve around our activities and the hours that we set ourselves. When we are making decisions about how we are going to operate within this chamber, we should think more often about what it is we do to those people and, of course, to their families and their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I commend to all honourable senators my own new year's resolution, that is, to do everything I can to ensure that this place does not sit in the last week before Christmas next year. The Government is responsible for the management of this place, as Senator Hill has said. Nevertheless, we all have a role. The Government has a swag of Bills ready for us when we come back nice and early next year. I think that with the planning which Senator Hill asked for from the Government, and with cooperation, we could make that new year's resolution come true. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for the sake of the Clerks and everybody else who works in this place-and I am conscious of the long hours that you, Mr President, and the Deputy President have spent in the chair these last few nights-that I speak about that goal which we should all have. I do not think legislation by exhaustion is really what this country deserves from this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I have served my first session as Leader of my Party. It has been a session of new elements for the Senate. There has been a new committee system. We are on record as saying we have done everything we can to see whether or not it will work. That is something we will all have to look at in the coming year. The pressure and stresses, particularly as those committees have met in these last few weeks, have been heavy burdens on my colleagues with their heavy portfolio loads. I think we should acknowledge the work that they have done. </PARA>
<PARA> This session there has been the televising of Question Time and my own new leadership, of which I have been particularly conscious, and also the relatively new leadership-having had four weeks to be run in, so to speak-of Senator Hill and Senator Boswell. Senator Button has been sitting there, not so new, on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> I would particularly like to acknowledge the new team which I have led. Five of my senators have been new, with Senator Lees and Senator Bell having had four weeks in May to add to their experience before they came for the Budget session. I congratulate my colleagues. It is very difficult to sit in balance of power, particularly in these last few weeks with the rush of legislation. I thank my colleagues, in particular my Deputy Leader, Senator Coulter, for their cooperation, stamina and fortitude in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Senate can be proud of the work that it does. If one looks at the Order of Business, one sees a long list of amended Bills that have come back to us from the House of Representatives. I would like to say something about this process. We hear a lot about deals in this place and I think we ought to see what that really means. It means that we have a chamber where the voice of the people can be heard and can have an effect. Those amendments are Government-Opposition amendments, sometimes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell Senator Macdonald that they are sometimes Opposition-Democrat amendments-quite often, in fact. They might be Government-Democrat amendments. Nevertheless, they are the work of this chamber. As I say, it is work which is done perhaps not in the most organised way. It is important for us to acknowledge the process that goes on here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one has had more experience of that than Senator Peter Baume to whom I want to say a very fond farewell. I had the pleasure of being a neighbour of Senator Baume's when we moved into this House. I saw quite a bit of him in the corridors in those years before coming downstairs this session myself. He has always been a cheerful person around the place. Sometimes, particularly towards the end of a year like this, that in itself can be enough to endear a person to any other person around the place. Someone who can manage a cheerful demeanour and a kind word is certainly popular for that reason alone. I think Senator Baume bears the title `the Hon.', which he has earned and which has been bestowed on him through his political work, perhaps more rightfully than anyone I can think of. He is an honourable politician who has been guided by those principles of liberalism which he has so often expounded very clearly in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke to the 100 outstanding year 11 students at the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee seminar they were at pains to tell me how much they had been impressed by Senator Peter Baume who had spoken to them the day before. They drew the contrast between the impact Senator Baume had on them and what they thought politicians were actually like. I know that Senator Peter Baume has spoken to many other groups of young people. I think we are all indebted to a politician who can actually raise young people's opinions of politicians in this country to a higher level. He has done us all a service. </PARA>
<PARA> I add to what Senator Hill said about the groups of people in the community who have been championed by Senator Peter Baume as a Minister, in Opposition, and on the back bench of his own Party-Aboriginal people, the disabled, young people and, in particular, women. He is a politician who has lived, worked and voted by his principles-something which is quite unusual. Even though he does not tell these young people that that is what he has done, that is what they can see and appreciate. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally wish to acknowledge the support of Senator Baume for those measures over the years which Democrats before me, and currently, have taken towards reducing the incidence of tobacco use in our community; his support for my private member's Bill whose provisions come into effect in a few days time; and his work within his own Party and the community on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> His contributions in this place have always been intelligent and compassionate. He is a politician of courage. He is a politician who is extremely loyal to his Party-from my point of view, unbelievably loyal. His loyalty must be acknowledged, and I think it is, by his own Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish him well in his, as Senator Hill has said, third career. He will be a magnificent professor of community medicine. No-one could be better suited to such a position, for he is a politician who has never been out of touch with the community. I believe he will bring great distinction to the University of New South Wales as he already has to politics and his profession. He will be missed. </PARA>

His article on the new procedures relating to the referral of Bills to committees was a very important and a very timely one. The article by Peter O'Keeffe, the Clerk Assistant, on how a private member is able to get a private member's Bill through was, I have to acknowledge, one worth writing. I acknowledge the tribute that he paid to my former colleague in this place, Senator McGauran, who will be back after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember the debate on the War Crimes Bill when we joined as one to pass it because everyone in the Senate, including Senator Collins, could see the merits of the arguments. It was approached in a bipartisan way. I hope that Senator Collins will use his considerable influence in getting the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) to accept that Bill when it is debated in the lower House. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Clerk and deputy Clerks for their work in the chamber and the service that they provide us. I know that as Leader of the National Party I have had to seek their advice on a number of occasions. I thank my staff also. They have been very helpful to me over the last seven or eight months for which I have been Leader. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we now come to a sad part of the procedure today in farewelling our colleague, Senator Peter Baume. I suppose there are not too many more unlikely combinations in the Senate than Senator Peter Baume, a liberal, and a person like myself, a merchant and a conservative. But we formed a great partnership and a great respect for each other-at least I certainly respect Senator Peter Baume and I hope he respects me. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been on a number of committees together. I will always remember an incident that occurred on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs when we were travelling in one of those Hawker Siddeley planes-the ones that defy gravity by hanging in the air at a minimum speed. It was an interesting debate because Senator Devlin, Senator McMullan, Senator Peter Baume and I were there-an interesting combination of a waterside worker, an economist, a doctor and a merchant. The discussion moved into deep intellectual philosophy. Senator McMullan and Senator Peter Baume were trying to prove by some equation that the earth was round. This developed into such an intellectual discussion that one had to have at least five degrees to enter into the debate. Either Senator Devlin or I said, `Listen, the way you find out that the earth is round is you start from one point and you keep going and when you come back to the same point you know the earth is round'. </PARA>
<PARA> I give that little example of what actually happened when four people from diverse backgrounds came together. Senator Peter Baume could cover the whole spectrum. He could talk to me, to the intellectuals, to the waterside workers and the workers and he could give them all the same confidence. That is one of the greatest attributes that I believe he brings into the Senate. He could cover the whole spectrum of human relations. For that I admire you Peter; I will miss you. I stood by Peter in one of the most trying speeches I had to make here. I do not want to mention the name of the debate and bring it up again because it did the job it was intended to do. Peter Baume stood alongside me and I thank him for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter, today you leave the Senate to start your third career. To you, to your wife in the gallery, to Sarah and your son-to your family-I wish you all the best. I say to you, Peter, that I am sure that you will make the same success of your third career as you have of your first and second careers. In conclusion, I wish everyone here a happy, safe and a holy Christmas. </PARA>

I must say that I feel very sorry for Senator Peter Baume. I think we should have made some arrangement for him to go off and sit in a soundproof room somewhere outside the chamber. It must be trying actually to sit here and listen to all this stuff. Might I say, and there are a few in this chamber who can testify to it, that we all find at times that valedictories-and I remember the last one in here with Senator Button-are a bit trying at times in that some of it is gush, and let us admit it, and some of it is not quite as sincere as it might be, but that will not apply to anything said in this debate by either side this afternoon and we all know that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My personal association with Senator Peter Baume goes back a number of years and predates my arriving in the Senate. But I have not forgotten it. It was in the early 1980s and he was the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I was a young and much smaller Northern Territory politician-and in every sense. Peter Baume came to the Northern Territory-this was a decade ago-at a time when conditions for Aboriginal people were considerably worse than they are now. They were appalling in some circumstances. I am known for my tolerance and even temper but I was not displaying those qualities in those days. I had a virulent dislike of conservative politicians in respect of the issue of Aboriginal affairs because Aboriginal people had lived under a very long period of neglect and I held conservative politicians to blame for a lot of that. The only reason that I mention that is to put this incident in context. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a serious problem in the Northern Territory, which is not relevant to this debate, so I will not go into it. To my astonishment I was approached by the conservative Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who had had it suggested to him that he come to see me about this particular problem. That was at a point in my political career where I could barely manage to say, `G'day' to a conservative Federal politician. First, I was astonished that a conservative Federal Minister would come anywhere near me to ask for advice and, secondly, I decided very early in the conversation that I would have to revise my views about conservative politicians in terms of making generalisations about them and that this was a bloke who was fair dinkum. I gave him some advice; the issue was resolved and there it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I mention this is that some years later when I came to the Senate I was approached by Peter Baume during the first one or two days I was here. He said, `Hello, you probably have forgotten that some years ago when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs', et cetera. I want to tell Peter Baume now that I had not forgotten it, and still have not forgotten it. He thanked me for the advice I gave, took it and the issue was resolved. My regard for Peter Baume started from that point in time. It has been a privilege and a pleasure to work with him-and Ron Boswell has mentioned the same committee -not just in this chamber but also on the committees of this Parliament, and my regard for him has increased and deepened over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter Baume, as well as being an able and diligent politician and one of the really good people in Parliament, has made a real contribution. He has many personal attributes which not only do I not share but will never possess. I know that this will be hurtful to Senator Michael Baume, the other half of the Baume family here, but I might say that one of the differences between Michael and his cousin, Peter Baume, is that, while Michael is a very able and diligent senator, he is often nasty and at times horrible. I mention that because-being a bit honest-I must admit that, while over the years I have admired Peter Baume, I have always tended to identify with Michael Baume. I do not possess and never will -I guess it is a deficiency in my make-up-some of those qualities I admire which Peter Baume has brought to this Parliament and to public life, along with the abilities of which we are all very well aware. </PARA>
<PARA> I woke this morning to the dulcet tones of Mr Bruce Webster on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on my clock radio. He was giving his report to the ABC on today's proceedings in the Senate. Bruce Webster, as most of us know-although some of us here may not-has the job of professionally watching and listening to everything we say in this chamber. He has been doing it for a decade. No doubt, as a result-and I am sure that it will inevitably come to pass-a small green van will pull up at the gates of Parliament House and men in white coats will carry him away a gibbering wreck. Of a number of people in this Parliament Bruce is in a better position than most-along with the staff who are constrained in appearing on ABC radio, although Bruce has a bit more flexibility in that regard-to pass comments on members of this Parliament. He said this morning:</PARA>
<PARA>Today the spotlight is on the human face of Parliament. On the motion of Senator Bourne a NSW Democrat it is Professor Senator Doctor Peter Baume Day . . . and following a move by the President Kerry Sibraa, Senator Peter Baume will be Honorary President this morning. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliament is a microcosm of our society . . . the members and senators reflect our strengths and weaknesses. They come and go, often unnoticed by the community at large. However every so often someone special comes along. Peter Baume is such a person. He is admired and respected by the whole Parliament . . . in fact, dare I say it-</PARA>
<PARA>this is a bit gushy-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he is much loved. He goes on to become Professor of Community medicine at the University of NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>I quoted that because I have been in parliament now for 14 years and over that time I have come across a small number of politicians whom I have detested. That detestation for some people-no doubt equally shared-has never been because of their political views. It has been because-and it is a very small number of politicians indeed who fit into this category; I stress that I am talking about both sides of the House-they are politicians who put in the minimum and take out the maximum. Peter Baume certainly is not in that category. Over the years I have also met a number of politicians whom I have liked very much but respected very little or not at all. I have also met politicians on both sides of the House for whom I have enormous respect but do not like very much at all. I have to say-and I think I speak for a lot of people on all sides of this chamber-that I do not think I have met anyone in 14 years in Parliament whom I have both liked and respected as much as Peter Baume. Sad as Peter Baume feels-and I know he does-about leaving this Parliament, he at least leaves it with the comfort that he has the respect, regard and good wishes of everyone in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that this comment at the end of the year should first start as a personal explanation in response to Senator Collins. However, I will get the usual good wishes out of the way, not because I want to downgrade them but because I want to talk about my cousin. Mr President, I wish you, the Clerks and everyone here all the best for Christmas and the New Year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have known Senator Peter Baume for more than 50 years, which I think probably just exceeds the time that most members of the Senate have known him. When I first met him he was a very skinny little kid. He was one of the few people in the world I towered over-for a short period of time. His family home at Collaroy was almost a home away from home for me. Under the benevolent dictatorship of his father, we had a great, funny, very exciting and interesting youth. Of course we always had holidays in the country together, where my mother was able to demonstrate-I think at a height of less than five feet-that she could tower over everybody. </PARA>
<PARA> The determination and bravery of Senator Peter Baume can probably be best summed up by observing that, despite having inherited the family nose, he still played hooker for the university rugby second grade side. That bravery also took him into, as I recall, the Ku-ring-gai Municipal Library, where he obviously found more than books in the stacks. While I could do no better than a very hard cover that was on temporary loan, he managed to find a very loyal and supportive wife there. </PARA>
<PARA> When he joined Parliament 16 years ago he had achieved great status as a consulting physician and many people asked, `Why are you doing this? You are a loss to medicine; it is an incredible waste of enormous talent'. His response then was that he had become a doctor because he was concerned about people and he was becoming a politician because he was concerned about people. It seems to me that he is now becoming Professor of Community Medicine because that concern about people is still driving Peter Baume. If one asks what drives Peter Baume, it is that evident concern; and he has been fortunate enough to have the ability and opportunity to be able to put into effect ways in which he can practically and usefully express that concern. Just as he was a great loss to medicine when he came into politics, so he will be a great loss to politics as he goes back into community medicine. </PARA>
<PARA> While today is obviously a very important day to Senator Peter Baume, it is also a very important day for me, because today is the day that in effect Peter Baume ceases to be Senator Peter Baume and I cease to be Senator Michael Baume; from today I simply become Senator Baume. I have one objective which remains, however, and that is to note that Senator Peter Baume, when he ceases being Senator Peter Baume, will still be the Honourable Peter Baume in all its aspects. If I have one objective in this place, I suppose it is to gain the word `honourable' both in capital letters, as Peter has done, and in lower case, as Peter has done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I echo the words that have been espoused by speakers from all sides of the chamber in regard to Senator Peter Baume on his pending retirement from this place. I do not want to spend a long time repeating those words because many others have served a lot longer in this place than I have and have worked with Peter over a wide range of issues. I have worked with Peter in this place for the benefit of Australians, and I consider that to be a privilege to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) who made some kind remarks about me and the role that I have been fulfilling in the past few months. It seems like a few years, but I am assured it has been only a few months. I am pleased that in this period because of the actions of the Government in the Senate the country has not come to a standstill. We have completed the program on time with the help of one particular motion that was carried in this place earlier in the week. </PARA>
<PARA> The work would not have been completed-and my work would not have been done in the way it was-without the enormous assistance that has been given to me by my two deputies, Senator Foreman and Senator Faulkner. I thank them for their assistance. It also would not have been done without the able assistance of the Opposition Whips-Senator Reid, Senator Knowles and Senator McLean-and many others who combine together to make this place work. I include in that the Clerks and the staff in the Table Office out in the corridor. Special mention must be made of Joan Harvey, the Whips Clerk, who is here from well before the bells ring in the morning until they ring very late at night. Joan has had many accolades given to her in this place at this time of the year for the work that she continues to do on behalf of the Parliament, and I am pleased that I have the pleasure on this occasion of registering the thanks of the Senate for the work that she does. I think that we ought to include in those remarks the people on the other side of the corridor from the Opposition Whip's office who play an enormous role in keeping this place moving. </PARA>
<PARA> I add into that my own staff member Marianna Serghi who has worked together with Joan to assist in keeping this place going. I am aware that there is a very distinct smell in the air.

We hope to see him often.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise to recall one particular month in the history of our Parliament. May 1987, three and a half years ago, was a very sad and difficult month. It was at a time when the Opposition was not in the strongest of fortunes. It was a time when, despite the principles that my Party stand for, a very controversial issue had come before us: the question of equal employment opportunity, especially for women, disabled people and newly arrived Australians. We had already seen in the Parliament one item of legislation go through with the support of both sides of the Parliament. This was the first equal opportunity legislation. At the time, our spokesman on the status of women-and with a very careful concern for this issue and for reform in our country-was in fact Senator Peter Baume. As a senior member of the shadow Cabinet he had the carriage of this area and had called in the first debate for a similar Bill to relate to the area that in fact this second Bill in May 1987 addressed. As I say, we were in a difficult time, and I do not wish to reflect upon the political judgment of others, as there was a variety of judgments, but I wish to highlight the carefulness, the conscientiousness and the courage that Peter Baume showed in that month. It showed him to be a person who cared for the people of Australia and who cared most courageously for the principle of equality. </PARA>
<PARA> It led to a number of us disagreeing with our Party. I for one, quite independently, determined that it was the first time that I would cross the floor and vote against my colleagues. There were seven of us in the Senate who said that we will stand for the principles that our Party has foundered upon and we will stand for equality. This was our personal judgment, and we believed this to be the issue in the matter that was before us. But the burden on Peter was much greater and, whilst there were some conversations with us, there was no conspiracy, no discussion, nothing other than his personal political attitudes which were being tested. He independently resigned from the shadow Cabinet and he was not a member in the three and a half years thereafter. It was an enormous price that he paid personally for a principle that I think we should remember him for. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it was an enormous price for my Party and, in retrospect, I regard us as sitting on this side of the chamber not least because of decisions like the one made in 1987. This led to greater disunity at that time because of the way in which that was not resolved. It was an enormous price that we were not, on our side of the Parliament, able to reconcile and to recognise the principles that Peter and a number of us so conscientiously espoused then, and we espouse them now without one small apology. I hope that we can remember that Senator Peter Baume exercised human compassion and the principles of liberty and equality in all that he brought to this chamber and to our Party. He leaves us now with enormous admiration on our part. We know that he was here to serve the people, and we wish him and Jenny every success in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to do two things: to add my thanks to the staff of the Parliament, and also to pass a few remarks about Senator Peter Baume. All of us who come into this place will have remembered those first few days when one realises the vast difference which separates the workings of Parliament from what goes on outside. Particularly new senators, on those first few days when the Parliament sits way into the evening, find that all of the staff are still working, the lights are on and one has a sense that Parliament is like a great ship at sea-and several other people have remarked on this also. It is totally self-contained. It operates with incredible facility, precision, cheerfulness and independently, to some extent, of what is going on in the community outside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot mention all the staff because, as everyone knows, there are many thousands who work in this place. I recall on about the third or fourth day in this place when I asked the library for a particular reference and it came to about 7.30 at night and I thought that the library staff would have gone home. I did not think of ringing them up again. The librarian rang up and said, `Do you still want that reference?'. I said, `Oh, are you still working?'. He said `Oh, yes, we are still working as long as you are here.' I went down to the library-as it was in the old place-and was helped at great length. </PARA>
<PARA> That is characteristic of the way in which the staff work, and I see Cleaver Elliott sitting over there. All of us who have been through these last four weeks will know that we have been down to him early in the morning, in the middle of the day, late at night, saying, `Can you draft up this amendment?'. We have been met with confidence, competence and a great deal of humour, even though he has been worked very hard indeed. Before him I recall in that role Peter O'Keefe and John Vander Wyk. They served with exactly the same good humour and competence. I mention those people simply as examples because around the Parliament those are the characteristics one finds among all the staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to Senator Peter Baume. I note, as have others, that he is leaving Parliament to go back into an academic career. I have come the other way: I have come from an academic career into Parliament. I know very well that I could not go back into an academic career because I do not have the ability while I am in this place to carry on at the level required, with the sorts of understanding and work that are required. The first characteristic that one notices about Peter is that he has been able to keep up with his own speciality, which indicates an incredible intelligence and ability not only to keep up with what is happening but to remain at the forefront. One does not become appointed to a professorial position unless one is of more than just average competence and average knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Some senators will have noted that, on the last occasion on which there were valedictory speeches, I did not come into the chamber. I was in my office watching proceedings on the monitor, and I was rather concerned that I may have come into this chamber and heard things being said that were not being said with full sincerity. I have come in here today knowing that everything that is said of Senator Peter Baume will be said with complete sincerity. </PARA>
<PARA> My experience of Peter is that he has shown not only the incredible intelligence that I have mentioned, but also an enormous degree of fairness and great forthrightness in very difficult situations. I have served on several committees with Peter, and I remember one occasion not many months ago when we had before us a number of government officers. Without any messing around after these government officers had given evidence, Peter simply said, `Will you give me an answer to this question and outline the answer yes or no?'. He kept after those officers, and when he was quite unable to elicit an appropriate answer, at the end of their evidence he said straight across the table to them, `That is the worst submission I have ever heard in this place'. I do not have the courage to say that, Peter, but that was absolutely right. I have found you to be not only an intelligent and courageous person, but also an extremely fair person of supreme integrity. That is a very important quality in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join colleagues in speaking on the occasion of the departure of Senator Peter Baume from this place. Unlike some senators here, I come to praise Caesar, not to bury him. I have had the pleasure of hearing Peter Baume in this place in any number of speeches, and certainly in Estimates, where I suppose the best way to describe his contribution is, `Always the rapier, never the broadsword'. Over the last year on the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, I have been particularly appreciative of and grateful for his contribution to what I think will turn out to be a useful contribution to the ongoing debate on health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume is a man of undoubted talent, commitment and compassion. That has been said by many, and I confirm that of my own knowledge. People can be assured that, if they ever take the time to dial up the parliamentary Hansard and select the name of Senator Peter Baume, they will have a very good read. I suppose that on any number of occasions one can say, `That was a good speech' or `That was a singular contribution', but I would urge people who wish to read Senator Peter Baume's contributions particularly to check out his speeches on the war crimes legislation. However, I hate to suggest that they stop there. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the praise for this man that I have heard in this place today, I can only wonder at the Opposition, which is clearly somewhat profligate with talent. Peter Baume has taken a stand on principle and it has cost him dear. In particular, with others, as was mentioned by Senator Teague, he crossed the floor on the equal opportunity legislation. As a result of that action, I fell to thinking, by way of this valedictory, with whom I might compare this man. Senator Peter Baume is something of a philosopher. Perhaps then he is a Thomas Aquinas. Do not fear, Senator Baume, Thomas Aquinas might be right on philosophy, but he was awful on women. Thomas Aquinas reckoned that they are a `deformed species of the human race, only conceived when the wind blows from the north'. That would not do as an analogy at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Then perhaps I could consider Senator Peter Baume as a gentleman and scholar. Perhaps I could see whether Samuel Johnson was a model. What I found in the Library assisted me in this because Samuel Johnson said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am very fond of the company of ladies. I like their beauty, I like their delicacy, I like their vivacity, and I like their silence. </PARA>
<PARA>That will not do either. No, he cannot be a gentleman and a scholar of the Samuel Johnson sort. As Senator Peter Baume is a person concerned with due process and good order, committed to using the law for change, I thought that maybe Jeremy Bentham would do. We know that Jeremy Bentham's contribution was that the dominant group in society that has the power can determine the good. Bentham thought that superior power was its own moral justification. Thus, he taught that the superior legal rights of men were justified because they had physical power and because women were `delicate, inferior in strength and hardiness of body, in point of knowledge, intellectual powers and firmness of mind'. That will not do either, Senator Baume. None of those captured your contribution or what you have given us to understand is your view and the sort of person you are. </PARA>
<PARA> I concluded from my little search that, Senator Baume, you are your own man, and that is probably one of the greatest ways in which you have contributed to this place. I wish you well in your new career in medicine. Parliament's loss is medicine's gain. I trust that Senator Herron and I will be able to continue your practice in this place. I look forward to your contribution in community health, and when and if you ever have to come before the Estimates committees, I hope that I am present. My best wishes to you, to Jenny and the family. </PARA>

To say farewell to Senator Peter Baume is a sad day for many of us. However, one always has to be mindful that, when a person is moving on to do something of his choice, we should and do wish him well in his future endeavours. I wish to place on record my personal thanks to Senator Baume for being a great friend and a wonderful colleague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When former Senator Lajovic made his last speech to the Senate, I had been here for only a few months, but he said one thing that struck a real chord in me:</PARA>
<PARA>I thank all my friends and supporters in the Liberal Party. It is impossible to name all of them, but there is one person I have to name, Senator Peter Baume. He guided me in my first days here and was constantly at my side, always willing to help.</PARA>
<PARA>As a new girl at the time sitting beside him, I could well and truly empathise with his sentiments at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter has always been ready, willing and able and never too busy to share his vast experience with new and old colleagues alike. Many people in my own very conservative State of Western Australia found it puzzling, to say the least, to believe or understand, for that matter, how I could consider Senator Baume, coming from a much more damp State, a friend. But Parliament is no different from any other aspect of life, and a prerequisite of friends should not be having to agree with them on everything-thank heavens. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter's experience and wisdom is something that, I believe, will be missed by this Parliament generally and by the Senate in particular. His medical skills will also be missed by many. While Peter never professed-pardon the pun-to have the answers for every illness, the fact remains that he did. One of my staff, Jeremy Buxton, said the other day that even though he had never been to Peter for a consultation, he recognised him as one of the most supremely caring and decent people that he had encountered in 21 years of political involvement. He also said-in a bit of a heavy note, I suppose-if he were ever to receive bad news from a doctor, Peter Baume is exactly the sort of man from whom he would want to learn that news because of his compassion. We can all relate to a lot of that because, Peter, we do recognise you as a very caring and decent gentleman. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter's wife, Jenny, who is sitting up there today also deserves recognition for her fine contribution over Peter's 17 years in the Senate and the Parliament, and for helping his contribution to the Liberal Party. It has always been a pleasure to see you, Jenny. I hope we will see a lot more of you in the future and keep up that smile. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter, thank you for what you have done for the Liberal Party. Thank you for what you have done for the Parliament, and thank you for your advice and friendship. I wish you well in your new role as the honourable professor. I wish you, Jenny, and your family all the best in your new phase of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, many honourable senators have been kind enough to come into the chamber for this small occasion and to all of those senators, thanks. Some senators have been kind enough to speak, and I apologise to those who would still like to speak but I am conscious of the time and of the nearness of 3.45 p.m. To you, Mr President, to the Clerks, to the Hansard staff, to the librarians, to the drivers, to the committee secretaries, to the Senate officers, the attendants and the waitresses-thank you not just for what you have done this year, but for what you have done over the long period since 1974 for me personally. You have all been very kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to thank my colleagues too for their friendship, for their tolerance, for their collegiality and for their kindness. I want to thank you, Mr President, and the Senate for the great honour you did me this morning and say how much it was appreciated. I would like to thank the attendants in this place for an event earlier this week where they made a presentation to me which moved me very much. </PARA>
<PARA> Valedictories, while the person is alive, have something of an anticipatory quality. It is the kind of occasion where only the good is remembered, where people's attributes are magnified and where faults are conveniently forgotten. It is an important occasion for the individual; one that should occur once only and in my case, Senator Teague, it will be once only. I will probably take the advice of some of my colleagues and not return. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is an opportunity for a look back and a retrospective view of one's parliamentary career and what one has done. On that score let others judge. I do not care to do so. I just mention that when I was a Whip and we brought down the guillotine, we did not just bring down a guillotine, we brought down a guillotine with a gag attached. But in any event, Mr President, I did come here with less understanding than I have now. I have taken part in some great events; some of them quite painful to those dear to me; and some have been mentioned today. The thing about it is that one grows in the process of moving through those events, whether it is 1975, 1987 or whatever. I have grown in terms of passion and in terms of clarity of view. I have grown because of the crises and I would not have avoided them. </PARA>
<PARA> This question of growth and understanding-perhaps it is the same with all honourable senators. Honourable senators should leave this place with no apologies and they should remember that senators are a better quality than people outside generally acknowledge, even if they are not always of the quality they give themselves. But senators, if I may say so, do lack a sense of history. There is a story about General Douglas MacArthur, to whom an apology was made by a newspaper, I think in San Francisco, in which it said that it had made the great error of undervaluing him simply because he overvalued himself. That is a good story. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps honourable senators might consider that we sometimes lack a sense of historical perspective. We sometimes ignore the lessons of those who built up the Senate over 90 years since Federation. If we do forget those lessons, Mr President, we know that we are doomed to relearn them the painful way. </PARA>
<PARA> Retirement from the Parliament is one such matter. There are people who have been here previously who have given some very good advice about retirement. I think the only privy councillor we have had in recent years, Senator the Rt Hon. Reg Withers, advised me not once but three times, and twice in writing, to get out. He made the point that those who left voluntarily do so with much less bitterness than those whose retirement is forced upon them. Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has probably told Senator Kemp the same thing. She told me that she has not missed the place once since she left. Sir Robert Cotton made a complete break when he left, after a very distinguished career here. And of course, Senator Powell, your predecessor, Senator Michael Macklin, having made his own decision, spent the next three months urging me to follow him-which I am now doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators sometimes think that the Senate began when they arrived and that it will end when they leave; that its only existence is for that brief period when honourable senators are here. Because I am leaving today, I do not have that view. Honourable senators sometimes think that they are immortal and invincible. They know in an intellectual sense that they will go some time, but that is something to be put off. The Senate only exists because they are here. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, in medicine we sometimes talk about the process that we call denial. It is quite useful sometimes, but it can be difficult if it is taken too far. `Golden lads and girls' who read Cymbeline might care to remember their inevitable association with chimney sweepers. It is the institution, Mr President, that is continuous. It is the Senate that continues; not the senators. The Senate outlasts Presidents, Clerks, officers and senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I arrived here, I have seen some absolutely amazing characters leave this place. Senator Justin O'Byrne was a senator for 33 years. We have only had the Senate existing since 1901, for 90 years. He served a large part of that time. Then there was Senator Sir Reginald Wright, and also Senator Ian Wood, who served 27 years. Senator Douglas McClelland and Senator Peter Rae served 20 years each. Yet, when each of them left, they were forgotten one day later; it was as if they had never been here. That is as it should be. The view of the Senate is resolutely towards the future. There is little time for any regrets or any farewells, and almost no time for a backward glance. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button, Senator Walsh and I came into the Senate at the same time-I think only Senator Durack, the father of the Senate, has been here longer. In the Parliament which I entered I had as Party colleagues John Gorton, Don Chipp, Bill Snedden, Ian Macphee and Alan Missen-all of whom just happened to be good liberals and all of whom are now gone. They were forgotten one day after they left. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter how long honourable senators serve; their role is in helping the institution. It does not matter, Mr Clerk, how long you are here; you are but the present Clerk in a line that stretches from the past and will carry on into the future. It does not matter, Black Rod, how long you are here; you are the link between the Black Rods past and present. It is the same for all honourable senators. So I look forward, with some pleasure, to knowing who it is that my division will eventually choose to replace me and who will come here next year in my place. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the General of the United Army, Douglas MacArthur. As an old man he returned to the United States Military Academy at West Point, of which he had been Commandant, to receive the highest honour that the Academy could confer. And he made an amazing speech-he used no notes at the age of 82. In the peroration of that speech he mentioned that wherever he was his mind would come back always to, `The corps, and the corps, and the corps . . . '. The best testament to the service of any individual senator in this place will be not what rank he or she achieved-whether that senator was a Minister, whether that senator got into Cabinet, whether that senator did this or that. The best testament will be through his or her part in sustaining and developing the Senate itself; in contributing to the vigour of the Senate, in contributing to its procedures, to its capacities and to its role and to determining whether the senators have contributed towards the strength of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that a former senator, Fred Chaney, was once asked whether the parliament lacked power. Chaney's answer was that the parliament lacks no power, what it lacks is parliamentarians to use the power it has. Each of us have a duty to think about our contribution and our role in the parliament. I say to officers: I have set these things out so you can know what my objectives are and if you wish to question me later we can go into performance indicators and performance standards. When Arthur William Edgar O'Shaughnessy wrote a very famous poem, he ended it with the lines:</PARA>
<PARA>For each age is a dream that is dying; or one that is coming to birth. </PARA>
<PARA>He could have been talking about the Senate and its progress, movement and change. I leave now in line with the advice of Reg Withers, at a time of my own choosing, to go to a career of my own choosing-to a third career; to a position of value and worth to teach medical students in a fine department in a great university. Of course, there is sadness and loss, particularly with regard to the friendships and the company of significant people. But I go to do more work to contribute to the education of young doctors. So, Mr President, I will not be here when you return in February, but always there will remain in my mind the Senate, and the Senate, and the Senate. I wish you all well and I wish you good fortune for your remaining time here and for the work you undertake on behalf of this institution and this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that Peter did not think he was now closing the debate because there are still a few of us who would like to say just a few things about him. I have worked with Peter in roughly the same area of interest for the past 15 years, but particularly in my first three or four years in this place when Peter and I served on the same committees. Peter and I have disagreed on many issues. It started with the first report we put out together. Peter was the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Social Welfare which released a report entitled Drug Problems in Australia-an Intoxicated Society? Senator Peter Baume, Senator Grimes and I were members of that particular Committee, along with others who have now left the Senate. As honourable senators would be aware, Senator Grimes has also left the Senate. But I mention his name because he also contributed to the next report we compiled, which was entitled Through a Glass Darkly. Senator Baume was also Chairman of that Committee, and it was one that I found fascinating as a fairly new senator because I can tell my colleagues who are unaware that this is really what started the real evaluation process that has gone on ever since. We called that report Through a Glass Darkly because there was no evaluation, not only within the Government, of any of the programs that the Government put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember Senator Peter Baume asking the senior departmental officer of the Department of Health, `What is the purpose of hospitals?'. The officer said, `Would you mind repeating your question?', and Senator Baume said, `It is a very simple question. What is the purpose of your hospitals?'. The officer said, `I am sorry, Senator, I just don't understand your question'. That was the first indication to me of just how far we were going. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember very well Senator Baume asking the head departmental officer of the Department of Social Security, `How do you assess that your policies are really reaching the people that they are meant to reach?'. The officer replied, `From the correspondence we get in'. Senator Baume said, `Would you like to rephrase that?', and the departmental officer said, `No, I would not like to rephrase that. It is exactly how the Department works'. That, of course, caused quite a discussion along the lines of what happens to all of those people who would never think, or be capable, of writing a letter to the Department to say, `You are not reaching me'. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to keep my remarks very short because I have just had the nod from so many of my colleagues who want to join me in speaking for just a few minutes. But I think that I have priority because I have been here for a lot longer and I have worked with Senator Baume in so many areas. As I have said, even though we disagreed about many things right from the first report-although I would say that there were only about three areas upon which we have disagreed, Peter-we have agreed on by far the majority of occasions. Senator Baume, I certainly wish you everything you could possibly wish yourself in your next career. </PARA>

<PARA> I will briefly speak about Peter Baume. He is a former Whip and he has set a high standard for Whips. He has always been extremely helpful to me since I became Deputy Whip. He has a subtle way of letting you know what should be done in a way that you always accept as meaningful and of value. I have known him since shortly after he came into the Parliament, as I was active in the Party organisation at that time. I most certainly have valued his and Jenny's friendship, which we will make sure that we retain. </PARA>

It is neither the time nor the place to go into what is one of the outstanding 10-day periods of our lives, greatly contributed to, Peter, by your knowledge, empathy and care of the place and what you were able to convey to all of us who were with you at that time. It is certainly something I shall always remember. Best wishes, Jenny and Peter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to the honourable Senator, Doctor, Professor Peter Baume. In so doing, I say briefly that as a new chum on the block, Peter Baume has challenged me intellectually on a number of issues when he sometimes thought that I could have seen another view. He has coached me in procedure and, in particular, in performance on Estimates. I think that his wisest counsel there has been to say, `If you don't know the answer, don't ask the question'. He has also been a counsellor to whom I have turned a couple of times in personal need. As a challenger, as a coach and a counsellor he has been a great colleague.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As an even newer chum, I was moved by Senator Peter Baume's speech. He left me, as a new boy, with three messages. The first is his great love of this chamber and the huge potential that this chamber has. The second is the fact that we are but a link in a long chain. The third is that how strong that link is and how effective we are, how effective this chamber will be. I thank you Senator for those thoughts. They are most valuable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a new chum I briefly mention the enormous amount of help that I-and I am sure my colleagues-have received in my induction to this chamber. I particularly thank you, Mr President. The training course that you presided over in the early days was most helpful. I thank you for that. I might say-in some encouragement-no matter how bad people think this chamber is, I spent some time as a staff member in the other place, and we are still miles ahead. But we still have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly thank the Clerks for their help and guidance and for the courses that they gave perhaps to try to encourage us to not adopt the bad habits of the chamber but to adopt the appropriate procedures and appropriate performance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise as one of the new chums. I wish to add my appreciation for the work that this chamber, you, Mr President, the Deputy President and the Clerks are doing. I also wish to distance myself from the motion moved today. When I came into this chamber I was somewhat surprised not only by the support, the efficiency and the cheerfulness with which all help was offered but also by a certain quality of deference. In fact, I was occasionally embarrassed by it. I hope that we do not take this too far-that we do not take it to the point where we deny people who work very hard in this chamber and who believe, as we do, in the ideals of what we are doing and the right to express an opinion. I know that that kind of humility would cause some of my friends to look at me with some degree of surprise but I can assure honourable senators that on this occasion it is genuine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Peter Baume and I go back a long time. I first met him in the mid-1970s when he, although in the Opposition party, supported the Australian assistance program, which I was intimately connected with. I appreciated his position then. To this day he has continued this tradition of independence and commitment to issues. I have some personal appreciation of the private member's Bill that he brought forward two days ago. Seeing that I, as a child, witnessed war crimes at first hand committed by people of many nations, and provided there is agreement from other honourable senators, I would be honoured indeed were I able to continue the work on that Bill. Senator Baume, we shall all miss you. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of businesses, for whatever reason, are matters for regret. However I consider that it is not appropriate for government to involve itself in the day to day operations of particular industries or members of those industries except to the extent that matters of safety or other regulation need to be addressed from a federal perspective.</PARA>
<PARA> The matters raised by Senator Kernot are not specifically matters for the land transport portfolio and I have consulted with appropriate Ministers in the preparation of this response.</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these comments, the answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that there were no special provisions in the awards of the employees of Deluxe Coachlines that would provide any additional benefits in the event of the failure of the organisation. Accordingly, the employees were entitled to one week's wages in lieu of notice in addition to accrued wages, leave and other entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA> These entitlements become calls on the company and rank for distribution of the asset disposal proceeds of the company according to the normal rules for such distributions. The distribution in the case of Deluxe is a matter for the Receiver having regard to the status of other creditors.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are no protections available to the purchasers of prepaid travel fares other than that they may have a claim against the distribution of the proceeds of the disposal of Deluxe's assets. The ranking of these passengers would depend on the status of other creditors.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that other carriers provided assistance to Deluxe passengers in the first week or so after the company ceased to operate where those carriers had spare capacity. This provided relief to a large number of travellers who might otherwise have been stranded and I would like to commend those carriers for providing this assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The bus travel market has been oversupplied for some time. Significant increase in capacity was provided by the industry to meet expected demand for the Bicentennial and Expo.</PARA>
<PARA> Industry sources indicate that patronage has declined significantly since then and that the capacity provided by existing operators is adequate to meet existing and anticipated demand.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No special federal government assistance is currently made available to the coach building industry in Australia. The government takes the view that industry is capable of planning for all levels of demand, both high and low. The industry, like any other, operates in a commercial environment and planning decisions are the proper province for industry management.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Following a series of benefit/cost studies on Adelaide-Melbourne standardisation undertaken during 1988 by the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) and V/Line, there has been only a limited amount of work undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> Studies undertaken during 1989 and 1990 were preliminary engineering studies of alternative routes to avoid the steep grades, tight curves and restrictive tunnels through the Adelaide Hills.</PARA>
<PARA> Major investigative work has been suspended pending developments on the National Freight Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> Following a submission by AN, the Minister for Land Transport recently approved funding from the Australian Centennial Roads Development program of $21.029 million over a three year period to upgrade a 100 km section of the main south line from Coonalpyn to the Victorian border. AN is in the process of letting contracts for this project.</PARA>
<PARA> The upgrading will include replacement of poor condition wooden sleepers, with concrete, gauge convertible sleepers.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Cost estimates have been prepared for a number of options. Simple standardisation on the existing corridor has been estimated at $90m but this would not involve any alignment upgrades and would preserve the tight curves and height and speed restrictions through the Adelaide Hills, and alignment problems elsewhere such as near Bacchus Marsh. Standardisation with a new, improved alignment through the Adelaide Hills has been costed at $350m. Standardisation with a new alignment through the Adelaide Hills and a track upgrade elsewhere, including the easing of grades and all tight curves with improved alignment options to enable full double stacking and lifting of speed restrictions, has been estimated to cost $550m. All figures are in June 1989 values.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The matter of the Wolseley to Mount Gambier line has not been considered further since the 1988 studies. The options considered then included the standardisation of the Wolseley to Mount Gambier link and retention of broad gauge (possibly involving mixed gauge) into Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The National Freight Initiative should provide an opportunity for standardisation of Adelaide-Melbourne to be considered further. A National Network Study, which will include consideration of the Melbourne-Adelaide standard gauge project, has been proposed for funding under the $50 million allocation which the Minister for Land Transport announced would be made available from the Centennial Roads Development program for rail infrastructure upgrading proposals in connection with the National Freight Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The current position of the State Government of Victoria in respect of the project is not known.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Following a decision by the Government to establish the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports (SIDCDE) the Committee met eight times in 1988, four times in 1989 and once to date in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> Meetings have been primarily concerned with policy issues rather than consideration of export applications as the number of applications and the requirement to meet a 21 day deadline for approvals meant that relying on meetings to consider cases would not give exporters the prompt decisions they require. It was therefore agreed by departments that those cases the SIDCDE required to consider would be dealt with out of session on an individual basis. This usually involves facsimile transmission of application details and SIDCDE member responses.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) (i) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) No. Applications for controlled goods not covered by Regulation 13b are referred to the appropriate authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The answer to 9 (b) (ii) is No.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Decisions to refer are made on the basis of the policy agreed by Ministers and the SIDCDE. A good indicator of these criteria is given in ``Guidelines for Exporters-Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods'' (July 1989), paras. 8-12 (for Part 1 and 2 goods), paras. 36-37 (for Part 3 goods), and paras. 41-42 (precedents).</PARA>
<PARA> (12) (a) &amp;(b) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), along with other Departments, has agreed which category of applications it wishes to see (i.e. to which destinations and what type of goods). The remaining applications are processed within the Department of Defence. This policy has been agreed by Ministers. Further to this, formal and informal referral occurs, where it is felt that an application is likely to be of interest to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. A quarterly summary of applications and approvals is provided to all SIDCDE members.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Approvals-in-principle are considered carefully to save exporters marketing effort and expenses. Nevertheless, irrespective of the issue of an ``approval-in-principle'', a follow-up export application is treated as a separate application and is processed in accordance with policy guidelines. In particular the application would be referred to the SIDCDE if it met the criteria for referral. This is important because of the possibilities of changed circumstances after issue of an ``approval-in-principle''. Apart from such changes in circumstances relating to an application, exporters could expect SIDCDE decisions on permits to be consistent with decisions on ``applications in principle''.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) No</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No</PARA>
<PARA> (14) (a) No, except in broad terms of the guidelines agreed by Ministers as indicated in answer to (11).</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes. The potential exporter would generate a request for ``approval-in-principle'' in the early stages of marketing. The criteria applied are the same as for considering an application for an export permit as indicated in answer to (11). Depending on the type of equipment and destination the application would be subject to normal SIDCDE consultation. The ``approval-in- principle'' would be given by the Minister for Defence or the delegate.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) No ``approval-in-principle'' was sought or given prior to the HdeH application for a permit to export trainer aircraft engine parts to Iraq. As the goods were covered by Part 1b in Schedule 13 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations and because of military advice that the parts were ``not of major military significance'', it was not required under Government policy to refer the application to the SIDCDE. However, in view of potential sensitivities the views of DFAT were sought prior to issue of the permit. DFAT had no objections to the export which was approved by the delegate on 28 May 1990 and revoked on 7 August 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) (a) On the basis of advice obtained from the Attorney-General's Department, I believe that the answers to the first part of the question are: (i) No; (ii) No; (iii) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> However, my Department is seeking further advice in the light of a recent decision of the High Court in the case of Bropho vs the State of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) If by ``procedures'' you mean the policy criteria specified in the ``Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods'' as applying to the consideration of an application then the answers to the question are: (i) Yes; (ii) No; (iii) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) While this question does not apply in view of the response in 16 (b) above, I advise that a direction has been given that the export of ex-ADF equipment for disposal action by the Commonwealth or exported as part of a Defence Co-operation Program, will be subject to the same guidelines and policies promulgated in the document ``Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods''.</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental directions for processing export applications are contained in a procedures manual which I can provide for the Senator's information if he wishes.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="6400" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Pak-Poy and Kneebone Pty Ltd with Henderson Consultants reviewed the Defence commercial vehicle fleets in 1988 with assistance from a Defence Review Team and presented the following reports:</PARA>
<PARA> Consultancy Study-Army Commercial Vehicle Fleet Phase 1B</PARA>
<PARA> Consultancy Study-Review of Defence Commercial Vehicle Fleet Phase 2 (Navy, Air Force, remainder of Defence)</PARA>
<PARA> Copies of these reports are available.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The following recommendations agreed by the Services are being implemented:</PARA>
<PARA> The Services should maintain the ownership of their CL vehicle fleets but in so doing should adopt new acquisition and disposal criteria which are no less advantageous than those pursued by DAS and commercial operators.</PARA>
<PARA> Even though there would be a long term cost advantage from the Department owning its own fleet, at this stage it should continue to hire its CL vehicles from DAS where it does so at present (ownership would require Government approval for an exemption from current rules).</PARA>
<PARA> A substantially self-funding arrangement should be adopted in which funds generated from the disposal of Service CL vehicles are preserved and applied directly to the procurement of replacement Service CL vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> In the present sales tax free environment, a basic replacement criteria of 2 years/40000 km should be adopted to maximise the sales tax advantages of self-funding.</PARA>
<PARA> An automated fleet management information system (Fleet MIS) should be introduced by each Vehicle Controller within Defence to provide information to allow managers to make timely decisions and to enable their fleets, as a whole, to be operated in a cost-effective manner.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements and organisational structures for the management of the various fleets should be simplified and the resources devoted to vehicle fleet management should be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> A standardised system of vehicle nomenclature and groupings should be adopted throughout Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> VIP and ceremonial Service vehicles should continue to be purchased in Service colours. Other vehicles should be purchased in colours which maximise the returns from sale.</PARA>
<PARA> Defence air-conditioning policies should be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA> Vehicles should be purchased with accessories, options and specifications which would optimise returns from sale.</PARA>
<PARA> Whole of life costs should be considered during acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA> Defence should establish and maintain appropriate channels of communication with DAS and pursue the scope for obtaining discounts in other than just the long haul area.</PARA>
<PARA> The scope for increased use of civilian contractors for repair and maintenance should be examined.</PARA>
<PARA> A series of initiatives should be taken to develop and introduce disposal arrangements which would optimise returns from the sale of Defence owned vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the early stages, some resistance was experienced but, as staff have become better informed and more aware of the benefits of improved fleet management practices, this resistance is no longer evident and indeed has been replaced by support.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Services are aware, at the macro level, of the personnel costs involved in operating commercial vehicle fleets. There is not the same awareness at the micro levels where the actual vehicles are managed. There are currently no regular reports of these particular personnel costs made to senior management. However the Commercial Vehicle Management Program initiatives now being introduced will improve visibility of these costs at all levels of management.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As with personnel costs, vehicle operating and maintenance costs are available at a macro level. Current management information systems do not readily provide detailed information on operating costs for commercial vehicles. The introduction of a new Fleet Management Information System in early 1991 will provide the means for the Services to capture, analyse and report this information down to the level of individual vehicles if required.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The management of the Services commercial vehicle fleets is not contracted out. The consultants recommended that the management of commercial vehicles remain within Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The estimated cost to bring the Services' commercial vehicle fleets up to an efficient standard was an additional $36m over two years. Substantial savings would then accrue. These funds are not available and a longer term funding option is being undertaken with additional funds being provided to the Services for implementation of the initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism, and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Aboriginal Arts Committee considered the draft report at its meeting of 13 and 14 September 1990. Following this meeting the Director of the Aboriginal Arts Unit, which provides administrative support for the Committee, notified the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation (ACF) that funding would cease from 1 January 1992 given that, with the development of new administrative structures for Aboriginal affairs and the increasing demands made on the Committee's funding, the ACF would be more appropriately funded through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). This decision is consistent with recommendations made in the draft report. The draft report has not been amended by the Aboriginal Arts Unit.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australia Council has an extensive national program of support for traditional cultural heritage which includes support for festivals and ceremonial activities, dance groups and art centres in Northern Australia. Officers of the Aboriginal Arts Unit have ongoing consultations on this subject with a range of organisations in this field, including those referred to. The Australia Council has previously had discussions with the ACF, ATSIC and the Northern Territory Government about ACF funding. The ACF and ATSIC have been informed of the decision to cease ACF funding, and the reasons for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) It is expected that the final report will be completed by the end of December 1990 for submission to the Aboriginal Arts Committee. A copy of the report, together with any responses of the Aboriginal Arts Unit and Australia Council decisions on the matter, can be made available to the Honourable Senator.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The proportion of the Australian Regular Army (ARA) in each category is:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 28.43% or 8 165 ARA;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 16.13% or 4 634 ARA; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 55.44% or 15 923 ARA.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Due to the categorisation of units within the Army Order of Battle it is not possible to identify a breakdown of figures into purely ARA and Army Reserve (ARes) when considering the Army's WEM. WEM is an indicative figure only, and as such provides a target to which Army would aim in time of expansion to meet a defence emergency. The method by which the Army might achieve such an expansion may see ARes personnel being posted into ARA units to `round-out' these units to WEM. Therefore the figure given for WEM in Table D is the total manpower requirement for each component in time of defence emergency and cannot be broken down further. Given this explanation the following table provides a breakdown of figures into ARA and ARes for Authorised Manpower and Actual Manning (as at 30 June 1990) only.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The following funds have been approved for the Development Import Finance Facility since the 1985-86 financial year:</PARA>
<PARA> 1986-87...$15,900,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1987-88...$30,000,000</PARA>

<PARA> 1989-90...$93,300,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1990-91...$83,800,000</PARA>
<PARA> These funds are associated with export credits from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation of the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE-EFIC).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian content requirements applying to exports approved for DIFF assistance are that the equipment or service being exported must be wholly or mainly of Australian origin. The figure generally agreed upon between AIDAB and AUSTRADE-EFIC is at least 75% Australian content.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) All the required checks have been, and are being carried out by AUSTRADE-EFIC on the Australian content level of DIFF-supported projects. This is part of established AUSTRADE-EFIC procedures undertaken before the exporter receives payment for goods and services supplied. These procedures include a signed Exporter's Declaration that must accompany all claims for payment. The Declaration requires the exporter to indicate any goods, for which payment is claimed, that are not wholly produced or manufactured in Australia. A similar declaration is required for services.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the increase in funds allocated to DIFF, a Project Monitoring Unit was established within AUSTRADE-EFIC in November 1989. The Unit's objectives are to monitor the progress of projects for which loan funds are being drawn, and to establish in greater detail project compliance with various requirements, including Australian content.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The above checks have led to several enquiries to exporters. In all cases the Australian content level was found to be within the required limit.</PARA>
