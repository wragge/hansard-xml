<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petitions of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported;</PARA>
<PARA> that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the ACT Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material;</PARA>
<PARA> that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>

<PARA>2. exclude from the `R'-rating all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA> We are employees of Greenridge Botanicals, a company which manufacturers herbal products and we view with great concern the proposed Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 which we understand will be shortly debated in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> From our understanding of the Act and the Regulations it appears to us that small manufacturers such as Greenridge will not be able to comply with the provisions without a massive injection of capital or borrowings, which under the current economic conditions will be impossible to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA> We feel that if the regulations as currently drafted, are adopted, then the future for this company, and consequently our jobs, is very bleak.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable senators will be aware that these regulations were disallowed yesterday by the Senate. The regulations were also, however, being considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. On 14 May I reported to the Senate on the concerns of the Committee, which related to important matters affecting personal liberties and parliamentary proprieties, and gave a protective notice of motion of disallowance in respect of the regulations. On that day I wrote to the Honourable Peter Staples, MP, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, outlining the Committee's concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next day, 15 May, the Minister replied to the Committee with a prompt and helpful response, which the Committee this morning agreed met its concerns. The Minister agreed to amend significant aspects of the regulations. With respect to other matters, the Minister directed the Department to review the regulations with a view to amendment to meet its concerns, wherever this was possible. The Minister also directed the Secretary to take certain administrative action, and explained other matters to the Committee's satisfaction. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for this helpful commitment to its principles. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to table and incorporate in Hansard the correspondence of the Committee with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The correspondence read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Honourable Peter Staples</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Housing and Aged Care</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra ACT</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No. 88, and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No. 89, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 17 May 1990. The Committee was concerned at a member of aspects of these Statutory Rules. I shall deal first with the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Although review of some important decisions of the Secretary (after reconsideration by the Minister) by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is provided for, a number of other discretions are provided for in rr.14 (2) (a), 19 (b), 20 (a), 20 (b), 20 (b) (ii) (B), 22 (6), 25, 28, 30 (3), 31, 45 and 46. By way of example, under r.45 the Secretary may apparently waive or refuse to waive fees which, in one case, are set at $34,700. Another fee is set at $23,000. The Committee believes that it may not be appropriate for the adverse exercise of such important discretions to be unreviewable. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Regulation 47 provides that the Secretary may delegate any of his or her powers and functions to any officer of the Department, no matter how junior. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes this power may be too wide, considering the commercial and livelihood implications of the Regulations. To continue the same example as in the previous paragraph, it is not appropriate that power exists to delegate to a junior officer in the Department the legal authority to waive unlimited amounts of Commonwealth revenue. It seems appropriate in all the circumstances to restrict delegation to Senior Executive Service officers. </PARA>
<PARA> In this general context, your advice is also sought on the wide power to the Secretary in r.23 to authorise ``authorised officers''. Given the nature of the powers of these authorised officers, it is assumed that it would not be suitable to restrict authorisations to SES officers. The Committee would, however, welcome your advice that authorisations will only be to officers of appropriate level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that under s.57 of the parent Act the Minister or the Secretary may delegate to any officer of the Department, or to any officer of another Department or Commonwealth authority having functions relating to therapeutic goods, which is a wider power than exists under the Regulations. The Committee would welcome your advice on the reasons for this difference. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The definition of ``drugs'' in r.2 can be varied by a declaration of the Secretary by notice in the Gazette. This function, on its face legislative in nature, does not appear to be subject to tabling and disallowance, an essential requirement for legislative instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Regulation 3 refers to the Therapeutic Goods and Cosmetics Act 1986 of the Northern Territory. For some years the Northern Territory has omitted the date or Acts from its citations. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Regulation 14 (2) (a) authorises the Secretary to fix a time for transfers. In such cases it is usual to provide for a ``reasonable time''. Similarly, r.19 (b) requires the supply of ``details of persons''. Such details could be intrusive into privacy unless qualified by a reasonableness requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Regulations set up a number of Committees to advise the Minister on matters with important personal rights and commercial implications. The members of these Committees are appointed by the Minister, which is usual. Regulation 38 (3), however, gives the Minister an absolute right to remove any member without cause or giving any reason. This is most unusual, as in cases of term of years appointments to statutory committees, in these cases of only 3 years maximum, members are generally liable to be removed only for expressly provided reasons such as misbehaviour, physical or mental incapacity, bankruptcy or imprisonment. Members of these Committees, presumably reputable and eminent figures, should not be liable to summary removal. Such a procedure could scarcely contribute to high standards of independent advice, and the reputations of the professionals involved in Committees may suffer if effectively dismissed without reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Regulation 40 provides that acting members of Committees are appointed by the Chairperson, rather than by the Minister, the latter of which being the usual procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Committee would like further advice on aspects of fees and charges in the Regulations and, in this case, in the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Regulations. Difficulties with the lack of review of the power to waive fees and the delegation of this power have been raised earlier. In addition, the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, s.59 (2), provides that fees prescribed under that Act must not be such as to amount to taxation. There is no similar provision in the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989. There appears to be no express assurance in the Explanatory Statement that the fees do not amount to taxation apart from advice that ``The scale of fees is determined following advice to the Minister by an Industry-Government Consultative Committee which meets periodically to discuss the structure of the fees''. This Committee does not appear to be set up by the Regulations and there is no obligation to consult it. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on whether the Industry-Government Committee was consulted on the present fees, whether it gave advice and whether the advice was accepted. Your advice would also be appreciated as to whether that Committee was consulted in relation to fees imposed by the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Regulations. If this was not, the Committee asks whether this could be done in future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has had a limited time to consider these Regulations and the above are preliminary comments. If the Committee has additional comments these will be sent to you as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Your early advice would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 14 May 1990 in which you draw attention to concerns raised by the Committee regarding the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Regulations. I deal with each of these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. I share the view of the Committee that as many discretions as possible in the regulations should be subject to external merits review. As you know, the Regulations already provide AAT review of the most important of these discretions. Nevertheless, I am pleased to give an undertaking to amend r.45 to provide for AAT review of the power of the Secretary or the delegate to waive or reduce fees. With respect to the other discretions mentioned by the Committee, I have directed the Department to review these provisions with a view to favourable provision of AAT review wherever feasible. </PARA>
<PARA> I am willing to give an undertaking to restrict the power of delegation under r.47 to waive or reduce fees to SES officers of the Department. I have also directed the Department to review provisions for the delegation of other functions of the Secretary to provide, wherever possible, for delegations to be restricted to SES officers. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The delegation power in the Regulations is narrower than under the parent Act, in my view quite properly, because the Therapeutic Goods Act was of course debated in Parliament while the Regulations were made without the benefit of such debate. Discretions in the Regulations were therefore kept to the minimum possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Your assumptions regarding the functions of ``authorised officers'' are correct. In order to meet any possible concerns of the Committee, however, I have directed the Secretary to ensure that authorisations under r.23 are made to suitably senior officers. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The provision is equivalent to provisions in the Act (subsection 3 (1) therapeutic devices, section 7, subsection 16 (2) ). The purpose of the provision is to define whether therapeutic goods are either drugs or devices in cases where the distinction may not be clear for example a device containing a drug. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. I undertake to correct the citation. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. I undertake to include the word ``reasonable'' in r.12 (2) (a) and r.19 (b). </PARA>
<PARA> 6. I undertake to provide that the Minister may remove Committee members only for proven misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. I undertake to provide that the Minister, rather than the Chairperson, may appoint acting members of Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. I assure the Committee that the fees imposed by the Therapeutic Goods Regulations do not amount to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic pattern of fees was developed in consultation with the Industry organisations prior to the implementation of the Industry-Government Consultative Committee and has subsequently been amended in line with the advice of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> This process also applied to charges under the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust the above meets the concerns of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely</PARA>

The objectives of the new scheme are to reduce the incidence and costs of work related injury in Commonwealth employment, to return injured employees to work as soon as possible, to provide fairer income-related benefits for injured workers, to make employers more accountable for the costs of injury, illness and unsafe workplaces, and to improve the efficiency of decision-making about compensation entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> Comcare has made significant progress towards achieving these objectives with an approach based on the integration of prevention, rehabilitation and compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new benefits package, which came into effect on 1 December 1988, reduces the financial hardship formerly experienced by injured workers, especially those with long term work disabilities. Early intervention by rehabilitation experts ensures that programs are implemented and employees return to work in far greater numbers and sooner than before. The premium system provides incentives to encourage the prevention of workplace injuries and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured or sick workers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the new legislation, Comcare has been able to achieve a saving of $12m, or 14 per cent, of the projected cost made between December 1988 and June 1989. This corresponds to a full year saving of around $20m. These savings have been made possible, notwithstanding the generally higher level of benefits payable to injured workers, because of the emphasis on reducing the incidence of injury and rehabilitating those employees unfortunate enough to be injured at work. </PARA>
<PARA> Comcare's premiums are comprehensive and competitive. There are no excess payments or hidden costs. Comcare's average premium in 1989-90 was 2.6 per cent of salary which compared favourably with 3.0 per cent charged in reformed State schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the new scheme has produced significant reductions in the duration of claims. The average length of claims in general has been reduced and, more importantly, there are fewer new claims becoming long term claims. These trends are occurring sooner than expected and are generating substantial savings to the Commonwealth and its authorities which are now directly responsible for the costs associated with work-related injuries. As a result, the average premium rate for the 1990-91 financial year is expected to fall from 2.6 cents per wage and salary dollar to 2.0 cents. The immediate reduction in the duration of claims under the new scheme and the expected reduction in premium rates demonstrate the real value of the new approach which is achieving this Government's goals of reducing both the human and financial costs of work-related injuries. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the amendments which would be made to the Act by this Bill have significant implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would amend sections 131 and 132 of the Act which relate to the amount of compensation payable to former employees. Former employees are defined in the Act to mean persons who were receiving compensation under the repealed Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 and who had ceased to be employees of the Commonwealth before the commencement of the Act on 1 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Special transitional provisions were included in the Act to protect former employees from the full operation of certain provisions of the Act, such as the age 65 cut-off of benefits and the dollar for dollar reduction in compensation benefits payable to persons entitled to weekly superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 131 and 132 of the Act set out methods of calculating the amount of weekly compensation payable to former employees. Section 131 deals with those former employees who are in receipt of superannuation benefits, while section 132 applies to those with no superannuation entitlements. As currently drafted, neither section allows Comcare to have any regard to the amount that former employees are able to earn in suitable employment. ``Able to earn'' tests of this nature are common to all workers' compensation Acts in Australia. However, a provision which would have enabled Comcare to have regard to the amount that former employees are capable of earning was omitted from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provide that the amount of compensation payable to a former employee who has a residual capacity for work will be either the amount that he or she is currently receiving, less the amount that he or she is able to earn in suitable employment, or the amount payable under the Act to a current employee of the Commonwealth with similar earning capacity, whichever is greater. In determining the amount that a former employer is able to earn, the Commission will have regard to the same factors as it would have regard to in determining the amount that a current employee is able to earn. These factors include-</PARA>
<PARA> the amount that the employee is actually earning;</PARA>
<PARA> the amount that the employee would be earning if he or she had remained in, or accepted an offer of, suitable employment; and</PARA>
<PARA> if the employee failed to seek suitable employment, the amount that, having regard to the state of the labour market, the employee could reasonably expect to earn if he or she had sought work. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the amendments to the Act that would be made by this Bill are expected to result in a saving to Comcare of approximately $3m in a full year. Additional savings will be made by the two ``administering authorities'', Telecom and Australia Post. The amendments would come into operation on a date to be proclaimed and claimants will be advised of the possible reduction in their benefits as a result of these amendments in order to minimise their impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to section 5 of the Act would remove any doubt that non-police staff of the Australian Federal Police are covered by the Act. Prior to the beginning of this year, non-police staff were appointed under the Public Service Act and, as Public Servants, were covered by the Compensation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, non-police staff have been appointed under the Australian Federal Police Act and a question has arisen whether those new appointees fall within the definition of ``employee'' in section 5 of the Compensation Act. The amendment will make it clear that the Act does apply to non-police staff of the AFP. Although most of the appointments will not occur until July 1990, some have been made already. Accordingly, it has been necessary to make this amendment retrospective to 1 January 1990 to make sure that the people concerned have been covered from the date of their appointment. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>OCCUPATIONAL SUPERANNUATION (REASONABLE BENEFIT LIMITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to implement changes to the reasonable benefit limits and related taxation measures which the Treasurer announced in his 1988 May Economic Statement and his Budget Speech of 15 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are an important part of the Government's retirement incomes policy. A basic objective of that policy is to increase significantly the role occupational superannuation plays in Australia's retirement income arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> For superannuation to play this role, it must be economically sustainable, attractive as a savings vehicle, and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the taxation treatment of superannuation enacted in June last year put superannuation on an economically sustainable basis for the long term while retaining the concessional taxation treatment of superannuation and like benefits. The changes to the reasonable benefit arrangements proposed by this Bill bring more equity into these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important effect of this Bill will be the establishment, from 1 July 1990, of the reasonable benefit limit as the maximum amount of benefits a person is permitted to receive on a concessionally taxed basis. Previously, the Commissioner of Taxation and, following the establishment of his office, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, restricted the benefits that could be provided by superannuation funds. This was the basis of the old 7 times rule. With the enactment of this Bill, those restrictions will be removed and superannuation funds will be permitted to pay out higher amounts of benefits provided that amounts in excess of the limits will be included in a person's assessable income and taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. Benefits up to the reasonable benefit limits will continue to be taxed concessionally. </PARA>
<PARA> With the very limited exemptions I shall mention shortly, the reasonable benefit limit will apply to all concessionally taxed benefits regardless of whether those benefits are provided by public or private sector sources, whether they are provided by superannuation funds, rollover funds or employers and whether they are funded or unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA> This important initiative redresses the long standing inequity of private sector superannuation benefits being subject to limits while public sector benefits were exempt. It also closes the loophole in the previous arrangements whereby those in private sector funds who have the ability to so arrange their affairs could receive concessionally taxed benefits in excess of the limits by rolling over before age 65 or taking additional benefits as ``golden handshakes''. </PARA>
<PARA> The only concessionally taxed benefits which will not be subject to the limits will be bona fide redundancy, genuine invalidity and approved early retirement scheme benefits within the income tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes that the method for determining the limits be set by the Government of the day. This initiative was foreshadowed by the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Hon Clyde Holding MP, in his Second Reading Speech introducing the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 4) 1987. The limits and the method for determining whether a benefit is within or in excess of the limits will be prescribed in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations prescribing the limits will be made once the Bill is enacted. They will give effect to the announcements made by the Government in the May 1988 Economic Statement and in the Budget on 15 August 1989 on the methods of calculating and administering the limits. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, before going over the the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to mention the main features of those announcements. They represent substantial improvements for those prepared to save for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> First, members of superannuation funds earning low to middle incomes will be able to save on a concessionally taxed basis enough to provide a CPI indexed life pension or annuity of up to 75 per cent of a person's highest average salary over any three previous consecutive income years. A lower percentage will apply to higher income earners. The limit will be high enough to allow the pension or annuity to revert to a surviving spouse at up to 85 per cent of the amount of the primary pension and be payable for 10 years even if both beneficiaries die beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> The lump sum equivalent of these benefits is up to 11.25 years salary. It represents an increase of up to approximately 15 per cent in the limits for those previously saving for pensions and up to 60 per cent for those previously saving for lump sums. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, a person will be eligible for benefits at this level if he or she takes at least half of his or her benefits as a pension or annuity which meets certain minimum standards. Where more than half of a person's benefits are taken as a lump sum, a lower limit applies, of up to 7 times highest average salary. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements reflect the Government's view that the taking of benefits as pensions and annuities should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, highest average salary will be indexed where a person takes all of his or her benefits, excluding undeducted contributions, bona fide redundancy, genuine invalidity and approved early retirement scheme benefits as a pension or annuity which meets minimum standards or preserves all of those benefits to age 65. </PARA>
<PARA> The final feature of the Government's announcements I would like to mention is that the new measures are designed to encourage longer participation in the work force and the retention of benefits to retirement. This has been achieved by removing the penalty in the previous arrangements whereby a person's reasonable benefit limit, and his or her entitlement to concessionally taxed benefits, fell if work commitments were wound down prior to reaching full retirement. Under the new arrangements, highest average salary will be indexed after age 55 when a person works a minimum amount after that age. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Government recognises that many people close to retirement had made their financial plans on the basis of the previous arrangements. It accordingly has decided that for those aged 55 years or more at 1 July 1990 their reasonable benefit limits will be based upon highest average salary indexed to maintain its real value without having to remain in the work force and work a minimum amount. This will substantially ease any impact the new arrangements may have had on their retirement plans. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the arrangements proposed in the Bill for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to administer the limits set by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Providers of concessionally taxed benefits, namely, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, employers, life insurance companies and registered organisations such as friendly societies will be required to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of prescribed details of benefits provided to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon receipt of this information, the Commissioner will be required to determine the amount of the benefit paid to the person that is within the reasonable benefit limits and the amount of the benefit, if any, that is in excess of the limits prescribed under the Regulations. The Commissioner will be required to advise the recipient of the benefit of his determination and of the basis of that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned earlier, the Bill provides that amounts up to the reasonable benefit limits are to be taxed concessionally and amounts in excess of the limits are required to be paid as a lump sum, to be included in assessable income and taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation of the excess amount at the marginal rate together with a tax on the contributions to the fund is intended to recoup the tax relief gained during accrual of the excess amount in a concessionally taxed environment. This measure will discourage deliberate overfunding and payment of excess benefits because the excess benefit received after tax will generally not exceed that from a nonconcessional savings vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also ensure that no one can receive an amount of concessionally taxed benefits in excess of his or her entitlements as prescribed by the limits. This is an important initiative to ensure the superannuation tax arrangements are both simpler and more equitable in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> Providers of superannuation benefits will generally not be required to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner where they pay a death benefit to a dependant of a member of the fund as such benefits will not generally be counted towards the reasonable benefit limits. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist the Commissioner to administer the limits effectively, the Bill proposes that, where a person is paid a benefit subject to the reasonable benefit limits, that person be permitted to provide his or her tax file number to the provider of the benefit for forwarding to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner requires the person's tax file number so that he can be certain that his determination of whether a benefit is within the person's reasonable benefit limit is correct, after taking into account benefits received in the past or from different sources. Where the person does not provide his or her tax file number to the provider of the benefit, the Commissioner will make an interim determination that all of the benefit which is counted towards the reasonable benefit limits is excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision of a tax file number by a person to the provider of the benefit will be on the same basis as tax file numbers are to be provided to financial institutions. There will be no compulsion to provide a tax file number but where it is not provided, the provider of the benefit will be required to deduct tax from the benefit at the top marginal rate. Moreover, where the Commissioner makes an interim determination because the tax file number is not supplied, the person will then be given an opportunity to provide his or her tax file number to the Commissioner so that a final determination can be made. If the person does not subsequently provide the Commissioner with his or her tax file number the Bill provides that interim determination is to stand and the payment, other than concessional components and undeducted contributions, is to be taxed at marginal rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner comply with the guidelines for the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers and the Information Privacy Principles prescribed under the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the proposals contained in the Bill on the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner for the purpose of administering the reasonable benefit limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner has advised that the administration of the reasonable benefit limits is clearly a tax related function and that to ensure there are no mistakes of identification, it is administratively necessary for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to receive and hold tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes changes to the definition of a superannuation fund to enable payment of retirement benefits even where a person has not retired from full time or part time employment. This provision will enable people in part time employment to retain benefits in a superannuation fund until age 70 at the latest and persons in full time employment to do so while they are in employment but would enable the benefits to be paid at age 65 if the persons so desired. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes that a person be able to appeal decisions of the Commissioner on his or her reasonable benefit limit and whether a benefit received is within that limit. The person will be able to request the Commissioner to reconsider his decision within 21 days of receipt of the Commissioner's determination. Where the person is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision arising out of the reconsideration, he or she may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the Commissioner's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill includes other taxation measures associated with the implementation of the new reasonable benefit limits. Those measures will ensure there is no misuse of concessionally taxed superannuation funds and will prevent funds circumventing the proposed taxation arrangements for excessive benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to quantify the effect on revenue of the changes to the administration of the reasonable benefit limits and the other taxation measures as it will, to a large extent, depend on the options exercised by individuals. However, I would expect that the revenue impact of the reasonable benefit limits arrangements will be neutral in 1989-90 and in 1990-91. In the longer term savings could be expected in outlays on social welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMONWEALTH LEGAL AID AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This is a Bill to amend the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977 to ensure that Part IV of the Act applies to officers of the Australian Legal Aid Office (ALAO) who transfer to the proposed Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Under arrangements being made between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth's position, in relation to staff transfers to the proposed Commission, is that staff of the ALAO should be offered a position in the new Commission on terms and conditions at least as favourable as those upon which they are currently employed. This conforms with the position concerning staff who have previously transferred to State Commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act at present only provides for arrangements between the Commonwealth and a State for the establishment of a State Commission, i.e. it omits arrangements for the establishment of a Commission in a Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the general protections given to former commission officers under Division 3, Part IV of the Public Service Act are only available through Part IV of the CLA Act. Accordingly, without the proposed amendments to the CLA Act, staff transferring to the Northern Territory Commission would not be ``eligible persons'' for the purposes of Division 3, Part IV of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill and Training Guarantee Bill are a package of measures that need to be read together. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier drafts of the Bills and explanatory materials were released for public comment at the time the previous Parliament was dissolved. The many comments that were received have been considered and have resulted in some amendments to the Bills. Other changes have also been made to clarify particular provisions of the earlier drafts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges in particular the positive contribution of the Australian Democrats in suggesting ways to assist employers meet their obligations through the services of industry training agents and possible exemptions for employers which are outstanding trainers. </PARA>
<PARA> While the level of public awareness of the need for increased and better quality training has improved over the past year, the level of training has not. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in April this year indicate there has been no significant growth in structured training from the levels estimated for the same period in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Training Guarantee will require employers to spend a minimum amount on training, broadly defined. The Government believes that employers should spend the money themselves in ways which they consider will maximise productivity or contribute more generally to the skills of the work force. However, where employers spend less than the required minimum, the shortfall will be collected and used to fund additional training activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a targeted measure aimed at improving the efforts of firms which do not currently invest in training or invest very little in training. The Government favours this scheme partly because it will not penalise those companies which have recognised the value of training and invest in it accordingly. For firms that already train above the required minimum level it will have no direct financial impact. The Training Guarantee is in fact a charge on the failure to train. </PARA>
<PARA> Structural adjustment and increasing the competitiveness of Australian industry have been major concerns of this Government. It is widely accepted that this will require a more highly skilled and flexible work force. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, the Government has undertaken major reforms to the education and training systems. Changes to the higher education system have substantially increased its capacity and made it more responsive to national goals. The Government has, jointly with the States and Territories, undertaken a major overhaul of the training system to improve the quality of training provided and the efficiency and responsiveness of the system. These initiatives include reform of TAFE funding; the move to competency-based training; the establishment of the National Training Board to develop nationally consistent skills standards; and providing assistance for innovative industry training arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In parallel, the Government has encouraged improvements to work organisation and worker productivity through award restructuring. This process is creating new opportunities and incentives for both workers and employers to invest in improving workplace skills. It is important that these opportunities for industrial reform are not wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Government discussion papers have drawn attention to Australia's unsatisfactory level of industry training. Both Skills for Australia (September 1987) and A Changing Workforce (May 1988) emphasised the importance of industry investment in training and expressed concern about the level of industry effort in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> This was followed in December 1988 by the Government's discussion paper, Industry Training in Australia: The Need for Change. The paper found that, while some employers have excellent training programs, many more do not. It analysed the level of expenditure on training by industry and examined some of the reasons why this was not higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the release of the discussion paper, the Employment and Skills Formation Council (ESFC) of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training was requested to undertake consultations with all interested parties and report on measures to improve industry training. Wide-ranging consultations ensued from which there emerged a high level of agreement that the existing level and quality of training was inadequate. The scheme embodied in these Bills is a modified version of that recommended by ESFC. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to change industry attitudes to training from the present situation where too many firms regard training as a cost to be minimised, to one where it is seen as an investment to improve the flexibility and quality of skills and hence to achieve more productive outcomes. We need also to improve the quality of training by increasing the incidence of structured, planned training. Finally, we need to ensure that there is a more equitable distribution of training effort amongst employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Training Guarantee is designed to address these requirements. It will `lift the tail' of industry training by targeting non-training employers. In this way it will help reduce the disincentive for other employers to train created by firms that rely predominantly on poaching for their supply of skilled workers. The Training Guarantee extends to the Commonwealth, State and Territory public sectors as well as the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers with annual national payrolls of $200,000 or more-which is around 8 to 10 full-time employees-will be required to spend the equivalent of 1 per cent of their payroll on eligible training activities from 1 July 1990, rising to 1.5 per cent from 1 July 1992 and thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of training is intentionally broad to give employers the flexibility to acquit their obligation in a wide range of ways. A key concept is the development of structured training programs, which identify in advance the skills to be acquired, the mechanisms by which they will be imparted and the means for identifying outcomes or productivity improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial relations training, occupational health and safety training and study leave for teachers and academics are examples of some of the types and range of training that would be counted within an overall training program. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are many other possibilities for meeting the expenditure requirement, including donations to tertiary education institutions, industry skill centres, industry training bodies and community-based training schemes; the establishment and maintenance of associated training facilities and information systems; and contributions to industry specific training levies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of consultations industry convincingly argued that on-the-job training had an important role in their training strategies. At the same time, there is strong industry support for the move to competency-based training. Hence, both on-the-job and off-the-job structured training are included in eligible training activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition does, however, draw a line between structured training on the one side and unstructured, informal training on the other. While informal training and work experience continue to have a role in building workplace skills, the Training Guarantee is focused on structured training. </PARA>
<PARA> Training is not restricted to non-managerial employees. Management training-and training for owner-managers-is just as important in raising the productive capacity of Australian industry and to changing attitudes to training. Expenditure on management's own training, provided it meets the other eligibility requirements, will count. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is training limited to management and other workers within an enterprise. While it is expected that employers will generally make the bulk of their expenditure on their own work force, scholarships, cadetships and structured training for those not currently in the workforce are to be eligible expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be stressed that the Training Guarantee is a minimum spending requirement: it is not an industry average or norm and for much of Australian industry it is certainly not an optimum level of training expenditure. To reinforce this point the Government will investigate, in further consultation with industry, the possibility of recognising a limited number of firms with an outstanding commitment to training and to simplify the accountability required of them under the Training Guarantee. These arrangements may require amendments to the legislation, which would be brought forward in the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemptions will be given to the following organisations: international organisations; foreign government representatives; public benevolent institutions (except public hospitals); and religious institutions, as they relate to pastoral duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has already been made to the fact that only firms with payrolls of $200,000 or more will be required to meet the Training Guarantee. This threshold level means that around 75% of the private sector nonagricultural work force will be covered by the Training Guarantee, while excluding about 85% of employers. The threshold will be indexed to average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> During the consultative process, many have argued that there should be no exemptions for smaller firms. However, the Government recognises the special difficulties and needs of very small businesses. While they are to be exempt from any compulsory requirement, the Employment and Skills Formation Council has been asked to further examine small business training needs and to advise on measures to improve the training effort of small business. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that an exemption for firms with a payroll below $200,000 is, in effect, an exemption for all firms spending less than the proposed minimum requirement. This is not correct. Recent ABS data show that almost 60 per cent of enterprises with an annual payroll over $200,000 spent nothing on formal training. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers and employees have a collective interest in the productivity of their enterprises and in the availability of training. While the legislation does not require them to do so, there would be value in employers informing their work force on their training strategy and expenditure on training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also concerned that low-skilled workers, women and disadvantaged labour market groups have access to training. While it has decided not to include specific training targets for such groups, it will be monitoring industry training behaviour. The extent to which training is distributed across all groups in the work force will be considered in the context of reviewing the operation of the scheme. The review will occur within four years of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for administering the Training Guarantee is to lie with the Commissioner of Taxation. The scheme will be administered on a self-assessment basis, combined with auditing of a sample of employers. All employers to whom the Training Guarantee applies will be required to keep appropriate records for the purposes of assessing whether they have a liability and for auditing purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> However, only those employers who have failed to spend the required minimum on eligible training activities in any financial year will be required to furnish a statement to the Australian Taxation Office, together with payment of a charge equal to any shortfall. In this way the scheme will minimise the administrative burden on industry and the level of bureaucratic involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that there is also a need for an agency to advise on guidelines for eligible training expenditure and to deal with issues of interpretation with respect to the definition of training and related matters. The agreement of the States and Territories will be sought for the National Training Board to fulfil these roles. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to assist employers to meet their expenditure obligations directly, the Government will also make provision for industry training bodies and industry associations to act as registered industry training agents. The national training agency will be empowered to register industry bodies which elect to take on the role of training agents. </PARA>
<PARA> Training agents will have the capacity to advise employers within a particular industry on eligible training programs and related expenditure and provide certificates if a particular program is eligible. A certificate issued by a registered industry agent will be accepted by Australian Taxation Office auditors as evidence of program eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines on the criteria to be used in registering and monitoring industry agents will be tabled in the coming months and it is expected they will be operational on or before 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office will provide advice on routine enquiries with respect to eligible training. On other matters relating to eligible training it will seek rulings and advice. The training advisory agency will provide such advice to the ATO and to the industry training agents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's purpose is not to collect revenue. The Government anticipates that the level of revenue collected will quickly decline as employers increase their own training expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in line with the Government's objective of encouraging employers to themselves make the required expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue collected under the Training Guarantee will be placed in a special trust account under a standing appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. All revenue net of administration and monitoring costs will be disbursed to the States and Territories which support the Training Guarantee and agree to disburse their share of revenue on training on the advice of an appropriate tripartite body and in a way that does not substitute for existing Government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects that this revenue will add to the pool of money available for funding innovative training arrangements. Where a State or Territory does not agree to the above funding conditions, or terminates its agreement, the Commonwealth will use that share of funds for additional training activities. Funds will be allocated according to a State or Territory's share of national payroll, as estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did notice that article. I think it makes the efforts in the last few weeks of the Greiner Government to appear green just a little bit difficult. The Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales has withdrawn for a number of reasons, but I understand that its main frustration has been coastal development in New South Wales, which has become an enormous issue in the State. In fact, I think the new members for Page and Richmond would be able to tell us just how big an issue it has become as they, undoubtedly to a large extent, came into office on that issue. This issue is offending millions of people in New South Wales and will continue to do so as long as the Greiner Government has `a develop at any cost' attitude to our coastline.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable senator knows, it has long been my view that there ought to be a referendum to give us proper power. There will be in the next few years, and when we get it there will not be a problem. As an example, I do not believe that we have power to prevent development of every wetland in New South Wales even if we do what the honourable senator thinks we ought to do in regard to the three-mile limit. Mind you, there is a real difficulty with that, given that it would involve cancelling agreements with the States. We do not wish to declare war on the States; we simply seek to have a more consistent approach around Australia to what is obviously a very important issue. But that is only one. Coastal zone management is very important. Yesterday in Question Time I referred to the national working group that we are setting up. We have also asked the Resource Assessment Commission to have a look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator also raises the question of World Heritage areas in New South Wales. The new proposal by the New South Wales Government, as usual, shows a complete misunderstanding of what the World Heritage Convention stands for and is. For instance, the New South Wales Government attempts, in its new stance, to assume that it has some standing as far as the World Heritage Convention is concerned when, of course, it has none. It seeks to say that in assessing World Heritage areas for their natural beauty we have to include an economic assessment when, of course, New South Wales has no standing to assess anything. It also fails to provide any protection for a property prior to nomination and has a limit of four years on assessment time. Where that has come from, God only knows. That is just one of the failures of the New South Wales Government, and they keep mounting up.</PARA>
<PARA> The Nature Conservation Council has also been very active in attempting to pressure the Greiner Government into declaring some more national parks in the south-east of New South Wales-which Premier Greiner, once again under pressure from Mr Murray and Mr Causley, will not do. He lacks the courage to fight the National Party. He is a bit like the people on the other side of the chamber. It saddens me to think that people like Senator Boswell have real power in the world. But, as long as they are allowed to run the Liberal Party, the National Party will keep doing it.</PARA>

Is it fair for parents living in isolated areas to suffer such a financial penalty simply because the child turns 16? Has the Minister noted that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal said that, because of the technical interpretation of section 81 of the Social Security Act, Mrs Frankcombe's appeal could not be upheld but that her case was `a reasonable one' and that it `seems unreasonable that receipt of AIC (boarding allowance) should disqualify receipt of family allowance'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information in the brief which I will make available to the honourable senator at the moment; in so far as there are other matters which require a more particular response from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I will ensure that the latter part of his question is brought to his attention for his consideration. The Minister is aware of the allegations that research results were falsified in order to conceal increases in cancer among workers at a factory in West Virginia. This is in relation to the so-called Monsanto studies. The factory manufactured herbicides and other chemicals that were contaminated with dioxin. In 1949 there was an accident that exposed some of the workers to high levels of dioxin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been several studies of these workers and of other workers at the nitro factory. These studies were considered by the Evatt Royal Commission on the use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnel in Vietnam. The studies have been portrayed as central to Justice Evatt's conclusions. However, the nitro accident was only one of a number of industrial accidents considered by the Royal Commission. Discussion of the nitro studies comprises approximately 10 pages out of the 400 pages of the volume of the Royal Commission report dealing with cancer. Based on a preliminary analysis of the material that has been made available, it appears that mistakes may have been made in the exposure classification of a small number of workers. This is different from fraud and falsification.</PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to reconcile the allegation that results were deliberately suppressed when the published study clearly showed a ten-fold increase in cancer of the bladder. It was acknowledged that a chemical used in the rubber industry was also processed at the factory and had been confirmed as causing bladder cancer.</PARA>
<PARA> Those raising the allegations against Monsanto have ignored another study discussed in the same section of the Royal Commission report. The study was commissioned by the nitro workers union and was carried out by a research group quite independent of Monsanto. That also concluded that workers exposed to dioxin were unlikely to suffer permanent and debilitating health effects.</PARA>
<PARA> Charges of scientific fraud are serious and further investigations are being made. However, it appears at this stage that both the allegations and their impact on Justice Evatt's conclusions have been exaggerated. In the latter part of the honourable senator's question certain further considerations are asked to be undertaken by the Minister. I will, as I say, bring that part of the honourable senator's question to the Minister's attention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health been drawn to an article in the Australian newspaper of 15 May 1990, is which the President of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Shepherd, called for a moratorium on the entry of foreign medical practitioners into Australia? Is Dr Shepherd correct in claiming that a `further influx of foreign doctors would cause Australia's high standards of medical practice to deteriorate'? Is the increasing number of foreign medical graduates likely to cause poorer training opportunities, excessive training costs, unemployment and a fall in the level of skills, as Dr Shepherd suggests?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on the question that Senator Colston raises. From my general reading I understand that at the moment Dr Bruce Shepherd is involved in an election campaign within the Australian Medical Association. I believe that the scaremongering and the utterly unfounded assertions that he has made, as conveyed to the Senate by Senator Colston, are simply part of that election campaign. I certainly do not want to add to any notoriety that he might be seeking by appealing in a xenophobic way to people's fears in the way that he has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has an overall adequate supply of doctors but there are sectoral shortages, such as in certain public hospitals, particularly in some rural areas-I notice Senator Watson nodding; he knows of some problems in Tasmania-and, of course, in some specialties. Attempts to overcome those shortages in those sectors would have been unsuccessful had recruiting drives been limited to Australia. Therefore it is quite clear that recruitment from overseas is essential if those particular shortages are to be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA> Before doctors are able to be recruited from overseas under the employer nomination scheme, the recruiting organisation must demonstrate that it has made a genuine, though unsuccessful, attempt to recruit within Australia. Of course, we know that other doctors are admitted into Australia under different immigration programs such as family reunion or refugee programs. It would be quite improper to deny persons from overseas the possibility of coming in under those programs simply because of their professional status as doctors. Once migrants are admitted, the Government believes that they all should have the opportunity to use the skills which they have applied overseas, particularly professional skills which may be useful to our people.</PARA>
<PARA> Doctors can practise in Australia only if they obtain registration, which is mandatory. That registration process is designed to protect Australia's very high medical care standards. There will be no undermining of those standards by the Australian Medical Council. The final point to make is that it is the Australian Medical Council which is the arbiter of standards for overseas trained doctors. I believe that that Council sets extremely high standards-so high, in fact, that they have been queried by many who, having obtained qualifications overseas, seek to practise medicine in Australia. The allegations made by Dr Bruce Shepherd are quite unfounded in the light of that particular structure to ensure that the very highest standards are adhered to in the practice of medicine in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do believe it was a contributing factor in two ways: firstly, the sheer financial aspect of reducing the cost of the product even to a relatively minor degree, I guess, has to be considered, but I think the major impact of the Government's decision in terms of the feedback that I have got on it is that it added greatly to the whole education process which is going on in the Australian community and, given some leadership by governments, both Federal and State, I do believe it is having an effect. I am talking about the move to introduce random breath testing, which has had a major impact on community attitudes towards drink driving, not simply because of the risk of getting caught but because of the atmosphere created-it is not an appropriate thing these days simply to accept that we can drink with impunity, as used to be the case in terms of community attitudes, and drive a motor vehicle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is also allied of course to the current initiatives the Government is trying to introduce in concert with this proposal that was introduced to get a national blood alcohol limit of .05. In terms of road fatalities, perhaps in a lot of ways I guess it is hard to say what the cause is, but the major factors when serious injury is caused to people who in fact survive road vehicle accidents are of course carelessness, followed by speed and alcohol-and, quite often of course, those three combined. Thirty-eight per cent of all drivers killed in road accidents in 1987 did have a blood alcohol concentration of .05 or over. That represented the unnecessary loss of 500 Australian lives in that year alone. It is axiomatic to say that a driver who consumes low alcohol beer, encouraged by this Government initiative, will stay below the legal limit for a longer period of time. That is obvious.</PARA>
<PARA> Just as important, of course, as consuming low alcohol beer is the legal blood alcohol concentration limit. There is a very convincing array of information-and I might say this in response to some of the interjections that I heard from Opposition benches yesterday during a question from Senator Lees-demonstrating that .05 does save lives. There is an equally convincing array of medical and physiological evidence that shows that any level of alcohol in the blood stream impairs performance. I am sure there are many people who can attest to that. For that reason, of course, it has been thought proper that in particularly sensitive jobs such as flying aircraft there should be no alcohol consumed at all.</PARA>
<PARA> There are unfortunately two States-South Australia and Western Australia-and indeed the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, which still have alcohol concentration limits of .08, and discussions to change that are continuing. A number of studies have shown that performance on driver-related tasks is significantly impaired at very low blood alcohol levels, as I have said before. In simple terms the risk of an accident at .05 is twice that at zero, whilst at .08 the risk is twice that at .05 and therefore four times that at zero.</PARA>
<PARA> The strongest evidence-and always the proof of the pudding is in the eating-comes from studies of the actual change from .08 to .05 in the States of New South Wales and Queensland. In both States the lower limit reduced the number of alcohol-related accidents. Accident costs were reduced by an estimated $76m in New South Wales and $32m in Queensland. It is important to stress that this is putting a large buffer between the legal limit and a blood alcohol level of .10.</PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Maguire for his question and I point out that there is ample evidence that these Government initiatives of lowering the excise and attempting to get a national limit of .05 are having positive results in reducing the trauma and the cost of road accidents.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The poverty figures for children in Australia are impossible to give, mainly because there has never been an accepted definition of poverty. Whether one wants to take the Henderson line or other lines below and above it, it is very difficult. So I do not intend to put a number on it. I think that is very difficult to do, and I am not about doing it. What the Government sought to do in the course of the last few years with those targets of 15 and 20 per cent, which we have now met via family allowances and family allowance supplements, was to make sure that those children in Australia who were living in conditions that we did not think were appropriate were able to be assisted. This Government now has, because of its adoption of those targets and its capacity to meet them, which we have now done, made sure that those children at least have the opportunity to have their standards lifted. That is something of which we will always be proud. It does not mean that the battle is over. Obviously it will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister talked about doing something on child poverty he made sure that the Government moved immediately and we are proud of our efforts. That does not mean, of course, that every parent then takes those family allowances and family allowance supplements and uses them properly in terms of looking after their children. There are some parents who have not done that. That is to be regretted, but it is not something that the Government can legislate about. What we will do, however, is make sure that those efforts not only continue but are improved. We will make sure that family allowance and family allowance supplements continue to be indexed. Though Senator Alston was not here, when some of his colleagues who were around during the Fraser-Howard years were in government I have to report sadly that they could not index payments for children. They could not even index them. They had that typical miserable attitude that conservative parties always have.</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the last election it was fascinating to watch all of the leadership of the party to which Senator Alston belongs-he probably cannot remember them now; they are fading fast-trying to duck the question of where the cuts they promised would come.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators would be aware of the program of the Government to strip major federal offenders-particularly those who involve themselves in the importing of drugs into this country-of the accumulated profits that they have made out of their nefarious criminal activity. The old aphorism used to run that crime does not pay, but of course we know that, particularly in relation to drug trafficking, crime does pay very large dollars indeed. Therefore the Government has, under the Proceeds of Crime Act and under the Customs Act, instituted a process whereby the accumulated profits of drug traffickers in particular can be stripped away from them in a way which not only hurts them personally and is an added individual punishment-they hate losing their palatial car, the luxury yacht and the horse stud-but also strips them of the assets which they can use for further criminal activity. This is an excellent way in which we can combat organised crime in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister announced during the election campaign that the assets and the moneys which are confiscated will be put into a special fund, and 50 per cent of the moneys accumulated in that fund will be relayed back to law enforcement agencies and 50 per cent will go into drug education and rehabilitation projects. I think honourable senators would agree that this is an excellent use of these moneys, turning the moneys of organised crime back to the law enforcement agencies to continue the battle and, more particularly perhaps and more satisfactorily, to provide for drug rehabilitation projects for those who have fallen victim to drug abuse. While it is impossible to put a very firm figure on this, it is expected that the trust fund will distribute around $3m per year in this way and I hope to introduce the legislation in the Budget sittings. I expect and hope that the Senate will give support to that legislation.</PARA>

Would the Minister please indicate what steps he proposes to take to remedy this totally unacceptable situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of that VCOSS report which suggested that there were a number of Department of Social Security beneficiaries who were forced into approaching charitable organisations for hand-outs from time to time. That has always been the case. I do not think it contradicts Mr Howe's statement. Nonetheless, it is obviously a matter of regret. There is no doubt that some beneficiaries, particularly those who for any one of quite a number of reasons go off benefits for any period, find themselves in acute difficulties. Often that is their own fault. Sometimes they are merely the victims of circumstances. When that happens there is a safety net in charitable organisations, as there is in all the developed countries, to assist in looking after them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that those organisations exist does not mean that the objectives of a proper social security system are not met. It simply means that government cannot ever meet every need. What we are proud of though is that during the course of the seven years of the Hawke Government we have massively increased our payments to social security beneficiaries and we have made sure that, as I said only a few moments ago, children in particular have benefited by the family allowance and family allowance supplements.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset it should be made clear that the Government has a commitment to improve recycling in Australia. The commitment is directed at two levels: first, to increase the awareness of the importance of recycling-so in that regard education campaigns are important-and, secondly, through increased awareness both government and private responses to recycling can be augmented and increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most recent commitment was spelt out by the Prime Minister in his July 1989 statement. Consequent to that statement on the environment, the Government initiated a review conducted by the Department of Administrative Services on the potential for using recycled paper. That was one response emanating from the Prime Minister's statement of July 1989. DAS was chosen because of its diverse roles in government. It is a purchaser; it has a technical role through bodies such as the Government laboratories, waste and cleaning through the Transport and Storage Group; and it supplies, of course, heaps of non-personalised stationery to members and senators. So the review was conducted, it reported in October 1989, and 29 recommendations emanated from that. As I say, those recommendations went to the question of educating as well as to the question of in-house decision-making in government to promote recycling.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bell asked a number of questions. I will go to the question of government action in this area in a few seconds, but in respect of the action that the Government has taken to facilitate the manufacture of products from collected recyclables, I think it is fair to instance one particular case, and that is the Government's involvement in and encouragement of a newspaper recycling mill at Albury-Wodonga. That was done with the encouragement of Senator Richardson and the Government, and I think that would be a great step in the cause of recycling. I think it is also fair to say that the Government anticipates another announcement within the next few months in the same sort of area.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of encouraging the public to purchase products made from recycled materials, I, in my previous capacity as Minister for Consumer Affairs, together with other consumer Ministers, initiated a review, a program, to lead to the establishment of identification of consumer products to ensure that when consumers are purchasing they can make decisions on environmental grounds. That particular proposal has been picked up by the State and Federal Ministers for the environment and is being progressed by government. It has to be coordinated on a national and State level, and I anticipate from what I have been informed that that continuing process will come to some sort of culmination in the next few months as well.</PARA>
<PARA> Within government we have a number of roles. One is awareness, as I have mentioned, and today's seminars are an important part of that. The guide to the use of recycled paper, which is being launched today, is an important step and one that encourages better paper management but also raises awareness of the usefulness of recycling.</PARA>
<PARA> The other important arm of government is purchasing. It is interesting to note that we purchase thousands of tonnes of paper through the Purchasing and Sales Group of the Department. DAS spends $28.5m a year on paper contracts, the Government Printer spends another $26.5m, and we have a whole host of paper supplied to parliamentarians, as I said earlier. Over the last year we have entered contracts covering a variety of paper products that are made from recycled paper-continuous computer paper, writing pads, scribble pads, envelopes and 1991 diaries-and we are progressing with negotiations to ensure that that is extended for the next financial year to cover areas such as photocopy paper and fax paper as well as refills.

There will not be unemployment benefits as such. There will be those on Newstart and another benefit for the first twelve months. So during the course of this financial year one would not expect great savings. However, the fact that for all beneficiaries we have considerably tightened up work and activity tests means that savings are being achieved all the time.

In relation to the general question, that is to say the question predicated upon asking the Minister to comment on what are claimed to be aspects of Opposition policy, I put it to you in the first instance that that is not within the Minister's responsibility. If the Minister, however, claims that he has some responsibility in that, I put it to you that he has similarly condemned himself in his own last comment by describing the debate as a hypothetical debate, since the Standing Orders specifically proscribe questions being asked which are of a hypothetical nature.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The questions raised in the article about union amalgamations are, of course, questions of current political debate. They are matters reported more widely, in terms of this Government's intention, in an announcement I made when I first took over this portfolio to review the Industrial Relations Act in order that the objectives of the Act and facilities provided within the Act for union amalgamations might be considered for change in the Budget session of Parliament this year. That relates to a review of the Act that I am undertaking, and on which I have consulted with employers, unions, and a number of other key figures and commentators in order that the question of the amalgamations might be speedily resolved. In that context, the issues canvassed in the newspaper article referred to by Senator Beahan have been canvassed by other people and, I notice, now by Mr Howard. Therefore, I would argue that they are entirely consistent and within the purview of my ministerial responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me comment on some of those ideas. I do not think that the proposal for a Japanese-style trade union structure in Australia is a sensible or substantial proposal. It would envisage the creation of several thousand unions based on workplaces. While it might achieve the objective of breaking down the craft nature of Australian unions, it does beg the questions of how would that transition ever be made, given the fundamental opposition by the union movement itself to such a change; what the cost of such a transition would be; and whether or not the wider economy would be advantaged in terms of the direction the Government wants to take union amalgamation policy, that is, to create a greater industry focus in order to provide career paths, end demarcation disputes, and provide a more multi-skilled and supple work force, which is better able to direct itself to trainee and competency based wage increases through a training system rather than the craft structure we have now. That ought to be recognised as a fundamental shift.</PARA>
<PARA> I think in terms of this wider debate certainly Mr Howard has a view and that view ought to be considered but, in terms of the practicality of that view, I do not think it is realistic and it is not really applicable in the current circumstances. I think we will await my consideration of the various views that have been put when I announce and bring forward legislation.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that Australian Airlines has decided to withdraw the independent Ita magazine from all its Flight Deck lounges. If so, what is the reason for the decision? Is it because Ita magazine has decided to publish a three-page advertisement for Ansett Airlines of Australia in its June issue, or is it for some other reason? Is it also a fact that Australian Airlines has threatened to withdraw all Australian Airlines advertising from the Ita magazine unless it agrees to exclusive advertising for Australian Airlines? Has Australian Airlines ever demanded such exclusivity in advertising or banned other magazines from carrying Ansett advertising, or is it simply that Australian Airlines believes it can muscle an independent publisher who would be eager for the advertising?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday Senator Bishop asked me a question regarding the closure of the Australian Embassy in Ethiopia. I am advised that, following the closure of both the Embassy in Addis Ababa and our High Commission in Dar es Salaam, there was a safe hand contingent of material from Nairobi on the African courier service in December 1987. The total consignment was of 394 kilograms comprising 14 kilograms of material from Addis Ababa, 240 kilograms of files for archives from Dar es Salaam and also 140 kilograms of files from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau which also came from Dar es Salaam. The majority of the AIDAB material and approximately 50 per cent of archives material on all but one item from Addis Ababa was unclassified. There is no evidence that Canberra management directed all unclassified records to be returned to Canberra by safe hand. That decision appears to have been made by the posts concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Departmental records indicate that the total consignment cost was $27,285. According to the records at the time, there could have been a saving of some $10,000 if the unclassified material had been sent by air freight. The files returned were required to be returned under the provisions of the Archives Act. Accounting records, which would certainly have included dockets and receipts, were also returned as they are required to be kept for five years. All other files and associated records were destroyed at the posts. Available department records do not indicate whether any of this material was destroyed after being returned to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A meeting of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings was held yesterday at which the initial offer from the House of Representatives was that nothing would change and, therefore, it would take the Wednesday broadcasting. This was a completely unacceptable situation to those members of the Senate on the Committee and I moved an option which would have given the Senate 26 hours and 45 minutes broadcasting and the House of Representatives 40 hours. That was rejected on House of Representatives versus Senate lines, not on any party lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I then moved a further option which would have given us 19 hours and 45 minutes and the House of Representatives 47 hours. That was accepted.

Senator Vanstone, who is not in the chamber at the moment, supported that on the basis that it was either that or getting a much lesser total than the 19 hours and 45 minutes. That second option was carried and it is to be assessed at the end of the Budget session.</PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for the Government to clarify its economic policies which have been thrown into confusion by the public quarrel between the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian economy is in very serious trouble. The fundamental problems confronting the economy are more deep-seated than they have been since the Second World War. They are more intractable, and the longer they are left to fester the more difficult they will be to cure, the more intractable they will become. Just four years ago the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave his famous banana republic speech when he warned that Australia was fast going down the Argentinean road of stagnation, hyperinflation and falling living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Australian economy is in a worse condition than it was four years ago. Our situation has deteriorated. The Senate does not have to take just my word for that-it is a view held by most serious economic commentators and economists. It is also the view held by Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance until two weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The symptoms of our economic malaise are plain for all to see: inflation stuck in a high groove of 7 to 9 per cent, twice the average of our major trading partners, with little prospect of falling and, indeed, some real prospect of rising; interest rates the highest in the Western World; foreign debt now totalling almost $150 billion; a gross current account deficit of $148.1m at the end of December; a current account balance which will be in deficit to the tune probably of $20 billion this year, making a total accumulated deficit over the period of the Hawke Government of $95 billion; productivity growth at best stagnant; negative economic growth; and per capita incomes falling. </PARA>
<PARA> This fundamental, intractably difficult situation should be occupying the total, undivided attention of the Government and particularly its key economic Ministers, especially the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). But what do we find instead? We find a government very deeply divided, a government in a self-destruct mode, a government where all concept of Cabinet solidarity has disappeared, a government led by a Prime Minister who has very rightly earned the description by his erstwhile former Finance Minister of Old Jellyback. Why that description? Because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has patently failed to exert the leadership over his Ministry, the discipline and the unity that is essential if government is to tackle responsibly the great problems facing us.</PARA>
<PARA> Three days ago we witnessed the most vitriolic, public, humiliating attack by one senior Minister-none less than the Deputy Prime Minister himself-on another senior colleague that we have seen in the memory of most of us. That attack breached Cabinet solidarity, Cabinet confidentiality and all normal Cabinet conventions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister should have sacked his Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer for such breaches, but he did not do so. Instead he supported Mr Keating in his condemnation of Senator Button. The Prime Minister thereby became party to an unholy alliance with his Deputy against the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce-the third most senior Minister in his Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Prime Minister believed the Treasurer should be supported in his brutal damning attack on Senator Button he should have sacked Senator Button for ministerial incompetence. Again he failed to show the leadership required of a Prime Minister. Looking at it from another point of view, why was it left to Mr Keating to do the attempted hatchet job on Senator Button? Why did the Prime Minister abrogate that responsibility if there was so much concern about Senator Button's comments? It was only after the event that the Prime Minister got into the act. The dirty work had been done by then. It was only after that that he told Senator Button to button up. The problem is that Mr Hawke is unprepared, as Prime Minister, to take the necessary tough decisions. Senator Walsh is right: the Prime Minister is an Old Jellyback. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of all of this is monumental division and disunity within the Cabinet. As a result there will be confusion in the community, particularly the business community, as to just what the Government's economic policies are. Who does one believe in this Government-the Treasurer, who says that there is no severe downturn in the economy, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, who says that there is a severe downturn in the economy, or the Minister for Finance who says that there may be a severe downturn in the economy but he does not really know?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government is disintegrating. It is disintegrating because of very deep and internal divisions and a lack of leadership. Mr Keating tried to usurp the Prime Minister throughout 1988 and much of 1989 and I think that what has been happening in recent days is a resurrection of that campaign. Honourable senators may recall that a year or so ago he actually sent his lackey, Mr Dawkins, to tell the Prime Minister that he should stand aside for Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA> We have had the merciless public rubbishing of the New South Wales heavyweight and our colleague here-the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson-by his Cabinet colleague Mr Kerin from late 1989 on because of Senator Richardson's servile, cynical, opportunistic, obsequiousness to the radical greens. We have had Mr Kerin's dumping on the whole Cabinet for its pusillanimous acceptance of the Richardson line, a line that cost Australia billions of investment dollars and even more billions of precious export income as a result of aborted development projects, the most notable of which were Wesley Vale and Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had former Finance Minister Senator Walsh's bucketing of Senator Richardson immediately after the election for prostituting rational decision-making on the matter and replacing it with grubby vote buying overtures to the radicals in the important environment movement. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had Senator Walsh's monumental rubbishing of his former Cabinet colleagues immediately after his outright refusal to serve in the Hawke Ministry announced a week after the election. His proclamations have been brutal and devastating. They range from his declaration that the Government lacks the courage to take the necessary hard economic decisions to his now famous description of his Prime Minister. This is from a man who has been one of the key economic Ministers throughout the seven years of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many other outbursts of disloyalty, despair, frustration and accusation by Ministers of this so-called Government over recent weeks. There are too many to name them all, but a few are worthy of mention. All are noteworthy because they involve accusation by Minister against Minister, undermining Minister against Minister and destruction of the basic concept of collective Cabinet solidarity. A couple of these cannot be allowed to escape repeated exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer first to the devastating public criticism of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, by the Prime Minister last week when, in the full glare of the floor of the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister said of Senator Tate that he had exercised `an appalling lapse of judgment' in making public comments presuming the guilt of a person under arrest on a drug charge. What more damning comment could a Prime Minister make of one of his Ministers-`an appalling lapse of judgment'? But what was the outcome? The Prime Minister lacked the spine to sack Senator Tate and Senator Tate lacked the decency, the basic sense of ministerial responsibility, to resign. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the disarray and disloyalty which is now endemic within the Government's own ranks, and which is causing fundamental confusion as to its economic policies and policies generally, was the outburst this week by the now Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and until recently Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, that he was persistently and consistently undermined by several of his colleagues whilst Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> But the supreme demonstration of disarray, disaffection, dislike, disloyalty, division and decay came three days ago when the Deputy Prime Minister took to the streets outside the Parliament to do his job on Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 there was a monumental struggle within the Cabinet as to control of the basic instrument that was to lead us towards economic reform in terms of structural and micro-economic reform-namely, the then Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and now the Industry Commission. After a great struggle the Treasurer won again and Senator Button missed out. Several damaging events then occurred. The Treasurer failed, until the very last moment, to appoint enough commissioners to allow the Commission to function legally and then he filled the positions only on a stop-gap basis. Ministers, including Senator Button, refused to allow the IAC to examine their industry assistance programs. It soon became evident that the Treasurer was not really interested in micro-economic reform. He even described micro-economic reform as small beer, despite it ostensibly having been made the top priority for the Government's third term of office between 1987 and 1989. Nothing was done then. The Government has now claimed it to be its top priority again during its fourth term. But we can be certain that the actuality will be no more action to match the hollow rhetoric that we have seen in the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA> Already the scope for structural reform-that is what so-called micro-reform is-has been massively circumscribed by the Government in the last three or four weeks alone. Meaningful labour market reform has been ruled out by the Government's insistence on adherence to the costly wage-tax deal with the unions and by its violent negative reaction to the Opposition's proposals to permit much greater flexibility in voluntary dealings between employers and employees in terms and conditions of employment. Any prospects for improving the efficiency of government business enterprises through privatisation have been ruled out. As a result, there is every likelihood that more taxpayers' money will go into business enterprises that should be deriving capital from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This week we have had the public disputation between the Treasurer and Senator Button, the relevant Minister, as to their approach to tariff reform and tariff reduction. We have had the extraordinary situation where there was a public attack by the Treasurer on the Minister because he was alleged to be dragging his heels on the whole area of tariff reform, and then within 48 hours the Treasurer said that in fact the tariff reforms that have occurred were done on Senator Button's own initiative. That statement is totally irreconcilable with the thrust of the public bucketing by the Treasurer of Senator Button three days earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has tried to portray himself as the great reformer. Why then has he not said one word to Senator Button about any speeding up of the review into the arrangements for the future of the textile, clothing and footwear industries? Why did he object so violently to Senator Button's recommendations in Cabinet about the handling of the review into the car industry? Every indication and every action by the Treasurer has been against the need for and acceptance of the importance of economic reform despite all the rhetoric that has been spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to preserve some time for my colleague Senator Chapman to speak for longer than the five minutes he would otherwise be entitled to at the end of this debate so I will conclude my remarks on that note other than to say this: this Government cannot govern itself, and a Government that cannot govern itself cannot govern the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the Government get its act together, heal its divisiveness, take the tough decisions and get the economy going again in the right direction. The divisiveness and the resulting confusion that has occurred as a result of the inability of this Government and its senior economic Ministers to act together cohesively and in unity is causing great damage, uncertainty, confusion and falling confidence throughout the Australian community. Regrettably all the signs are that it will be impossible for the Government to correct this. It is for that reason that the Opposition has raised this matter of urgency today and I urge the Senate to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume's interjection is that I am `defending the indefensible'. Those opposite pretended throughout last year that they would do something about interest rates if they got into government at the election. Their leader at the time of the election had been elected to the leadership as a result of a stabbing in the back of John Howard. He had been elected on the basis of opinion polls to lead the Liberal Party into the election, claiming at election time that the coalition would reduce interest rates from day one if elected to government in the course of that election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition was not elected to government, for very good reasons. Only this week the Sydney Morning Herald talked about the Opposition's attack on Government economic policy in the first major economic speech from the new shadow Treasurer, Mr Peter Reith, and said that he failed `to articulate any alternative economic position'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short says that is nonsense; I thought today he would have taken the opportunity which was right there in his hands to articulate an alternative economic position. He did not articulate one word of an alternative position. In terms of economic policy the main arms of the Government's economic policy are fiscal policy, wages policy and monetary policy. It has been very difficult for this Government to administer, as we have done, a tight monetary policy. There has been no difference between any Minister in the Government about the need to maintain a tight monetary policy, as we did last year and have continued to do, with some relaxation, in the earlier part of this calendar year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been no difference between any Ministers in the Government on that issue or about the need for a tight fiscal policy. A tight fiscal policy is something which those opposite would know nothing about, leaving us, as they did in 1983, with an enormous deficit, which this Government has turned into a surplus. They knew nothing about it. They do not talk about fiscal policy now because they really do not know anything about it. In terms of wages policy they bleat away--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why are those opposite all yelling their heads off? Is this painful to them? I think it might be. They never talk about wages policy with any sense at all. This Government has administered a wages policy which has been both practicable and fair. Those two things are absolutely necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year I listened to those opposite talking about the decline in the living standard of Australians. When we came into office 600,000 people were out in the streets without jobs. But last year those opposite were talking about declining living standards, using the measure relating to average weekly earnings. We used the measure relating to household disposable income. We chose an improvement in Australian living standards, and that is because people have been employed under this Government. Those opposite have nothing to say about that because they have nothing of any sense to say about anything. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of Senator Short's speech, which was supposed to be dealing with the directions of Government economic policy, about which there are no differences between Ministers, he wandered off down the old track which he has talked about on many occasions in this place before. He talked about a monumental struggle between the Treasurer and me over the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), as it then was. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite know who determines the administrative arrangements. It is the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I tell Senator Short now that as far as I am aware, the Treasurer did not even seek to have the IAC in his portfolio. There was no power struggle between the Treasurer and me on that issue. There was a decision by the Government that the Industries Commission, as it now is, should be used to look at wider economic issues than the specialist industry by industry reviews which it had conducted in the past. The Government having made that decision, it is totally appropriate for the Industry Commission to be within the aegis of the Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short forgets that while the Industries Assistance Commission was in my portfolio, we adopted every one of its recommendations except those in respect of chemicals and plastics where, as I said yesterday, we lowered the tariffs further than the IAC wanted us to do, and the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Those are the two exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1988 we announced an across-the-board phase down of tariffs in industry. Once there is that process of an across-the-board tops down approach to tariff reductions, the IAC, as the body looking at individual industries, has limited relevance. The Government made a decision to use it for economy-wide references, as it has since done. So, if Senator Short wants to lay the groundwork for what has happened this week by looking back to conspiracies which allegedly happened in 1987 or 1988, he is again quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to lecture the Opposition in any sense at all, but I do wish that it would understand that there is a difference between the direction of economic policy and its consequences. The words used in Senator Short's matter of public importance are `the need . . . to clarify its economic policies'. There is no need for clarification on that issue at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not correct. There are many differences in the business community about the consequences of current economic policies in terms of still relatively tight monetary policy and so on. But there are not differences or misunderstandings in the business community-I keep in pretty close touch with them; they do not talk to me about directions of economic policy but they talk to me about the consequences of current economic policies. It is natural for them to do so, as I am the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. There are differences of agreement and of emphasis on the consequences for different sectors of the economy. As the Treasurer said, I think yesterday, the economy is patchy in terms of the consequences of economic policy. Some people are feeling it more than others. That is a fact from which no Minister in this Government retreats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have used some words about the effects of current economic circumstances on sectors of the business community, and so on; the Treasurer has used words which are no different. I think he said in the House of Representatives yesterday that it was purely a matter of emphasis in the terminology which was used. The point I am trying to make is that there is a difference between confusion on economic policies and confusion about the consequences-which there may well be in sectors of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short, in his matter of urgency, goes on to talk about `the public quarrel between the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce' allegedly confusing economic policies. I said nothing at all in the now controversial Walsh Report interview about the directions of Government economic policy. The Treasurer subsequently made some remarks about tariff reform, which are well known. In answers to questions in this Senate on a series of occasions-Senator Short asked some of them-I have explained my views about those issues, as I am entitled to do. But to turn that seeming disagreement about these issues-Senator Short made the point that the Treasurer in Question Time yesterday or the day before had qualified considerably some of his earlier remarks-into a question of confusion about the Government's economic policies is ridiculous.

He represents an opposition which has substantial differences between its shadow Ministers on a whole range of issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this urgency motion with more sorrow than anger. I suppose the anger has disappeared after five Parliaments in this place. It does seem to me to be a pity that after the last election, with the Opposition still in opposition, its members would have learnt that they needed to change by focusing on policy and forgetting about the personalities. But yet again, we have a matter of urgency focusing on personalities, running that rather silly line that I think the electorate is well and truly tired of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not normally agree with Gerard Henderson in his Media Watch, but I must say that I was flicking through it last night and it came to mind this morning when I saw the Opposition's so-called urgency motion. He referred to a number of follies involving the Australian media in election mode. One of them in fact referred to Senator Button, and there was an unflattering photograph of him attached to the article as well. That was Folly No. 3-`An Obsession with Minor Errors'. Not only had the media fallen for this particular folly but also, unfortunately, the Opposition is continuing to fall for it. At the end of this discussion about the problems that occur in terms of miscalculations or so-called scoops, there is a lesson for the future which I think is important. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Journalists on the election trail should not cast the first stone. They should treat the minor miscalculations of others in the same manner as they treat their own slip-ups-i.e. by overlooking them. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is excellent advice. The quite innocuous statements made by Senator Button on a television program quite frankly, I think, had absolutely nothing to do with the economic debate in this country and it is a pity that as a matter of urgency we did not have the Opposition bringing forward something of substance. Indeed, I think the focus on this debate could very well have been on the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and his propositions with regard to what is the fundamental economic debate-that is the terms of trade. But we have not got that. We did not have it yesterday in the other economic debate, and we do not have it again today. Presumably at some stage people are going to get tired of talking about personalities and get on to the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue in terms of the terms of trade, of course, is that if the Government has got it wrong, we are certainly going to find out in the next couple of years. The terms of trade is the only thing that really we need to focus on. At the time of the last election we made it very clear that for a number of reasons we, as a party, were unhappy with the direction in which the Government was going. We think it has been sending the wrong signals. We believe that, for example, resources will not go into import replacement industries unless they can earn a higher rate of return, and the problem with high interest rates, of course, is that they discriminate against investment in comparison to consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> But over all of this, I think there is an extraordinary exercise in priorities-not only the priorities of the Opposition but also, if one bothers to flick through them, the priorities of the media. Let us look at what was given high priority yesterday-high priority, of course, in terms of what the media see as being important. They put high priority on the operation the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is going to have, and low priority on the conclusions of the international conference with regard to the environment and the agreement between the industrialised countries not to assist less industrialised countries overcome the problem of ozone depletion. They saw the operation of the Prime Minister-a minor matter, quite frankly, both in personal and certainly political terms-to be high priority; they saw these other matters to be low priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition members, running as they do the exercise of trying to get themselves a few brownie points and hopefully a headline here or there, have decided to adopt exactly the same tactic. I think they are selling the electorate short by doing that and I think that the electorate, unless it gets better service from the Opposition, will keep them there for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The item which got included in this debate which I want to focus on is overseas debt. That involves economic policies which I think need to be enunciated much more clearly. Here, again, we have had another one of those fallacies running around: we say the size of Australia's debt is a very large number and of course debt is bad, and you fill in your own particular assertion at that point. The difficulty, of course, is that the debate about overseas debt with regard to Australia has not been discussed in rational terms. Indeed, on one particular calculation, if we wish to take debt as a percentage of our net capital stock, that is in terms of our buildings, our equipment and our constructions, it in fact is 11 per cent. This is the normal exercise of working out whether we are heavily geared or not. If we wanted to add into that the land, the resources, and the financial assets, nobody could possibly claim that Australia, as a country, was heavily geared. </PARA>
<PARA> The really absurd exercise, though, is this one of saying that every Australian somehow or other owns this debt. It is almost as nonsensical, of course, as suggesting that every Australian is responsible for 0.00002 of every murder that is committed in Australia. They are not; neither is every Australian responsible for the debt. The debt, and the correctness of decisions with regard to debt, are a matter not of a debt is bad, no debt is good type of simplistic reaction. Borrowings are judged on the basis of what we borrow for. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australians are happy to and want to be in the position to borrow for a home. That does not make those borrowings bad, provided the money is put to good use-that is, they are buying a home-and they can service the debt. The judgment about debt is made in terms of outcome and sustenance, not in terms of debt is bad, no debt is good. In terms of the money that has come into Australia by way of borrowings, quite frankly the jury is still out. We do not know whether those borrowings have been put to good use. </PARA>
<PARA> But one of the things that we do know-and the Opposition in the last Parliament made a great deal of noise about this particular matter-is that we have had a downgrading of our credit rating. It is an even more odd exercise to get upset about that, because if one is upset about the level of debt, why would one be upset about a downgrading of credit ratings? A downgrading of credit ratings means that we have less ability to borrow. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in terms of that exercise, all it means is that if a high foreign debt is seen as a problem, the existence of that debt prevents us from further increasing our foreign borrowings. I would have thought that Opposition members would be happy with that position. But, instead, they run the two contradictory lines that the high foreign debt is bad and that the downgrading of our credit rating is bad. That is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent, of course, that the money that has come in has produced products, and these products are competitive, then over time we will see the outcome of that productive investment. In so far as those investments have been bad investments, then it is a judgment on the people that have spent that money, and a judgment on the people who loaned that money-that is, a judgment on the banks and other financial institutions in this country for lending money to people who should not have been able to get that money, and secondly, on private enterprise in terms of its investments. But we have had a lot of Opposition members saying, as we have had other commentators saying, `Government should take some action'. I simply ask the question: What particular action do people want government to take? Do they want government interfering in the investment policies of private enterprise? I would have thought that the Opposition would say no to that. Do we want bureaucrats making decisions about what happens? I would have thought that the Opposition would say no to that too. We have heard nothing from the Opposition. I had hoped that in the early days of this new Parliament we would have heard something about the particular policies the Opposition thinks the Government should put in place with regard to the foreign debt. But as yet we have not heard anything. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercises on those investments and the discussions that have been carried out so far have been of a highly artificial kind. For example, during the election campaign I heard an Opposition spokesperson maintain that a lot of the money that has come in has been poorly spent. I am not quite sure how that person made such a judgment, but there was a reference in the speech to the non-traded sector, such as insurance, freight and the like. I believe that investments in those areas have had very important implications for the cost structure of the traded sector. But our infrastructure has to be continually modernised. For example, the suggestion that we should not have spent so much on computers seems to me a little like suggestions, made when Edison invented the electric light, that we should not get into electricity because gas was cheaper. We have to stay current; we have to stay competitive. If those expenditures are poorly done, we will see the results, not in gross terms of money being spent on computerisation, but in the fact that the money will be spent in the wrong way and in the wrong areas. However, I have not yet seen either industry or others bringing forward definite propositions that that money has been spent incorrectly. </PARA>
<PARA> Somebody has suggested that the money should not have been spent on housing. My party does not see the economy as existing in its own right. We see its purpose as that of providing goods and services that benefit the population. If that benefit flows through to the population in the form of housing, we see that as a benefit, not a disbenefit, to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of our high foreign debt, to the extent that lending to Australia declines because of our credit rating, we will find that further downward pressure will be put on that debt. That appears to be a good thing. To blame the Government for private sector debt seems very odd and I have not yet heard what type of action the Government is expected to take in relation to the private sector. To date, the arguments are lacking in compulsion with regard to the need to increase efficiency and competitiveness. I would point to this factor because throughout the election that was the only thread that I was able to pick up that was consistent in what the Opposition said. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no necessary relationship between a more competitive economy and lower foreign debt-none whatsoever. A more competitive economy may lead to lower foreign debt, but on the other hand it may lead to higher foreign debt. The reason for that is obvious. International lenders are not in the area of charity and if they do lend they are likely to lend to those people who, hopefully, can repay. A more active and competitive economy would have a greater capacity to pay and, hence, a greater capacity to raise its debt. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the matters which we should be debating, not the rather silly matter of urgency that is before the Senate. We see no urgency in the matter that has been brought forward and, hence, we will not be supporting it. We hope that next time such a matter is put forward it will be urgent so that we can discuss the real issues of the economy. </PARA>

Why do we have to pay double what people in many other countries would pay for most of the cars on the Australian market? Why do Australians have to pay $160 for a pair of Nike Pegasus running shoes when Americans pay only $82? Why do we have to pay $600 for the same suit that even New Zealanders can get for $450?

<PARA> The reason for these outrageous prices in Australia is, according to Mr Keating, that Senator Button has been dragging the chain. Mr Keating says that Senator Button does not want to cut tariffs as much as he does. Mr Keating says that Senator Button wants to do private deals with car companies and other clients of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce about future levels of protection. Mr Keating says that prices would be even worse if Senator Button had his way on consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> But according to Senator Button, it is Mr Keating's fault. It is because of macro-economic circumstances. Senator Button says that we face these problems because Mr Keating has not brought the current account deficit under control. Senator Button says that Mr Keating's policies have produced an economic downturn of some severity, reducing our living standards. Senator Button says that Mr Keating's policies have caused a decline in investment and investment intentions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly for all Australians, who seem to have been completely forgotten in the midst of all the quarrelling, divisions and rancour between these two senior Ministers, which has become the hallmark of this Hawke Labor Government in its fourth term, both are right and both are wrong. Both are right because the continued featherbedding of large sections of Australian industry, with excessive protection and a regulated labour market as well as the wrong macro-economic policies of high interest rates, high taxation and, consequently, high inflation, together are causing prices to spiral and living standards to go through the floor. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why Senator Short and I, on behalf of the Opposition, are arguing as a matter of urgency today for `the need for the Government to clarify its economic policies which have been thrown into confusion by the public quarrel between the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce'.</PARA>
<PARA> A few moments ago in his very lame response to this debate, Senator Button said that to establish the terms of the motion we had to show that there were differences between Ministers on the direction of economic policy. Certainly, in the community there is concern about the direction of economic policy. Certainly, there are differences between these Ministers as to the correct rate of change in the structure of our economy. Certainly, as we have also seen from their statements this week, there are differences between these Ministers as to the health of our economy. So, for the sake of all Australians, let us hope that Old Jellyback gets that desperately needed spine transplant while his other physical problems are sorted out in that Sydney hospital. Then he can knock some heads together and instil some unity and sense of purpose into his tired, uninspired and uninspiring Government. </PARA>
<PARA> With the economy in recession, Australia cannot afford to have this Government starting its fourth term in office by being unable to give itself and its Ministers a sense of direction, unable to lay down clearly its program for the next three years, unable to provide us with stability and unity of purpose and, most importantly, unable to show strong leadership. All we see coming from this Government is division and rancour. No wonder people in the community are confused when they see this occurring in a government whose leader proudly trumpeted during the last election campaign that a party which cannot govern itself cannot govern the country. Indeed, a party which cannot govern itself cannot govern the country. This is the very position in which Labor has been ever since the election. No wonder the Australian people are flocking to support the coalition, as evidenced by yesterday's Morgan gallup poll. In contrast with the Government, the Opposition now offers a competent and united team, committed to making the changes necessary to ensure Australia's economic recovery and future prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> But sadly, Australia cannot wait until the next election for these initiatives. They are urgently needed right now. Just as sadly, this Government's senior Ministers cannot agree on the required action or initiate it. So, home buyers, small businesses and farmers have been forced to bleed by high interest rates and a consequently over-valued dollar. All this Government can agree to do is to restrain the burgeoning trade deficit and foreign debt by dampening demand. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia really needs is to increase its product and to produce more goods and services which are internationally competitive, and therefore capable of replacing imports without the protective shield of tariffs or quotas and earn export dollars for this country. This has not happened, according to the Treasurer, because Senator Button lacks sufficient zeal to reduce tariffs and likes doing deals with industry behind closed doors. What hypocrisy from the Treasurer! From whom does he think Senator Button learned about doing deals? Above all else, this is a Government of deals and fixes, especially between big government, big unions and big business, under its corporate state mentality which allows no place for individuals, their rights or freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA> Foremost among the perpetrators of deals has been the Treasurer himself. Let us face it; he was weaned on them from his youth in the New South Wales Labor Party. Do honourable senators need to be reminded of his successive deals with Crean and Kelty, giving them de facto Cabinet status, allowing them to retain corporate power and status at the cost of delivering continually falling living standards to Australian workers-deals which prevented the deregulation of the labour market and the development of enterprise based industrial relations. What gall on the part of the Treasurer! How dare he condemn Senator Button for doing private deals! The fact is that this whole Government has been one of deals and fixes with the business and union mates of Hawke, Keating and Button. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians should also remember, as they watch the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce squabble over a consumption tax, that largely because of the Treasurer's surreptitious changes to the existing sales tax we are now paying consumption tax to the tune of $9.4 billion per year. But even more sinister is the hidden consumption tax, the $7.7 billion extra which Australians have to pay for goods because of the continuation of excessive tariffs and quotas, which has been the subject of the squabble between the Ministers this week. Why would a government of secrecy, of private deals and fixes like this one want to be up front and honest with the Australian people by introducing a consumption tax when it is already ripping $17.1 billion out of their pockets in hidden taxes?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has repeatedly talked about the need to add value to our primary products as a means of improving our trade balance. But yesterday he threw up his hands and blamed the experts when I asked him about the continuing crisis in the wool industry. Then today in this debate he sought to fabricate differences within the Opposition on wool policy. What about allowing the opportunity to add some value in Australia to this massive wool stockpile? Because the Minister has been dragging the chain on reducing protection, Australian wool scouring actually receives minus levels of protection; that is, the excessive protection on various inputs to this wool scouring industry makes what is an otherwise efficient industry less competitive on world markets. So much for this Government's commitment to value adding. It says volumes for the Government's attitude to the wool industry, which would gain enormous benefits from value adding. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has offered no policy prescription which is effective in increasing the productivity and product output of Australian industry. Its policies have simply been designed to dampen down demand and in that way try to overcome our burgeoning trade deficit and our burgeoning foreign debt. For the Government it is too hard to increase product, because that involves changing the way we do things. It involves treading on some toes. It involves especially treading on the toes of some of the Government's union mates. </PARA>
<PARA> What this country needs to increase its product is a deregulated labour market, based on individual firms, the productivity of those firms and their capacity to pay. We need to have an industrial relations system which will allow effective profit sharing and give employees a stake in those firms. We need to abandon the `us and them' mentality that the Government's present centralised system of industrial relations encourages. Only then will we establish competitive export-oriented industries which, as I said earlier, not only can replace imports competitively without any need for protection but can also earn export dollars for this country, and in those two ways combine to reduce our massive and, as I say, continually burgeoning foreign debt. Australian industries need to be exposed to the chill winds of world competition which will provide them with the incentive to become more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to dramatically lower the cost of transport in this country. Given the size of Australia, as well as its distance from international markets, the cost of transport is of much greater significance to our cost of production than it is for many other countries. But it is made even worse because of the effects of the power of the union movement with regard to restrictive work practices and union structure in rail transport, our waterfront and shipping industries. Unless we are prepared to bite the bullet and reform those industries, we have no hope of becoming internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin postulated that our overseas debt was not a problem, because it was only 11 per cent of our assets. What Senator Macklin ignored was the capacity of this country, through its earnings, to service that debt. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Opposition calls on the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to respond to this urgency motion by immediately acting to reduce protection and featherbedding more quickly, to reform the restrictive work practices and union domination in rail transport, on our wharves and in shipping, to deregulate the labour market and establish enterprise based industrial relations, and to cut government spending. Only then we will see the turn around in our economy and increasing prosperity for all Australians. The Government has been out on one long smoko for the last three years. It is time to get back on the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I speak very briefly to the report. This is a very useful report by the Auditor-General. It would have been more useful had it been received by this chamber before the Senate Estimates committees that met this week in fact did meet. Many questions emerge out of this report which could, and in some instances should, have been raised in Senate Estimates committees and certainly would have been raised had senators been aware of the material that is in this report. I am certainly not blaming the Government for this, because one can clearly see that the report was conveyed to the Government on 17 May, according to the letter at the front. All I am saying is that this sort of timing is unfortunate. I hope that the Auditor-General recognises how useful his work is to senators in dealing with Senate Estimates. The timing of the Senate Estimates committees must have been available to all the authorities involved quite some time ago, and the significance of the points I am making would be evident from the fact that this report, for example, indicates that there has been an unacceptable level of breaches of legislation by statutory authorities in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General notes that 18 statutory authorities were required to deal with receipt and expenditure of moneys and the acquisition of disposable assets in accordance with the law. The list of 18 contains major organisations such as the Australian National Gallery, the Australian Sports Commission, the Health Insurance Commission and so on. On top of that, legislative restraints on borrowing were breached by another series of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General does say that, while it should be noted that many of these breaches involved relatively small amounts for relatively short durations, and, where approvals had been required, they were later referred to a competent authority for information, nevertheless the number of organisations involved is of concern. If it is of concern, it would have been nice to have raised those concerns with the bodies involved at Senate Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> I think most senators know that I am concerned about the matter of dead rent, and the Auditor-General's audit report had previously mentioned that dead rent amounting to $3.6m was involved in the Rialto building in Melbourne, and this was described by the Auditor-General as `excessive'. He also states:</PARA>
<PARA>Following further consideration of the comments provided by the Australian Construction Service, the Australian National Audit Office sought advice from the Department of Administrative Services and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, an occupant of the Rialto building, on the reasons for submissions of clients briefs at, or after, completion of the building-</PARA>
<PARA>which is one of the reasons for the dead rent-</PARA>
<PARA>since that appeared to the ANAO to have resulted in an avoidable dead rent cost of $1.6 million. </PARA>
<PARA>This sort of thing would have been significant and important enough to have been raised in some detail in Estimates committees. For example, we have had the Department of Veterans' Affairs estimates. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The audits of the accounts and records of the hospitals--</PARA>
<PARA>of the Department of Veterans' Affairs-</PARA>
<PARA>found deficiencies in the areas of salaries, payment of claims, stores and management information and reporting systems. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on throughout a whole range of departments. I might say, Mr President, in your area, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The audit found a disregard for the established form of Commonwealth budgetary expenditure control and a number of breaches of legislation in that moneys received were not paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and were spent without appropriation and the exercise of other statutory processes. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that these matters are sufficiently significant to merit being raised in the Committee of the Whole of the Senate itself when the Estimates committees report to this chamber. As a result of document like this report coming in late, I now feel obliged to tell the Secretary of each of the Estimates committees that the matters raised in this report merit a reservation in the committee reports. I am certain it would assist the procedures of this chamber if that sort of thing did not have to take place, but I give notice I will advise the Secretary of every Estimates committee that we should have the reservation enabling these matters to be raised in the appropriations debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise but for one moment to express by concern at the outrageous situation in which we find ourselves in respect of the swearing in of a new senator from Western Australia. Senator Ian Campbell was endorsed by the Liberal Party on 30 April of this year, filling a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Fred Chaney. The State Parliament has sat continuously since 1 May. It is now 17 May and Senator Campbell is still unable to take his place in this chamber. My understanding is that at 3 p.m. yesterday a meeting of both Houses of the Western Australian State Parliament took place, and Senator Campbell was duly appointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is symptomatic of the problems of the Lawrence State Labor Government of Western Australia that it is so incompetent and incapable that the State of Western Australia-its State-has quite unnecessarily been denied a senator for a period. At this moment Senator Campbell is unable to be sworn in because the due processes and formalities have not been completed by the Western Australian State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not without significance to note the contrast between that situation and the situation pertaining to Mr Goss, the Labor Premier of Queensland, who sought to make a political point and embarrass the National Party in Queensland when he called for an early endorsement to enable an early appointment. That was intended to flush out whether or not Mr Stone was to be submitted as the nominee of the National Party. It could do it in a flash, but the Western Australian State Labor Government, which has been sitting since 1 May-the Monday following the Sunday endorsement of the then Mr Campbell-is unable to find time for a two-minute joint sitting to appoint a new senator from Western Australia. It shows either total and absolute incompetence or total disregard for the proper representation of that State in this chamber and within that State. I suspect it is a combination of both. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be no clear indication when those processes are going to be duly completed so as to allow for Senator Campbell to be sworn in, to take his place in this chamber, and to fulfil his obligations and responsibilities on a number of appropriate committees. I condemn the State Labor Government for its failure. As I say, it is symptomatic of the imbroglio, the mess, the confusion and the incompetence into which it has presently plunged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to reject the assertions made by Senator Crichton-Browne about the Lawrence Western Australian Government. I heard Senator Crichton-Browne's comments about the speed with which Queensland appointed its new senator to replace the retired senator. I draw Senator Crichton-Browne's attention to the fact that Queensland is slightly different to Western Australia in as much as it has only one chamber to deal with, whilst Western Australia has two. I might add that at this stage the upper House in Western Australia has a different agenda in mind than has the Government. That, in itself, is making headlines in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
