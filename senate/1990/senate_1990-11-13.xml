<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations and arises out of a question I asked him yesterday. I refer to the Government's submission to the Remuneration Tribunal recommending a 6 per cent pay rise for senior members of the Industrial Relations Commission. I note what he said about the present status of that submission, so I will not go back to that. I ask the Minister: On what grounds was that submission based? Does the Minister agree with the Prime Minister that an increase of the sort that has been referred to could totally destabilise the wage fixing procedures and that the discussions that the Minister will have, or is perhaps now having, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Commission are to avoid that outcome?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3963" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The grounds on which the application was made were consistent with an undertaking I had given the Industrial Relations Commission following upon the breaking of the nexus between its rates of pay and that of judges. The undertaking I gave was that the Government would conduct an inquiry into that issue, that is, the proper level of remuneration and how it is to be fixed in the absence of a nexus, and a series of other matters which relate to the fact that this Government has succeeded in achieving an agreement with the States that heads of tribunal of the State industrial relations commissions would be appointed to our bench and vice versa-members of our bench to their bench-to integrate the State and Federal systems into one national system. That gave rise to a series of matters relating to remuneration and conditions of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry that we have now announced-the Gleeson inquiry-is to examine the right and proper ways of resolving those issues. I indicated that, were the inquiry not to have completed its deliberations by the time the next adjustment for judges was due, I would put before the Remuneration Tribunal a proposal for Industrial Relations Commissioners and Deputy Presidents. There is nothing surprising about that explanation; I have read it myself today in the newspapers. Maybe Senator Durack does not read the newspapers or maybe he prefers this medium of information exchange, and I do not blame him for that. That is the short explanation in reply to the first part of his question.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of his question asks whether I agree that this claim would totally destabilise the wages system. The Prime Minister is right to make the observation that major increases, coming at a time in which ordinary wage and salary earners in Australia were expecting a wage increase based on the September quarter consumer price index, could have a serious effect on wage stability in this country. That is a fair enough and quite proper and correct observation to be made.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason why the Government has chosen, in the circumstances of the 0.7 per cent September quarter CPI figure, to review the situation with respect to the application to the Remuneration Tribunal for Industrial Relations Commissioners and Deputy Presidents is that we are given here an opportunity to continue trending down inflation rates. It seems to us that that is an appropriate thing for a responsible economic manager to do.</PARA>
<PARA> I can report that in the last six quarters we have presided over a successive drop in levels of inflation as measured by the consumer price index. In June last year the quarterly return was 2.4 per cent; in September last year, 2.3 per cent; in December last year, 1.9 per cent; in March this year, 1.7 per cent; in June this year, 1.6 per cent; and in the September quarter this year, it was 0.7 per cent. That is a quarter on quarter succession of the levels of inflation moving downwards. It seemed appropriate to us that, since September was marked as the quarter in which the general wage earning population was to achieve its first increase under this accord and as we have a low return, it was entirely appropriate-in fact, quite responsible-for a government to examine all of the pressures on wage fixation and to take the time to consult with the parties in relation to wage fixation to see whether we, as a government used to making creative economic decisions and taking the hard choices about industrial relations, could generate a further reduction in inflation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations whether he is aware that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has recently issued its figures on industrial disputes throughout Australia for the month of July. Do these figures show that industrial disputation continues to be at record low levels? Can this magnificent result be included among the achievements of the Government's accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3964" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have consistently said that, of all of the measures of lost time to industry, the level of industrial relations disputes is probably the least important because the time lost owing to accidents and disease in industry ranges about 10 times more and the time lost through labour turnover and absenteeism is about 10 times more. Not withstanding that, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported in its latest bulletin on industrial disputes in Australia, published on 27 October, that the level of industrial disputation has dropped even further. Briefly, some of the main features of the report as recorded by the Bureau of Statistics are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the 12 months ended July 1990-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . A total of 910,000 working days were lost. This is the lowest twelve month figure since this measure was first published on a regular monthly basis . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Of the industry groupings, the Construction industry, and the Metal products, machinery and equipment manufacturing industry each reported the lowest level of working days lost since this measure was introduced on a regular monthly basis . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The report also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory reported the lowest level of working days lost since this measure was published on a regular monthly basis . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of working days lost per thousand employees, the overall figure (142 days) and the figures for the following industries and States were the lowest levels recorded since the measure was first introduced on a regular monthly basis--</PARA>
<PARA>Those industries concern construction and metal processing. That is, indeed, a pleasing return. For the month of July, 37,500 working days were lost in 102 disputes. For the year ended July 1990, 910,000 working days were lost, the lowest, as I have said, according to this measure, since it was introduced and the lowest since 1968. I point out that the work force is now 65 per cent larger than it was in 1968, when we had the same number, in gross terms, of days lost.</PARA>
<PARA> I table for the interest of the Senate a table I have compiled of the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees for the 12 months ended July each year, from 1982 to 1990. It shows 603 in the last year of the Fraser Government, and in this current year 142. The table shows a consistent fall, except for the year 1998. I table that for the information of the Senate and say that the one feature of the statistics that I--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the Minister explain the basis of redundancy payments? Are they meant to be offered to employees to take early retirement because their jobs have become superfluous? If so, how does he explain the relatively large number of redundancy payments which have been made to the drivers of Comcars? Why have redundancy payments been made to drivers who are on the eve of their retirement anyway? Why have new drivers been engaged to replace those drivers who were supposed to be redundant? What influence has the Transport Workers Union had on this quite blatant waste of taxpayers' money?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we get Senator Parer coming in here with his own view of history and his own view of the facts. Redundancy payments, of course, do have a specific purpose. In respect of the matter Senator Parer raised in respect of Comcar, there was a review of the functions and delivery of services of Comcar. That review was conducted earlier this year and towards the end of last year. Out of that review came some proposals for the reorganisation of the service side of Comcar. As part of that, the Department of Administrative Services decided that redundancy payments should be made available to a number of drivers in order that, as part of a package of reforms, new shift arrangements and new working structures could be put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his answer and I would like to ask him: if redundancy payments were made because jobs were becoming superfluous, why were those people who were paid those redundancy amounts replaced by new drivers? Again I ask the question: to what extent did the Transport Workers Union have an influence on this blatant abuse of taxpayers' money?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very easy to allege the blatant abuse of taxpayers' money. Of course that charge is denied. In all reforms of this sort where industrial matters are involved the relevant union is involved, as it has been in this case. The redundancy payments were made available on the basis of a number of criteria, one of which was the length of service.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to reports today that the Republic of South Africa is closing its consulate in Sydney and scaling down the operations of its embassy in Canberra. Accordingly, I ask the Minister: Is this some form of protest against Australia's supposed lack of recognition of reforms claimed by the Pretoria Administration? If so, what are the implications for current and future political and diplomatic relations between Australia and South Africa?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3965" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As reported this morning, South Africa told us officially yesterday of its intention to close the Sydney Consulate and to scale back its Canberra Embassy representation to an ambassador and two diplomatic personnel by March next year. It appears clear, especially from statements made by Ambassador Tothill, that the main motivation for this has been financial-the need to make savings in order to accommodate new pressures for upgraded representation elsewhere, especially in eastern Europe. That is a familiar problem for governments-one that we are wrestling with ourselves-and it is a response that causes us no difficulty whatsoever. But it does seem that South Africa could not resist the opportunity to try to score some political points in the process to make a propaganda virtue, as it were, out of its economic necessity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems clear that there is an element of diplomatic punishment involved for Australia as a result of our continued active support for sanctions, through the Commonwealth and elsewhere. The most explicit indication of this is, I guess, in the terms of the South African note that we received which states not only that there is a `diminished level of mutual interest prevailing in relations between South Africa and Australia' but also that it is the `view of the South African Government that Australia's representation in South Africa should be reduced to a commensurate level by 31 March 1991'.</PARA>
<PARA> There is of course no principle of reciprocity in international relations which requires a country to downgrade its presence in a second country in response to that country downgrading its own presence in the first country. If it were really accepted by the South African Government that we were about to greet the dawn of a new era in South Africa's domestic circumstances and in its international relations, this is hardly the time to be diminishing the opportunities for contact between us. That hardly squares with the South African Government's own stated commitment to making that country more open and accessible to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia makes no apology whatever for the stance that we have taken and continue to take on South Africa. The Prime Minister and I have warmly welcomed developments to date and we have both congratulated President de Klerk on the statesmanship that he and his senior leadership colleagues have shown in breaking the awful impasse of the last 40 years. We have both expressed the hope that it will be possible to wind back sanctions sooner rather than later, but we will not move unless we are satisfied, in consultation with our Commonwealth friends and with the most representative black voices within South Africa, that there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible change.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that President de Klerk's sincerity seems to be clear and that the commitment to change by him and his senior colleagues may well now be irreversible. But the process of change itself has as yet only just begun, and it is simply too early to state with any confidence that that process of change is irreversible. What has happened to date has essentially been talks about talks, and the clearing away of preliminary obstacles. Substantive negotiations have not begun. Only one of the basic pillars of apartheid-the Separate Amenities Act-has to date been dismantled. The other basic pillars: the Groups Areas Act, the Land Acts, the Population Registration Act-not to mention the Constitution itself-all remain.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is not looking to sustain trade sanctions, financial sanctions or sporting sanctions for a moment longer than they are necessary, but we are determined to maintain them for just so long as they are necessary to ensure that apartheid is destroyed once and for all and that South Africa does at last become a genuine non-racial democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by expressing the hope that the South African Government will recognise the sincerity and consistency of Australia's position and not now embark on a course of diplomatic action which will make more difficult than it needs to be the task of rebuilding relations between our two countries in what we all hope will shortly be the post-apartheid environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I preface my question by reminding the Minister that Australia's electrical power industry is responsible for $32 billion of Australia's foreign debt as a result of the installation of generating capacity to meet demand forecasts which failed to materialise and that the ability of the Queensland Electricity Commission (QEC) to predict demand has been particularly poor, leading it actively to encourage the wasteful use of electricity in order to increase revenue. Is the Minister aware that in just six years from, 1982 to 1988, forecasts by the QEC exceeded reality by 1,000 megawatts? Is the Minister also aware that the QEC is now proposing to spend $550m on the 600-megawatt Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme, 25 per cent of the cost of which will be spent offshore on generating equipment? Is he aware that the debt of the QEC is growing at a rate of 15 per cent per year? Has the Federal Government considered insisting on the States controlling electricity supply and directing utilities towards demand management and readily achievable energy efficiency? Will the Government consider placing a cap on foreign borrowings by State electricity utilities and if not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am aware of all those things in Senator Coulter's question now that he has asked me the question, but for the first time I am aware of all those things.

In so far as Senator Coulter's question seeks information about various things, I cannot supply that at the present time but I will seek to provide the honourable senator with an answer. Of course, the general issue of electricity generation came on the agenda for the Premiers Conference as a result of concern about the price of electricity, the management of electricity authorities and a number of the issues inherent in Senator Coulter's question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Did the Minister see a report in the Sunday Age of 11 November that the Opposition trade spokesman, Mr Alexander Downer, said he would lead a trade mission to South Africa next year? Given the clear position on sanctions which has been spelt out by the international community in general, and the Commonwealth in particular, what is the Government's reaction to Mr Downer's comments?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3967" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the report on Sunday that Mr Alexander Downer, the Opposition spokesman on trade, said that he will lead a trade mission to South Africa next year whether Australia has lifted its sanctions by then or not. It will be fascinating to see how Dr Hewson reacts to this particular triumph of expediency over principle, and whether he will disown this exercise by his trade spokesman-which I now invite him to do-or whether he will regard this as just another illustration of the kind of `selfish' foreign policy that he recommends for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Mr Downer has done cuts completely across the policy of successive Australian governments since the mid-1970s which, for all the reasons I outlined a moment ago in response to Senator Loosley, has been to maintain a united, consistent approach on the question of sanctions-to use them to bring South Africa not to its knees but to its senses, and not to lift them until the process of the destruction of apartheid is irreversibly under way. Mr Downer's statement is one which sends exactly the wrong signals to Pretoria at this stage. Come what may, however slowly the reform process now moves forward, however long it takes to address and remove the basic remaining injustices of the apartheid system, the Liberal and National parties will be in there cheering.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a signal, moreover, that will be read with dismay by all those around the world-not least in black South Africa and in the Commonwealth-who know that the battle is not yet over and that it can be won only if principles are maintained, if international solidarity is maintained and if international pressure continues to be maintained so long as it is productive, which at the moment it undoubtedly continues to be. It is the case, and I say it again, that apartheid is a monstrous evil. It is still overwhelmingly intact in South Africa today. This Government will not be dissuaded, whether by crude and unprincipled behaviour now foreshadowed by the Opposition, or by some not very much less subtle diplomatic pressure from South Africa, from doing everything--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to tell the Senate that as of yesterday the Commonwealth has now successfully negotiated with all the States and Territories to allow for magistrates and judges to award a community service order instead of a term of imprisonment or a fine in cases where a Federal offender, having been convicted, is to be sentenced. I believe that this is a most important arrangement, and to have it concluded with the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr John Dowd, agreeing only yesterday is to put in place an Australia-wide system which actually began in Tasmania some years ago, with the now Sir Max Bingham introducing community service orders in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have reached a situation where all governments and jurisdictions in Australia in relation to Federal offenders will now have available the alternative of the community service order. In the case of New South Wales this is certainly a sensible move in relation to the costs of administering the Corrective Services portfolio because, whilst it costs around $40,000 a year to keep a person in prison in New South Wales, it will cost some $1,800 a year to administer a community service order.</PARA>
<PARA> The great advantage of community service orders from the Commonwealth point of view is not to provide a more lenient sentence in the case of those engaged in major drug trafficking or in relation to major fraud against the Commonwealth or tax evasion; but particularly in cases of social security offences where, for example, a woman has got caught up in a series of offences, is brought before a magistrate in relation to those offences and ought to be convicted, but where it would be a tragedy for the family and would cause greater costs for the State if that woman were to be imprisoned in the absence of an alternative such as a community service order being available.</PARA>
<PARA> This sentencing option will enable the community to indicate that what is done in those situations is wrong and unlawful, but not such as would warrant the disruption of a family and perhaps putting children into care with all the consequences for their upbringing. Without condoning a deliberate fraud in relation to social security, one has a situation now Australia-wide where magistrates will have the full range of sentencing options available to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator West for this question. It indicates her very real interest in the people of New South Wales living outside the major cities and urban centres. She is well known for her extensive coverage of the western areas of New South Wales, in particular Broken Hill. She has rightly indicated her concern because it appears that the New South Wales Government is threatening to close the Broken Hill gaol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that, while that is a matter for State authorities, I would ask those State authorities to consider very carefully relevant findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It is quite clear that to have a gaol at Broken Hill certainly permits Aboriginal inmates to keep up the very important contact with their families and close relatives and kin. Isolation from such family and kin can have very serious consequences for the Aboriginals concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the report of the inquiry into the death of Malcolm Smith, Commissioner Wootten discussed the desirability of maintaining family and kin contacts and the problem of corrective institutions being located a long way from centres of Aboriginal population. I quote extensively from the report, Mr President, because I think is very important. Commissioner Wootten said:</PARA>
<PARA>A valuable exception to the remote location of gaols is Broken Hill Gaol. It is a relatively small gaol and one can imagine in days of economies of scale it may be under scrutiny. However, its existence is of great importance to the Aboriginals of the western areas of New South Wales, who supply many of its inmates. Although Broken Hill is 262 kilometres from Wentworth, 111 kilometres from Menindee and 195 kilometres from Wilcannia, it is at least within an area in which Aboriginals are used to moving, whereas eastern gaols might as well be in another planet for many Aboriginals. Imprisonment in Broken Hill Gaol gives some opportunity of maintaining family contacts: indeed with the large extended families in the area such contacts are to some extent maintained within the gaol.</PARA>
<PARA>The closure of the gaol and the movement of prisoners would seriously diminish the opportunities of relatives to visit and would make contact between the prisoner and his or her particular Aboriginal community almost impossible. Therefore, I make a plea and I certainly hope that State authorities will consider action to mitigate these consequences in view of the findings of the Commission.</PARA>

In fact, this document is a steal from one that it introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> I really worry about these kinds of lunatic proposals because they are the exact way that Australia ought not to go. If we want a lesson in how to go, we should have a look at the latest report on social security and service delivery in the United States by the Brookings Institution, which is, of course, I think as all honourable senators would concede, a very respected institution. The Institution makes it quite clear that the devolution of social security responsibility from central authority has led to very serious and very large holes in the safety net for Americans who are struggling. In fact, the Institution reports that some States have actually reduced benefits so that they can stop poor people from settling. That is not the way that Australia needs to go. We have a targeted, equitable, central system which delivers 140 million payments a year with 99.9 per cent of them on time.</PARA>

It still remains the Federal Government's goal that 1 January be the implementation date. I believe that Mr Hartnell of the Australian Securities Commission shares very passionately in the view that we should achieve that objective on that date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am well aware that Senator Kernot is not raising this question again from any motives of raising alarm or scaremongering. I know that Senator Kernot and a number of other honourable senators have received representations from constituents regarding this matter and that she is raising the question quite properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to put beyond doubt-in respect of the actions of the Qantas crew-what I have done since receiving Senator Kernot's first question. I advised Senator Kernot and the Senate at that time that I would be checking with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)-I had not had time to do it at that point but have since done so-as to the action it had taken. I also asked the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation to go back to the flight data recorder, the actual records taken from the aircraft, in order to put this matter beyond dispute. I am aware of the sources of some of these allegations.</PARA>
<PARA> I advise the Senate again, to put the matter beyond question, that the Bureau of Air Safety has done that. The allegation that has been made that the aircraft was out of control for two to three minutes is totally false. The flight data records taken from the aircraft show quite clearly that the entire incident of the altitude excursion that the aircraft suffered lasted for a total of 19 seconds from start to finish. But for the first eight seconds of that excursion the change in altitude was so slight and so gradual that the air crew on board that aircraft would not have noticed it. So the extreme excursion of altitude suffered by that aircraft lasted for a total of 11 seconds from start to finish-not two to three minutes-until the aircraft was again in level flight.</PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that the air crew, not unnaturally, when the incident first occurred assumed that it was a meteorological problem, that they had run into a serious clear air turbulence. The fact that the aircraft was back in level flight 11 seconds from the time the excursion started should put to rest completely the allegations that I know are continuing to be made, that the answer I gave in the Senate during the last week of sitting was not correct.</PARA>
<PARA> I also say that the CAA has confirmed that the action that Qantas took was appropriate in the circumstances. I will advise of one slight correction-the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation advised me that the aircraft had three auto pilots. In fact, the particular aircraft involved had two. That is not a particularly important issue. I just take the opportunity to correct it. The rest of the answer that I gave was absolutely accurate. As I said, the entire incident lasted 19 seconds from start to finish. The air crew behaved in precisely the way they had been trained to do. At no stage was the aircraft out of control.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the last part of the question as to whether the people injured have been personally advised of the details of that incident-that is a matter for Qantas. I do not know the answer to that question. I will inquire. If they have not been so advised by Qantas I will personally make sure that they are.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I informed the Senate on 14 September, the Australian Government has consistently called for a democratic government to be established in Burma or Myanmar. In addition to all the specific bilateral representations and policy statements made here and multilateral activity, as recently as yesterday the Australian delegation to the General Assembly, in a joint statement with New Zealand, expressed our concern over the failure of the Burmese authorities to make any serious move towards the transfer of power to a democratically elected government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has been considering possible economic sanctions against Burma. We would join any broadbased international move to impose economic sanctions but would wish to evaluate the likely effectiveness of such a move in conjunction with the United States of America and other like-minded countries before going down that track. It appears to be a general view in the international community, at the moment anyway, that sanctions would be unlikely to have much effect, especially as Burma's regional trading partners, who account for most of the country's trade, would be unlikely to support sanctions, at least at this stage. We wish to continue consultations on this issue with other like-minded countries and will do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The more general situation in Burma has continued to deteriorate with the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC, unfortunately increasingly dependent on intimidation and repression. The number of political arrests has increased markedly. As I think I mentioned last time, on 7 September the spokesman and acting leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the main opposition party, and four other party leaders were taken into detention. Two have since been sentenced to seven years gaol. It has now been reported that another, arrested on 25 October, has died in custody. I am very concerned about that report. I have asked our embassy in Rangoon for more information about it. In addition, during October security forces entered monasteries, as was widely reported, and arrested a large number of monks in response to the monks' religious boycott of the military. We strongly condemn these intimidatory tactics.</PARA>
<PARA> While it is the case that the National League for Democracy just a few days ago, on 9 November, made a majority decision to agree to SLORC's very gradual process for writing a Constitution and a transfer of power to a new government at an indefinite time in the future, the position of the NLD was, to say the least, complicated by the continuing detention of a number of its most active leaders and the clear possibility that refusal would have led to the complete exclusion of the NLD from the political process or even its forced dissolution. The Australian Government deeply regrets these latest developments. We will continue to do all that we can to maintain pressure through bilateral and multilateral representations to achieve an early transfer of power to a democratically elected government and for an improvement in the human rights situation in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I can say by way of footnote that the Senate will have noticed that I have used more or less throughout this answer the expression `Burma' rather than `Myanmar' to describe the country. This follows some consideration that I have been giving recently as to what should be our practice so far as the names of the country and its capital are concerned. The standard practice is, of course, to accept, for both formal and informal purposes, the English language version of the name that a country gives to itself. But occasionally some variations are justified by circumstances. The present military regime, SLORC, advised us in June 1989 of its desire to change the familiar names `Burma' and `Rangoon' to `Myanmar' and `Yangon' respectively, and we have been following that practice hitherto. However, it remains the case that these names have not commanded widespread acceptance in international usage, particularly in the United States and Europe, or by Burmese expatriates abroad, or by the opposition NLD, which was so overwhelmingly supported by the people in the election of May this year. For all these reasons, while we will still use `Myanmar' in formal communications with the present Government, for all other purposes we will henceforth revert to the more familiar and much more widely understood and accepted `Burma' and `Rangoon'.</PARA>

In view of the trial having concluded, consideration will be given by the Commissioner as to whether any matters were raised which have not already been investigated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly comprehensive reaction by the Commissioner of Police and I believe that this matter deserves to be buried, and not attempted to be resurrected in the clearly politically motivated way that it continues to be by the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Administrative Services. Given the Government's support for employer-based child-care, will all future new government buildings make provision for child-care in accordance with the Government's commitment to ratify the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 156, Workers With Family Responsibilities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3976" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point I would like to make in response to Senator Reynolds's question is that employers are increasingly recognising the importance of child-care to the achievement of a more flexible, productive work force at the enterprise level. To this effect, the Government is keen to support employer sponsored child-care to further our social justice objectives and labour market objectives. As a consequence, in 1988 our national child-care strategy included 1,000 places for a new industry initiative. There has, of course, been some interest in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1990, in our election statement, we included further commitments to facilitate employer sponsored child-care. Changes which will take effect from 1 January 1991 include the extension of the improved fee relief scheme to all employer provided long day care and amendments to fringe benefits tax legislation to exempt payments to secure places in commercial centres. These measures, of course, all add up to a major boost to the provision of employer-provided care. For the first time, public sector employers will be able to establish child-care for their employees and will also be able to benefit from increased fee relief levels.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken a number of actions. Firstly, on 30 October Mr Peter Staples, the Minister responsible in this area, released an information kit. Together with that, a video produced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training will also be made available. The video will be entitled Child-Care: the Management Challenge in the 1990s. As well as that, further information kits and a booklet on taxation issues relating to work-based child-care will be available later this year. We are also sponsoring in April 1991 a high profile national seminar on employer provided child-care. That will be held in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, relating specifically to Senator Reynolds's question and the issue of whether employer provided child-care will be made available in public sector buildings, with regard to new government buildings both I and my Department support the concept of child-care facilities in Australian government buildings. Of course, there is great potential in terms of social justice and market flexibility issues. We will promote to client departments the inclusion of child-care facilities in new Commonwealth offices. Where these facilities are requested by client departments, we will assist them in pursuing the achievement of them. In respect of existing government buildings we will also consider, on a case by case basis, requests from departments to locate child-care facilities in such buildings. Of course, considerations that are relevant here are the availability of space in the buildings, the legal requirements and the provision of facilities such as access to open space, suitability and so on.</PARA>

Senator Button, during his tactically diversionary answer to a question from Senator Vanstone, somehow implied that my questioning during Estimates committees had lessened the time available for debating legislation. This is a complete misrepresentation. The Minister implied that Estimates hearings are heard during the period when ordinary sitting days would normally take place which, of course, they are not. Certain days are set aside with the provision to sit on non-sitting days to complete the period of Estimates. I certainly took the opportunity, as did colleagues during that period, to scrutinise proposed Government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 November I was asked a question by Senator Calvert on the mechanical problems being experienced by the Aurora Australis. The Antarctic Division of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following information: Aurora Australis has two main engines to drive a single propeller. These engines can be operated singly or in tandem to meet requirements for speed in open water or icebreaking capacity. On Saturday, 27 October, while Aurora Australis was breaking heavy pack ice about 400 kilometres from Mawson, a flexible coupling drive between the port main engine and gearbox was damaged. The reasons for this will be investigated by a team of specialists when the vessel returns to Hobart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> P and O, however, advises that the damage was not associated with the propeller or the rudder and that fitting or non-fitting of skeg or ice knives is unrelated to the problem. During the design phase of the vessel, some advice was provided supporting the use of a skeg while other advice was not supportive of this. Considerable ice tank tests were conducted prior to finalising the vessel design and, based on the results, skeg and ice fins were judged to be unnecessary. In fact, expert advice was received that the fitting of a skeg and fins would be detrimental to the performance of the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA> The spares carried on board the vessel are in excess of those required by the classification society and voyage register of shipping. The spares holding for the vessel was reviewed by the classification society which found that it complied with its rules and regulations and were adequate for the vessel's Antarctic service. There has been no damage to the starboard engine coupling and the vessel is operating in single engine mode. In this mode its operating capacity is similar to that of other vessels which have been chartered by the Antarctic Division. It is therefore misleading to describe the Aurora Australis as limping around the Antarctic continent or to suggest there are safety concerns. I should like to point out that the Aurora Australis is presently running two days ahead of schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman is an office in which I have always maintained a close interest. The citizens of Australia are perhaps not quite as aware as they might be of what an important person the Ombudsman is to them and to their rights when it comes to dealing with the administration of this country. As a parliamentarian, I find the Ombudsman's Office extremely helpful and very important in scrutinising what goes on behind the doors of Commonwealth Government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly interested, as the shadow Minister for Defence Personnel, in the work of the Defence Force Ombudsman because often the Ombudsman is able to get to grips with documents to which I, as the shadow Minister, am not privy. Often, between the two of us we can achieve some influence on what is happening behind the scenes in the Department of Defence which is in the best interests of individuals in the Defence Force. The Ombudsman also covers a wider area than that, including veterans' affairs, but I am especially interested in defence. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have only a little time, I intend to concentrate on a few matters. One is the question of delays. The other programs in this report have a section on delays, that is, how long it takes to finalise a claim, an appeal, through the Ombudsman system. The freedom of information program notes delays, as do the programs for both the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In fact, the only program for which I have not been able to find a statement of what the delays have been is the Defence Force Ombudsman program. I am afraid that is rather worrying because historically the defence area has experienced the longest delays. That is not meant to be any reflection on the most professional job done by the Ombudsman, but rather on the lack of resources given to the Ombudsman to carry out his tasks adequately and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of delay was raised in May this year by the Ombudsman, Professor Pearce, who commented publicly while addressing the Australian Institute of Administrative Law, that his office was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . probably the worst-resourced Commonwealth review agency in the world-despite the fact that it dealt with many more people affected by Government than any other body. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Pearce also said at the time that the saddest feature of his two years in office was that he had been unable to carry tasks through in the way required by the Ombudsman's legislation. He said that the `parsimonious approach' to the resourcing of his office affected its capacity to perform its statutory functions. I think that is something which the media should be concerned about, as should the Parliament. If our Ombudsman is so under resourced that he cannot effectively do his job, it is the Parliament's right to know and the citizens' right to redress that are affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Pearce said that in his role in examining complaints involving the Australian Federal Police and the Defence Force, he found both organisations very cooperative but their processes very slow. He said that the serving members of the Defence Force had to go through an `extraordinarily elaborate' internal complaints procedure before a matter could even be referred to him, or before he could deal with it. Other matters he raised included the fact that his office was obliged to conduct its inquiries almost exclusively on paper. He said that it was paradoxical that the review body which could most readily assist the attainment of good government administration and could do so in the least threatening manner was the most neglected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman in the last year has been looking at administrative matters outside the redress system in the Department of Defence. He has been looking at issues concerning the return of service obligation for service personnel who have been given training for which they have to give a return of service; at the conditions of service for members without family, who certainly have been disadvantaged, I believe; and also at a number of other matters that are important to the forces regarding removals, drug abuse, civil convictions and those sort of things. </PARA>
<PARA> I was especially pleased when he gave the example of how finally after three years he had been able to achieve something on education allowance, because the Defence Force had been slow in realising that the determination was not being properly interpreted. That is something which I have long had concerns about and tried to take action on, and I welcome his success. I only wish that he was financed and resourced by the Parliament as an officer of this Parliament, and then perhaps he would better be free to scrutinise the actions of the administration of this country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> In scanning this annual report of the Australian Safeguards Office, I note that the introduction refers to the technical measures applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and I commend the Director of Safeguards, John Carlson, for having the honesty to point out that for the IAEA to have a preventive role it would require far more extensive powers and resources than the world community has yet been prepared to give any international organisation. I have always argued with regard to safeguards and non-proliferation that it is ludicrous to expect a body to take effective measures against transgressors when it was set up to promote nuclear power in the first place and, as the Director admits, could not possibly be effective even if it wanted to be. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 30 there is a reference to participation in the Australian delegation to the fourth Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference in Geneva. That fourth review conference of parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty finished on 15 September and Australia was one of the 84 parties represented out of the 142 countries eligible. The conference ended without any agreed conclusion when disputes over the importance of a test ban for the future of the NPT prevented the adoption of a final document. Of course, one should not suggest that just because there is not a final document the whole exercise was a waste of time, but it certainly does highlight one of the major problems with the NPT review process, that is, that the nuclear weapons states are highly reluctant to actually get on with the business of concluding a ban on the future testing of nuclear weapons. There are many experts who feel that the treaty will not last beyond 1995 because the nuclear powers refuse to put a stop to testing, although they expect other countries to pledge that they will not develop nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that, under the treaty, non-nuclear states renounce the right to acquire nuclear weapons and accept international inspection of their nuclear facilities. In exchange, the three nuclear weapon states which are signatories-and it is probably important to point out that neither France nor China, also nuclear weapon states, is a signatory to the NPT-vow to negotiate a nuclear test ban and nuclear disarmament and, along with other industrialised states, to cooperate with non-nuclear weapon parties in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government, of course, has worked hard to achieve a comprehensive test ban, but time and again all progress has been blocked by the opposition of our great powerful friend and ally, the United States. The very hard work and good efforts of our two Ambassadors for Disarmament so far have been stymied by the United States. I can only hope that the holding of the amendment conference of parties to the 1963 partial test ban conference to be held in New York next January will result in more progress towards the goal of a comprehensive test ban than was evident in Geneva in September. It is absolutely crucial that the world moves towards this ban on the testing of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 13 of the report I note a section on nuclear non-proliferation, repeating the nonsense about nuclear materials not being diverted to nuclear weapons. I must admit that I thought this myth had been demolished with the admission a couple of years ago that Australia's uranium might well end up in French nuclear weapons. In fact, the Government cannot categorically say that Australian uranium does not end up in French nuclear weapons or the nuclear weapons of other nations to which our nuclear materials may be transhipped. This is particularly the case as the monitoring of yellowcake transfers consists only of shuffling paper. In fact, the safeguards are not the worth the paper they are written upon. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I visited the embassies of France and China to discuss the test ban review conference scheduled to be held in New York in January. The representatives of both these countries assured me that they needed nuclear weapons for their defence, but seemed oblivious to the fact that, if they felt they need nuclear weapons, why should other countries not have similar feelings or `needs' to have nuclear weapons also? Already, in the past month, we have seen the United States Congress seek to punish Pakistan because it has not been honest about its nuclear weapons capability. We hear about Iraq's nuclear weapons potential a few years down the track if Saddam Hussein is not stopped now and deprived of his military capability, which includes nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. Israel, another non-signatory to the NPT, like France and China, took steps against Iraq's nuclear potential some years ago, but now Israel appears to have gone underground to hide its new facilities as well as to decentralise them. </PARA>
<PARA> One might well ask how countries like Iraq ever got hold of the technology in the first place, let alone the relevant materials. The answer is quite obvious because although many countries, such as Australia, pay lip service to safeguards, as this report does, in the end there are no effective safeguards, bar one, that is, to make a decision to have no part of the nuclear fuel cycle and to devote our efforts to developing renewable energy alternatives, energy efficiency and conservation. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The report which I have just presented deals with the refurbishment of the head office of the Reserve Bank of Australia in Martin Place, Sydney. The proposal which the Public Works Committee examined is for the removal of asbestos; the refurbishment of the facade; the upgrading of building services and the fire sprinkler system; and the installation of new ceilings, lighting and carpets. When referred to the Committee the cost estimate for the proposed work was $86m. This estimate was reduced to $77.2m in the Committee's inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> Before arriving at the recommendation that the work proceed, the Committee undertook a thorough analysis of matters relating to the location of the bank and the practicality of selling off the building in Martin Place and relocating the head office to a greenfields site. The Committee concluded that, in order to carry out its supervisory responsibilities in relation to the banking system and to provide banking services to its clients, it is desirable for the Reserve Bank to be located in the central business district (CBD) of Sydney, specifically in Martin Place. In terms of the greenfields option, the Committee concluded that the higher capital cost of relocating the head office to a greenfields site and the low rate of capitalisation do not compare favourably with the benefits in terms of bank operations and capitalisation associated with remaining in the CBD. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the Committee's inquiry, which is covered in the report, was prompted by the relatively high cost of the refurbishment. None of the components of the refurbishment-asbestos removal, facade recladding and internal refurbishment-come cheaply. There is also the need for the Reserve Bank to continue operating whilst the refurbishment is being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the Senate that the Committee went to some lengths to ensure that the internal refurbishment will not be lavish and will conform to current standards for modern offices. The Reserve Bank assured the Committee that all finishes will be consistent with those of a good quality commercial building and based on a design life of 15 to 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that it be advised by the Reserve Bank on a regular basis during the life of the project of progress and actual expenditure on the proposed work. It has also recommended that the Reserve Bank investigate the concept of joining with other banks located in the CBD to provide a child-care facility for their employees. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>LIVE-STOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill sets the levy rate for cattle, calves and bobby calves under the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964 at zero, to allow the introduction of the cattle transaction levy and the beef production levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that if the new arrangements are not working satisfactorily, the Minister, after consultation with the AMLIPC, may make a declaration, setting the rates of levy under the new arrangements at zero, and reinstating the live-stock slaughter levy on cattle, calves and bobby calves at the rates that were operative at 31 December 1990. This declaration power is valid only until 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision has been included as a safeguard until the new arrangements have been bedded down. The power will only be exercised after the fullest consultation with the AMLIPC. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>LIVE-STOCK EXPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill sets the levy rate for cattle under the Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977 at zero, to allow the introduction of the cattle export charge, the cattle transaction levy and the beef production levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, like the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, provides that the 31 December 1990 rates can be reinstated up to 30 June 1994. Again, this provision is included as a safeguard until the new arrangements have been bedded down. The power will only be exercised after the fullest consultation with the AMLIPC. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>BROADCASTING (FOREIGN OWNERSHIP) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> On 22 May 1990, the Minister for Transport and Communications announced the Government's decision to bring legislation before the Parliament to provide an effective means of limiting aggregate foreign ownership of Australian commercial radio and television broadcasters to an absolute maximum of 20%. This Bill will give effect to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting Act's current rule prohibiting control of a broadcasting service by a foreign individual will continue. This means that any individual foreign person or company, that is, a company more than 50% owned by foreigners, will never be allowed to have actual control or a level of direct or indirect interests exceeding 15% in an Australian licensed broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill prevents contrived schemes which, under provisions introduced in 1981, make possible foreign equity levels well in excess of the 20% aggregate limit through complex company structures. The Bill reintroduces tracing of indirect foreign interests in broadcasters, using a proportional tracing mechanism, to ensure that aggregate direct or indirect foreign ownership of Australia's broadcasters is strictly limited to 20%. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced on 22 May 1990, licensees with direct or indirect interests then in excess of the 20% aggregate limit will have three years from that date in which to comply. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will have the power to grant extensions of that period if they consider it to be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This discretion recognises the commercial realities facing licensees. Investment is essential to broadcasters, as it is to other businesses. Because we wish Australians to enjoy high quality broadcasting services which reflect the diversity of our community, and we certainly do, we have to ensure that reasonable investor confidence is maintained. The Bill provides for an orderly process of restructuring to remove excess foreign interests. The only way this can be assured is to give the Tribunal power to consider all relevant matters, while making it clear that the Government's concern is to ensure the limits are achieved quickly, without affecting the quality of services provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be able to have regard to all matters it considers relevant to its decision, but will be required to consider certain specific matters which the Government judges to be significant. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Tribunal must consider the effect on the ability of broadcasters to meet their licence obligations to provide adequate and comprehensive services within their service areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it must ensure that licensees comply with the letter and spirit of these amendments. The Tribunal is, therefore, required to consider the desirability of compliance with the condition as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government recognises its responsibility to provide clear guidance to investors, the industry and the Tribunal on issues involving foreign interests in our electronic media. The Bill will require the Tribunal to consider relevant statements of policy referred to it by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not prepared to see the long-term continuation of excess foreign ownership merely because investors have paid too much for media interests and now face losses. The Government makes this point now to give affected parties due notice. It is well known that some investors have, in the past, greatly over valued the potential earnings of broadcasting licensees and the protection from competition those licensees previously enjoyed. It is not this Government's function to protect those investors from the effects of bad commercial decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that the legislation is not intended to allow excess levels of foreign ownership to persist for undue periods merely in order to avoid investors having to sustain losses due to changing values of their assets. Investors will not be allowed to hang on, waiting for unrealistic prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The second feature of the Bill is a limit on the number of foreign directors of broadcast licensees to 20% of the total. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to limit the direct influence which foreign directors can bring to bear on the day to day management of licensees. This rule is not intended as a reflection on the integrity and professionalism of foreign directors. It is simply a recognition that directors are in a position to influence the operations of licensees. We have to recognise that broadcasting services are an important source of information on local and overseas events and issues for most Australians. The Government believes it is vital that decisions affecting them should be predominantly in the hands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, let me now deal with the question of the foreign ownership limits in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be clear from a reading of the Bill, and the Explanatory Memorandum that I will shortly be presenting, that the tracing of interests through a corporate chain is a complex matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreign ownership limits have been applied by way of licence condition since they were introduced in the 1950s. This means that the responsibility for compliance rests ultimately with the licensee. To this end, the Act requires all licensees to include powers in their articles of association to divest interests which would place them in breach. </PARA>
<PARA> Licensees assume responsibility for a variety of licence conditions when they accept a licence. They undertake to provide a level of service, to comply with certain program standards and with the requirements of the legislation. In certain circumstances, compliance with any of these conditions may be difficult or affected by the actions of third parties. It is entirely reasonable to require them to ensure that they comply with limitations on ownership comparable to those applied in other developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting Act already provides (section 92H for television, section 90M for radio) that the Chairman or other director approved by the Tribunal and the secretary or manager of the licensee must each year give the Tribunal statutory declarations stating:</PARA>
<PARA>whether, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the foreign ownership provisions of the Act have been complied with at all times during that period, and the particulars of any contravention of that condition; and</PARA>
<PARA>what steps he or she has taken to ascertain the matters referred to in the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end result, the Tribunal must be satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken by the licensee to comply with the condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Licensees should be assisted in this task by the fact that the provisions are so drafted that they only apply to the most direct foreign interest, and not to additional foreign interests traced through that first interest. The Bill avoids this `double counting' of interests and, by limiting the number of interests which could only be ascertained by searching foreign share registers, further limits the effort required of licensees in monitoring compliance with the condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised the commercial realities facing licensees, and the practical difficulties facing the Tribunal, in the method of tracing aggregate interests. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned above, a proportional tracing mechanism will be employed. This deems a person or company to have a proportion of interests held by another company, calculated on the basis of the proportion of interests that first person or company holds in the second company. This continues down a chain of companies to a licensee company. For example, if company A owns 10% of company B, which owns 50% of a licensee, company A is deemed to hold 10% of 50%, or 5% of the licensee. </PARA>
<PARA> If applied indiscriminately, however, this method could require licensees to search through every shareholding, however remote, in a chain to determine if it is held by a foreigner. This would prove difficult, expensive and futile where such interests are minuscule and remote. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Government, we are totally committed to the 20% aggregate limit, but not just as an aim in itself. We are committed to it as one of the practical guides to ensure that Australian broadcasters remain in the control of Australians. We are not concerned with it as an exercise in mathematics and, therefore, expect that the efforts of licensees and the Tribunal will be directed towards ensuring that the limit is met in practice. We do not expect licensees to pursue foreign interests to the ultimate degree when it is clear already that they comply with the condition. The Tribunal will not make unreasonable demands on licensees. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, the Government has decided that any minority foreign interests that may lie behind `minor' interests (2% or less, direct or indirect) held by Australian companies in licensees will normally be disregarded. This will allow minor traced interests to be disregarded except where the Tribunal suspects that, if those interests were counted, there is a real chance that the aggregate limit would be exceeded. In that case, the Tribunal will be able to direct that the minor interests or a class of interests should be counted, and their foreign ownership levels investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> This will enable the Tribunal to concentrate on areas of real risk, without the need for most licensees to go through the futile exercise of calculating precisely by how much they comply. If a licensee has 14% aggregate foreign interests and might, if an exhaustive search were conducted, be found to have 14.1%, the Government is not interested, and would not expect the Tribunal to be interested. The Government is proposing a Tribunal discretion, and does so in full confidence that the Tribunal will exercise its powers to examine minor interests responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further safeguard, the Bill provides that excess foreign interests do not, and will not, breach the licence condition for a period of 28 days after the licensee became aware of the failure or should have become aware of the failure. Again the Tribunal has the power to extend that period if it considers it to be in the public interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Licensees, therefore, have the opportunity to ensure that any excess interests are divested before they lead to a breach. This means the licensee should never be placed in breach of the conditions of its licence inadvertently or unreasonably. The requirement is to exercise proper diligence and to act when a contravention is identified. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like honourable senators, and broadcasters for that matter, to be clear about the importance the Government attaches to these limits. We do not propose any amendment to the requirement of the Broadcasting Act that the Tribunal may not renew any licence where there has been a breach of the condition. The period of grace provision has the effect, as I have mentioned, of preventing any excess foreign interest becoming a breach until 28 days, or that period as extended, after the licensee becomes aware or should become aware of the interest. This protects the licensee against failures to comply which go beyond its reasonable control. It offers no protection beyond the 28 day period to licensees deliberately or negligently breaching the requirement. Neither does it prevent the Tribunal exercising its discretion not to renew a licence, or to renew a licence for less than the maximum period, if the circumstances warrant, whether or not a technical breach of the condition exists. </PARA>
<PARA> The view has been expressed that these provisions are inconsistent with the thrust of the efficiency package amendments currently being considered in another place. I would remind honourable senators that the purpose of that package was to enable the Tribunal and licensees to concentrate on matters of real importance. The Government considers that effective controls on levels of foreign investment in Australia's commercial broadcasters are matters of real importance. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will place some additional responsibilities on the Tribunal in investigating possible breaches of licence conditions. However, the Government does not expect the Tribunal to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis; only, as I have said, to investigate situations which indicate reasonable grounds for belief that a breach has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Some $80,000 has been allocated to the Tribunal this financial year to cover additional costs which cannot be offset. Sums of $50,000 have also been earmarked for each of the next two financial years for the same purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1990-91, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting on 28-29 June 1990. The Bill will replace the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1989 and its provisions closely follow those of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill totals $13,508m, or about 15percent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1990-91. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> General purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory (before adjustments such as that associated with the transfer of the debits tax base) are estimated to decline by around 2 1/2percent in real terms in 1990-91. This is close to the reduction in 1989-90 although somewhat less marked than that in 1988-89. It will, of course, add to the effect of the significant reductions in payments to the States and global borrowing limits of recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> These reductions in payments and borrowings have been a key part of our strategy to ensure the continuation of a process of fiscal consolidation by encouraging restraint in expenditure at all levels of government but, at the same time, targeting that restraint so that the burden is shared equitably and sensibly. The decisions which this Bill implement strike a balance between the need for restraint and the requirement that the States have access to sufficient funding to provide essential public services and infrastructure. In this regard, the recently announced State budgets for 1990-91 confirm that this strategy is beginning to produce clear dividends in terms of fiscal adjustment at the State level. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $13,211m in 1990-91. The vast bulk of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> At the June 1990 Premiers Conference, it was agreed that the pool of financial assistance grants in 1990-91 would be determined on the basis of a reduction from the forward estimates at the time of:</PARA>
<PARA>* $400m in savings; and</PARA>
<PARA>* further $50m to fund the special revenue assistance for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This involves a reduction of $450m in financial assistance grants, offset by the $50m special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory and implies therefore net savings from the forward estimates of general revenue grants of $400m. Consistent with the arrangements in previous years, both financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance are to be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the CPI in the year to the March quarter 1991 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers' Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Conference is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial assistance grants are to be distributed on the basis of Grants Commission's updated per capita relativities based on the five-year review period included in the Commission's 1990 Report. As in recent years, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance grants and the base level of hospital funding grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also included in the Bill to make any necessary minor adjustments to financial assistance grants in 1990-91 and the base level of assistance in respect of the recoupment of States taxes paid for the first time in 1989-90 by Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1989-90 at a base level of $50m. Similar assistance was provided to the Northern Territory in 1989-90. The Government intends, as a matter of policy, to progressively move the Northern Territory to a financial basis comparable with the States. Nevertheless, had special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory been terminated in 1990-91, the disproportionately large fall in the Territory's general revenue grants which would have resulted and the fiscal adjustment this would have necessitated could not have been readily accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the payment of $296.8m in interest free capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same nominal amount as provided in 1989-90 after adjusting for the recoupment of 90 per cent of State motor taxes levied on Telecom and Australia Post from 1989. It was necessary to effect this recoupment from the capital grant as, unlike the other state taxes, now paid by Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises, the relative impact of collections by the States is not reflected in the Grants Commissions calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). However, provisions in Appropriation Bill No.2 allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few changes from the arrangements put into place last year. This Bill allows for a reduction in the payment of Financial Assistance Grants from that agreed at Premiers' Conference so as to facilitate the transfer to the States and Territories of the Debits Tax base announced by the Prime Minister on 19 July. Arrangements for the transfer, which is expected to take effect on 1December, are proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> A further change is the inclusion of a clause to complement amendments presently before Parliament to the Higher Education Funding Act to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. These provisions strengthen, and where necessary protect, the legitimate autonomy of higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated at the time of introducing the amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 the Government considers it unfortunate that there needs to be provisions of this kind at all. However, the Government is conscious that the primary source of funds for student organisations is the fees collected on their behalf by institutions. Some States have in the past interfered with the arrangements for the funding of services and amenities to students and there is some possibility this might occur again. We are not prepared to see that happen but we hope that these provisions will never need to be invoked. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State Governments and the Budget. I commend the Senate to the House-this is what the original says; should it be-I commend the Bill to the House and present the related Explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (FURTHER PAYMENT) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia to the Ninth Replenishment of the International Development Association. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to begin by giving honourable Senators a brief outline of the International Development Association and its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Development Association, or IDA as it is commonly known, is part of the World Bank group. It was established in 1960. It now has a membership of 138 countries. IDA provides loans to its poorest member countries for development activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, the terms on which IDA loans are made are very favourable:</PARA>
<PARA> Borrowing countries pay no interest on their loans. Repayment begins only after a period of 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Loans are repaid over a period of 35 or 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take a few moments to speak about the economic environment in which IDA borrowers must operate. Borrowing countries normally have a per capita GNP below $US580 per annum (in 1987 dollars). Obviously, therefore, IDA borrowers are among the poorest countries in the world. They face extraordinary difficulties in building their economies and alleviating poverty at home. There is no doubt that the domestic policies and legal frameworks of these countries will have a major impact on their development. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the task of tackling world poverty is one that all countries-rich and poor-need to share. Industrial countries like Australia can and should help. Industrial countries can help by working towards an open and competitive international trading system. They can accelerate the transfer of technology to developing countries and contribute to the development of that vital resource-their people. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important way in which industrial countries can contribute towards the task of overcoming world poverty is by ensuring that aid continues to flow to these countries. Developing countries' need for external resources is greater now than at any other time during the past decade. This is because despite the international debt crisis-indeed, to no small degree because of it-total net resource flows from developed nations to developing nations have fallen dramatically during the 1980s. According to recent data from the OECD, total net resource flows from developed to developing countries have fallen by 50 per cent in constant terms from a peak of $US200 billion in 1981 to $US100 billion recorded in 1987. There has been a modest recovery in flows since 1987, but the increase has been slight. </PARA>
<PARA> This collapse of net resource flows from rich countries to poor countries was, without question, one of the major changes on the world economic scene during the 1980s. The change is a historical reversal of the trend during the 1960s and the 1970s when resource flows to developing countries were rising. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we should never delude ourselves that aid is the panacea for the ills of developing countries. For example, total aid from all sources to major developing countries such as India and Indonesia is barely over 1 per cent of the GNP of these countries. And in China, total overseas aid receipts are a tiny 0.5 per cent of GNP. The clear implication is that in some of the world's largest developing countries, the main effort to mobilise resources for development must be carried out at home. Overseas aid can help assist growth in developing countries, but in most cases is not central to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, this does not mean that the provision of aid is unimportant for developing countries. For many of the smallest and poorest developing countries, the provision of Official Development Assistance will remain their main external resource for development for the foreseeable future. Although private flows of investment and credit to these countries have fallen since the early nineteen eighties, the flow of official aid has been maintained. And for the larger developing countries such as China, India and Indonesia, the technical assistance and policy dialogue which has been part of the development co-operation process has been invaluable. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this general background, we come to consider Australia's contribution to the Ninth Replenishment of IDA. Negotiations for IDA-9 concluded in December 1989. Under IDA-9, funding for development projects will be approved over a three year period to June 1993. The World Bank will call upon donors to make their contributions over a longer period, reflecting the time taken to implement projects. Donors have pledged an estimated $US14.7 billion in contributions. Australia has pledged $A382.5 million, or a 1.99 per cent share of the total. This pledge represents a decline in real terms on our $A335 million contribution to IDA-8. However, with the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the past three years, Australia's share in IDA-9 is marginally higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been a constructive participant in IDA since the Association's inception. For each replenishment, Australia joins other donors to negotiate an over-riding policy framework which reflects the changing needs of international development co-operation. IDA-9 was no exception. Australia's requirements with regard to several key issues-poverty alleviation, the regional allocation of funds, women in development and the environment-coincided with the requirements of several other members. The Executive Board of the World Bank has agreed to administer IDA-9 taking these requirements into account. Let me briefly outline some of them. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking of effective development co-operation, we have now come to regard the achievement of economic growth without corresponding poverty alleviation as unbalanced. In its latest Annual Report, the World Bank identifies its primary mission as supporting improvement in the quality of life for people in its developing member countries. It is true that on a variety of social indicators, some developing countries are now approaching the standards of the developed world. But this is far from universal. The World Bank has estimated that in 1985 over one billion people in developing countries were living on less than $US370 per capita a year. When you compare that figure to Australia's average per capita income of $US11,700 for the same year, you can see that the situation of roughly one-fifth of the world's population is very grim indeed. Under IDA-9, the World Bank has been asked to design projects which take a broader view of the development process. The objective is to encourage, where possible, the twin elements of economic growth and poverty alleviation. </PARA>
<PARA> From Australia's point of view, IDA-9 has the potential to bring considerable benefits to the Asia-Pacific region. In spite of remarkable achievements in poverty reduction in a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region, it remains the home for over half the world's poor. In IDA-8, up to 50 per cent of funds were earmarked for Sub-Saharan Africa. For IDA-9, however, it is recognised that there will need to be increased flexibility in allocating funds based on the criteria of need and performance. Sub-Saharan Africa remains a region where the need for external resources is great. But if there are new demands in the Asia-Pacific region-for example, say Cambodia and Vietnam were to resume borrowing following a successful settlement there-then IDA resources would be found from a reallocation from all regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another policy outcome of great importance to our region is recognition of the special position of many small island countries, such as those of the South Pacific. Due to their per capita incomes being above the normal IDA cut-off, they would not normally have access to IDA funds. But their limited creditworthiness means that they are unable to borrow from that other member of the World Bank group, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Under IDA-9, they continue to be eligible for funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's insistence that the role of women be recognised in the design of projects is also reflected in IDA-9's policy framework. Effective project design needs to take account of the importance of women having access to education and their potential as decision makers, entrepreneurs and members of the work force. In addition to incorporating sound women-in-development practices into project development, IDA has already shown it is prepared to fund projects which have a major focus on improving the position of women. In 1989/90, for example, IDA approved two education projects, one in Bangladesh and one in Pakistan. These projects are designed to increase the participation of girls in schooling. The Bangladesh project includes a scholarship program for female secondary school children. </PARA>
<PARA> Environmental considerations will also be integrated into all aspects of IDA's activities. During negotiations, members called for greater consultation on environmental concerns with non-government organisations and with affected groups in developing countries. Members urged that environmental action plans be prepared for all borrowing countries by June 1993 at the latest. In addition, the World Bank has increased the overall level of its environmental reporting. Hopefully, these measures will go a long way towards allaying the concerns of individuals and groups who have been critical of some bank activities in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude by outlining briefly the payment arrangements for IDA-9. In accordance with Australian practice, payment will be made in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes. The promissory notes will contribute to the IDA-9 lending authority for the period 1990/91 to 1992/93. It is expected that the promissory notes will be encashed over a period of eight to ten years beginning in 1990/91 to meet IDA's disbursements. Funds required for 1990/91 are already provided for within the global aid allocation so no additional allocation is required. Funds for the future years will be met from within the global aid vote. To date, the World Bank has only provided drawdown estimates through to 1993/94. These estimates, which I have set out in a table, are subject to change, as they are dependent upon exchange rates and the actual rate of disbursements by the Association. </PARA>
<PARA>ESTIMATES OF DRAWDOWNS FOR IDA-9 (amounts in $A million)</PARA>
<PARA>Year 90/91 91/92 92/93 93/94 Next 4 to 6 years</PARA>
<PARA> The World Bank group remains an important source of aid for developing countries. Its continued effectiveness requires countries such as Australia to be active in their support and constructive in their criticism. I would like to take the opportunity to remind honourable senators that the Treasurer now reports annually to the Parliament on Australia's participation in the World Bank group. His report also provides a general assessment of the effectiveness of each organisation affiliated with the World Bank, including IDA. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate our continuing support for IDA and for the development needs of the poor in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>(No. 3) 1990</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you will recall that the Treasurer recently announced in the Budget that the Government intended to provide relief from sales tax on computers for use by manufacturers and persons who process goods on behalf of manufacturers. This Bill will give effect to this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned about the impact of sales tax on business inputs and extended some exemptions to sub-contractors in the 1989-90 Budget. The purpose of this Bill is to provide further tax relief on business inputs incurred by manufacturers in the course of producing goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present aids to manufacture provisions of the sales tax law, manufacturers are able to purchase free of tax computers for use directly in the manufacturing process. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure recognises the broader range of activities that computers now perform in manufacturing than are presently covered by the aids to manufacture provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reflects that position and introduces separate exemptions for computers used by manufacturers to enhance the efficiency of the manufacturing process. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four new situations where exemption will apply to computers used by manufacturers and other persons who process goods on behalf of manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The first relates to the technical design and engineering of goods. Efficient manufacture starts with efficient design and computers used by manufacturers to design goods for manufacture will now be exempt.The second concerns production-related activities. Considerable efficiency gains can be made by the timely scheduling of production and computers serve an important role in this process. An example of such a system is the just-in-time ordering system which has been widely adopted by motor vehicle manufacturers. Where computers are used by manufacturers to schedule, monitor or control the production of goods they will now qualify for exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area relates to the finalising of print for the production of printed matter. Printing is an area where computer technology has had a considerable impact in improving efficiency and this Bill will ensure exemption for computers for use by printers and others in finalising text or graphics for printing. Exemption will also extend to computers for use by typesetters and sub-editors in the newspaper industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The final area embraces computers which may have a number of different uses in the manufacturing processes. Computers may be used partly as an aid to manufacture and partly in design or production scheduling or the finalising of print. To ensure that exemption applies to computers that have a variety of manufacturing uses, the Bill will allow manufacturers to combine the various exempt uses to reach the level of use required to obtain exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> These new exemptions will also extend to sub-contractors who are engaged by manufacturers to carry out the exempt activities on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure will commence to operate from 19 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill will assist Australian manufacturers to be more competitive in the international environment. The estimated cost of providing exemption for this computer equipment is $44m in 1990-91 and $70m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to examine further options to relieve the impact of sales tax on business inputs in the sales tax simplification review announced by the Treasurer in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>(No. 4) 1990</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill amends the taxation law in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes measures to give effect to concessional modifications to the thin capitalisation provisions of the income tax law that were foreshadowed by the Treasurer on 30 March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> A draft Bill and explanatory notes relating to these changes were released for public comment on 19 February 1990. This Bill reflects the outcome of this consultative process. </PARA>
<PARA> The transitional arrangements accorded to gold miners in respect of the treatment of trading stock, the application of the capital gains tax provisions and the method of calculating residual eligible gold mining expenditure will also be modified. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers engaged in quarrying operations will, by amendments contained in the Bill, be able to deduct any unrecouped excess exploration and prospecting expenditure incurred in relation to a mining right which has been disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the zone rebate provisions in several respects to give effect to measures announced in the 1990-91 Budget arising from a departmental review. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the imputation provisions that became necessary as a result of the new system for collection of company tax on income for the 1989-90 and subsequent years of income are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill proposes a number of other amendments of a minor nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Thin Capitalisation</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes five modifications to the existing thin capitalisation measures which operate to limit interest deductions for Australian companies or other entities on borrowings from related foreign sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The first modification will exempt from the thin capitalisation controls certain balances in financial institutions' clearing accounts, called nostro and vostro accounts, where the accounts are maintained for the sole purpose of settling international transactions. Deposits to these accounts and relevant overdrafts must be cleared within 10 days. Overdraft advances have been provided for in this context to allow for commercial flexibility such as where, due to error, the necessary deposit has not been made in time to settle an international transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Other modifications will effectively exclude from the measurement of foreign equity certain debentures eligible for the section 128F withholding tax exemption and short term trade credit arising from the export of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> Another proposed modification relates to a foreign-owned resident holding company which partly owns a resident bank. It will provide for the holding company's equity in the resident bank to be notionally treated as foreign equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The final proposed change will allow taxpayers to elect to use an alternative measure of excess foreign debt for a year of income. The alternative measure will generally alleviate for the taxpayer the impact of the thin capitalisation controls where excess foreign debt occurs for only a short period. It will provide an incentive for excess foreign debt to be reduced once it occurs during a year of income. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is not possible to put a precise revenue figure on these changes, the revenue effect is not considered to be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>Transitional arrangements for gold miners</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also addresses some concerns expressed by the Gold Mining industry and tax practitioners in relation to removal of income tax exemption for the industry from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, taxpayers will be able to obtain deductions for trading stock on hand at 1 January 1991 on a similar basis as provided for in the trading stock provisions, with a minor variation to ensure stock values are not artificially manipulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the application of the capital gains tax provisions is being modified so that the concessional treatment accorded to eligible gold mining and eligible gold transport expenditure will be available to certain gold mining assets generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers are also to be given an option in the way in which residual eligible gold mining expenditure is calculated which will enable taxpayers to take account of the number of years a mine has actually been in operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed will have an indeterminable effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Quarrying</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will effect a minor technical amendment to the operation of the quarrying provisions to ensure that any unrecouped excess exploration and prospecting expenditure incurred on a mining right that has been disposed of is able to be carried forward for deduction against income of subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is not expected to produce any additional cost to the revenue other than that previously estimated for the extension of the mining provisions to include quarrying which was estimated at $10 million in 1990-91 and 1991-92 and was expected to peak at $20 million later in the decade. </PARA>
<PARA>Imputation</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the imputation provisions of the income tax law to provide for franking debits to arise when a company's liability for franking deficit tax has been waived because the company's initial payment of tax is based on an estimate of its tax payable. A franking debit will also arise when any part of an initial or subsequent payment of tax is refunded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a measure that ensures that any company that has underfranked a dividend in anticipation of these amendments will be compensated for any loss of franking credits for underfranking that occurred. Without this safeguard companies could suffer a double penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will also defer the time at which the franking credit arises where a company makes an initial payment of tax during the year of income to which the payment relates. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the revenue effect of this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>Zone Rebates</PARA>
<PARA> On 1 December 1989, the Prime Minister announced that the Treasury, with the involvement of the Department of Social Security, would undertake a review of aspects of the taxation and social security arrangements in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the 1990-91 Budget, the Government has decided to amend the zone rebate arrangements in several respects as a result of the departmental review. The amendments will apply in relation to the 1990-91 and subsequent years of income. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing arrangements, the zone rebate available to residents of the special area in Zone B is $938 plus 20% of the relevant dependant rebate amount. This Bill proposes to increase the dependants' component from 20% to 50%. This brings the rebate for the special area in Zone B to the same level as that applying for the special area in Zone A. </PARA>
<PARA> Nhulunbuy, situated on the north eastern edge of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, is currently in Zone A. Due to its particular isolation, it has been decided to include Nhulunbuy in the special area in Zone A with the result that the fixed amount of the zone rebate available to residents of Nhulunbuy and its surrounding area is increased from $270 to $938. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also make amendments so that Lord Howe Island will be included in the special area in Zone A and King Island and the Furneaux Group of islands in Zone B. Accordingly residents of these areas will become eligible for a zone rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue from these amendments is expected to be $1 million in 1990-91 and $3 million in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Gift Provisions</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to reflect changes in the names of the Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian Sports Aid Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will ensure that gifts to the renamed organisations are deductible from the date on which they changed their names and will have no effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains identical provisions to the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1989 which was passed by the House of Representatives without opposition on 23 November 1989 and introduced into the Senate on 24 November 1989. The 1989 Bill lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament and the calling of the 1990 general election. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to implement changes to the operations of the Australian Heritage Commission as agreed by the Government following a comprehensive public review of the Commonwealth Government's role in the conservation of the national estate. As a result of the review, the Government in November 1988 reaffirmed its support for the basic principles of the Australian Heritage Commission Act and almost doubled the staff and financial resources of the Commission. It also decided on a series of amendments to the Act arising out of the review process. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the amendments proposed in the Bill is concerned with one or more of the following matters: clarification and improvement of the Commission's operational procedures; the inclusion of powers for the Commission to administer the National Estate grants program, the Commonwealth Government's principal program for funding conservation of the national estate throughout Australia; the removal of a sub-section unnecessarily discriminating against Aboriginal sites; the exemption of authorities of the self-governing Territories and Australian Airlines from the requirements of the Act, in accordance with Government policy; and administrative changes to clarify certain operations of the Act and correct some minor technical defects. </PARA>
<PARA> Before examining the provisions of the Bill in detail, let me first explain the history of, and the principles underlying, the Australian Heritage Commission Act and the reasons why the proposed amendments are considered essential. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Heritage Commission Act was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1975 following a major public review conducted during 1973 and 1974 by the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate under the Chairmanship of Mr Justice R.M. Hope. The principal recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry was that a Commission be established to administer national estate matters and that its enabling legislation contain provisions obliging all Commonwealth agencies to act so as to ensure maximum possible conservation of all items in the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently the original Act was amended in 1976 following a review by the new Government of then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. The amendment Act of 1976 re-affirmed the key elements of the original Act as recommended by the Hope Committee. The main amendments related to: the removal of specific powers from the Commission to advise the Government on expenditure and grants of financial assistance-the current Bill aims to restore this power; a reduction in the number of Commissioners from 19 to 7; a provision to limit the Commission's power to enter Aboriginal places in the Register of the National Estate-the Bill aims to repeal this provision; the removal of permanent head powers from the Chairman of the Commission; and a provision requiring the Commission to seek the approval of the Minister before appointing committees-the Bill aims to remove that limitation. Since 1976 there have been a number of other changes to the Act but these have concerned specific administrative issues such as public service reform. They have not affected the fundamental principles of the Act. The Commission comprises a Chairman and up to six Commissioners with various skills and interests related to the natural, Aboriginal or historic environment. The Chairman and Commissioners are appointed on a part-time basis by the Governor General. They are supported by a fulltime secretariat of about 50 located in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's main responsibilities can be summarised as: preparing and maintaining a register of national estate places; advising the Commonwealth Minister responsible for the environment on all matters relating to the national estate; advising other Commonwealth Ministers and Government authorities on Commonwealth Government proposals which might affect the national estate; and developing policies and programs for research, professional training and public information and education. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Act requires that before a Commonwealth Minister, department or authority takes any action which might significantly affect a registered place the Commission is informed of the proposal and given reasonable opportunity to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act also requires that no action be taken by a Commonwealth Minister, department or authority that adversely affects a place in the Register, unless there is `no feasible and prudent alternative', and if there is no such alternative then all necessary measures must be taken to minimise the effects.</PARA>
<PARA> All Commonwealth departments and authorities are also required under the Act to give the Commission whatever assistance is reasonably practicable for it to carry out its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> These responsibilities of the Commission, Commonwealth Ministers and agencies have remained unchanged since 1976. However, they were again subject to review in 1978 and 1979-this time by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, chaired by the Hon. John Hodges MP. In general, the Committee concluded that the Act and the operating procedures of the Commission were satisfactory and appropriate. All the recommendations of the Hodges Committee for amendments to the Australian Heritage Commission Act will be implemented by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1985, the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Hon. Barry Cohen, MP, announced yet another review of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. The purpose was to assess whether, after ten years, the mechanisms were still adequate and appropriate and to recommend changes where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister invited public submissions from all interested parties including State and Territory governments, local government, conservation groups and development groups. Over 150 submissions were received and a two-day seminar held to discuss the review attracted over 100 participants. The report of the review, which also took into account the Hodges Committee report and previous representations made to the Government on the operations of the Act, was distributed to all interested parties in August 1986. Comments were invited before final recommendations were made about amendments to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators can readily see that the amendments proposed in this Bill have not been lightly arrived at. Since its passage by the Parliament in 1975 the Australian Heritage Commission Act has been the subject of intense public scrutiny and almost constant review by Government or the Parliament. This process has identified a number of desirable changes to the Act to improve the Australian Heritage Commission's efficiency and effectiveness. However, it has also demonstrated beyond doubt the Commission's essential ongoing role in the Commonwealth Government's efforts to conserve and protect the national estate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's achievements have been considerable. It has established a substantial database of places of national estate significance. This includes over 9,000 places entered in the Register of the National Estate and the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate. Using its database, the Commission provides advice on the national estate to a wide range of Commonwealth Ministers, departments and authorities. In 1989-90 the Commission provided such advice under section 30 of its Act on 310 occasions. In addition, the Commission's expertise on national estate matters is acknowledged by State and local government and private firms and individuals. The Commission's advice is often sought even though there is no statutory requirement. This occurred 121 times in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Educational activities to foster understanding of the national estate have also been at the forefront of the Commission's priorities. The publication of The Heritage of Australia-the Illustrated Register of the National Estate in 1981 has been followed by individual State editions for Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. These have been significant milestones. Film co-productions such as The Land of the Lightning Brothers and the highly acclaimed Nature of Australia:  Portrait of an Island Continent have also added substantially to Australians' awareness of and concern for the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on matters related to the national estate, the Australian Heritage Commission has often faced a difficult task in carrying out its responsibilities. The Commission has been required to provide the Government with national estate advice on some highly controversial issues-the destruction of the Bellevue Hotel in Brisbane, the Franklin Dam and the Wet Tropics of Queensland to name but a few. Nevertheless, its activities are not limited to such issues. Much of the Commission's most effective work is carried out in collaboration with government and the private sector, out of the public limelight. This often leads to real achievement in the conservation of the national estate-without controversy, without confrontation and without public attention or fanfare. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been recognised by the Government in considering the review of its role in the conservation of the national estate. While some legitimate concerns have been raised about the Commission's operations, these can be readily addressed through the amendments proposed in this Bill. The fundamental need for the national estate to be conserved through the continued operation of the Commission is undeniable. Community and government support for this proposition has grown even stronger since its initial articulation in the Hope report of 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that there has not been some misunderstanding of the Commission's role. Indeed, I suspect that this misunderstanding, particularly regarding the effect of having a place listed in the Register of the National Estate, has been deliberately and mischievously fostered by some development interests opposed to Commonwealth Government actions to conserve the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is the nub of the matter. People and organisations opposed to the Government's overall environmental policies often cannot or will not distinguish the basic concept of the Register of the National Estate from decisions made by Government on issues involving the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact the only decisive power of the Australian Heritage Commission is to identify the national estate. Its other functions are advisory, educational or research oriented. The Commission has no power of intervention or proscription. It is the Government which is responsible for deciding about `feasible and prudent alternatives' to actions affecting the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Such decisions are properly the role of government after it has assessed all the costs and benefits including those related to the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also incorrect to claim that listing in the Register of the National Estate somehow locks up areas or forecloses options for economic and social development. There are many examples throughout Australia of listed areas being used for economically productive purposes which do not have an unacceptable impact on the heritage values of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Calls for greater Ministerial control of the Commission or the inclusion of other than national estate criteria-for example, economic significance-in the registration process are therefore particularly ill founded. Parliament advisedly gave the Australian Heritage Commission an independent statutory role in registering places of national estate significance and bringing them to the attention of Commonwealth Ministers and agencies. The judgments required in registration decisions are not and should not be political. They should be objective and backed by expert scientific assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that it is only through such a process that heritage values can be guaranteed of consideration alongside other values-land use, economic and so on-when government decisions are being taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the specifics of the Bill, clauses 1 and 2 deal with the short title and commencement date. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 relates to interpretation and raises a number of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of `authority of the Commonwealth' will be amended to remove the authorities or bodies established under the laws of the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island and Australian Airlines Ltd from the requirements of the Act. This is in accordance with the Government's policy of treating the self-governing Territories as States in most respects and with its decision to make Australian Airlines more commercially competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Terms used in the proposed new part of the Act dealing with the National Estate Grants Program are also defined. Definitions of the Interim List and of the term `owner' as used in describing those persons that the Commission must inform before publishing a notice of intention to register a place are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill will insert into the Act specific criteria against which places under consideration for entry in the Register will be measured. This will clarify the definition of the national estate already included in the Act and will reflect procedures which have been used by the Commission for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Such procedures reflect the best professional practice in the fields of nature and cultural conservation in Australia and overseas. As noted, they relate specifically to national estate significance. They do not encompass other considerations such as economics and resource use because these matters are not relevant to determining national estate value. </PARA>
<PARA> Such matters of course need to be taken into account by Government when considering projects that might affect a registered place. However, they have no role in the processes of deciding what constitutes the national estate itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will reinstate the original wording of paragraph 7(a) of the Act as originally passed and extend its provisions to allow the Commission to give advice on identification of the national estate as well as its conservation, improvement and presentation. The reinstatement of subparagraphs concerning advice on expenditure and financial grants will be consistent with the Hope Committee's original recommendation and with Government's decision to transfer the administration of the National Estate Grants Program to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will also insert specific functions in the Act for the Commission to administer the National Estate Grants Program. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 makes it clear that the Commission may enter into contracts. The Act has no specific provision for this at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 22 (5) of the Act provides for the removal of a place from the Register. Clause 7 of the Bill will provide for the removal of part of a place from the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 8 to 12 of the Bill reflect the need recognised in the review for the operational procedures of the Commission to be more `transparent' to public scrutiny. Hopefully these changes will help inform people of the Commission's role and avoid some of the misconceptions I noted earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments provide detailed procedures for the entry or removal of a place in the Register including the notifying of owners, the provision of location maps and statements of significance, the handling of objections and clarification of the operation of the Interim List. The proposed amendments also enable the Minister to direct the Commission to review particular entries in the Register to determine whether they should continue to be recorded as part of the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Although objections to proposed registrations may be submitted on any grounds, the Bill makes it clear that the Commission must give prime consideration to the national estate significance of places. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments which relate directly to the Commission's decision-making processes will enhance the timeliness of Commission decisions and will substantially increase the degree of independent and public input into the identification of the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist this process, the Bill provides for the appointment by the Minister of independent assessors to advise on the merit or otherwise of objections to listings. Independent assessors cannot be Commissioners or anyone connected in any way with the original proposal to enter a place in the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that objections must be dealt with by the Commission within one year unless otherwise approved by the Minister. If an objection is not dealt with in this time frame, then it is deemed to have succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 also provides for the repeal of subsection 23 (5) which currently restricts the Commission's ability to enter Aboriginal sites in the Register. This subsection was introduced as an amendment in 1976 to avoid possible conflicts between decisions by the Commission on the registration of land and recommendations by Land Commissioners on Aboriginal land rights. The subsection is an unnecessary discrimination against Aboriginal sites and, on the experience to date, its removal will not result in the conflicts forecast in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 of the Bill will legitimate an existing practice whereby the Commission is normally given an opportunity to comment on proposed actions by Commonwealth Ministers and agencies that might significantly affect a registered place. The proposed amendment will require the Commission to provide comments as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 deals with the National Estate grants program and will transfer its administration from the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act to the Australian Heritage Commission Act. No major changes are proposed to the nature or administration of the program except a provision for the Minister to make grants to approved bodies directly as well as at present through State and internal Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 39 of the Act includes a requirement that the Commission must obtain the approval of the Minister before entering into a contract involving the payment or receipt of an amount exceeding $50,000. Clause 15 of the Bill will increase the amount to $200,000, reflecting inflation and the growth of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 will permit the Commission to appoint committees without restriction, returning to the original 1975 wording of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 will correct technical deficiencies in public notices published prior to 20 November 1979. These deficiencies were minor in nature and the Bill will validate the notices which included them.This Bill re-affirms the basic principles underlying the Australian Heritage Commission Act while at the same time introducing a series of improvements to the operational procedures of the Commission. These improvements will clarify the Commission's role, make it more open and more accountable yet retain its independence as the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is fortunate in having a unique heritage which in large part has not been degraded or destroyed like some other countries. However, this means that we have an even greater responsibility to protect it for future generations. This Bill, together with previous Government initiatives to increase substantially both the staffing and financial resources of the Australian Heritage Commission, should be seen as a measure of the Commonwealth Government's determination to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CENTENNIAL ROADS DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> I take great pleasure in introducing to the Senate the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988, broadening the scope of the Federal Government's land transport assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Minister for Land Transport introduced to the Parliament the Australian Centennial Roads Development (ACRD) Bill. At that time he indicated that improvement in Australia's land transport sector was an integral part of the process of structural adjustment adopted by the Government to improve the efficiency and export competitiveness of our major industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACRD legislation represented a major development in the Federal Government's role as a provider of road funds. It concentrated the Federal role more firmly on roads of national economic significance. There is now a need to improve upon that program by expanding the commitment to national roads and by broadening the Government's program of assistance to reflect its integrated approach to land transport reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aiming for a land transport sector in which both road and rail undertake the tasks to which each is best suited. This requires a rail system which is more efficient and competitive-a system equipped and able to meet the needs of users. It requires reform of road charges and vehicle regulation to remove distortions in States' revenues and road costs and to improve the productivity of the road system and road transport operators. </PARA>
<PARA> These issues were reflected in the historic agreements reached by the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers at the recent special Premiers' Conference in Brisbane. A ``heads of agreement'' was signed, marking the commitment of all governments to the establishment of a National Rail Freight Corporation. This historic agreement means that a single commercial corporation will be established to undertake interstate rail freight services. The Corporation will encompass existing railways' interstate freight operations and will involve Commonwealth and State equity. It will commence on 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Heads of Government also agreed to the establishment of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme together with uniform technical and operating regulations and nationally consistent charges. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms will address the key problems in land transport. They will also require an unprecedented level of cooperation between Federal, State and Territory governments. The positive approach to reform evident at the special Premiers' Conference indicates that there is a willingness to maintain the necessary cooperation and impetus for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms have the capacity to provide significant economic gains. The Industries Assistance Commission in its last annual report conservatively estimated that transport reform would yield a 3 percent increase in Australian Gross Domestic Product. This is roughly equivalent to the annual growth from all sectors of the economy at present. </PARA>
<PARA> As an indication of its commitment to reform the Government has broadened the scope of its land transport funding to increase the focus of assistance on projects of national significance and to target funds through special programs to projects with high economic and social returns. To reflect this more integrated approach, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act will be renamed the Australian Land Transport Development Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to commitments made by the Federal Government prior to and during the last election to introduce three new land transport funding programs. They are the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways Program, the Road Safety Black Spots Program and a program for the funding of Urban Public Transport projects. </PARA>
<PARA> In his Land Transport Statement of 27 February 1990, the Prime Minister announced the Government's intention to establish the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways Program. As indicated by the Prime Minister, this Program will concentrate on roads of major economic significance which lie outside capital cities. It will complement the present national arterial roads category which funds major projects with high benefit-cost ratios and which are of vital importance to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In targeting funds to accelerate the upgrading of rural highways and roads in provincial cities, the Government recognises the importance of rural roads to the economy and the need for country Australians to have access to a good quality road network. </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways Program the Prime Minister identified the Pacific Highway as a candidate for funding. Other rural roads which are likely to receive funding under this Program are the Bunbury Highway in Western Australia, the Todd Highway in South Australia, the Victoria Highway in the Northern Territory, the Capricorn Highway in Queensland, the Calder Highway in Victoria and the Tasman Highway in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> Existing measures which ensure the efficiency of spending on national arterial roads projects will also be applied to the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways Program. Projects will be subject to tendering requirements and to be eligible for funding will require an advantageous benefit-cost ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide the Government with the ability to target funds where the need is greatest, funding will not necessarily be tied to fixed State shares. The Minister for Land Transport will determine eligible projects according to national priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, Provincial Cities and Rural Highways funds may also be used for priority improvements to mainline rail systems. $10 million of Provincial Cities and Rural Highways funds in 1990 will be made available to the States for works preparatory to the establishment of the National Rail Freight Corporation. A further $40 million will also be drawn from other categories of assistance for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's new Road Safety Black Spots Program was announced by the Prime Minister in December last year. The Program will provide $120 million over the next three years for cost efficient safety projects to reduce the number of road deaths and serious injuries on Australia's roads. </PARA>
<PARA> $110 million will be provided to eliminate a range of ``black spots'' by improving the condition or management of locations noted for a high incidence of crashes involving death or serious injury. A proportion of the funds determined by the Minister can be made available for other road safety measures such as electronic speed and alcohol limit control equipment, bicycle helmet rebates and pedestrian safety measures. </PARA>
<PARA> A further $10 million has been earmarked to increase support for road safety research and public education activities. The Government aims over the next three years to target further areas such as attitudes towards the use of alcohol and drugs when driving, occupant protection, vehicle design, fatigue and the provision of national data bases. </PARA>
<PARA> To encourage States and Territories to adopt a range of uniform safety countermeasures Black Spot funding will be provided only to those States and Territories that have agreed to adopt a Road Safety Package. </PARA>
<PARA> The Road Safety Package is a broad set of uniform road safety requirements. It will require changes to some States' legislation including a 0.05 blood alcohol limit, national licensing of heavy truck and bus drivers, speed limiters for heavy vehicles, uniform national speed limits, a graduated licence system for young drivers and greater enforcement of seat belt and blood alcohol requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects that all States and Territories except the Northern Territory, which is currently considering its position, will adopt the package. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the number of road deaths has been reduced over the past 20 years from around 3,800 to 2,800 a year, the loss of these lives and serious injuries to another 30,000 annually is still unacceptably high. The Minister for Land Transport informs me that our State and Territory colleagues also share this view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary for all governments to take action to ensure that the road toll, which tended to plateau in the late 1980s, should begin to move down again. These programs will assist in achieving this. Indeed, I have no doubt that the public debate on the Road Safety Package has contributed in no small way to the 14 percent reduction in road deaths so far this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also announced the establishment of the National Road Trauma Advisory Council. This body of eminent health and safety experts will provide advice to State and Territory governments on issues of national importance in all aspects of road trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will increase the scope and level of Federal assistance for urban public transport through the establishment of a separate Urban Public Transport Program. While legislation has, in the past, made provision for expenditure by the States on urban public transport projects funds were provided through the road program. States had the option of using a proportion of their arterial roads funds on urban public transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will allocate $55 million for its Urban Public Transport Program in 1990/91 and $200 million over the 3 years of the Program. </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the commitment of additional funds the Prime Minister indicated that they would be targeted at Australia's expanding outer metropolitan areas. These areas, which have poor transport services, will benefit from this Program which will provide funds for capital projects such as buses, suburban trains and bus interchanges. In recognition of the transport needs of communities in our smaller cities and towns provision has been made for the funding of projects in these areas also. These approaches reflect the Government's concern to improve transport services for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has increased the scope of eligible urban public transport projects. Funds will continue to be provided for urban public transport projects which reduce wear and tear and congestion on urban roads. Funds will now be provided also for projects and programs which demonstrate new approaches to demand management and environmentally innovative solutions to urban public transport problems. A number of our cities are approaching the limits of traffic capacity and public concern over the environmental consequences of vehicle emissions is increasing pressure on governments to provide alternative forms of transport to the private car. The Government's Urban Public Transport Program will encourage change and innovation in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements for funding the new programs outlined above will differ from those which apply to other Federal land transport assistance programs. Under the current arrangements all funds have been raised by earmarking a proportion of net receipts from excise levied on motor spirit and diesel. Funding for the new programs will be in addition to funds generated through the road user charge. These programs will be financed by payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund which will be paid into the trust fund which currently receives the receipts of fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for more funds to be directed at nationally significant projects by ending annual allocations to the States for State arterial roads. This category has provided assistance to the States for roads which are their responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> As governments acknowledged at the recent special Premiers' Conference, there is a need to rationalise road funding responsibilities between the three levels of government. The funding of State arterial roads is more properly the responsibility of State Governments. Funds will be redirected by the Federal Government to the States for nationally significant projects such as national arterial roads, mainline rail upgrading and urban public transport projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Ending annual allocations to State arterial roads does not mean that road funding has been cut. With the redirection of some State arterial funds to national arterial roads and the establishment of the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways Program, the Government is expanding both the size and the scope of its commitment to roads of national economic importance. It is expanding the set of national roads. </PARA>
<PARA> States which already rank their road funding priorities in order of economic warrant should experience little change. Where States experience genuine short term difficulties in adjusting to the new arrangements there is provision for the Minister to transfer funds from other categories for use on State arterial roads. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill indicates the Government's commitment to a reformed and revitalised land transport sector. The three new funding programs will be allocated $178.3 million in 1990/91, $168.3 million in 1991/92 and $158.4 million in 1992/93. This is a total of $505 million over the next three years and is in addition to the Government's existing land transport funding commitments. The Government's total allocation for land transport assistance will be $1.611 billion in 1990/91, a 13 percent increase in real terms over 1989/90 funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill defines the nature of future Federal interests in the provision of land transport assistance. The Government's traditional concentration on roads will be broadened to include the Black Spots road safety program and a new Urban Public Transport Program. Its road funding objectives, with the introduction of the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways Program and the cessation of funding for State arterial roads, will further emphasise roads of national economic and social significance. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus Bill for legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. Its introduction will facilitate the passage of amendments to existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains minor administrative amendments to the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989, the Export Control Act 1982, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987, the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1983, the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949, the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Act 1989 and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA> Due to drafting errors, it is necessary to amend the schedule to the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 before regulations can be put in place to collect levies from the pig and laying chicken industries for payment into the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> Under regulations applying from 1 April 1990, the dairy, livestock, meat, chicken and wool industries contribute to the Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA>Export Control Act 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Export Control Act 1982 are required to reflect operational changes in export documentation and ensure that powers afforded by existing provisions are preserved with introduction of the system. At this stage, the system will be used for the export of meat and may be extended to the export of other commodities. </PARA>
<PARA>Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA> This Act provides the framework for the Government's support of research and development in horticultural industries and establishes the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation to administer research and development funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment establishes independent selection committees to nominate persons for appointment to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The amendments alter existing selection committee arrangements to conform with those contained in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The composition of the current corporation selection committee consists of four members of the Research Council's selection committee under the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 and three other members nominated by industry bodies. With the passage last year of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the corporatisation of rural research councils the RIR Act is expected to be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will increase the number of selection committee members nominated by industry from three to a maximum of six. The industry will therefore have a greater influence on the selection process. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment provides for selection committees to be set up on an `ad hoc' basis. The Minister will appoint a part time presiding member for a three year term. The presiding member will then have the responsibility of establishing a selection committee when a vacancy arises on the corporation. The committee will be disbanded when the selection process has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking to the immediate future, a selection committee will need to be convened to nominate persons by August next year for appointment as members of the Corporation for the 1991-94 term. This amendment is presented with the intention that these new arrangements for selection committees will be in place to select persons to the corporation as expected vacancies arise next year. </PARA>
<PARA>Murray-Darling Basin Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will allow the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council to make decisions out-of-session; that is otherwise than at meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council consists of up to three ministers representing agriculture, water resources and the environment from the governments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is charged with direction and co-ordination of the Murray-Darling Basin initiative to combat land and water degradation in the Basin. It also encourages the improved management of environmental resources of the Basin. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to better discharge its duties, the Council wishes to be able to make decisions out-of-session. This should allow the Council to be more flexible in managing its programs and responsive to the needs of the community. The amending agreement is designed to allow the Council to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA> Parallel legislation is being introduced in the Parliaments of each of the participating States. </PARA>
<PARA>Plant Variety Rights Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 are necessary to validate participation in international testing arrangements and international obligations, to clarify the definition of breeding activities and to improve the level of participation by overseas breeders. </PARA>
<PARA>Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 is being amended to correct an inconsistency concerning the attachment of the wheat industry fund levy to the Grains Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem has arisen because the levy comprises both an industry fund and a research component. The proportions of the total levy attributable to each component is determined annually by the Grains Council of Australia, the industry body. As it now stands the Research and Development Act does not provide the necessary powers to allow the regulations to adequately specify the research component of the levy which is to be paid to the Corporation. Other consequential amendments to the Act have also been necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric</PARA>
<PARA>Power Act 1949</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment empowers the authority to invest surplus funds in specified classes of securities without the requirement to obtain prior ministerial approval for each transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Act 1989 is being amended to provide that the levy on wheat which is processed by or for a grower for his own commercial use or subsequent delivery will not be payable until after such use or delivery. The Act currently provides for levy to become payable as a consequence only of the wheat being processed and this was never the intention. </PARA>
<PARA>Wheat Marketing Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is to provide for the Grains Council of Australia to determine, within the limits of the legislation and regulations, the management and use of the Wheat Industry Fund via an annual business plan. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Government's intention that the industry should have control over the fund, which is made up from a levy on wheat sales, and this was reflected in the legislation. However the Grains Council's preferred method of control, via a business plan, was not available under the Act as it is now worded. The Australian Wheat Board, which manages the fund, has agreed to this approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments are a consequence of the establishment of the Grains Research and Development Corporation and the termination of the Wheat Research Trust Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the proposed amendments have any significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 to facilitate the operation of the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Quotas can only be varied in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation's (AMLC) corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated a moment ago, this Bill sets down requirements for full details of quota arrangements to be set out in the AMLC's corporate plan, for rights of appeal and for publication of details of quota allocation to be incorporated in the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also require the AMLC to use funds raised by the sale of quotas only in ways specified in the corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the honourable senators, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>DEBITS TAX TERMINATION BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill will give effect to the Prime Minister's announcement of 19 July 1990, in his speech ``Towards a Closer Partnership'' proposing a major review of Commonwealth/State relations, that the Commonwealth would respond positively to the request made by some of the States to transfer the debits tax to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will facilitate transfer of responsibility for debits tax from the Commonwealth to States and Territories. It does this by amending the Debits Tax Act to terminate imposition of the tax by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer of the tax base to the States has the potential to rationalise the taxation of financial services and provides the States with an additional revenue source. The transfer of the debits tax to the States will have no net impact on Commonwealth or State finances as the reduction in Commonwealth revenue will be offset by an adjustment to financial assistance grants to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> As an interim measure, while the States and Territories put the necessary legislative and administrative mechanisms in place, the Commissioner of Taxation will collect debits tax on behalf of the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> For this purpose the Bill will also amend the Taxation Administration Act to authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to make arrangements with taxation Commissioners of States and Territories under which the Federal Commissioner can collect on their behalf debits tax imposed by States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer of debits tax to the States and Territories will take effect on a date to be proclaimed. It is expected that this will occur on 1 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>(No. 5) 1990</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA> It will give effect to announcements in the 1989 Budget and in June this year to increase the level of tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions made by people who do not receive superannuation support from anyone else, and will introduce a new tax rebate for certain taxpayers with only small amounts of superannuation support from another person. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will exempt from tax the pay and allowances of Defence Force personnel on operational service in response to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the gift provisions of the income tax law, and in relation to the taxation of eligible termination payments and capital gains are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also provide for a new penalty where a taxpayer overestimates the amount of tax instalment deductions from salary or wages in a provisional tax variation application. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will exempt from fringe benefits tax payments made by employers to commercial child care centres to secure priority of access for children of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will modify the operation of a number of taxation laws in accordance with the policy of the Sex Discrimination Act, and make amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 in respect of tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased deductions for personal super- annuation contributions</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Government's 1989 Budget commitment to increase the level of tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions made by self-employed people and those employees who do not receive superannuation support from anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum deduction for superannuation contributions made by self-employed people and unsupported employees is presently $3,000. This Bill will significantly increase this limit so that it is the lesser of:</PARA>
<PARA> * $3,000, plus 75% of any contributions exceeding $3,000; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the amount of contributions required to provide the person with a benefit equal to the person's reasonable benefit limit. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure, taken together with the proposed new tax rebate for employees with low levels of superannuation support-which I will deal with in a moment-will further encourage people to self-provide for retirement. The new measures complement this Government's significant reforms in recent years that have been designed to make superannuation attractive as a savings vehicle, economically sustainable and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together they give real meaning to the Government's retirement incomes policy, of ensuring that all Australians have an adequate and secure income in retirement and that those in the work force are encouraged to save for their retirement in order to enjoy a higher standard of living and be less dependent on the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>New tax rebate for certain personal super- annuation contributions</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also introduce a new tax rebate that is to be available to certain people who are not entitled to tax deductions for their superannuation contributions because superannuation support is provided by someone else (usually the employer) other than solely through a 3% award superannuation agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The target group for this rebate is made up of people earning low to middle incomes who receive only a small amount of the type of superannuation support that disqualifies them for a deduction. The rebate will act as an important incentive for these people to make superannuation savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate will be available to people who, broadly, do not get more than $1,600 of superannuation support in a year from someone else. The base rebate is to be 25% of the person's own superannuation contributions in a year of income, up to a maximum of $3,000 contributions, and will be available to people whose assessable income does not exceed $25,000. The maximum contributions for which the rebate applies will be reduced by 50 cents for each dollar of assessable income over $25,000, so that the rebates cuts out altogether when a person's assessable income is $31,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that the new rebate is not abused, Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act- the general anti-avoidance provisions of the income tax law- is to be extended to cover schemes entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a rebate for superannuation contributions. This amendment is to apply to schemes entered into after 8 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue of the increased superannuation deductions and the new rebate is estimated to be $145 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemption of pay and allowances of members of Defence Force on operational service</PARA>
<PARA> As announced by the Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel on 14 August 1990, this Bill will exempt from income tax the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel while on operational service in the Middle East in response to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption will apply to Australian Defence Force personnel serving in the operational area, including personnel attached to the Armed Forces of the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will apply to pay and allowances derived on and after 2 August 1990, the date of the invasion, and is expected to have a revenue cost of $850,000 per month with a total cost of $8.75 million in the financial year 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Tax</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will modify the capital gains tax rules in two respects. </PARA>
<PARA> It will allow roll-over relief where an original asset is destroyed as the result of a natural disaster, and give effect to the 1990 Budget announcement to extend the principal residence exemption during a taxpayer's temporary absence. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently, to obtain roll-over relief following the involuntary disposal of a pre-20 September 1985 asset, the amount paid for a replacement asset must not exceed 120% of the market value of the original asset at the time it was destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Newcastle earthquake, escalating building costs resulted in some difficulties for taxpayers in replacing destroyed assets within the terms of this limitation. The Bill will remove the 120% limitation where assets are lost or destroyed as the result of a natural disaster, but alternatively require that the replacement asset be substantially the same as the original. </PARA>
<PARA> As also announced in the last Budget, taxpayers will now be permitted to retain the tax exempt status of their sole or principal residence for unlimited periods of absence, instead of the present four year maximum, provided the dwelling is not used to produce income. For periods of income-producing use during a taxpayer's absence, an exemption of up to six years will be available. If, after six years of such income-producing use, the taxpayer continues to be absent and derives income from the dwelling, the exemption will be lost, but only in respect of the period exceeding six years. It will also no longer be necessary for the taxpayer to reoccupy the dwelling prior to its disposal to be eligible for the exemption during an absence. These more generous arrangements will apply from the commencement of the capital gains tax, 19 September 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will result in a small but unquantifiable cost to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligible termination payments</PARA>
<PARA> A number of minor amendments in the existing law relating to the excessive component of an eligible termination payment will be effected by this Bill. An excessive component arises where superannuation benefits received by a taxpayer are in excess of the taxpayer's reasonable benefit limit. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the excessive component of an eligible termination payment which arises on commutation of the excessive amount of a pension or annuity can be rolled over, but is still subject to tax at the time of receipt. To correct this anomaly the Government has decided to prevent the rollover of such an eligible termination payment. This will prevent administrative and compliance costs which may arise due to the recalculation of the components of an eligible termination payment if the excessive component were able to be rolled over and not subject to tax at that time. Further, a taxpayer will not be able to reduce the amount of such an eligible termination payment by any unused undeducted purchase price of the pension or annuity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also remove the provisions in the law that reduce the excessive component of an eligible termination payment by any non-qualifying component. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments, which apply to payments made on or after 1July 1990, are expected to have a negligible effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional Tax Penalty</PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the 1990 Budget, this Bill provides for a new penalty where a taxpayer over estimates the amount of tax instalment deductions from salary or wages income in an application to vary provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This new penalty will apply only where the existing provisional tax penalties do not apply to the taxpayer and, in the preceding year, the tax owed on assessment was $3,000 or more and tax instalments were underdeducted by a similar amount. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure has negligible revenue effects. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Treasurer's announcement of 20 September 1990, gifts of the value of $2 or more made on or after that date to The Friends of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia Incorporated will be an allowable deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue of the amendment is expected to be $100,000 in a full financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to extend by six months- to 31December 1990- the period of deductibility for gifts to Australian Vietnam Forces Welcome Home `87 Pty Limited for the purpose of the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial project. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue cost of this proposal is estimated at $75,000 in 1991-92 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Fringe Benefits Tax</PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, employers who secure priority of access in child care centres for children of employees, by making payments under the Children's Services Program, are exempt from fringe benefits tax on the benefit provided. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will extend this exemption to payments made to a commercial child care centre that is an eligible child care centre for the purposes of the Child Care Act 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment must also be made under the Services for Families with Children program operated by the Department of Community Services and Health which has replaced the Children's Services Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is expected to be revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will make a technical amendment to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 concerning the quotation of tax file numbers to payers of superannuation and termination of employment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> That Act currently provides that a person may quote his or her tax file number to the payer of a benefit subject to the reasonable benefit limits for forwarding on to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. Quotations may only occur, however, once the payment has been made, and this is not consistent with the timing for quoting a tax file number on an Australian Taxation Office form. Therefore, this Bill proposes a technical amendment of the Act to bring ISC procedures into line with those of the Tax Office, and allow a person to quote his or her tax file number to a payer at the time the person becomes entitled to receive payment of the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> This will ease the administrative burden on payers of superannuation and termination of employment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted in determining the timing of quotation of tax file numbers and has no objections to these new arrangements. In this regard, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is required to comply with the guidelines for the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers and the Information Privacy Principles prescribed under the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will have no revenue impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments Relating to Sex Discrimination</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend certain laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation so that they will comply, as far as possible, with the policy of the Sex Discrimination Act. That Act declares discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy to be unlawful in a number of areas of community life. </PARA>
<PARA> Up until now the taxation laws have been exempted from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, however, committed to reducing the number of exemptions in that Act and the amendments made by this Bill will limit the scope of the exemptions for the taxation laws. This is a result of the ongoing review process which is part of the Government's National Agenda for Women. </PARA>
<PARA> To remove discrimination between a legally married spouse and a de facto spouse where the de facto spouse would otherwise be treated as single, the Bill will insert a new definition of ``spouse'' in the Income Tax Assessment Act to apply generally throughout that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> While many areas of the income tax law already apply as if the term``spouse'' includes a de facto spouse, the new definition has necessitated several consequential adjustments to that law and to those relating to the Medicare Levy and the taxation of fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also remedy certain other discriminatory features in the income tax law. For example, the marital status qualifications that apply to the special provisions which apply to the income of revocable trusts and certain unearned income of children will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the opportunity is being taken to reduce the age limit below which certain provisions apply from 21 years to 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the daughter-housekeeper rebate that is currently available to a widowed taxpayer whose daughter is wholly engaged in keeping house for the taxpayer will be replaced by a child-housekeeper rebate. This rebate will be available to all taxpayers who have a child wholly engaged in keeping house for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost to revenue of these proposed amendments is less than $500,000 in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I am pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and China, Australia and Sri Lanka and Australia and Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will insert the text of these agreements into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as schedules to that Act. The Bill also proposes certain minor technical amendments to the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act (No.2) 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements with China, Sri Lanka and Fiji were signed on 17 November 1988, 18 December 1989 and 15 October 1990 respectively. Details of each agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at the time of signature. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements included in this Bill will allocate taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the respective agreement countries. However, the existing Airlines Profits Agreement with China will continue to allocate taxing rights between the two countries in respect of international air transport operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements substantially accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and these three countries and that it is appropriate to pursue these aims at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the agreements is that they each provide for``tax sparing'' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by China, Sri Lanka and Fiji under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. This means that where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, each agreement calls for a tax credit to be allowed by Australia as if the foreign tax forgone had been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> By this means, the development incentives will retain their attraction for Australian investors and allow them to compete on favourable terms with investors from other countries, as they will not be negated by the imposition of Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I note here that the agreements were negotiated on the basis of the existing income tax laws of the respective countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, the Government has proposed changes to Australia's general foreign tax credit system which will affect the practical operation of the tax credit provisions of these agreements and of earlier concluded agreements, including their tax sparing mechanisms. These changes are included in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990, which is currently before the Senate</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes will apply from the beginning of the 1990-91 income year and provide for certain dividend payments and branch profits derived by Australian resident companies from comparable tax countries to be exempt from Australian tax. As these three countries are each broadly considered to be a comparable tax country, those proposed exemptions will provide at least as great relief from Australian tax and would operate in relation to such income from those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the agreements will enter into force when diplomatic notes are exchanged notifying the other country that all necessary constitutional processes have been completed to give the agreement the force of law. That notification can be given for each agreement, in the case of Australia, following the enactment of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements will help facilitate trading and investment relationships with the other countries but it is not possible to predict the eventual effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; At the close of play last night we were discussing why an item of $91m is in one place rather than in another, why it is a separate element and not simply part of the estimate and whether the Department of Defence or the Government is able to predict with any certainty the contingent costs for salaries in the financial year. I have now had the benefit of having looked at the Hansard for last evening and I cannot say that I am much wiser than when I asked the question. It may be that the officers or the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) have had a look at my question and could give me a better answer rather than my talking on at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure about a better answer. I have an answer expressed in different terms which may have more clarity for both Senator Newman and me. Last night I asked the officer to go away and to put this answer in different terms. The information I will now provide is at least a start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Newman sought clarification on the reasons behind the changed functional presentation of the provision for prospective salary increases to the personnel costs and retirement benefits outlay category from the `Defence and Other' category that was used in previous years. Senator Newman referred to the presentation of Budget Papers which are prepared by the Department of Finance under the functional classification used in the national accounts. The changed presentation of the provision for prospective salary increases was made by the Department of Finance. I am glad that I was not too definitive on that point last night because I suspected that could be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> This change was made to better reflect the appropriate functional placement of prospective salary outlay. Using this approach, the overall personnel share of projected Defence outlays for 1990-91 is 41.7 per cent. Had the same approach been adopted in 1989-90 when the prospective salary increase provision was $80m, the comparable Budget estimate figure would have been 41.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have some additional information. Using the above approach, the achieved figure for personnel for 1989-90 was 40.8 per cent of the total Defence outlays. By their nature, Budget figures are estimates which can vary from the actual achieved outlays for a range of reasons including variations in personnel numbers and differences between forecasts and actual salary and allowance increases. Prospective salary provisions are only appropriated to Defence as required throughout the year. They do not form part of the initial Defence appropriations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; That is more helpful. I wonder about the Minister's last comments that the salary appropriations were only made as the year progressed. If the Minister has any belief that the estimate is in any way accurate, I do not understand why it is not an appropriation now which is varied in the additional appropriations later in the year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I was under the impression that that was being handled in Defence differently from the way in which it is handled in other departments. I am not sure of my facts and I will check that before we meet again. Last night I also mentioned an item about the assessment of education allowance. I was interested this afternoon when the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman Annual Report 1989-90 was tabled. He specifically referred in that report to the problem of educational allowance and the fact that for three years his staff had been trying to convince the Defence Force that the relevant determination for education allowance was not being properly interpreted. I want to get a little more information on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Secretary to the Department has approved an act of grace payment in connection with the specific instance referred to in the Ombudsman's report, one presumes that the Australian Defence Force has now been convinced that the relevant determination was not being properly interpreted. What changes has this meant for the take-up rate of the education allowance?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Take-up is influenced by quite a few factors. First, families must have children in the age group. This tends to orient the usage towards longer serving members, who are not a high proportion of the Australian defence forces. The 1991 Australian Defence Force family census should help us improve our data on this characteristic. Secondly, families must choose to accept the separation from their children. This factor is given insufficient weight by critics of allowances. It has a significant influence, and attitudes towards it in Australia differ from those in, say, the United Kingdom, when we do a comparison. Using the allowance also leads to a larger financial outlay in conjunction with reimbursement. Administratively, this can be alleviated by lodging claims before paying the bill.

The very people who are being asked whether they would be prepared to serve have raised it with the Minister's Department over the Gulf deployment.

In fact, the Australian Medical Association has made representations to his Department over some period. It is a matter of concern. If the Minister expects to have an integrated Defence Force, if he expects reservists to take their place in that Force and if he is to have any ability to keep not only doctors but other professionals, he will need to resolve it, and resolve it pretty fast.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister for Defence will recall that he wrote to me recently about the age of our gas masks, stating that a replacement purchasing program had been put in place which was to occur this financial year and that it was likely that the masks would be supplied from the United Kingdom or Canada.

Senator Newman could get a copy from Dr Hewson or I could send another letter to her with regard to the timing. My memory of it is that it was something like 17.45 to 18.15 and then at about 22.30 back to Canberra-one assumes at 23.00.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been trying to get a clear picture on how many civilians are employed in the Department of Defence. I have been looking through a number of papers in relation to this, such as Budget Paper No. 1, the Defence annual report and the explanatory notes that have been provided for the purposes of Estimates committees. There are some quite extraordinary discrepancies, which I will point out to the Minister for Defence. He may not be able to answer this question now, but I will put it on the record at least. In relation to the quest that I have engaged in to arrive at the employment figures for 1989-90, Defence, according to one set of figures, was employing 23,922 civilians and, according to another set, 25,017. So there is a discrepancy of 1,095 people who may or may not be working for Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was also interested in the numbers for this year as to whether civilian employment is growing or decreasing. In Budget Paper No. 1 civilian numbers are said to be increasing by 83 for the current financial year, but when this matter was pursued in Estimates committee hearings a Defence official informed me:</PARA>
<PARA>This financial year--</PARA>
<PARA>that is 1991, of course-</PARA>
<PARA>we have also programmed a one per cent reduction in civilian staffing right across the Department, which produces a further net saving of something like 250 over the course of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Here again, we have a major contradiction: a claimed increase of 83 and a claimed reduction of 250. It is extremely difficult for us when we are unable to get clear and consistent figures on a matter of such importance or to get consistency between answers which are received in relation to this matter. I am bringing this to the attention of the Minister-it is something of a cri de coeur-so that he might follow up the difficulties that I am having and see whether they are justified. If not, can he give a firm figure as to the level of civilian employment in 1989-90, the level this year and whether it is in fact increasing or decreasing?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Sometimes there is confusion between actual staff numbers and staff years allocated to departments. The figure of 83, I am told, is a figure that was under-achieved the year before, so it is not really an increase-it was not achieved the year before. I will endeavour to get some precise figures and precise definitions, because a variety of definitions is used by different people on these matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The next matter I want to raise at this time in the consideration of the defence estimates is a question in relation to the capital procurement program. Of course, I am very concerned about the commitments in relation to this very large program and the extent to which it is driving the defence budget over the next decade or more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also registering a complaint about the fact that I have not been given the amount of information that I was seeking to get in relation to it. I asked a question which was taken on notice. That is fair enough. I did not expect the information to be ready to be tabled. For each of the projects listed under Major Capital Equipment Expenditure, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . please provide data which indicates landmark dates in the evolution of the project as the projects are anticipated to develop over the coming . . . years. Landmark dates would include such things as progress of projects through major committees, letting of contracts and subcontracts, completion dates for major components of projects, major stages for payment of monies and final completion dates. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer was a total brush-off:</PARA>
<PARA>Given that Appendix 7 of the Explanatory Notes contains some 44 of the more significant major projects, extensive research in compilation of data would be required to provide the information sought. I am not prepared to direct resources to respond to such a blanket request. </PARA>
<PARA>That appears to be the Minister's own decision in relation to this matter. It does not actually say that the Minister directed it but there is the term, `I am not prepared' and I presume it is a ministerial decision. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, there may well be 44 major capital equipment items in this list in appendix 7. That is no mean amount, of course, but that is one of the reasons why I am interested in the question. It is a very large program. The questions I asked on landmark dates, which seemed to me to cover only a very bare outline of such major programs, covered the letting of contracts, completion of major projects, stages for payment of moneys and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that running information of that kind in relation to any project-much less major capital projects-would be there on hand as a management tool of a most elementary kind. The fact that the answer to me is that extensive research would be required to provide this information is, in itself, a matter of great concern. If extensive research is required to provide what I have requested only as landmark material, then there seems to me to be a major lack in management control over such projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, I am wrong in that assumption, but the fact that it could not be provided to me, presumably because it does not exist, is the major concern. However, it seems to me that, if the material is there now in a readily extractable form using modern computers, it would not require much work for it to be put together and provided to me on the public record. Matters of commercial-in-confidence, and so on, are other problems which I will refer to following this discussion. But I raise the question of what information does the Department itself maintain in order to keep the most elementary tab on what is going on in each of these major capital equipment projects and why it would be such an enormous task to provide such basic information. </PARA>

What he may regard as information that should be readily accessible may be accessible in our own terms but not in the terms that he is stipulating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason why the question was not answered is that it is simply too big. We are talking about over 150 major projects, 44 of which are in Appendix 7 in the supplementary Estimates. It would have taken several man weeks to have any chance of compiling that particular answer. The document would have been several hundred pages thick. After all, some of these major projects have hundreds of subcontractors dealing with them. </PARA>
<PARA> There has to be a limit, sooner or later, to the amount of detail that can be provided in answers so that resource problems are not created for particular departments. In our judgment-and I endorse that particular judgment-this question was far too broad, going back over many years and involving a massive amount of research. I do say that, if Senator Durack has a particular concern about specific projects, we would be willing to dig out information on those projects and provide the information to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for going some way to meet the request. It seemed to me that the only difficulty that the Minister has raised is perhaps in relation to subcontracts. Admittedly, I asked for landmark dates, which would include such things as the progress through major committees and that would not be difficult, I would have thought; the letting of contracts and subcontracts, and subcontracts in major projects can be very many indeed and may be something which would require an excessive amount of detail to be extracted; the completion dates; the major stages of payment of moneys, and note that I asked only about major stages, of which there are not a great many; and, finally, completion dates for 44 projects and, presumably, that information would not add very greatly to that burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I specifically asked my question in relation to Appendix 7 of the explanatory notes, that is, the major capital equipment expenditure, which contains 44 projects, not in relation to the 100-odd that the Minister mentioned. The question only relates to them. As I said, I left it very much in my question to the discretion of the Department itself to determine what would be meant by landmark dates. I have not seen the documents, so of course I do not know exactly the way in which this information is retained in relation to each project, but setting aside the question of subcontracts, which I can see may have caused a problem, I cannot see why the rest of that information could not be supplied in relation to these 44 projects. </PARA>

<PARA> I asked some questions about the Anzac frigates-the Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated (AMECON) project-about which I received a good deal of information. I thank the Minister and the departmental officers concerned, but here again I ran into a problem with principal subcontracts. One can make an interesting comparison with this and the non-answer I received to the question I asked in general terms that we have just been discussing. In relation to the Anzac frigates project and Collins-class submarines, I asked for details of each contract: when it was let, et cetera. I will not read all of them. I received answers about the prime contract and answers under the heading `Principal subcontracts let by AMECON'. It was a reasonable exercise of discretion by the Department to select principal subcontracts and give some details. </PARA>
<PARA> I was given an answer in relation to price which was that, due to the fixed price nature of the prime contract, price details of subcontracts let by AMECON are commercial in confidence and not available to be released. I make the comparison that at least there was some reasonable attempt by the Department to answer the question I had asked in general terms. As I said, the question related to each of the contracts and I asked the Department to provide information in relation to subcontracts which were clearly selected by the Department. I make no complaint about that. </PARA>
<PARA> But in view of the fact that the price details are not to be supplied because of commercial in confidence, it raises in my mind a number of questions about the role of the Department in relation to a fixed price contract, which is the nature of the prime contract. I know that letting contracts of a fixed price nature is an important development and I support it. I am not in any way critical of that. But in view of the fact that these contracts are very large and cover a very long period, and will no doubt involve the engagement of a number of subcontractors, I would like to know to what extent the Department will have in place a control over the performance of contracts by subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably, the departmental officials who are responsible for the performance and oversight of the contract do not leave the performance of subcontractors to the attention of the prime contractor. What is the departmental policy in relation to ensuring the prime contractor is, in fact, keeping a very close eye on the extent to which his subcontractors are performing, because this must be closely related to the timely completion of the contract and the cost of the total project? In addition, I would like to know whether or not subcontractors are able to meet various deadlines for completion of their work during the various stages of the prime contractor's performance of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know whether there is any form of administrative oversight by the Department in relation to the subcontracts and whether or not it lays down any particular guidelines on subcontracting. For instance, to what extent is there any policy of having a percentage of work performed by Australian industry? For argument's sake, the major development on the North West Shelf gas project has cost many billions of dollars over many years. The percentage of Australian work in the development of that major project in both its stages has been able to be stated. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Department of Defence provide an estimate of what percentage of that contract price in each of the cases of the Anzac frigates and the submarines will be performed by Australia? Does the Government have a policy on this? Does it take an active interest in ensuring that its policy is carried out?</PARA>

We do specify some requirements but, essentially, it is up to Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated (AMECON) to provide the specified performance. It is its job to look after subcontractors and to deal with them. AMECON monitors for quality control systems. We look at those at all times because we are interested that the right outcome is met. If the right outcome, as specified, is not met, it is on AMECON's head to fix it. There is an expectation via the contract that has been signed that 70 to 80 per cent of the work would have Australian content.

It is done by regular meetings; it is not as though the Navy or the Defence Department just say, `You build a ship and we will take it'. There is more involvement than that. This comes up regularly and is monitored regularly. Honourable senators must also understand that over a particular part of the contract the percentage may not be in that range, but over time it will get to that range; it may even be higher than that and drop down. It is over the life, as I understand it, of the 14-year contract that we get that 70 to 80 per cent Australian content.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only one question area I would like to put to the Minister, and it relates to a question I left with the Estimates Committee, which was not answered. I thank the Minister and the Department for answers they provided to other questions, but this question was about the 1,600 approvals for defence exports. The Minister declined to answer it because some of the information, he said, was commercial-in-confidence and quite a lot of effort would be required to produce this list. I ask the Minister to reconsider that answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly cannot provide information which is commercial-in-confidence. I recall passing this question. Listing 1,600 approvals is not the normal thing to do in an Estimates committee. I suggest that Senator Vallentine put in a monetary amount so that we can narrow this down to the biggies-the top 200-and we might be able to provide those. However, it is an awful lot to ask in terms of resources to get the 1,600 approvals listed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have just been informed that my suggestion is not very helpful because we know only what was exported and not how much each item is worth. I think it is very unreasonable to ask for that amount. I am not saying the basic question is unreasonable, just the totality of the answer required. In a very tight budgetary situation I must look after resources. I have no hidden agenda because I have no regrets about any of those exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Somewhere in the Department there must be a list of all the exports that have been approved. I do not see why it should be such a big thing. Obviously, a number of people in the Department work on this issue and make these approvals. Surely the various work portfolios of the officers doing this job could just be collated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand what the Minister is saying-it does seem to be a big effort, and it is a big list of 1,600, yes-but I want to explain why I want this information. In 1988 a resolution at the Forty-third General Assembly of the United Nations-resolution 43/751-followed on from the United Nations Special Session on disarmament. One of the areas of great concern to people at that conference was the question of arms transfers. In that resolution there was a call for the world community to look at the whole question of arms transfers and in particular, part 2(c.) calls for an examination of the ways and means of providing for more openness and transparency with regard to worldwide arms transfers. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time Mr Hayden was still the Foreign Minister and he made a stirring speech to the Special Session and said in part that arms should not become the new cash crop. That line was very roundly supported by many people at the conference. Earlier he had said that Australia should not sell arms to countries at war, preparing for war or using weapons to repress their own citizens. I realise that would cut out a whole lot of Australia's potential buyers. It would certainly have cut out the sale of the Mirages to Pakistan, which I know has been of great concern to the Opposition as well as to me. It would also have cut out the proposed sale of the 76-millimetre shells to Sri Lanka and the proposed sale of aircraft spare parts to Iraq, both of which, I imagine, were cancelled due to high embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) also made a stirring speech recently at the United Nations. It is interesting that these speeches are made there and often we do not hear much about them in domestic consumption. This speech was made on 2 October 1990 and Senator Evans said at the United Nations that the upward spiral of arms procurement and the proliferation of increasingly more destructive weapons was of great concern, and also:</PARA>
<PARA>The acquisition of conventional weapons continues at an alarming rate in many parts of the globe. Often scarce resources are diverted from social and economic development to military expenditure. Australia supports measures by all States to reduce military budgets . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have also had signal warning from Barber Conable of the Board of Governors of the World Bank. He made a speech in September 1989 which also talked about military expenditure and the need to explore ways to bring military spending into better balance with development priorities. He said that governments should be realistic and remember the human consequences of the choices they make in terms of arms exports. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we have a real dilemma since the new guidelines were made for defence exports following the Cooksey report. That is when the Department of Defence became the final arbiter in these matters. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade seems to have been squeezed out of the decision making; obviously there needs to be more time for assessment. I think I heard the Minister say recently that the guidelines need to be re-examined in the light of some of the more embarrassing proposed sales which had to be cancelled. It is mainly because of the transparency that the United Nations is calling for; Australia may not be one of the worst offenders in terms of arms transfers, but it is in there attempting to increase its level of defence exports. If we are serious about the comments that our Foreign Ministers make at the United Nations and their support for this transparency in arms transfers, I think it is not at all helpful-in fact it is downright counterproductive-for the Minister to say it is too much trouble and he is not going to provide senators with the list. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other problem with this list is that we can only tell Senator Vallentine what our approvals are for exports, not what has been exported. These are two distinct things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the more general issue Senator Vallentine raised, I just do not happen to agree with her. I certainly think there is a fair bit of transparency in the military equipment we sell in this country. We import more than we sell; therefore, I assume by that that we are making others more immoral than ourselves. The reality is that over the years we have had to import too much defence equipment, and I see nothing, in a moral or other sense, that prohibits exports. We have fairly tight guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine referred to three cases. In the case of shells to Sri Lanka, Senator Vallentine is not a gracious person. This matter went to the committee and was defeated. It was never on. It was only because some salesman had approached the Australian High Commission in Colombo that it got into a cable and got out. It was always going to be knocked over. Senator Vallentine should at least say that when she raises this issue. It was not embarrassing; the only embarrassment is the leaking of that cable that brought it to public light at that time. It was always going to be knocked off. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to spare parts, we had a very restrictive policy in 1988 on what could be exported to countries like Iraq. We would not have been supporting offensive matters; these were spare parts for trainers, and they were banned, not on military grounds, but because all trade was suspended with Iraq, including wheat and other commodities. There has been a lot of publicity on the sale of Mirage jets and I still say we were entitled to do that. It had a long lead time. The thing we acknowledged straight after the contracts were signed was the poor timing, but a lot of that is due to the fact that in this country, when things are under way and writs are issued, governments do not intervene and make major policy decisions. Unfortunately, it went to the contract stage and was irretrievable by the time I became Minister for Defence. It was a question of timing and the timing was not good. However, we have not had war in the last six months between those two countries and things are far more stable today-I am not necessarily 100 per cent optimistic-than they were at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have tighter guidelines on the export of defence equipment than most other countries. We are not engaged in an arms race; we are spending only 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product on defence, most of which is on an extremely defensive rather than offensive posture. We will never become a major exporter of arms, we know that. In the current climate, if anything, we may become a reduced seller simply because at the end of the cold war we will be undercut in price. There are certain niche markets that we will export to. We will continue to do so in the same way as we will import certain equipment over a period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just come back to the matter that I was raising before, although I have asked most of the questions that I wanted to raise. I just give a small example of the problems that one gets into in a contract with subcontractors. It concerns a contract about which I received complaint from a subcontractor in relation to some work done at Maritime Headquarters. I do not know remember exactly what the contractor was doing but he went bankrupt, leaving a subcontractor who was laying floor tiles in the Maritime Headquarters lamenting for payment. He was demanding that the Navy should not continue walking over the tiles that he had laid without paying for them. That is the simple sort of normal attitude that subcontractors take when they do not get paid for work they have done. They often look to the building owner. I do not know what the legal position is as a matter of course in these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter was presumably brought to the attention of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) because it was brought to my attention by the person concerned. It is simply an example of the problems that one can face with large contracts and with the non-performance by various subcontractors down the line. That is really a reason why it seems to me that with a very large contract, such as the ones we have been talking about, it is necessary for the Government-or whoever is commissioning the work-to ensure, by having an adequate watching role on performance by a prime contractor, that all is going reasonably well so far as can be ascertained. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the Minister's answer that the Department really does not have in place any ongoing management role in this situation, but that it has meetings from time to time and gets reports from time to time. Am I right in my assumption, or is there some clear policy being pursued in relation to the question of seeing that the prime contractor is in fact engaging the people who are doing the work, as he would be expected to do?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can get into these problems with subcontracts. This is the life of subcontractors; they get into these problems all the time, and I have great sympathy for them. But if there is one thing that is coming through to me as Minister, it is the desire to stop the Department of Defence overspecifying what contractors and subcontractors should be doing; that is, interfering all the time, delaying, and slowing things down. I think Senator Durack is going in the wrong direction with that particular thing. I hope that tomorrow night, when we have a lot of the Defence contractors there, we both get a bit of feedback. But the thing that they raise with me most often is overspecification, overinterference and oversupervision, and these are putting pressure on them rather than the other way around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not had that particular case in Maritime Headquarters raised for my attention directly in the sense that people have been to see me or that I know they have applied to come to see me on it, but I am not sure that it is our role to supervise every subcontract that some main contractor has put out. That is why we are putting them out for them to do, not for ourselves to do. Sure, every now and then one of those subcontracts goes wrong or the main contractor goes broke and the subcontractor is left holding the bag. But that is in the nature of being a subcontractor, unfortunately. If we can help or assist or smooth their way, I think we should. If we can help or assist, we do not just leave someone stranded because they have got into some problems. But I do not necessarily think we should set up some massive bureaucracy to supervise every subcontract in Defence. Again, the Opposition would be back here saying, `Why have you spent all the money on consultants, computers and extra staff to do all this?', and we would be criticised on those particular lines. The whole trend in Defence in the next few years has to be for more flexibility, for less supervision and for allowing people to get on with the job, and not overspecifying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is not for me to say what is the final comment but I will make my final comment on this. The last thing I want to see is a great deal of close attention and a total bureaucratic approach to management. That is one very important reason for going down the fixed price road, which I have already said that I thoroughly support. I would not for a moment suggest that the Department should go on supervising the detailed work that is being done, as it would be doing in the past under an old cost plus system or whatever it was doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I was really wanting to obtain from the Minister-and I do not know that I really had a great assurance of it-is what form of supervision the Department is putting in place in a major long contract such as the Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd or the submarine contracts to keep an eye on how far the prime contractor is in fact meeting the obligations that he has. I am not suggesting at all the sort of thing that the Minister comes back to me on. I just want to make it perfectly clear that I am simply wanting to know what sort of arrangements, guidelines, or policy-whatever we call it-the Department has in place to manage contracts of such major importance over such a long period of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For instance, at Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON) I think we have 12 people onsite. Basically one is doing three things: first of all, laying down initially the specification for what is wanted; secondly, ensuring that AMECON's quality control measures are always up to date; and, thirdly, when the final product comes off, ensuring that it is what was asked for. That is the degree of interference that I think is necessary. Both on the AMECON site and the submarine site Defence obviously takes a day to day interest in what is happening, and if something goes wrong it is going to be reported back to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the work is broken up into several thousand work packages. AMECON has to demonstrate that the results are being achieved before we pay it. But it does not have to explain its own internal arrangements between AMECON and its subcontractors. If Senator Durack is worried particularly about AMECON and the way it has gone on, I invite him-I am not sure that he has-to pop down to Williamstown Dockyard. </PARA>

They are not fully down the track with this particular one because they are still building the two other frigates. The Newcastle and the Melbourne are both being built there at the moment. The same applies to the submarine side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, the general approach is that we lay down the general specifications of what we want, and it is at a fixed price. We make sure that quality assurance systems are in place and we measure the product at the end. There are people on site and, naturally, if they pick up something that is going wrong on site, they will draw it to the attention of the management. We will pay only when we are satisfied that the product is of sufficient quality to entitle us to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole those two projects are going relatively well. There will always be problems over a particular subcontract or a particular work package.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have done so. I must say that I had not regarded it as a high priority, but knowing that the Estimates Committee would come up was a bit of an incentive for me to complete the guidelines. I completed them yesterday. I table the new guidelines now. I have them with me. I also table an explanatory note which will lead Senator Durack in 14 points to see where particular guidelines have been changed. They are not dramatic changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give Senator Durack the highlights off the top of my head. I am trying to insist that where journalists go on a VIP flight they pay economy fare in all but exceptional circumstances. In fact, I cannot think of circumstances where they will not have to, and I shall be the one who determines it. In essence, that will apply to journalists or any other passenger who for some emergency reason is put on a flight. For example, if a meeting has gone late here and there is a VIP flight going back to, say, Melbourne and the people from the meeting are put on the flight, they should also be charged the economy fare. That is one of the changes made. </PARA>
<PARA> Because there was some debate over the role of parliamentary secretaries, I have specifically written them into the guidelines. They will be entitled to use those planes travelling at the direction of their portfolio Minister. Thirdly, I have added the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to the list of those with that entitlement. I do not know why that was never there. It seems to me to have been an oversight. </PARA>

<PARA> I have added in a new point that allows backbenchers to use VIP flights in exceptional circumstances. At the moment, if one wants to move 10 or 12 backbenchers, unless an entitled person is there they cannot use the plane. There may be cases where we are stuck here with 12 backbenchers wanting to go to Western Australia, for example. If an entitled person is not there one cannot authorise it. I will now be able to authorise it. It is not something that we will be doing every day; it will be done in emergencies. </PARA>

In the Estimates Committee hearings Senator Ray may remember that I asked about eligibility for the use of VIP flights as it related to the timing of alternative commercial flights. The Minister replied to me that if there was a commercial flight within a few minutes-that was the phrase he used-then the person concerned would not get a VIP flight, and I think that it was extended to half an hour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position will be that after 30 November the Privacy Commissioner will, no doubt, examine all the submissions before him and over the succeeding month or two come to some conclusions and perhaps introduce some changes to the indicative guidelines that he had published. To overcome the difficulty, given that we cannot wait until that has been done, I indicated to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs last Friday that the Government would seek to put some guidelines into the Privacy Amendment Bill with which the Privacy Commissioner agrees and have some sort of a sunset clause, which would mean that once he has given us a final report we would come back and tidy it up. I have not got a date from him for his final report, but one would imagine that that would be, say, around February.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>It is of paramount importance that DSS forms and letters be clear, precise, non-intimidatory and in plain language. The Department's efforts to achieve this goal have to date been manifestly unsuccessful-</PARA>

<PARA>The Committee strongly recommends that the Government's response to this report specifically address the issue of forms and standard letters and set out what steps have been taken to achieve the improvements required. </PARA>
<PARA>What occurred was an attempt to accept the spirit of that Senate report and to go outside the Department, given that the claim had been that the Department had been manifestly unsuccessful, to see whether someone else could do better. When that happens it is the responsibility of the officers in that section of the Department to find an expert who can advise. That was done on this occasion. My understanding of the situation was that, if this letter had proved to be successful, between 16 and 20 letters based upon it, as variants of that original letter, would go to clients. </PARA>

The other point that Senator Alston made concerned the amnesty and when it will be finished. There are quite a number of calculations that need to be made, because it also depends upon those people who did not use the formal processes of the amnesty but who, nonetheless, came forward.

According to my calculations, if approximately 2 per cent of people were in receipt of incorrect payments, the percentage who will be identified by the social security amnesty, which is quite a significant proportion-almost a quarter-will then not be identified by the data-matching process because they will have already been identified.

I think a bigger concern along the same lines as the question would probably be how to guarantee that data-matching continues to produce the results that we have estimated for three years after we have found much bigger numbers than 22,000 people in the first year. The experience of social security over time is that fraud continues as people come onto benefits and also as people who have been in receipt of them and have not been indulging in fraud tend to get an urge to commit fraud, and so it continues. We believe that the amounts that we have estimated over those first three or four years-as I made the point on Friday, they were the subject of considerable negotiation and discussion with the Department of Finance- are conservative estimates and we are very confident that those amounts will turn out to be real.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Given the fact that we were told at the inquiry last week that if the provision to extend the tax file numbers was not permitted by this Parliament the Minister would not proceed with the data-matching procedure, and given the concern that the Minister has about introducing this and the need on his part to have it introduced, would it not seem appropriate to have much better data provided to the Senate or to the Parliament as to the costings? The Minister might know all of that but the data that I received last week does not indicate how those figures are arrived at. I think it would be more appropriate if the Department could produce a much more detailed set of figures as to how it goes about achieving the cost benefit analysis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we agreed last Friday, this is an issue about balancing privacy against the cost of fraud. We all want to prevent fraud to enable those who are in genuine need, and those who really require social security, to get their fair share of the cake. If all of us have that goal, I want to know what the financial costs are balanced against the social costs. I just do not think that the data we have to date is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for departmental people sitting there with all the information at their fingertips, but those of us on this side of the House, and the Australian Democrats, are trying to make an assessment of whether, in fact, there is a cost benefit involved. With all due respect to the Minister, despite the fact that he has asked me to trust him-he asked me last week to trust him; and I said I was not sure I could trust him and he said he trusted me-I would like more detailed figures that would help me to be convinced that there is a cost benefit, because it is a great social cost that we are imposing on people to provide their tax file number and extending it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the tax file number was first being used we were promised by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The tax file numbering system will be administered exclusively by the Tax Office for tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on a number of times to say that the number would not be applied or extended. Now we have been told it has been extended, and the Minister told us again last Friday that there had been changes in technology. We have been given all the reasons. I just do not think there is sufficient reason to convince me totally that it is a great idea. If the Department could come up with better costings, I think that would help to allay some of the fears on this side of the chamber. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. Senator Alston was talking about Age Pension News. I think we have mentioned that in December 1989 the headline read, `Free medication to continue', and in July 1989 it stated, `Govt guarantee: no charges for pensioners'. When the pharmaceutical charge was introduced I was dying to get my copy of Pension News to see how the Government could tell us the good news-how pensioners were going to hear this good news. I thought, `How will they be able to write the headlines in a favourable way?'. What do I find? The headline states, `$2.50 gain to pay for medicine cost'. I have got to give it to those in the Department: they ought to be out there writing for the Age or the Australian because they can make good news out of bad news. It is amazing. It was very interesting to see that the pensioners were told they were going to get a $2.50 gain for their pain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I looked further at Age Pension News-and I think I have mentioned this. In the July 1990 edition, we were told about the virtues of Minister Staples and Mr Sciacca-we were told about their caring attitude. It made them look like saints, or angels with wings and a halo. The only problem with a halo is that it has to be polished every now and then and I think Mr Sciacca had forgotten to polish his, because what do we see in the Australian headline in October 1990? It says, `Emissary taps into pensioners' anger'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite a different headline from what we saw in the Age Pension News. Here is an article accusing Mr Sciacca of accusing pensioners of going dotty. He did not actually say they went dotty, but he used gesticulations. He used things which Senator Richardson has been told not to use in this chamber. He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>A lot of you won't understand this, I can see you are going . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how Hansard shows somebody tapping his finger on the side of his head, but that is what he was doing. The article quoted one pensioner as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>We're intellectual people fighting for our rights and he got up and tried to tell us we're suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the portrayal of Mr Sciacca in Age Pension News as the caring person who has suddenly developed a great interest in and affection for the aged maybe needs to have been slightly more modified. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things which interests me about Age Pension News is that there does not seem to be any avenue for any of the major pensioner groups. I thank the Department for sending me copies of the letters that were sent to Age Pension News. I presume they are letters which were written; if not, someone had an awful task running around getting letterheads with gumnuts down the side and all sorts of things, and getting various people to write them. I did note that some of them looked like they had been written by older people who had learned a script of earlier years. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyway, when looking at those letters to the editor, we see that none of them are from any of the age or pensioner groups, or retired persons associations. It interests me that the Age Pension News does not seem to be an avenue through which those groups seem to be expressing their opinions. It seems to me that it is a very biased publication. As I pointed out from the headlines, it is wonderful how bad news can be made into good news. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be interested to know whether the Age Pension News has received any letters from pensioner groups expressing either their praise for the introduction of the change in the medical costs for pharmaceutical benefits for aged people or any other changes that the Government has brought about. Have there been any comments on deeming? If they have written to the editor, why have their opinions not been expressed in the letters to the editor section?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will check on which organisation is sending which letter. We have printed letters critical of the Government's position in Age Pension News which proves how unbiased we are. While it may annoy Senator Patterson, Age Pension News has proved to be phenomenally successful and will continue to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator's mention of the Australian piece on Mr Sciacca is interesting. I have had cause to complain over the years about efforts that journalists have made in writing about me. I can recall in the last election going to a meeting of 300 people in Rockhampton-a terrific meeting with one person causing a scene for two minutes out of three hours. Of course, true to form, that is what was shown in the news. It was suggested that this was an example of how rowdy the meeting was when, of course, it occurred for only two minutes out of the three hours and was the only example of rowdiness at that meeting. This is something we all get used to. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mr Sciacca's case, a person in the audience was making a gesticulation to him. He responded. Unfortunately, most of the crowd looking at him had not seen the other fellow doing it. I suppose that is one to put down to experience. But to suggest that Mr Sciacca was trying to paint those in attendance as suffering from Alzheimer's disease is, of course nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Having mentioned the meeting, it is worth noting not just how successful Age Pension News is but how successful people such as Mr Sciacca and Mr Staples are, because when I attended a meeting of pensioners on the Friday week after the Budget, it was indeed rowdy. Somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people assembled at the Sydney Town Hall and they gave me a very hard time. But such were the explanations that I was able to give, that Minister Staples was able to give and that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, Mr Sciacca, was able to give that the meeting we are now talking about had 160 people attending. The same people organised it and this time they had 160. They knew the issue no longer had legs. They did not even book the hall; they had it outside. In Age Pension News there were some excellent explanations of what has been going on. Because they were excellent explanations, they had been accepted by the pensioner community in Australia. I wish to place on record my gratitude to those who prepare Age Pension News for the very fine job they have done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders employment strategy. The Department has created a staff position at ASO6 level within the equal opportunity program to implement a strategy designed to eliminate and overcome employment and career barriers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff. I think that in November 1989, $41,000 was spent on a consultant's report. This strategy is being developed within the context of the Aboriginal employment development program developed by the Department of Employment, Education and Training for the Australian Public Service. Is it correct that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has already developed a program to facilitate the employment of Aboriginal people in the Australian Public Service; and, if so, how can the Department of Social Security justify expenditure on consultant staff and a new strategy for the same purpose?</PARA></TALK.START>

We are providing a range of services to them in a way that no other part of the Public Service can possibly be doing. I think that whatever strategy is in place for the Service as a whole, we need to make special, particular and continued efforts to assist in service delivery to Aboriginals, and part of that must be an employment strategy for them within the Department as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, if this year's Estimates are any example, it is not convenient for me to limit in the way you suggested the sort of reservation I made on various grounds. In the first place, when there is a delay of some time between Estimates hearings and the Appropriation Bills debate, many issues arise as a result of both publicity and contact made with people who have knowledge of the matters raised in Estimates committees which put new light on many of the answers provided. That has certainly happened in this case. I have received a large amount of information subsequent to the Estimates committees. For example, I sent the Hansard of the Senate Estimates meetings to interested people. Your suggestion to me-and I take it that it is only a suggestion at this stage-would prevent me, if I did not have a broad description of what I planned to make a reservation about, from raising matters on which I have subsequent information relating specifically to the Estimates and specifically to the debates on which we are reporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the absence of any discussion-and I concede, Mr Chairman, that you wrote to me on this matter but I have been very busy preparing for, among other things, this debate-with you and with the chamber as a whole, I cannot see that I can accept your recommendation at all. In those circumstances, all I can say is that the Standing Orders clearly set out a situation where I can make the sort of reservation I did. I do not intend to canvass once again all the issues raised in the Estimates. What I seek to do is to raise those issues which merit further consideration because of matters that took place subsequently, particularly in respect of unanswered questions or questions which, perhaps, it has since been established, were not answered satisfactorily in the Estimates Committee itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. In the Estimates Committee I asked the Department:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To what extent is the AIS using East German and other East European coaches, who I understand are in surplus supply at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA>I was given a written response which said that only two eastern European coaches were brought into Australia in 1989-90-they were Mr Korner from East Germany and Mr Popov from the Soviet Union-but that the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) cycling unit was currently negotiating to bring a leading East German coach to Australia to assist the track cycling team to prepare for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. That answer was sent to me in October and related to a question asked on 11 September 1990. It seems curious in light of the answer to a subsequent question. On 16 October the Minister replied to a question I asked about East German coaches not by saying that there were two, with the possibility of bringing in another cycling coach, but that five East German coaches were currently, or were soon to be, involved in programs funded by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC). They relate to cycling and rowing. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for my concern is that there have been serious allegations about the use of drugs in sport in East Germany. I particularly asked the Minister about that in this question. I asked him for:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an unequivocal assurance that no East German sports coaches who participated in this organised program of cheating through performance enhancing drugs have been, or will be, used by the Australian Institute of Sport or any other government-funded body in the sports arena. What assurances do we have that East German sports coaches already here did not participate in this program of authorised poisoning of young athletes?</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that the answer I got does not seem to meet that question. That question was asked on 11 October and on 16 October Senator Richardson said he had been advised by the Minister, who would, I imagine, be Mrs Kelly in this case, that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Sports Commission is unaware of any information or allegations which would lead it to believe that any of these coaches-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, those eastern European coaches who are coming to Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . have been, are, or are likely to be, involved in providing anabolic steroids to Australian athletes or promoting their use. </PARA>
<PARA>That was not the question. The question was: were we confident they had never been involved in the East German campaign-an organised, official campaign of abuse of performance enhancing drugs by the East German authorities? In view of the confusion generated by the replies to the questions on notice from the Estimates Committee and the reply in this chamber-the confusion being whether it is three coaches or five-I would like to know: are we confident and have we inquired into whether these coaches were involved in any way in any sporting activities in East Germany where drugs were used?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is vital that that specific question be specifically answered, and not only because of allegations by Professor Hermann Buhl about the use of anabolic steroids in East German sports training programs for almost 20 years. I draw the Minister's attention to an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald. I shall quote a couple of extracts from it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of East Germany's world champion swimmers to qualify last week for the united-German world championship team heading to Perth in January indicated that their world dominance had been drug-assisted, head Australian coach Don Talbot claimed yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>These are not just wild allegations; this is the head Australian swimming coach. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> While it was shattering for the individual swimmers to perform so poorly, Talbot said that after pitting his swimmers against drug-assisted teams for almost 20 years he wasn't about to shed a tear over the passing of the East Germans. </PARA>
<PARA> `I feel no pity or compassion' Talbot said. `It is about time swimming records were brought back to reality. The East Germans have dominated the world for the past few years and then suddenly, en masse, they drop by the wayside. It just shows that something has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA> `Some swimmers and coaches have already admitted to using steroids and their failure at the trials doesn't surprise me at all. Since 1972, whether I have been coaching here in Australia, in Canada or the US, I've had to deal with it. At last maybe there is some justice, and the swimmers who have been suspect are falling to the back of the field. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have continuing clear indications of the extent to which there has been cheating in sport and drugs in sport, and particularly in eastern Europe and among eastern European coaches. Here we are importing eastern European coaches to assist Australians in our elite sports program. These East German coaches are not coming here to coach the run of the mill athletes; they are here to coach the top ones. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister again-but this time I would really like a reply that relates to the experience of these people in East Germany-whether any of these coaches have been involved in any of the sports in which drug taking appears to have been the norm in East Germany? Have inquiries been made to ensure that they have been in no way involved in any organised campaigns of performance enhancing drug taking in East Germany? If no inquiries have been made, will they be made?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There appears to be a confusion about the questions. The questions that were asked concern in one case the Australian Institute of Sport and what coaches it might have had. The other was a more general question relating to coaches coming to Australia which would, of course, include what national sporting associations might do in relation to the hiring of coaches. So both answers were correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the Australian Institute of Sport is concerned, in hiring a coach it consults with the head coach of the national association and with the national association itself. When one pools the knowledge that the Australian Sports Commission has with what the national association has and the head coach has, if there is a suggestion that there is something wrong with a visiting coach then the appointment would be blocked. That has not been the case on any occasion. When Don Talbot speaks about his views of what might have gone on in swimming he may well be right, but we have not hired a swimming coach, so it has not been a problem for us. We have no evidence of any kind that the East German coaches that we listed for Senator Baume have had any involvement in the use of drugs either in their own country or in this one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) believes that both answers on those coaches were correct. As I understand it from his answer of 16 October, among the programs funded by the Australian Sports Commission involving East German coaches were the Australian Institute of Sport residential programs of cycling and rowing, where the coaches concerned are Michael Hubner, an AIS cycling coach, and Theo Korner, an AIS rowing coach-and he is the only one mentioned in the reply to my question on notice. The others relate to coaches with intensive training centres: in rowing, Stefan Muelberg and Harrald Jahling; and, in cycling, Heiko Salzwedel. The answer to the question on notice mentioned a totally different name, that of a Mr Boris Popov from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, who was simply an eastern European coach. So it does seem to me that there were different people. That is, I guess, by the way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a matter of some concern, and perhaps it is fortunate that the matter has not been resolved yet because this could be taken into account. I spoke a week or so ago to the National Secretary of the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation (ADFPF), Mr Ron Williams, who, apart from being the National Secretary, is also involved in blind sport in Australia. It had been his hope that the ADFPF would host the powerlifting section of the 1991 World Blind Games to be held in Australia. To this end he had been in regular contact with the Executive Officer of the Blind Sports Federation, Mr Ian Fowler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Williams indicated that he had been informed by Mr Fowler that the Australian Powerlifting Federation (APF)-that is the one that got the money rather than the drug free ones who did not-had been granted the right to host the powerlifting section of the 1991 World Blind Games. Mr Fowler had said that the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) had made this recommendation to the Blind Sports Federation over two months ago. At the time of my speaking this would have been back in August. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously I have no reason to doubt the words of these people, but it seems that if that is so it is at odds with assurances given to the ADFPF, as I understand it, by Mr Weir and Mr Crosswhite that neither the APF nor the ADFPF would receive recognition until after the ASC had considered the outcome of the Black inquiry into drugs in sport. I am wondering whether some officers may have pre-empted the decision of the ASC which, as I understand it, was not made until 27 September, and whether that pre-empting would have been by some two months. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances I wonder whether the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) might like to make available to me the submissions made by the APF and the ADFPF with a view to our being able to compare them and to look at the accuracy of the information contained in them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For `recognition'. Is this not what it is all about? The ASC has taken the view that it cannot provide funding for both; it must recognise only one. I understand that is exactly correct. I do not know the reason for all the head-shaking opposite. The ASC, as I understand it, recognises only one body as the national body. I would have thought the word `recognition' tended to cover that fairly accurately, but maybe it does not. I believe that in the circumstances it would be useful if we had access to the information used by the ASC in making its decision regarding powerlifting, especially if there is some suggestion-and I cannot vouch for its accuracy-that the decision had been pre-empted and that there was a predisposition to provide funding to the Australian Powerlifting Federation rather than to the Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is particularly serious to my mind on the grounds of recent experience. In the 1990 Australian open championships the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) conducted, for the ADFPF, 23 drug tests with no refusals and apparently no positives. This followed the previous year where there were six positive drug tests, the last five having been in the past 12 months when, in accordance with the recommendations of the Black inquiry, the ADFPF attempted to open its membership to persons from the old powerlifters. Two lifters were found to have used anabolic steroids. One was suspended for three years and the other received a lifetime ban for the additional activity of trafficking in the drug. Two lifters tested positive for the use of diuretics and one for grossly excessive use of a stimulant. Those three also received three year suspensions. The key point is that in the 1990 championships there were no refusals and apparently no positives. </PARA>
<PARA> This, as I understand it, is unlike the Australian Powerlifting Federation where, I am told, that, at its 1990 national titles, one State team withdrew at the venue prior to the competition commencing when it was alleged that it found that testing would be conducted, where there were a number of refusals to be tested, and apparently some positive tests. It has been suggested to me that there were four. This is all in the only competition that the APF has had tested this year. The ADFPF has also placed all random drug testing of its members in the hands of the ASDA. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that I am receiving information from one side only and perhaps there is an appropriate response, but it seems to me that an enormous problem has emerged in sporting groups. For example, in boxing we have seen rival organisations proceeding. I am beginning to wonder whether the ASC may have to consider taking a different approach to whether `recognition' should be given to only one body. I think that the biggest amateur boxing organisation in Victoria receives no assistance because it has broken away from the Mr Arthur Tunstall body. As a result it is unable to get the support or recognition that it claims it needs, particularly in the context of what I understand to have been some very critical Victorian Government comments on the manner in which that Victorian boxing organisation has been run. That is by the way, but I would like to hear a response on the powerlifting aspect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to make is that I would be very strongly against the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) changing its policy and recognising more than one body. To do so would invite chaos. In the case of all these associations the criterion to be observed essentially is that there is a representative body to which it is affiliated in each State and there is an affiliation to an international body. If one looks at what is happening in boxing, I think one has to say that the body which Arthur Tunstall is involved represents far more in many more places. As in politics, you can get breakaways caused by all sorts of arguments, but it ought not to be the ASC's function to fund people who are aggrieved, rightly or wrongly, by a decision taken by a national body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of these two powerlifting federations, I am advised that Senator Michael Baume is getting one side of the story that is not entirely correct. I am advised that the allegation of a State team withdrawing is not true. Obviously I have no personal knowledge of this, but that is what I am advised. Having spent a few years in the portfolio, I would say that it does not surprise me at all. I am also advised that athletes from both organisations have tested positive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there are just a few points to add. Because the dinner break intervened, it is difficult to recall exactly the point I had reached. To conduct the world blind sports powerlifting championships, the Australian organisers are required to use officials recognised by the International Powerlifting Federation. The difficulty is that only the one body has that recognition; that is, the body that is not titled `drug free', whether or not `drug free' is the appropriate title. That is the determining factor, and that is something that is beyond our control. I am, therefore, reluctant to go any further because the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has said that she is reviewing the decision. We will certainly make available to the honourable senator submissions that were made to the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) when it made its original decision. I do not think any submissions have been made since this review; rather, the Commission is conducting a number of meetings. But we will certainly make the initial submissions clear to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From talking to officials during the honourable senator's contribution, I believe that he was getting one side of the story-there is another side. I cannot evaluate which side is right or wrong, but hopefully we will come to a position where there is only one body and, hopefully, we can do that fairly soon. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek to interrupt the honourable senator's discussion on powerlifting. He did ask a number of questions. On that matter I have a couple of pages which have been prepared over the dinner break and which I think will be of assistance. Prior to the dinner break, I was asked a number of questions concerning East German sports coaches. I think they are now Germans from the eastern part of Germany, rather than East Germans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Collins approves; he is improving. On 11 October this year, Senator Michael Baume asked me the following question in the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I ask the Minister for an unequivocal assurance that no East German sports coaches who participated in this organised program of cheating through performance enhancing drugs have been, or will be, used by the Australian Institute of Sport or any other government-funded body in the sports arena. </PARA>
<PARA>The question asked by Senator Michael Baume in the Senate Estimates Committee was:</PARA>
<PARA>To what extent is the AIS using East German and other East European coaches, who I understand are in surplus supply at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously there is a difference between the two questions. In responding earlier, I was attempting to point out that difference. There are several programs that the Australian Sports Commission runs that are separate from those of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). In the main, I think we are referring to the funding of coaches by national organisations. Obviously those two are quite separate. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the first question-the Senate Estimates Committee question: What are we using East German and other eastern European coaches for?-is that in 1989-90 there were two eastern European coaches brought to this country. One was Theo Korner, who was East German, and the other was Boris Popov of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Mr Popov has now completed his contract and has popped off. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew that you knew! What can I say? It was foreshadowed that another coach could be contracted for cycling. In answer to the second question, that asked in the Senate, I said that five East German coaches are currently or are soon to be involved in programs funded by the ASC. The programs are the AIS residential programs in cycling and rowing and the State-based Intensive Training Centre programs in cycling and rowing. The coaches concerned are Michael Hubner, an AIS cycling coach who will undertake a 10-week contract commencing November 1990-I do not think he is here yet, but he is on the way-Theo Korner, a rowing coach currently on a six-month contract which concludes in November; Heiko Salzwedel a coach with the Intensive Training Centre in cycling; and Stefan Muelberg and Harrald Jahling, both with the Intensive Training Centre in rowing. The coaches, other than those employed by the AIS, are contracted to national sporting organisations in cycling and rowing and those sports, of course, are receiving ASC funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am saying is that even if one looks at the exact terms of the questions and answers, the answers are still accurate. Obviously, elite coaching is fundamental to performance so it is obviously worth funding by the Sports Commission. At the same time the Australian Institute of Sport is training elite athletes as well. But in either category we have made every inquiry possible as to whether or not any of these people have been involved in the use of drugs in sport. We have no evidence that any are involved and so we have no reason to query their appointment. </PARA>

The Minister pointed out that powerlifting had an international body. Maybe I am listening to only one side of the case again but, as I understand it, there is a monumental volume of irrelevance about that fact in this context in that, to my knowledge, the powerlifters have not in fact participated in international meets run by that organisation. </PARA>

While the Minister is in this very benign frame of mind and is prepared to answer my questions in such detail as he did in the case of the last one, I might ask him another question. Mr Haynes made a statement to Estimates Committee C that the Australian Sports Drug Agency is indeed making an input to the decision making process-in other words, the governmental decisionmaking process-by providing information on the harmful effects of anabolic steroid use at a workshop in Perth in October which will precede recommendations going to the ministerial council on drug strategy. I am wondering whether the Committee can be informed of this information. I would think that there would be a great deal of merit in it being made available to us. One would hope that all of us in this chamber, following the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on drugs in sport, would be mindful of the need to communicate as fully as possible the harmful effects of anabolic steroid use. If the workshop was conducted in public, I must say that I would be grateful to receive a copy of the material.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In respect of the honourable senator's earlier remarks about powerlifting, let me say that the Australian federation was a founding member of the World Games. Three World Games have been held, in 1981, 1985 and 1989. Powerlifters took part in each of them and Australian power-lifters competed in the past two. The World Games are conducted under the auspices of the General Association of International Sports Federations. The International Powerlifting Federation is a member of that and the Australian Powerlifting Federation is the Australian affiliate of the IPF. So I think, as I said, the honourable senator has been getting one side of the story. I am still not making a judgment between the two organisations but there are two sides to the story. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! During the suspension of the sitting for dinner I further examined the reservation by Senator Michael Baume attached to the report of Estimates Committee C. I would like to quote from recommendation 5 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that debate on appropriation bills in the committee of the whole be confined to matters referred to in Estimates Committee reports for further examination. </PARA>
<PARA> This procedure would ensure that the original intention of Estimates Committees, as implied in paragraph (17) of Standing Order 36AB, is more closely adhered to, namely, that the committees focus the attention of the Senate on particular matters which they believe require further examination. The reference to reports in this recommendation includes any reservations attached to the reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports of the Estimates Committees should include schedules of questions not answered at the time of reporting, with a recommendation to the effect that those questions are referred to the Senate for further consideration until they are answered. This would allow questions still unanswered at the time of the committee of the whole debate to be referred to at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the committee of the whole procedures on the appropriation bills should not be regarded as a further opportunity for questions to be put to Ministers and officers, other than the unanswered questions referred to in the previous paragraph. Ministers should not otherwise have officers in attendance, Senators should direct their remarks to the matters contained in the Estimates Committees' reports, and any responses which may be necessary should normally be given by the chairmen of the committees or the authors of any reservations to elucidate or supplement the material contained in the committee reports or reservations. </PARA>
<PARA>In reading that quotation, I do not suggest that they are necessarily the procedures that should be used in the Senate. I have read them to indicate what the Committee considered when it brought down that report. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider that the reservation of Senator Michael Baume is contrary to the spirit and intention of the new procedures which were intended to focus debate on specific matters in the Committee of the Whole. Consistent with the statement I made yesterday, however, I intend to allow the reservation to be the subject of debate on this occasion but I consider that in future senators ought to adhere strictly to the spirit of the procedures and refer to specific matters in reservations. </PARA>
<PARA> There will probably be some matters which have to be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure as a result of experience gained in this series of Estimates committee hearings. Broad reservations such as that which was listed by Senator Baume may have to be one of the matters referred. In brief, Senator Baume, you may continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the basis that I first mentioned there are some matters that I wish to raise involving corrections to statements made in Senate Estimates hearings. I draw attention to a comment-a genuine mistake, I assume-by Mr Arnaudon when I asked him about the announcement of the $3m to Western Australia for capital works expenditure associated with the staging of the World Swimming Championships. Mr Arnaudon said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It was announced by Senator Richardson in March, I believe, of 1989. A contribution was made by Mrs Kelly in July. </PARA>
<PARA>I have since got a written response which corrects that and says that it was announced on 19 February 1990. I acknowledge that that was a slip of the tongue. There was nothing significant--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Richardson" NAMEID="4E4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Arnaudon might think that that was one of the incredibly rare occasions on which Hansard might have made an error. Perhaps Hansard is of the view that he may have. In any event, it was certainly 1990, not 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was certainly not in 1989, no. A subsequent response that I have says 1990; it is only that it is repeated twice in the Hansard. That is not the point I am making. The point I am making is that the correct figure, which we have received subsequent to the Estimates discussions, reveals that it was 19 February 1990-five weeks before the Federal election. There are those who say that that is quite remarkable timing. In Western Australia-an area where there was a degree of political sensitivity, where there were suggestions that the opinion polls were showing the possibility of the loss of some seats for the Australian Labor Party-an announcement was magically made five weeks before the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise this matter because there is always the fear that the good things that emerge in terms of funding in areas such as sport can at times be used for political benefit to a political party, just as it seems that some politics were involved in the announcements relating to the Melbourne Olympic Games support from the Federal Parliament. I must say that these things cause problems for the Opposition, not because the Government is funding these capital works but because of the nature and timing of them. For example, I draw it to the Committee's attention that there have been only about five capital payments for various events over the last decade, including grants for the World Cup Athletics in Canberra in 1984, grants for the Americas Cup defence in Fremantle in 1987--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a contribution of $30m for something which could hardly be described as the working man's sport. There was a grant to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982 and so on. As Mr Arnaudon told us, an Australian Sports Commission policy states that grants are not to be automatic; they are to be considered by the Cabinet on a one on one case basis. I am asking this genuinely; I cannot remember: What type of capital contribution went to assist the Tasmanian Government in its staging of the World Rowing Championships, which I believe were very well organised, and when was it announced?</PARA></TALK.START>

That being the case, we were under quite considerable pressure from the Victorian Government about an early announcement.

We had been pressed, because, had the Western Australian Government not been able to make some announcement about this, it would have found itself in great difficulty in holding the championships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Sports Commission and the Government regarded the holding of these championships as a very important event in Australian sport. I am quite convinced, therefore, that the Commonwealth involvement was worth while. Quite seriously, it had nothing to do with elections. Whether there had been an election or not, we would still have had to make that announcement. The fact that it came at the time of an election was fortuitous and I do not regret it, but it had nought to do with the decision. We had been working on it for some months. In respect of the decision on the Olympics, the Government would have been remiss in its duty and would have been very roundly criticised had it not made the decision when it did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of answers to this from Ministers far senior to me. I do not think that there is anything useful that I can add to the statements made by the Prime Minister or his representative in this chamber, Senator Button. In so far as I can recall, there was going to be an examination by the departmental committee. We wanted to ascertain the veracity of the costings, even though that was irrelevant to the fact that we had set a limit. It would not have mattered whether the costings were right, wrong or indifferent; we still were not going above the figure we had announced. But we were going to make sure of the veracity of those costings. The Commonwealth was quite properly concerned to ensure that it was not put in a position where more than that which it was prepared to promise could have been asked.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I understood the Minister to say that the actual analysis was irrelevant-I think he used the term `irrelevant'-because the terms of the Government's decision, as announced in the Cabinet decision of 23 January, set a maximum of $125m on the Federal Government's commitment. Therefore, as I can see it, there was no way that the Commonwealth could have been committed for more than $125m. It may have been able to get away with a little less if the total cost of the complex was less than $250m because it was a one for one matching basis with the Victorian Government. I think that the Minister is nodding ascent on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am nodding ascent to the proposition that the Commonwealth protected its position by nominating an upper limit and that any examination was obviously irrelevant to the upper limit because it could not have been changed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the Minister's view on that; it seems to be self-evident. We seem to be agreeing on the fact that the decision to provide up to a maximum of $125m was really conditional only on the basis that Melbourne be granted the Games. If Melbourne were not granted the Games, then the whole thing would be irrelevant. But that being the condition, the only other matter subject to any sort of issue at all was whether the figure would be the maximum of $125m or whether it would be some lesser figure, depending on whether the cost of the complex would be $250m or less in total. That decision was not subject to any other condition. That seems to be absolutely and unequivocally clear. I would like the Minister's concurrence that it is absolutely and unequivocally clear. If it is not, I would appreciate his guidance as to where I may be incorrect in my understanding of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, the committee was to report to him by 16 February. As we all know, four months slipped by and the committee did not report until 12 June. Given his normal grasp of his portfolios and that he was the key Minister involved in this at the time, I am surprised that he is not in a position to confirm that my understanding of this matter is correct.

As I recall, there were two qualifications; the first was `up to' and the second was `if Melbourne gets it'. They were in the announcement, and at the same time the Government decided to examine the costings to make sure that they were valid. I suppose that, at least in part, it implies that the Government wanted to ensure that the Commonwealth could not be hemmed later into a position of offering more, and that was a proper exercise of protection of Commonwealth interest. I will review that and, if I think there is anything that I can add which will be helpful, I will certainly do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

I leave it, therefore, on the basis that, as I understand it, we are agreed-unless the Minister comes back to me subsequently-that that decision to provide up to $125m to the Victorian Government for the Olympic Games was conditional on, or subject to, only the question of whether Melbourne was granted the Games and that there was no other conditionality at all surrounding that decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to develop briefly one small point which emerged out of the Estimates inquiries. It was evident that the Department had decided, as a matter of policy, not to have a policy on the merit or otherwise of declaring performance enhancing drugs illegal. I take the opportunity to express the Opposition's unhappiness with that. The Opposition is basically of the view that, in view of the fact that the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) is part of that structure, the Department would have a capacity to provide valuable policy input on such a matter. Other `performance enhancing drugs' which are listed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are drugs which many people regard as social drugs-these being alcohol and marijuana. In the circumstances, does the Department have a view as to whether it is proper for those social drugs to be on the IOC list? I take on board what Mr Blunn said at the time, that they could be performance enhancing because using alcohol and marijuana, for example, could soothe the nerves when shooting.</PARA></TALK.START>

Obviously, as I mentioned at the time, tobacco may well calm the nerves and could be a performance enhancing drug too, but I do not think that it is on the list. Amendments from the Australian Democrats to a Bill relating to the incidental broadcasting on television of tobacco advertising are likely to come before the Senate. Mr Fairbrother noted during the Senate Estimates C hearing:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I know that Mr Fairbrother said at the time that it was on his work program over the next four or five months but, in view of the fact that this matter is to be debated fairly soon in this chamber, could the Senate be provided with those position papers looking at the level of sponsorship in order to assist the Senate in its discussions of the upcoming broadcasting Bill?</PARA>

I think it is still to be the subject of Cabinet discussion, and I do not believe we can release any of the documents that might be associated with the Cabinet's discussion. I will add a few points to what Senator Baume has had to say. As far as alcohol and marijuana are concerned, the International Olympic Commission does not ban them; it lists them but does not proscribe them, which means that associations can ask for them to be tested for but they do not have to.

In respect of the views the Department may have held on these matters, of course it is not the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) that counts, but the Department of Community Services and Health. DASETT may have made its views known to the Department of Community Services and Health, but it is not DASETT's responsibility to have a policy on this matter. As Senator Baume will be well aware, we in this Government attempt to leave everybody's patch to him or her and not transgress. The people on my left are not aggressors; these are people who are quite happy to allow the Community Services and Health patch to remain its own.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The testing body was complying with the request of the sport. In the case of rugby league, that sport asked that marijuana be included and so the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) tested for marijuana. The other drug which caused a furore in rugby league was, of course, cocaine, which is already on the list, so ASDA has to test for that anyway. But it does not test for marijuana in the sport unless asked. Of course, when it comes to a sport like rugby league-a professional sport-one can see why it would ask. If there is a widespread belief held by such people as Jack Gibson that marijuana depresses initiative, energy and verve, then professional sports paying big money to their players obviously have a concern, so they ask for it to be included.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to move to another matter that emerged out of the Senate Estimates hearings, and that was the elite sports program. I do not want to go over all that ground again but simply say that the Government has taken the clear decision to concentrate on the seven sports with a view to enhancing Australia's performance internationally, particularly at the Olympic Games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What emerged from discussions in the Senate Estimates hearings was that clearly this is a very high risk policy. If it does not pay off-in other words, if it does not result in lots of gold or other medals at the next Olympic Games-presumably there will be a sense of disappointment and this special funding may well be at risk. Senator Richardson in one of his responses to me said:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we are trying to back winners, but I do not think there is any shame in that . . . Given that it is this kind of movement on the part of a lot of ordinary Australians-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a popular movement of concern about the bad economic position of some of Australia's leading sporting contenders-</PARA>
<PARA>that gives you the impetus to get the money, I think you are betraying that if you do not give at least part of that extra to those Olympic sports where Australia has a real chance. </PARA>
<PARA>My concern-and it is a concern that has been reinforced to me very strongly since the Senate Estimates Committee, as people have read the Estimates Hansard-is that, while it is recognised and accepted around the place that if there are sporting heroes who win things there is the prospect of attracting lots of youngsters into those sports, the concentration of funding on the seven or eight elite, depending on which way one looks at it-or the 17, if one looks at it in a different way, but particularly that seven-appears, at least in the view of many Australian sporting people, to be unfair to the non-Olympic elite sports. I use the word `elite' not in the Australian Institute of Sport concept, but in the way in which it is generally accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the dominance of the International Olympic Committee members, it appears, over the AIS, it is the concentration on Olympic sports that gives this indication of unfair treatment of many of the non-Olympic sports where there is exactly the same opportunity for hero worship and for following the excitement of someone who is an outstanding performer, recognising also that the Olympics take place once every four years and there are other heroes who might be more regularly supportable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian women's netball team-I think this point was made-has been world champion five, six or seven times within the last 10 years and has quite significant status, although there are probably not all that many countries playing that sport. Nonetheless, it is an international sport. Squash has had many Australian champions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just concerned, and many other people in the sporting arena are concerned, about this concentration on the Olympics and the high risk nature of it. As I said, if we do not come up with the medals what is going to happen to the funding? I am particularly concerned when I look at what is happening in other nations, where the trend seems to be away from this kind of concentration on elite sports. I simply make the point that since the Senate Estimates hearings I have received a large volume of concern from other sports which feel they are being unfairly treated, although I take the Minister's point that all sports have received some additional funding. I acknowledge that, but there is no doubt, as the Minister has said repeatedly, there has been a `concentration' of the extra funding on those elite sports. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that funding for every sport went up was the main point to make. It is also undeniable that the impetus for change, the impetus for that massive increase in the funding of sport, came from the Olympics; from Duncan Armstrong getting there on the dole; the harrowing tales of those women who had been in the Australian hockey team who had to struggle; Debbie Flintoff-King, and all the rest of them. Every one of those people who had done well had hard luck stories to tell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had to try to address those problems. I do not believe for a second that all the problems have been addressed. It is still the case that the private sector in this country does far less than it does in most of the comparable western European nations or in the United States of America. Given the economic conditions, it is probably unlikely that we are going to get a huge rise in that in the near future, so we are not going to have every problem addressed straight away. The massive increase in funding enabled us to give big increases to all sports, and particularly big increases to seven. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, it is obvious that a sport which is not in the seven is going to have a complaint and say, `Well, what about us?'. All I can say to those making that statement is that they got looked after as well. Everyone gained, but we have to recognise the purpose of the gain. Australia was looking at the Olympics, at the results achieved and at the conditions which were endured by athletes in achieving those results. Anyone who fails to acknowledge that that was the impetus for change-the impetus for more money-fails to grasp the obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if the policy does not pay off at the first Olympic Games, some will complain. I would expect that. But I have no doubt that over the course of the next two to six years these policies will pay off. As I sat in Newcastle on Saturday and watched the Australian hockey team beat Great Britain six to one, it becomes obvious that we are a growing power. We are a growing power in the sport because we are spending more money. It is the case right across. We have improved performances already. Let us not knock it. Let us give it a chance. It will work. There is enough money there to make sure it does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has Mr Maurice Plant been the recipient of any direct or indirect funding from Athletics Australia on either a casual or other basis? Mr Maurice Plant is, as I understand it, the athletes' representative on the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) for the Grand Prix circuit. The Minister may be able to tell me what the position entails and what Mr Plant's relationship is with young Australian athletes visiting the international Grand Prix circuit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time of Mr Plant's involvement in the urine substitution incident with Jane Flemming, he was banned by Athletics Australia-as I recall-from further occupying a team position. He holds a significant position with the IAAF, ironically, and I wonder whether the Australian Sports Commission has a view about that; and, if it does, what that view is. Has it conveyed what must be some very grave concerns it has, given the previous history of Mr Plant with the IAAF?</PARA>

In 1989-90 the sports development program paid $275,000 to Athletics Australia. In 1990-91 the sports development program paid $416,000 to Athletics Australia.

In response to the second part of Senator Crichton-Browne's question, Mr Plant has not received any money directly from Athletics Australia. However, in Melbourne in early 1990, he received payment from a sponsor when he promoted an international athletics event on behalf of Athletics Australia. I am informed that the position of an IAAF supervisor, which is what I understand he is, entails liaison between athletic nations, promoters and sponsors to formulate and establish a list of athletes for each event at each meeting on the European Grand Prix circuit. This is an arrangement between Mr Plant and the IAAF directly. In this regard he is responsible for nominating relevant Australian athletes to the relevant events and meets. He does not have any managerial role in relation to Australian athletes. The Australian Sports Commission has not expressed a view about the desirability of Mr Plant holding his present position in the IAAF.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that answer. I do not want to be sawing sawdust again and I hope that eventually we can put this thing to rest, but I ought to say that the letter I received from Athletics Australia was a letter of the most unsatisfactory type. It sums up the frustrations of those of us that have had a very difficult job in sorting our way through this business. I wrote to Athletics Australia and asked it what action it had taken regarding this incident. I got a letter back telling me that it was not going to tell me anything, and that was virtually the end of the matter. I am happy to table the letter. It did not repeat what had happened in respect of Mr Plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth of the matter, in respect of the poor, unfortunate athlete that has been so often mentioned in this matter, is that absolutely nothing was done. She was interviewed, she declined to answer the questions, and that was the end of it. I might say that was months and months after the matter was first raised. As a result of the athlete's response, the rules were changed so as to impose a suspension on future athletes who do not accommodate requests for information from Athletics Australia in such incidents. But for their trouble they did absolutely nothing, except continue writing to me to plead with me to drop the thing because, as far as they were concerned, it was causing problems. That is right; it really is causing problems. The problems were caused by the administration and the officials, not by the athlete, by me or by anybody else. It is sad that it was not dealt with in the way it should have been dealt with in the first place. And still it has not been dealt with in the way it should. </PARA>
<PARA> I should just say for the record that I would have thought it was unsatisfactory for Maurie Plant to have any association or connection, whatever devious route the funding that finds its way into his pocket travels, with any of the Australian athletes. I find it pretty unsatisfactory that an assistant team manager sought from a young lady a urine sample for the purpose of providing a mechanism for allowing what he judged to be a potentially positive test to prove negative, so as to cheat. When it was raised with him, Mr Plant admitted that much of his evidence which was necessary, but claimed he had committed a potential error of judgment. He had not committed an error, just a potential error, of judgment. It is almost like the bank robber who goes into a bank and aborts his hold-up. It is only a potential error of judgment because he did not get any money. Athletics Australia wrote to me and told me that, in its view, that was not an unreasonable description of his conduct. I find that a very unreasonable description of his conduct by it and I find it most unhelpful in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> Could the Minister give an indication-or perhaps something more specific than an indication-of when we will see the passage of legislation setting up the Australian Sports Drug Agency as a statutory body? I recognise the difficulties with the legislation. No doubt the Government is waiting with bated breath for our report so that it can implement all the recommendations. With the packages of legislation presently before both Houses there is a difficulty with which I sympathise but I would have thought that there was a great deal of justification for us all wanting to see the legislation on the statute books and the agency in place, with its board appointed, by the end of this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain I understood all the processes, but I was prompted to ask that question after looking at the response from the Minister the last time we discussed this matter, when I asked about the appointment of Mr Robert de Castella as Executive Officer of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). I think that is his position. The Minister has provided me with an answer since then which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Section 31 of the Australian Sports Commission Act empowers the Commission to employ the director of the Institute. The Commission established a subcommittee of the Chairman, Mr A.E. Harris, the Deputy Chairman, Mr J.D.Coates, and Mr H.J. Elliott to undertake initial interviews and to recommend to the full Commission candidates for the position of Executive Director of the ASC and the Director of the AIS. Mr de Castella was first interviewed on 15 January 1990 for the position of Executive Director. A second interview was held with Mr de Castella on 22 March, being for the position of Director of the AIS. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing exceptional about that. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Coates made contact between 22 March and 25 March with all but one of the other commissioners, seeking their approval of Mr de Castella's appointment. All the commissioners were in agreement with the appointment; one commissioner unable to be contacted was subsequently contacted on 27 March and the full Commission ratified the appointment at its meeting on 3 May. </PARA>
<PARA> With the greatest respect, I think that is a sloppy way to make appointments. Not all the Commission knew of the appointment when the announcement was made. The full Commission never, to use vaguely bad English, met prior to the appointment of Mr de Castella being made; Mr Coates contacted the other commissioners between 22 March and 25 March-by telephone, I suspect-seeking their approval for Mr de Castella's appointment. I think the appointment was made on about 24 or 25 March, somewhere around there. It is a remarkable way to make an appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been significant controversy at the AIS. There have been a great many problems, and it is imperative that the appropriate and proper person is appointed. I have no doubt that Mr de Castella is the right person. I am not questioning his qualifications. Certainly he has been at the coalface; certainly he understands athletics and has some empathy with athletes. However, after all the difficulties of the AIS and after the hiatus between appointments, to have a sub-committee of three people interview him twice and then, if I might say with respect, ring up with a fait accompli at the last hour, seeking the approval of other commissioners, is not the way that any board, committee or commission can properly and comprehensively consider the applicants. The subcommittee clearly was considering only one applicant; it was only considering Mr de Castella. We do not know what happened after that. To make the announcement, and for the Commission to ratify the appointment on 3 May, seems to me to be a remarkable way of doing business. </PARA>

It was not the case that Mr Harris, Mr Coates and Mr Elliott chose him in the face of opposition and used that choice to ram a fait accompli down the throat of an unwilling board. As I recall-and I did speak to quite a few of them-board members were very happy indeed to have Mr de Castella on board. I do not think any of them thought there was any alternative but to have a process which enabled a decision to be made quickly. It is not possible to have a board like this, which has representatives from every State, except Tasmania-we had better watch that one-meet and interview all applicants when necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to record that I suppose the entrepreneurial spirit still flickers alive, but this `can do' sort of business is not the way that these commissions ought to run. I am quite certain Mr de Castella would not have taken a better job elsewhere in a fortnight or a month's time if it had taken that long for the matter to be considered carefully and properly. I think the sensible thing would have been to invite each member of the Australian Sports Commission to meet the applicant or at least receive a proper written report, which is the way that men and women normally do business in these circumstances, yet this thing was done with great haste and, might I say from my reading of the answer from Senator Richardson, without one of the commissioners even knowing about it. He just happened to be uncontactable and so the matter proceeded. He might have had some devastating information that made it quite wrong, but at least he was judged in his appointment on the Commission as somebody competent and capable of making a contribution to these sort of decisions. Yet he did not even have a voice. I do not want to labour it but I want to say that this sort of approach has not been helpful in solving the sort of problems that the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission have had.</PARA></TALK.START>

In this case there was no numbers fight and as I understand it the great majority of the board were very happy with the appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is possible, I suppose, that one member might have had a devastating argument to undo the views of everybody else. I cannot think of it ever happening on that board or any other, but it is possible. But if one were to hold out that possibility then one wonders how any board would ever work. A board would never be able to make a decision unless everyone was present. I shudder to think how many Australian Sports Commission board meetings would have every single member present on every occasion. I think that is being a bit too restrictive and unnecessarily so. In this case, a very successful attempt was made to get hold of the great majority of the board and they approved the appointment. </PARA>

I do not want to get off the substance of what we are dealing with, but I do want to refer to the response to the extent that it goes to the heart, in some respects, of the funding of the Australian Drug Sports Agency and the Australian Sports Commission. There was a recommendation relating to an appeals mechanism and a proposed tribunal. The Government response was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of hearing and assessing evidence the Committee clearly formed the view that an expanded Tribunal was necessary and should have an investigatory as well as appeals functions. There is, of course, a conflict in one body having both an appeals and an investigatory role, and this was taken into consideration in forming the Government's position on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> Was the Government mindful that we were not simply looking for a mechanism that arbitrated, but rather a body that was capable of collecting information itself in a way that is not necessarily available to the Australian Sports Commission or to any of the sports bodies?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not be the first time she is wrong nor the last. Can I take a moment to explain something to the Minister and ask for his response to the recommendation we made? I have to say that perhaps the Government's view is that various sporting bodies and the Australian Sports Commission are the appropriate people to look at complaints from athletes who might want to convey information relating to the use of bad substances by other athletes, or their own harassment, their own intimidation, their own pressures and their own duress by the Maurie Plants of this world but they might want to have somewhere to go to explain the problems they have got and they are very real problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not read it myself, but I understand that when Darren Clark retired recently he said he was sick of being beaten by cheats. Darren Clark is not a whinger nor a whiner. He is an excellent athlete who was very competitive and had his wins and had his losses, all with good grace. I find it very sad when people like that retire from their chosen sport because they cannot win because of the cheats. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very sad when we have young girls coming before our Committee, as they did, and telling us that they were so depressed when, for example, they had to compete with East European athletes. They were built like tanks, had deep voices and could have sung Paint your Wagon lower than Lee Marvin and had a 5 o'clock shadow that would put most of the rock stars to shame. Yet our girls knew from the outset, when they lined up against these competitors, that they were running against a cheat that probably had a second or half a second on them before they started. They would train their hearts out for months and months and perhaps years, only to find that by somebody else taking a performance enhancing drug it was all pretty much in vain. </PARA>
<PARA> We were seeking a mechanism to give relief to those sorts of people. It is not easy for them to find the mechanism that is necessary. I was distressed, for instance, with the sort of evidence that the Committee received. It is no good going to sports officials because they have a vested interest. I do not say that in an unkind way, but they are bound to be subjective. Half of them are ex-coaches or ex-athletes; they have got an interest in one athlete or another. Without labouring the point, Jane Flemming could hardly go to Maurie Plant and say, `Listen, the athlete next to me is cheating. What do I do about it?'. She is away from home, away from her parents, away from her coach. She has to go to somebody, so she goes to the assistant team manager. Instead of him saying, `I understand, I empathise, I will keep your confidence. This is what we will do about it', he says `By the way, while you are here will you wee in my bottle?'. Where do these athletes go to where they can be certain that they will not be intimidated?</PARA>
<PARA> I have had one senior sports official tell me that I am causing some pain because I have raised Maurie Plant's name a few times-do I not know that he decides which athletes from Australia get on to the grand prix circuit, and that is where all the big bucks are? He can make or break these kids. That is true of these other major promoters overseas. Somebody creates the entree. Therefore, these kids cannot afford to squeak. </PARA>
<PARA> We took evidence from witnesses who were terrified to tell us about some of those operators-the operators who say, `Yes, come and compete on our circuit, and we will guarantee that you will not be tested positive'. These kids are not going to stand up and tell us that, are they? They will be one darned athlete who will never get another crack at it. It is the make or break of these kids. Who do they tell? They cannot go to the Australian Sports Commission or anywhere else. The Australian Sports Commission does not have the powers. It will pull in a lawyer who will find out that there is no prima facie case. But I shall come to that in a moment. Who do these kids trust? They are terrified of offending anybody because their futures rest on it. </PARA>
<PARA> We had two witnesses before us who gave me some heartburn. One was an Australian athlete, a top athlete-and I mean `top athlete'. That particular athlete was to appear before us in camera. On the night before, that athlete got a phone call from a senior sports official, gravely concerned that that athlete was to give us evidence about the use by another Australian athlete of illegal performance enhancing drugs. When the athlete came before us and was sworn in, there was no way in the world that that athlete was going to tell us in camera, out of camera or anywhere else, because that elite athlete was terrified of the ramifications. The athlete told us afterwards the whole story and explained why she could not give us the evidence in camera or anywhere else; she just could not talk about it. I found that absolutely tragic, but that is the reality of where we are at. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our witnesses was in Queensland when she was contacted by a person and was intimidated against giving us evidence. That particular person has been mentioned unfavourably in the report, and I know that there are those in this chamber now who think that I have been unkind to that particular person and harsh on another matter. But I would remind the Committee that Al Capone did not go to gaol for anything else except taxation fraud. There is more than one way to skin a cat. Do honourable senators think that the athlete would come before us and tell us that Mr X had got her at a sports meeting and told her how unwise it was to give evidence because of the implications and ramifications for her future? Of course not. So where do they go?</PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that that problem is endemic in Australia, but there has to be an independent body. It is pretty tough. I had the audacity to raise the matter of the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF) giving, first of all, six weeks' notice-and then I discovered that it was six months' notice-to the Australian athletes going off to Seoul of its drug testing timetable. Even the dumbest of athletes would not get tested with that notice, all being equal. I was not suggesting anything sinister or improper. I was making the point that, because of the mechanism in place at the time, we are exposing ourselves to the allegation that we are assisting the cheats. One could reasonably draw the conclusion that we are more concerned to make sure that our athletes were clean when they went than we were to make sure that they were not cheats. </PARA>
<PARA> What did I get for my efforts? Mr Kevan Gosper, the President of the AOF, put out a press statement pouring one over me. I understand that he is now the Vice-President of the OIC-he has been promoted. Instead of Mr Gosper saying, `Listen, that was never intended and I am sure you will understand that, but that is the effect of what we did. We have learnt from our mistake. We now recognise with hindsight that it was not wise and we had not thought that that would be the effect. We will not let it happen again', he was so defensive and aggressive that he put out a press statement attacking somebody who was just raising a matter-and I might tell the Committee that as a result of its being raised it will not happen again. How would honourable senators like to be young athletes going along and raising some of the problems that these athletes can have?</PARA>
<PARA> I wish that it were just restricted to a few. We received evidence from one rather brave soul who wrote to us and told us about problems with boxing. Mr Zammataro wrote and told us about problems with drugs in boxing and he got a letter from Mr Arthur Tunstall for his trouble-a very angry Mr Tunstall. Correct me if I am wrong, but Mr Tunstall was the Secretary of the Commonwealth Games Association and also the Secretary-General of the Amateur Boxing Union of Australia Inc. Of the sporting bodies we wrote to who were invited to make submissions to our Committee outlining any problems they might have with drugs in their sport or any potential problems they might have, the only person to write back to us said that he had no intention of giving us a submission because they had no problems. </PARA>
<PARA> At this very time last year I asked a question of Senator Richardson. It was not a flier or a blind shot. I asked Senator Richardson whether boxing was a sport with potential for drug abuse, and he answered me yes. Of course it is, because it is a weight sport so there are diuretics. It is a sport requiring power so there are anabolic steroids. It is a sport that requires quick reflexes so there are all sorts of other implications. Yet Mr Tunstall would not appear before us. But poor old Mr Zammataro wrote to us and told us about some problems, and he got a nasty letter from Mr Tunstall for his trouble. When he did not respond to the first letter, he got another one. I am happy to table this correspondence, if it be the Committee's wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was then required as a result of Mr Zammataro writing to us and pleading protection-which is the point I am making-to write to Mr Tunstall to advise him that there was a small problem with intimidating witnesses. It brings a penalty of six months in gaol or a fine of $5,000, or $25,000 for a non-person. Mr Tunstall was pretty impressed with the correspondence. He wrote back and told us that we were intimidating him. It is pretty classy stuff. It can bring a smile to one's lips and is a good yarn to tell over a beer, but the tragedy is that it is an everyday event in sport in Australia. </PARA>

Discussion is still proceeding in the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts about the status of correspondence of this sort. We have, in effect, two conflicting decisions taken by the Committee. One is that correspondence entered into with regard to the drugs in sport inquiry should be presumed to be understood as evidence, and the other is the subsequent ruling that evidence before that inquiry could properly be made public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One letter, which was received very close to the decision to complete the reference, is strictly no longer part of that inquiry.

<PARA> We now have a situation where all elite athletes in this country know that they are going to be tested. But none of them knows when. Whatever they knew two years ago about the schedules of tests and all the rest of it, now none of them knows when Haynes will descend upon them.

<PARA> In any event, I am of the view that the change in culture which we have brought about in the last few years means that what athletes may have felt about coming forward a few years ago will not be relevant in future. I believe that every single sport is desperate to prove that it is not involved in drugs. Every sport will be encouraging athletes to come forward if they even hear of anything. Of course, they would be running a risk that if they did not and the Sports Drug Agency or the Australian Sports Commission received a report, their funding would be in doubt. So all athletes in every sport now have on them an imperative that they did not have before to come forward. With that change in culture, they will come forward. I do not now believe that athletes are being intimidated into silence. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not at all surprised by the tenor of correspondence between the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts and Arthur Tunstall, nor his response. I have known Arthur for quite some time. I consider Arthur Tunstall to be a very fine Australian. I am absolutely certain that he has not had, nor ever will have, any involvement in drugs. Arthur is the kind of person who decries that behaviour with vigour. In fact, Arthur does most things with vigour and that includes the writing of letters. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the Committee that he is a very difficult person to intimidate. I think Arthur, like many others, had concerns about the Committee. This does not mean that those concerns were right; it does not mean that there was an attempt to intimidate. But obviously many sports had concerns about the way the Committee proceeded. I think they had been thrust into the parliamentary arena for the first time and did not understand procedures. I think that created a fair bit of confusion and fear. Perhaps some of them overreacted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not read the correspondence with Mr Tunstall. Maybe he did and maybe he did not. But I do know that many sports were concerned and some of them did not understand what Senate procedures were like. They had views that the Committee had overstepped the mark when in fact all the Committee was doing was observing the Standing Orders of the Senate. I think whenever there is confusion and fear we can sometimes get overreactions and we all regret them. </PARA>

In view of the Minister's comment that perhaps the legislation may be dropped for this year, I want to express my concern that it is one of 66 Bills which at present are being attempted to be bulldozed through this place, having been bulldozed through the other chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very important Bill. It seems to me that exactly the wrong message will be conveyed to some people in the sporting community if this Parliament considers this Bill not important enough to be passed before Christmas. I think that message is totally inappropriate. I would like the Minister, in these circumstances, to outline to the Committee why this Bill was not prepared and was not ready to come before this chamber before now. As I understand it, the outline of what was required of the Bill has been known for months and months. Drug testing has been proceeding under the ASDA for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill does not go through, the Government should not try to fit that on the Opposition. That is what really worried me about Senator Richardson's remarks.

I want to say with some vigour that we have not delayed the process of legislation in this place. </PARA>

The Estimates Committees sit on different days from those on which the Senate sits to deal with legislation. The Minister should not try to fit us with the incompetence and failure of the Government to come up with appropriate volumes of legislation at appropriate times of the year. The House of Representatives has only on one occasion sat on fewer days than it has this year. We are being inundated with legislation at the end of the year. It is intolerable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to make is that whether the legislation goes through the Senate this year will have no effect on the sports or the athletes. The reality is that testing goes on whether or not the legislation is passed. Any athletes caught will be disciplined whether or not the legislation goes through and funding for the sports will be taken away whether or not the legislation goes through. Obviously, like Senator Baume, I want to see this given legislative force. Whether or not the legislation has been passed will have no practical effect on the use of drugs in sport, which we have been stamping out for the past 12 months without this legislation. I think we can manage for another four. To suggest that there is some incompetence involved here is nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the rest of Senator Baume's contribution, I have been, as is always the case, a model of tolerance and patience this evening, but they are running out. The disgraceful abuse of Senate procedures by a range of senators, including Senator Baume, when it comes to Estimates Committees is on record in this chamber. I have spoken about it before. When you hold up Estimates Committees you think that it is not a problem because it is a day that is not a Senate sitting day. You and some of your colleagues have never understood that the tying up of departments for hours, days and months in chasing every rat hole has come up with nothing. For all the questions you have asked, you have not got one headline, let alone one line in any paper. Why? Because the way you use the Estimates committees--</PARA>

I have heard honourable senators in this place even this evening complain about $848 for a consultant's letter prepared for the Department of Social Security, while at the same time the Department spends hundreds of thousands of dollars chasing up stupid questions at Estimates committees. Why? Because Estimates committees are no longer used for their purpose but are used for briefings of incompetent shadow Ministers who are not across their portfolios. Tonight is another classic example of the same process being repeated.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making a general point.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is quite right. Sports officials are not used to the procedures and the implications for not complying with the procedures, and they were not aware of the cohesive powers of the Committee. I suspect that in some respects it was intimidating. Notwithstanding that everyone tried to be relaxed about it, it is not an issue about which one can stay thoroughly relaxed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say with sincerity that the problem with some sports officials in Australia is that they have been receiving taxpayers' money for so long and they imagine that they get it by right. They take offence at having to be accountable and scrutinised by those who ultimately have to pass the legislation that makes the funding possible. I had to make the point very frankly today about Athletics Australia when it wrote me a bland letter. I said, `I regret having to do it, but I will pursue this matter, the questions and the information until I am satisfied that I have the answers relevant to the funding'. I did not say that in an aggressive way. One gets the clear impression that the officials see themselves, their sporting associations and their sporting bodies as having the money by right and get on with the job without understanding that there has to be a scrutiny somewhere. Perhaps they are not used to being scrutinised except by an auditor's report to say that the money has been spent where they say it is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that there are those who can make valued judgments as to whether the money is being spent on elite sport properly, whether it should be spent at the other end of the sporting spectrum, or where it should be spent. That is half the problem. If we have done nothing else-I suspect that we have failed from my observation-we have focused the sporting officials on the realisation that they are accountable to the Parliament at the end of the day for their conduct, for their management, for their guidance and for the expenditure of the funding. </PARA>
<PARA> There may not have been a problem with drugs in boxing. I do not know whether there has been. I would be very surprised if boxing was outside the mainstream average of drug use in those sports which are likely to be enhanced by the use of these performance enhancing drugs. It is similar to the mother-perhaps more the father-saying that every daughter is a virgin when she marries. There is just an incapacity to imagine that that particular sport is tainted by drugs. I suspect that I am not incorrect when I say that every single sports person who came before us came to persuade us-and, I suspect in his or her own mind was persuaded-that that sport was the one sport that did not have a drug problem, whether it was the rowers, the basketballers, the rugby players or the Australian league footballers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian rules people gave very good evidence. The Australian rules sporting organisations have been very effective as have the Rugby people. They told us all the reasons why drugs did not fit their sport. Of course they do. Of course Australian football players have used them. The rugby people could not imagine that was a problem for them. I give them absolute marks. As I have said before in this chamber, I have always been persuaded to the view since I first took some interest in this matter-which I might tell honourable senators is about to terminate and which I am sure Senator Richardson will be pleased to know-that the professional sporting officials have been quicker to grasp the problem, to deal with it and not to justify it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume raised the question of use of marijuana. I can think of no better example than the South Sydney Rugby Leagues Club Ltd. Clearly those officials did not just guess there might be a marijuana problem. I am certain they must have known that the club had a problem among its players. They wanted it fixed. They probably realised that the athletes were playing below their performance. They understood that the players were bad role models for their followers. They understood that one day the news would get out. They grasped the nettle. They did not hide it. They did not have private counselling. They got it out on the table. All those fellows were found for their sins. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certain that they are now better athletes and that it is a better club, and those officials ought to take the credit. If that was the attitude of all sports, sport in Australia would be better. But without exception they said to us, `There is not a problem with our sport and, if we were able to give an example of an athlete, it would be the only one'. The so-called amateur sports in particular have been very slow to accept that there is a serious problem and that Australia is in the mainstream in terms of the amount of drug abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been disappointed. That is why I got angry, perhaps unfairly, with the Harrises of this world and the others who, instead of getting on with it, want to argue with me about it. I pay some credit to the Government for its recent response. There is much of it that I do not agree with, but that does not make it wrong. The tone in which it is written is much more acknowledging, accepting and seeking to solve the problems than this hairy chested, confrontationist, rude and bombastic correspondence, which everybody finds offensive and which I respond to. It is a big improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet, I ask the Minister what the status of weightlifting in Australia is. It is referred to briefly. I think a subcommittee has been set up. Weightlifting is one of the sadnesses of the use and abuse of drugs in sport in Australia. The Coffa brothers were proud to tell us that there had never been a positive. But if one reads this report, one sees correspondence to us from Mr Bruce Walsh, the Executive Director of the Australian Weightlifting Federation Inc., in which he sets out categorically, in writing, one clear case of a cover-up in respect of Nick Voukelatos in the 1984 Olympics.  We then had the Satry Ma case. There were a number of other cases. Because they had not been dealt with honestly, properly and frankly, it was reported that there had not been a positive. They said that there had never been a positive. They were pretty keen to attack us. That is not unnatural-it is unreasonable but not unnatural. I hope that something is now being done about that. </PARA>
<PARA> If I had my way, I would not have weightlifting as an Olympic sport and I would not fund powerlifting. Until such time as we have a proper profile in place, the cheats in those sorts of sports will never be stopped. There has been no serious attempt by the Weightlifting Federation to come to grips with the problem. I hope that this part of our report, which is frank and factual, is not just pushed out the door and that the Australian Sports Commission looks at it in a positive and constructive way, because-and I say this with the greatest of respect-this matter will not be cleaned up by the present officials of the Australian Weightlifting Federation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne has again raised a number of points. The only part of what Senator Crichton-Browne was saying with which I disagreed was the beginning of his speech. Many of the officials about whom he is speaking have not really been earning large lumps of money from the Australian Sports Commission or from their sport. Many, if not most of them, have of course worked voluntarily.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But you must understand that I was not talking about funding for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but the point that many of these officials would be trying to make is, `I have worked for 30 years in a voluntary capacity. I give up all my time for this sport. I have broken my back for it, et cetera, yet here they are picking on me'. I understood that feeling. Many of them complained to me. Whenever I got that sort of complaint I explained to them why the Committee had to proceed. I explained to them that it was not breaking any standing orders and that, if they had matters of real gravity, they could be presented in camera. I attempted to explain to as many officials as I possibly could the way that the Committee would proceed and the correctness of it. But many of them undoubtedly had that feeling. I think that that will now change, because over the next few years we will be putting more money into administration, so more administrators will be on the payroll full time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with a further point that Senator Crichton-Browne made. When I was the Minister I insisted that, as a condition of that extra funding, there be auditing of the sports concerned. We had to make sure that that money was being spent properly. As Senator Crichton-Browne would be aware, a number of sports have not performed satisfactorily in terms of their administration in the last few years. We had considerable concerns about their administrative performance. Accordingly, at the time of the big announcement on the increase in sports funding, we said that we would be having performance audits of the administration of these sports to make sure that they were performing properly. We will continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the sports with which Senator Crichton-Browne has been having a celebrated disagreement was one where perhaps administration was not all that it should have been in the past. Having said that, I cannot be too critical of what happened four years ago. A new team is trying hard. They cannot really undo what happened four years ago, even if they wanted to. I appeal to Senator Crichton-Browne to be relaxed about that. The new people are better than their predecessors and are trying very hard. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne also talked about weightlifting. There is one aspect of this that I will check overnight. I will make sure that we can inform Senator Crichton-Browne exactly. Weightlifting had been offered funding on the basis that it accepted the doping policy. I think it has accepted it, but I am not certain that we have the correspondence yet. I will have that checked before we resume at 10 o'clock in the morning so that we can let Senator Crichton-Browne know. I agree that question marks have hung over the sport in the past. Certainly, the late withdrawal of competitors on a number of occasions was open to question. I do not have any evidence about it but, like Senator Crichton-Browne and many others, I have heard stories. </PARA>

I believe that under our new arrangements we will be able to detect athletes who have been doing the wrong thing. I think that that will help us eliminate it from the sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that weightlifting will remain in the Olympics in the foreseeable future, even though there were a few embarrassments in that sport in the last Olympics, particularly with a Bulgarian. But it will still be on the list. Therefore, there is every reason for Australia to still be in it. Mind you, we will have to be absolutely satisfied about the running of the sport in Australia now. My understanding is that it is not yet back in the Australian Institute of Sport programs. We are still conducting an examination to determine whether it should be brought back. Honourable senators will recall that we put it in the sin-bin some time back. I am not yet certain of how long we put it in the sin-bin for, but I think there will be a response fairly soon. I hope that we can give Senator Crichton-Browne a response by the end of the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very sympathetic to those long-suffering, hard-working voluntary sports officials whose only reward is to wear a blazer or get a buzz from success, or perhaps ultimately see some rewards for their endeavours by the achievements of the athletes with whom they are associated. Of course, that begs the question, which is perhaps a debate for another time-whether we have so socialised sport in Australia that we have crossed the Rubicon in that sporting officials now have to get used to the idea that if they are going to take government money there are new rules. There is a new system and there is a new responsibility. The good old days of rattling the tin and having a chook raffle in the local pub to give an athlete a new pair of shoes or to send an athlete to compete in Sydney are over-and thank goodness for that in some respects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It really begs the question as to whether the officials have come to grips with the fact that they are now in a different era with a different form of funding which requires a great deal more accountability than the money from the chook raffle did. No doubt they will be offended when Crichton-Browne has the impertinence to ask them what they have done with the money. That is only natural; I understand that. I hope that they are all fast track learners so that they can understand why the questions are being asked. That will make them better and more accountable officials. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one other matter before me. That is the difficulty I was talking about earlier. I received privately some complaints from people and then I received an anonymous letter, which I will not table because it names somebody who is alleged to have acted in what I judge to be an improper way. Following a discussion which we had at the last Estimates Committee C hearing when we discussed the matter of the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF) distributing funding for Olympic sports, I expressed to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) my grave concern that this organisation, in a sort of incestuous way, had the capacity to pull the strings and run the show. I thought it was an abrogation of responsibility that the Government, through the Australian Sports Commission or whatever, ought to be funding Olympic sports in the same way as all other sports. </PARA>
<PARA> That begs the question: should the Confederation of Australian Sport, for instance, be allocating funding for non-Olympic sports? I do not want to get into a philosophical discussion now about the virtue of the level of funding for Olympic sports or the selection of the big seven and the justification for and the merits of that and the relationship between those in the AOF and the sports that get the money. It makes interesting reading and one can wonder whether the money has been given in a thoroughly objective way and whether the measures and tests used for the allocation are objective and fair. One will always have complaints that they are not from those who do not receive it and accolades from those who do receive it. The letter I received stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Are you aware, that on May 19, at the AOF annual general meeting, a number of olympic sports, including two of the super seven were told . . . that if they continued their membership of the Confederation of Australian Sport, that their funding would be in jeopardy?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister knows what I am asking. That is very worrying for me and it takes me back to the argument I put to the Minister when it was decided to allow the AOF to allocate the funds. It gives it an enormous and unique influence. I have to say, with respect, that that is why I think it is wrong. It has the potential and the capacity to decapitate people and compromise them; to cause them to become obsequious when they should be saying something. It really takes them out of the mainstream of contribution to sport in terms of how it is run and their having a view about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister is able to give me a commitment about this. He will presumably be resting only on the reputation of those on the AOF when he does give me a commitment. I hope that the Minister will pursue that matter so that I can have an assurance that it is not hinted to people, by implication indirectly or directly or in any way by innuendo, that if they cause problems-`they' being people associated with the Confederation of Australian Sport-they will get into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that there is some politics involved. I am sorry that I do not understand the politics, but there is some politics between the AOF and the Confederation of Australian Sport. I have not spoken to either body so I do not know, but clearly politics is involved and I would hate to think that any sporting body which is associated with the Confederation of Australian Sport is being threatened. I understood through another source-I am not being secretive about this; I cannot remember who it was-that there was a suggestion indirectly to Athletics Australia that it had a problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been tension between the Confederation of Australian Sport and the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF). If we are being honest, we have to concede that there has been some tension between the Confederation and the Australian Sports Commission at times in the last few years, let alone with just the AOF. When there are those periods of tension there are all sorts of allegations about who said what to whom. I will certainly take up with the Olympic Federation the allegation that Senator Crichton-Browne has made, which the Sports Commission knows about but has no evidence of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that the Sports Commission has a contract with the Olympic Federation as to the allocation of funds and the rules to be observed. One will not find in that contract a rule that says that a member of the Confederation will not receive funding. I will ensure that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Sports Commission make it absolutely clear to the Olympic Federation that we will simply not tolerate any attempt by it to have the influence of the Confederation reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> I spent quite a bit of time ensuring that the Confederation got a kick along. It had been in the doldrums; I think it had been hijacked by some unworthy people at times. Three or four years ago it was not worth much. It has improved its situation dramatically since then. In fact, if my memory serves me correctly, within a couple of years it will be self-funding through the efforts that it has made. So while it might receive government funding now it will not have to very shortly. This body has really got hold of itself and kicked on, and I want to encourage it. I think having a lobbying body for sport outside the AOF, the Commonwealth Games Association or the Sports Commission is a good idea. I will certainly take up Senator Crichton-Browne's suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do not accept the criticism about the Olympic Federation having an influence on the allocation of funds. One of the complaints made consistently to me while I was Minister was that it was very difficult for sport to know where money was coming from. We had all sorts of people allocating it, with all sorts of different criteria in mind. Obviously, when we are talking about millions of dollars of government expenditure-and we are here-it is a far better means of service delivery if we can have the decision made by fewer people under one set of rules rather than by lots of people all over the place with different sets of rules. I think that is better for sport because there is more certainty involved for the sporting bodies themselves. In setting up a new board for the Australian Sports Commission I tried, therefore, to have a balance with representatives of the Olympic Federation, athletes and some State institutes. I tried to get a whole range of people involved-from disabled sport as well. If we can get that kind of spread across the sports, we ought to get the right balance at the Sports Commission level. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought not to be ashamed or afraid of people such as John Coates, who will be the Manager of the Olympic team again in Barcelona. He is an incredibly popular figure in sport in Australia and perhaps the most efficient sporting administrator that I have come across. I think he is a first class Australian. I do not mind Senator Crichton-Browne strengthening the hand of people such as Mr Coates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 August the Auditor-General presented to the Presiding Officers of this Parliament Audit Report No. 3 1990-91, Department of Defence, into Australia's Army Reserve. The findings of the report have been accepted without question. No-one has stood up in public, to the best of my knowledge, and challenged those findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most people who quote this report have only read the list of recommendations. Had they taken the time to read the report carefully to become aware of the scholarship and the methodology, they would have reached conclusions very different from those reached by the Auditor-General. It is because of the impact that the Auditor-General's report is having on the current defence debate in Australia-an impact based on incorrect conclusions-that I take the time of the Senate to analyse it in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I want to defend both the importance and the independence of the office of the Auditor-General. Accountability, particularly in handling public funds, is a fundamental for democratic government. One of the means of ensuring accountability of government is through an agency answerable not to the executive government, but to the parliament. Unless there is the facility for independent surveillance of the financial actions of government, then abuses and malpractices will occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps out of ignorance, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) operated in an area where it had little or no expertise. Having read numerous audit reports on the Department of Defence it is apparent that the approaches adopted by the ANAO, while correct from a professional accounting point of view, are sometimes inappropriate in the case of this Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence is unlike other departments of state. Many of its capabilities cannot be readily quantified or demonstrated short of a real emergency. Many of its activities are directed towards future potential. While that is so, the most scrupulous accountability must still be maintained over the spending of public moneys. Those activities must be beyond reproach, and comprehensive audit procedures applied. Problems come at the next stage-whether some piece of equipment or some capability represents value for money. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point to be made relates to the objectives as outlined in chapter 2, Audit Objectives and Scope. The opening statement in paragraph 2.1.1 states that the objectives are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ARES in terms of the role and objectives set out in 1987 Defence White Paper and associated high level Defence papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then lists its first detailed objective in paragraph 2.1.2 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the organisation and management of operational activity of the ARES . . . </PARA>
<PARA> With the best will in the world, that task is simply beyond the Auditor- General. It takes time and a great deal of money to develop a good analytical capability. The Australian Department of Defence went down this path once with the Central Studies Establishment (CSE). The Central Studies Establishment was set up to look objectively at military capability in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) as a whole, not from a single service point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> It did much more than that. It analysed carefully what capabilities were required and how they might be provided. It looked not only at the purchase price but also at the total resources that would have to be committed to operate the system throughout its life, and the benefits and disadvantages of that system in comparison with others. This sort of detailed analysis often produces a result different from what might be expected when items of equipment or weapons systems are selected on one or more superficial attributes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Central Studies Establishment was too professional for its own good. Some of its findings did not accord with the prejudices of some of the generals in the services and some of the public servants, so it was quietly done away with. Since then, we have had a number of major capital acquisitions-the submarine program and the Anzac ship program-which have totally committed the defence budget for the next decade or more, and which have not been subjected to the rigorous analysis that CSE would have given them. The Department of Defence needs this critical analysis. To carry out analysis at this level takes vastly more resources than those in existence at the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as this capability the Australian Defence Force needs another independent assessing capability. How the Australian Defence Force is meeting the objectives set by the Government must be measured. This is best done by an independent authority which has the resources for the task, particularly with respect to training procedures and equipment. What is required is the creation of the post of Inspector-General of the ADF. The role model for this is already in existence in the post of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the duties of an Inspector General of Defence would be very different, but the principle of an informed, independent person or organisation having access to the innermost workings of the whole of the Department of Defence, and required to report without fear or favour, is the same. I will develop that in a future speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point is that the ANAO has a mistaken view of what the 1987 Defence White Paper has to say about the purposes of the A Reserve (ARES). The ANAO appears to have a conceptual image of the A Reserve as a fully manned and equipped military force trained for specific vital asset protection tasks, with the role of the ANAO being to judge the efficiency of their training. A more careful and informed reading of the White Paper shows that it sees the Reserves primarily as an expansion base. The 1987 White Paper does introduce, for the first time, specific tasking for the Reserves, particularly for the now disbanded 3rd Division. </PARA>
<PARA> I read the Defence White Paper carefully when it was published in 1987, which may have been some little while before anyone in the ANAO read it. The White Paper has little detailed discussion on the role of the Reserves, but the heart of what it has to say is in paragraph 4.106, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Our requirement for land warfare cannot be achieved without extensive Reserve participation. Accordingly the Army Reserve structure is being reviewed and changes will be implemented progressively. Since World War II the Reserve has provided the expansion base for the Army. It will now in addition be required to contribute to operations which might arise in the shorter term . . . </PARA>
<PARA> That clearly spells out the expansion role and the phrase `in addition it will be required' is a qualification to that basic directive. Whatever the ANAO sees as the correct interpretation of the White Paper, it must not be taken as the absolute prescription for Australia's defence. White Papers and strategic basis papers change as circumstances change. Like a railway timetable, at best they are a guide only. Papers change but the services endure. The purpose of the Australian Army Reserve (ARA) is to provide an expansion base for all contingencies ranging from limited support for the Regular Army and low level contingencies through to full scale mobilisation in a major emergency. One of its most important functions is to provide a pool of trained officers. While we have an overproduction of officers in the peacetime Regular Army, that surplus would be quickly exhausted in any serious emergency. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the existence of the Army Reserve lies in its potential. In this, the Army Reserve differs from the Air Force and Navy reserves. The fact that one of the main reasons for the Army Reserve is officer production means that it cannot exist in entirely the same form as a normal fighting force. Any assessment based on a comparison, for example, between the second and third Reserve divisions and the first division will not only show the second and third divisions in an unfavourable light, but also that it is incompatible with one of the central purposes in having the Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> One very important point, unknown or overlooked by the ANAO, is that the ARES is forbidden by policy directive to train to the level of the ARA. It cannot train past sub-unit level so it is further disadvantaged. It is against this background that the reserves must be judged. To be fair to the ANAO report, the expansion base role is explored in the final part of chapter 3. It is weakly discussed with the stated interpretation that expansion would occur only after `the threat of more substantial conflict' and long lead times would be involved. It fails to understand the significance of this and therefore fails to censure the Department of Defence when it discovers in paragraph 3.5.3 that there are no plans for expansion-only the prospect that `concept papers would consider the extent to which expansion of the ADF or increased rates of effort might be required'. </PARA>
<PARA> In response, in paragraph 3.5.8, the Department shrugs this off when it says, `The Department advised it is not intended to develop operational concept papers on the ADF expansion base'. The fact that the Department of Defence has no plans for expansion in an emergency has not been commented on by any reviewers of the report. It is probably the most significant and certainly the most worrying statement in the entire report. Nevertheless, the questions which the ANAO attempts to answer are vitally important. They must be asked. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the major failure of the report, the assessment of the cost of the Army Reserve. No-one knows what the reserves cost, certainly not the Auditor-General with his methodology. But then no-one knows what any capability costs in any of the Services. One has only to read the Hansards of Senate Estimates committees for the Department of Defence to know that. There is an inadequate cost accounting system in the Department of Defence. The last thing I want to see in the Department is cheeseparing accountants saying what can or cannot be afforded. That is to put the argument the wrong way round. The correct approach must be to decide on the best evidence what Australia's national security needs are and then fund that accordingly. What happens now is that the Government decides what the minimum amount of money is that it can get away with for the defence vote, and the defence requirements and the threat scenarios are tailored accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, a small nation has to know what it costs to maintain the capability of an element in the Defence Force in addition to what it costs to buy the equipment. It is for people other than accountants to decide whether that capability is required or not. Having said all that, while I think we can do a great deal better, at the end of the day costing figures may well be impossible to obtain with absolute precision. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANAO correctly makes the point that neither Army Office nor the Department had any estimate other than salaries paid for training days of what the reserves cost. Despite its reference in the appendix to the Government Accounting Office (GAO) of the United States, the ANAO did not apparently explore overseas experience in any depth. The GAO is far better endowed for this task than the ANAO, and it supports the view that the costs of the reserves are about 60 per cent of the costs of the regulars. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANAO proceeded to develop its own estimate of cost of the reserves. This led it to the conclusion that a Reserve soldier costs 50 per cent per day more than a regular. This conclusion is now widely disseminated and believed. How did it get this figure? The steps it followed were these: the ANAO started from the proposition that apart from those ARA personnel assigned as cadre to ARES units and those in specific combat units, the remainder of the ARA supported the needs of both the ARA and the ARES. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANAO accepted a figure from the Army that in the State of South Australia the ratio of effort from the Regular Army in support was 65 : 35-that is, reserves to regulars. In other words, 65 per cent of the activities of the ARA in South Australia, apart from combat units and ARES cadre, was spent on the reserves. The ratio of 65 : 35 was not substantiated in any way. It may be true; it may be false. No-one knows. But what we can say is that there is no justification for transferring that figure to the whole of Australia. Even the Department of Defence protested about that flight of fancy. </PARA>
<PARA> What the ANAO did was to multiply the number of these ARA support personnel in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania by an average salary paid to the ARA in each of these States. From these three figures a cost attribution was worked out on the basis of 65 per cent of the cost going to the Reserve in South Australia and Western Australia. For Tasmania the fraction was 80 per cent. These three figures were added together and divided by the ARES numbers in the three States. This then gave an average cost of the support by the ARA to each Reserve member. This figure was then multiplied by the total number of reserves in Australia which produced a figure of around $100m. This is of course over and above those cadre normally provided to Reserve units such as COs, adjutants and instructors. To anyone with any mathematical understanding, this methodology is quite incredible. In the first place, the Army figure is not substantiated in any way. The principal role of the regulars is as the force in being, but among a number of other roles is the requirement to train and support the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly reasonable to ask how much effort goes into supporting the reserves. At the same time, it is reasonable to ask the Reserve, as the customer, if it thinks it is getting value for money, particularly if 65 per cent of the support troops in the whole Army are supporting it. The Auditor-General's figures are that a reservist trains for about 40 days per year-most do far less-versus 220 days for a regular; a ratio of 1 : 6. To support one reserve training day compared with six training days for a regular apparently takes nearly twice the effort throughout a whole year. Clearly this is an untenable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, those ratios-65 per cent in South Australia and Western Australia and 80 per cent in Tasmania-apply to States which have small Regular units. From the ANAO's own report, the total ARA strength in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia was only 2,654 out of a total figure of 31,465. Mathematically, there is no correlation between these three small States and Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria where the numbers are very different both for the regulars and reservists. The Department of Defence in paragraph 5.2.4 is quoted by the ANAO as saying that it cannot accept the reasoning behind this approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, a clear assumption is that the ARA gets nothing out of the reserves. At all levels, Reserve activities do provide training and experience for the ARA, training which they may not otherwise get. One example of this is the tendency to replace reserve COs with regulars. In a contracting environment for the regulars, Reserve units do provide useful career opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the attribution of effort completely overlooks the fact that support personnel are necessary for combat units. It may well be that they cannot be used 100 per cent of the time but their existence is essential to the Regular unit. In this case, if the Reserve can use this unused capability, it should get it for nothing or at least a heavily discounted figure. Having developed this methodology, the ANAO then takes the same flawed thinking and applies it to the equipment, materiel and accommodation used by the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Regular Army lacks some basic equipment and there is absolutely no excuse for this. The Reserve is very much worse off. Despite having authorised entitlements for equipment for rifles, radios and the rest-entitlements which on average are 25 per cent of what they need-most reserve units have less than their authorised level. The ANAO report records the shortages of equipment in paragraph 3.4.6 where it draws attention to significant shortages of equipment, increased demands on regional equipment pools and excessive holdings, absence of information on age and condition to provide management information and a properly managed equipment repair program. </PARA>
<PARA> The system whereby a reserve battalion has only 25 per cent of its equipment is reasonable so long as it has enough for training purposes through the year. When these units undergo continuous training in their annual camps, they are supposed to be able to draw 100 per cent of what they need from a regional pool. These pools were set up for reserve use. The report shows these pools to be inadequate where it says that less than 50 per cent of requests for equipment made to regional training pools can be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to this insufficiency is the fact that ARA units are now drawing on these pools although they were not set up for regulars. Despite having shown that there were gross deficiencies in ARES equipment, the ANAO looked at the capital and equipment account of the Army, divided it up on the same ratio as is used to ascribe manpower costs from the regulars and added that to the cost of the reserves. In this way a figure of $475m was claimed to be the cost of the Army Reserve. It is claimed to be a conservative estimate because several other costs were not included. One of those qualifications, that no consideration is given to income tax forgone because Reserve pay is tax free, is quite silly. This Government tried to tax Reserve pay and failed. Reservists are paid much less than regulars and in nearly all cases less than they earn in civilian employment. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side, claims can be made that the reservists are more efficient in some ways than regulars. The equipment pooling system means that equipment assigned to reservists can be used far more intensively than in regular units. All training days can be used for reservists, while the regulars have guard duties, ceremonials and about 40 days stand-down a year. None of these points is important to me, but I mention them in passing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major shortcoming of the report arises from its concept of what the Reserve should be. The report does not understand what the Army is in both its regular and reserve components. Relying on a strictly cost benefit approach, it has led to some wrong conclusions. The report's treatment of understrength units provides a very good example of this. The ANAO uses the term viability and in its eyes a viable unit is one which has 70 per cent of its authorised strength. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in order to reallocate equipment from non viable units or those assigned lower priority tasks, to the high priority and viable units so as to match needs and resources in accord with army priorities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing drives reservists away faster than poor or non-existent equipment. If a unit is weak and is stripped of its meagre resources, it will cease to exist. The answer is to fund the Reserve adequately for these basic requirements-rifles, webbing, uniforms, compasses, et cetera. The Defence Department can afford billions of dollars for submarines and frigates, but it cannot find a few million that would solve all the basic equipment problems for both the reserves and the regular Army. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that reasons are found for the problems of understrength units and those problems dealt with. The Reserve must be spread throughout the whole Australian community. That is absolutely fundamental. It is dangerous to accept the proposition that those strong units, which are mainly in Queensland and New South Wales, should prosper and the weak be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> One final point on viability. The report sees university regiments as not cost effective because they do not produce enough officers. That is a central role, but it is not their most important one. For the information of the Audit Office, an important fact is that reserve officers from university regiments serve for longer than officers recruited from other sources. It is essential that in peacetime the Defence Force has a presence on the campus. To do otherwise is to isolate the Defence Force from the higher educated sections of the community, presumably the future community leaders, with potential and important sociological divisions or misunderstandings in the longer term. Furthermore, the Defence Force is entitled to have access to the talent on campus. There are numerous other examples of a lack of understanding by the ANAO. For example, paragraph 4.2.2:</PARA>
<PARA>The retention of the two ARES divisions did not appear to have any efficiency and effectiveness gains flowing from it and there was evidence to indicate more concern to retain promotion positions than in priority structural efficiency and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>That charge can be laid on some regular units. Within reason, in peacetime excess positions provide both training and experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 4.2.5 recommends:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a simplified command and control chain to reflect the part time nature of the ARES. </PARA>
<PARA>Again it misses the point that the Reserve is not an end in itself but a means to an end. We certainly do not want a Reserve structured like a State emergency service. It is wrong to allow vital asset protection to dominate and simplify training. Army units are not trained for a single task. The only way an asset like an airfield can be protected is by having troops skilled in all arms who can dominate the surrounding area and deny its use to the enemy. That takes real trained soldiers, not civilian security guards. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the foregoing comments, there are some factual errors in the report which detract from its scholarship. Time does not permit me to enumerate them. Having made those unfavourable criticisms, it should be recorded that the report has some valid points. It highlights the shortages of basic equipment. We are not talking here about exotic helicopters or ships, but the absolute basics-boots, uniforms, webbing, and the tools of trade for a soldier, rifles, compasses and radios. There is no excuse for those items to be short. In both regular and reserve forces the greatest depressants of morale are poor equipment and poor training. If basic equipment cannot be provided for the limited peacetime numbers, how will it ever be supplied in an emergency?</PARA>
<PARA> The report comments on the quite incredible paper war that Army administration finds essential and has for centuries. Everything must be signed for, and in triplicate. Again, administratively all three services, not only the ARES, are back in the Boer War from the point of view of communications. When the use of car phones, mobile phones, hand-held radios and facsimile machines are universal in the civilian world-not only in private industry, but in all government departments-I have yet to see one fax machine in any service office or headquarters. Cumulatively, the time lost across the whole of the Australian Defence Force by not providing adequate numbers of these basic essentials is incalculable. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the ANAO's claims, it costs more to keep regulars then reserves. Not all personnel are required 365 days a year. Even if the figures of the Auditor-General are accepted, in this context the real significance is not that a reservist costs 50 per cent more than a regular. The argument can be inverted. The country can buy two-thirds the numbers of regulars for about only one-fifth of their cost. Except for those cases where an immediate capability is required, and that is a very real requirement, much greater potential capability can be bought for the same amount of money through the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument should not be expressed in those adversarial terms for we need both regulars and reservists. The truth of the matter is that the level of training determines the cost. I want to say quite emphatically that I am not arguing for the reserves, least of all an entire Reserve Army for Australia or a Wrigley plan. For the purposes of this speech I am accepting the status quo in ratios between the reserves and the regulars. The point is that the Auditor-General's report is into reserves, so they become the central point. At the present time three major inquiries relating to the reserves are under way or on hand. The Department of Defence is doing a major force review study which will be completed in the first half of next year. The Wrigley report, which proposes a much enhanced role for the reserves, has been presented. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of this Parliament is completing a major inquiry also. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the effect of this report? First of all, the figures quoted by the Office have been accepted as fact and people who should know better quote them. Secondly, these figures have been used to undermine the Reserve within the defence community. It is not only the Regular Army but also some regulars in the other two services who are now saying that the reserves are a waste of money. The countervailing view among some in the Reserve is that the regulars are not supporting them and indeed see the continued existence of the Reserve as unnecessary competition for scarce resources. It is wrong that this dichotomy should exist within the Australian Army, which is in fact made up of both a regular and a reserve component. The reservists believe there is some justification for their view. </PARA>
<PARA> Conducted between March and December 1989, the Audit Office report was published in August 1990. Through the 14 chapters of the report, the Department of Defence makes written comment on the recommendations. Indeed the report was circulated widely through the Army asking for comments. Anyone outside Defence who had an interest in the report knew of its findings at least six months before the report was tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point that troubles the Reserve is the timing of the release of the report. I do not know whether it was a coincidence. My views do not matter. The views that do matter are those of the reservists. A couple of weeks after the ANAO report was released, the decision to disband the headquarters of the 3rd Division was taken, having been public knowledge for some time prior to this. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pointed out that the disbanding of the Construction Squadron, a Regular unit, was announced in the Budget in August, yet the 3rd Division announcement was not made until 8 October. In paragraph 4.2.4 the Department of Defence argues strongly against closure of the Reserve Divisional Headquarters because they are essential. It is very disturbing that matters which are essential to the Department of Defence can be changed so readily. Rightly or wrongly, there are those in the Reserves who believe they were treated less than honourably by their colleagues in arms, their brother officers, in the Regular Army. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point is the devastating effect that this report has on the morale of the Reservists, particularly in Victoria. They feel very strongly that the report is inaccurate. The Reserve has been dealt a crippling blow in one of the two great population centres in Australia, where the nation must tap the huge range of skills and personnel available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserves in Australia often get treated badly. Few members of the general public recognise the sacrifices made by those who conscientiously serve this nation's interests in a voluntary part time capacity. There are very big sacrifices made by a Reservist and his or her family in time, money, career advancement and often, sadly, in family welfare. Reservists do leave after 30 or 37 years of dedicated service feeling their time and effort has not been valued. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia must have a Defence Force. We must have a highly professional Regular Force as a counter to any immediate threat. We must have a Reserve Force to back that up. It is quite proper for the the state of both the Regular and the Reserve forces to be subject to continuous and objective reviews. What the Auditor-General has done is look at the Reserves and decide that the nation is not getting value for money. Implicit in the report is that, since this is so, the Reserves should be done away with. Surely a more intelligent approach is for the Auditor-General to look for the reasons why this is so, if indeed it is true. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally think we could get a great deal more out of the Reserves. The reason why the Reserve is in the state it is in is that it has been denied the sinews of war-materiel and resource. Give it the basic equipment it must have; give it good instructors from the ARA; give it realistic training programs; and then judge its worth. That is what is starting to happen with the Reserve units in 6 Brigade, where a number of Queensland Reserve units-49 RQR, 2/14 Cav, to name but two-have been integrated with Regular units. The results, a year or two after integration, are very promising and point the way to the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I have taken the time of the Senate to deal with what I believe is an important report. I do not agree with the central findings of this report and I believe that this report does a disservice to the national interest. There are certainly problems with the Reserve, but a more perceptive approach is required to overcome those problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I will be brief. In the year 1215 AD, King John of England signed an agreement with his subjects. The agreement is commonly known as Magna Carta and it is acknowledged as being an important document. It is displayed in the public areas, of course, of this Parliament for all of the public to see and absorb its significance. It is significant because it is the document upon which our system of parliamentary representation and indeed the whole of our judicial system are based. It is a pompous document, but it is agreed that it is also significant. I would like to quote from the commencement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> John, by grace of God, king of England . . . to . . . all of his officials and faithful subjects greeting. Know that we, out of reverence for God and for the salvation of our soul and those of all of our ancestors and heirs, for the honour of God . . . and the reform of our Kingdom, on the advice of our . . . faithful subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> We have . . . granted to all the freemen of our kingdom, for ourselves and our heirs for ever, all the liberties written below, to be had and held by them and their heirs from us and our heirs. </PARA>
<PARA>What this means is that Magna Carta binds our Sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth. It binds the Queen in the Parliament at Westminster; it binds the Queen in the Parliament of Sydney; it binds the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth of Australia and for New South Wales; and it binds Her Majesty's Justices in the courts of this land. The agreement concludes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Wherefore we wish and firmly order that . . . the men in our kingdom shall have and hold all the aforesaid privileges, rights and concessions . . . for themselves and their heirs from us and our heirs in all things and places for ever . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite an extraordinary promise. What this means is that the rights conferred by Magna Carta ensure the benefits of the subjects of our Sovereign Lady the Queen throughout Britain and the British Commonwealth of Nations. That trust is placed in us as a parliament and in the courts of the land. I would like, with leave, to table a translation in modern English of Magna Carta for the information of honourable senators who perhaps have not seen it in modern English. </PARA>

In March 1988, Mr Taylor issued proceedings against the bank and the officer, claiming damages. On 11 May 1990, Mr Taylor applied to the Supreme Court of New South Wales by way of notice of motion-and I seek leave to table a copy of that notice of motion-to have the hearing of the proceedings be expedited.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>. . . coronary arteriography was performed on Mr Taylor on 26 April 1989 which showed moderately severe coronary artery disease. </PARA>
<PARA>Then paragraph 7 says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I am concerned that delays in his legal proceedings will produce a continuing, and perhaps accelerated, deterioration of Mr Taylor's coronary arteries. </PARA>
<PARA>And paragraph 10 says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is possible that if he were to wait longer than a few months for the proceedings to be dealt with his health would deteriorate to the extent that he would no longer be able to continue the proceedings and may even die before they are eventually dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that, in refusing the application for expedition, the judge was in fact contravening the principles enunciated from the Magna Carta that I read earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> King John entered into a covenant with his subjects and their heirs forever. That is a very pompous statement but that is what Magna Carta actually says. The covenant is:</PARA>
<PARA>To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay right or justice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is my contention that, by refusing expedition, the judge breached that covenant. The judge breached an ancient covenant that guarantees that justice shall not be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the interests of the people of Australia that Mr Taylor's proceedings go to trial almost immediately. I have disclosed in this place, by reference to affidavits sworn by managing directors of four separate companies, the evidence against the bank officer. In April 1988, a senior officer of the New South Wales police fraud squad informed Mr Taylor and others that he, Taylor, had a strong prima facie case against the bank officer. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1988, an officer of the Australian Federal Police informed Mr Taylor and, separately, Mr Tony Rigg of Nowra that the bank officer would be charged on summonses and a warrant issued to seize the bank files. That was in April 1988 and nothing has happened. Mr Taylor is a man who has served the nation well. During the Second World War, he used his engineering skills to develop a new form of altimeter for aircraft. That altimeter was fitted to aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force, and made a tangible contribution to the war effort in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> During the war the United States Navy urgently needed new instrument lathes. Mr Taylor developed those lathes. Also during the war troops fighting in jungle warfare in New Guinea and Borneo needed an optical instrument to measure vertical angles. Mr Taylor developed that optical instrument. In more recent times Mr Taylor designed the dies for the Mighty Chef range of microwave cookware, together with a secret manufacturing process incorporated into the machinery. The Mighty Chef range was recognised as a world leader, and it became the subject of the action between Mr Taylor and the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a grave travesty of the justice outlined in the Magna Carta if Mr Taylor were unable to continue with his proceedings. A great issue is raised by Mr Taylor's predicament. That issue is whether ancient rights guaranteed to us down the years of our constitutional history prevail to this day, 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, is Mr Taylor's State member of Parliament. I advise the Senate that I will call upon Mr Greiner to affirm to the people of Australia that those ancient rights do prevail to this day. I advise the Senate that I intend to call upon Mr Greiner to use his good offices to cause Mr Taylor's proceedings to be set down for trial within one month. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) One for which the Treasurer is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Loan Council, established under the Financial Agreement of 1927. Loan Council controls and coordinates public sector borrowing in Australia in terms of both Government and semi-government debt. The main agreements under which it fulfils this role are the Financial Agreement and the Global Approach Resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In recent years, Loan Council meetings have been held annually, in conjunction with the Premiers' Conference. Members have the ability to convene on a more regular basis, if they feel this is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Members comprise the Commonwealth Treasurer (Chairman) and the Treasurer of each of the six States. The Chief Ministers of the ACT and the Northern Territory attend as observers.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Loan Council Section, Fiscal Policy Division, Treasury, serves as Secretariat to the Loan Council, and is currently comprised of two officials who perform other functions in addition to their Secretariat duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Attendance at recent Loan Council meetings was the same as for the conjoint Premiers' Conference. The response on 22 December 1989 to the honourable senator's almost identical question to the Prime Minister on this subject (Question No. 1421, Hansard, pages 5227-5229) provided a response in relation to the 1987, 1988 and 1989 Premiers' Conferences. In view of the considerable time and expense involved in the preparation of that reply, I am not prepared to authorise the work and expenditure required to prepare an answer to this question in relation to the 1990 Premiers' Conference/Loan Council meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) There are no additional costs arising from the Loan Council meetings over and above the Premiers' Conference with which each meeting is held. The response on 22 December 1989 to the honourable senator's almost identical question to the Prime Minister on this subject (Question No. 1421, Hansard, pages 5227-5229) provided a response in relation to the 1987, 1988 and 1989 Premiers' Conferences. In view of the consider- able time and expense involved in the preparation of that reply, I am not prepared to authorise the work and expenditure required to prepare an answer to this question in relation to the 1990 Premiers' Conference/Loan Council meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The meetings were held at Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Copies of the Press Release by the Treasurer on the outcome of each Premiers' Conference/Loan Council meeting are publicly available. The minutes of Loan Council meetings are confidential to Loan Council, and can only be made public with the consent of all members.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice on 13 September 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) With the increasing amount of corporate crime has the Government retained the services of more auditors to check the business of companies.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How many auditors work for the Federal Government in this capacity.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is there a problem retaining the services of highly trained auditors.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I have assumed that the honourable senator's question is not intended to refer to the public servants whose work at the Australian National Audit Office includes the audit of Government enterprises. I have assumed he is only concerned with the business of private companies incorporated under the companies legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Auditors of private companies are appointed by members of companies rather than by the corporate regulatory authorities. The role of the company auditor is to report to the members on company financial statements, accounting records and practices, and other finance related matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The closest equivalents to auditors in the corporate regulatory apparatus are the investigators employed by the State and Territory Corporate Affairs Commissions to investigate suspected breaches of the companies legislation by companies and those connected with companies. Such officers are not auditors, but usually hold accounting and/or legal qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA> The Market Supervision Division in the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) is also concerned with supervising the activities of companies, although that Division also has other functions. Further, the practice is that the NCSC does not conduct prosecutions, but rather refers these matters to the Corporate Affairs Commissions.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the various Corporate Affairs Commissions, the Commonwealth Government administers only the Australian Capital Territory Commission. The Commonwealth has no role in relation to the State and Northern Territory Corporate Affairs Commissions.</PARA>
<PARA> There have not been recent increases in the number of investigators employed in the ACT Commission. However, with the establishment of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) as a single national corporate regulator, the Commonwealth Government intends to effect a substantial increase in the resources devoted to corporate regulation, not just in the ACT but throughout Australia. It is currently envisaged that, over the next 4 years, an additional $210m will be spent, representing an increase of 60% over current cooperative scheme funding.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the ACT Corporate Affairs Commission, 12 investigators were employed on 12 October 1990. The total number of staff in the NCSC's Market Supervision Division on that day was 26.5 (though as mentioned above, that Division has a range of functions).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It can be difficult to retain the services of officers experienced in corporate finance because such skills are of considerable value in many areas of the economy. So far, however, this difficulty has not prevented the Commonwealth from employing and retaining sufficient numbers of competent investigators for its purposes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Primary Industries and Energy portfolio was formed in July 1987, as a result of the amalgamation of the Departments of Primary Industry and Resources and Energy and elements of the Department of Trade. Since its inception that Department and other budget funded agencies within the portfolio have entered into one contract with the Roy Morgan Research Centre. In 1988 the National Soil Conservation Program (NSCP) engaged the Roy Morgan Research Centre (RMRC) to undertake an Australia-wide survey to determine the basic level of community awareness of land degradation and soil conservation. Funding for the project was approved from NSCP on the above basis. Information on this study is recorded against (ii).</PARA>
<PARA> Records for the constituent Departments prior to 1987 are sometimes difficult to access in a uniform and consistent form. In October 1980 the then Department of National Development and Energy commissioned Roy Morgan Research Centre (RMRC) Pty Ltd to undertake a consultancy study into the end-use of waste lubricating oil and the potential for its increased recovery. Information on this study is recorded against (i).</PARA>
<PARA> (a) (i) Consultancy survey October 1980</PARA>
<PARA>A contract was made for this proposal. A copy of the specifications has been provided. There was no alteration to the specifications of the proposal after it was entered into, and the scope of the study remained unaltered during the course of the study.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) National Soil Conservation Program (NSCP) 1988 survey</PARA>
<PARA>There was a contract for this survey. The specifications included the timing of the survey, specific questions to be asked, the fee for conducting the survey and providing a written summary report and the timing of payments to the RMRC. At the Department's request it was agreed not to proceed with a written summary report after the survey had been conducted.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) The funds actually expended during the course of the study were $48,000-which was also the recommended level of expenditure agreed to by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) and the then Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) $11,520.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) The commissioned study was put out to tender. The RMRC Pty Ltd tender was selected by the Department of National Development and Energy as the most cost-effective one.</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (j) (i) RMRC was not specifically asked by the Department to provide a computer printout of the survey. The Department relied on the findings of the survey as shown in the report, which are of a factual nature rather than based on interpretation. Therefore technical expertise in interpretation of survey data was not essential.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) RMRC provided the Department with the survey results in a cross-tabulation format. The Department decided not to proceed with having the RMRC prepare a report because the Department felt it could pull out the major findings itself. RMRC offered to check the Department's interpretation at no extra cost, and did. The results were summarised by the Department and disseminated to State soil conservation agencies and other organisations with an interest in soil conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> (k) (i) As part of the information dissemination activities conducted under the NERD&amp; Program, the commissioned study report has been made available publicly on a cost recovery basis. No follow-up action has been initiated.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The results of the survey are to be used by the Commonwealth and State soil conservation agencies as baseline data to monitor the success of programs aimed at increasing community awareness of land degradation and soil conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> (l) (i) The study was initiated by the then Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, who wrote to NERDDC on 27 May 1980 seeking advice on such a study.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The proposal to conduct the survey originally emanated from the Standing Committee on Soil Conservation, who approached the NSCP seeking funding for a national awareness survey. However the Standing Committee subsequently elected not to proceed with it. Subsequently, those administering the National Soil Conservation Program (NSCP) saw a need for national baseline survey data and decided to proceed with the survey. In 1988 the NSCP engaged the Roy Morgan Research Centre to undertake an Australia-wide survey to determine the basic level of community awareness of land degradation and soil conservation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Immediate adjustments are not necessarily made in this situation. For most clients, increases in income received while working for the same employer are unlikely to satisfy the requirements for reassessments set out in the Social Security Act 1947.</PARA>
<PARA>In broad terms, the law requires family allowance entitlements to be adjusted only where taxable income for a current financial year is more than 125% of both:</PARA>
<PARA> * the family allowance income test threshold relevant to that family; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the family's taxable income for the financial year ended in the previous calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also necessary that the increase in income be linked to a ``notifiable event''. For all but a small number of people, whose entitlements are based on an estimate of current financial year income, employees are not required to notify an increase in wages while with the same employer.</PARA>
<PARA> The number of family allowance recipients is about 1.9 million and it would not be productive to require notification of every change in income during the course of the entitlement year. Such a requirement would necessitate, for example, millions of unnecessary contacts each year because of National Wage Case increases. In all but a few cases they would not increase household income over the family allowance income test limits. The administrative overheads of such an arrangement would be significant.</PARA>
<PARA> All entitlements are reviewed towards the end of each calendar year to determine whether payment should continue in the next year and, if so, at what rate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) An increase in wages which is not accompanied by a change of employer could take, on average, about nine months before it was subjected to the family allowance income test provided there was no other change in the family's income situation. In only a small minority of cases, however, the rate of family allowance payable would be affected because of the level of the family allowance income test limits and because the limits are indexed for movements in the Consumer Price Index each January.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This information is not readily available because, for the reasons set out in (l) and (2), most such advices are not relevant to current entitlements. I am not prepared to authorise the considerable expenditure of resources required to collect the data by way of manual inspection of documentation held for 1.9 million clients.</PARA>
