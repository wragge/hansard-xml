<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. On this, the occasion of my first speech to the Senate, I feel very proud and privileged to be elected as a senator for Western Australia. It is a great honour to be part of a team of six Liberal senators representing Australia's largest State. I sincerely thank the people of Western Australia and will endeavour to represent them to the best of my ability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this point, I must also thank the many people who supported me during the election campaign. I would particularly like to acknowledge Jim Sampson, who finally convinced me that I should nominate. I thank the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, and his team of people for their enormous amount of help. I found the orientation seminars extremely useful. As well, I thank Chris Pelzer and the staff in the Department of Administrative Services in Western Australia; our Whip, Senator Reid; and honourable senators for their help and understanding. I congratulate the President, in his absence, on his election. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to define what I see as the role of government. That is to establish policy and provide the infrastructure that is required to facilitate the running and operations of the nation; in particular to create an environment in which individuals can maximise their opportunity. It is not to be involved in business ventures and doing those things which business can perform. It is essential that competition be the cornerstone of our system, so that we can become internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> In my time in the Senate I will concentrate upon the issues which led to my decision to stand for election. That decision was not an easy one. As a farmer-businessman, I find that my life is busy. This has led me to a heavy involvement with the Western Australian Farmers Federation and the National Farmers Federation. From 1973 to 1988, I was an elected member of the executive of the Western Australian Farmers Federation. From 1978 to 1988, I was on the National Farmers Federation council and/or executive. During this time I served as President at the State level and Senior Vice-President at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> My particular interests are in industrial matters, economic management, trade and conservation. In addition, I have served as a director and chairman on a number of boards. I am particularly aware of the difficulties that face us today, not just those that face farmers but of the many that confront an employee, employer, small business and larger corporations. To be more precise, I am alarmed and appalled at the growth in bankruptcies, the imbalance in our trading figures and the ceaseless spiral in interest rates and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly wish to bring to attention Australia's net debt situation in the Association of South East Asian Nations countries. It is a situation that we can hardly be proud of. Unless addressed, it means that the next generation of Australians, for the first time since Federation, will be handed a lower standard of living.  The economy of this country is grinding to a halt. This is the main reason for my decision to seek office as a senator-to influence the direction that the Australian economy must take to recover. Unless we fix the economy, stabilise our debt, reform our taxation and industrial systems and take a much more responsible position on fiscal management, business will not have the resources required to address, in the practical sense, the conservation and environmental requirements of our resource based industries; nor will governments be able to tackle the problems we have with those who are disadvantaged, for whatever the reason; nor will we be able to overcome the problems in our medical institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The next few years are going to be crucial if Australia is not to slide irreversibly into economic oblivion and disaster. Australia cannot be proud of the fact that our credit rating has been cut. Of concern is a continually over-valued Australian dollar. This has been brought about by excessive use of high interest rates with the emphasis on monetary policy and not enough on fiscal policy at Federal, State and local government levels. This overvalued dollar has meant that our export industries have not been able to maximise our export returns. A much tighter fiscal policy with less reliance on monetary policy, and hence a lower dollar, would have allowed our exporters to compete internationally and would have taken pressure off our domestic manufacturing industries against the flood of imports coming into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Excessive taxation and excises, high interest rates, government red tape and an ever increasing national debt are strangling us all. Throughout Australia there would not be a single person who has not felt the effects of the downturn in our economy. This year, 1990, is the start of a new decade. It is our opportunity to stop the ever increasing fall in living standards. The average family is struggling to pay for their home. In fact, the average Western Australian family buying their home is almost $100 a week worse off than they were in 1983. Record interest rates, spiralling inflation and increased housing costs have made the great Australian dream of owning one's own home a nightmare. Home buying families can spend up to a third of their weekly earnings on mortgage repayments, another third on tax, leaving one-third to clothe, feed and educate the family. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 Australia's economic ranking in the world has declined alarmingly. Our foreign debt has increased from $23 billion in March 1983 to a record $124 billion in July of this year. That represents a debt in excess of $7,000 for every man, woman and child-that is, three times that of Argentina and 10 times that of the Philippines. If those countries are considered Third World countries, it poses the question: where do we stand?</PARA>
<PARA> Our current account deficit has reached a new record high-$21.2 billion; a blow-out of 19 per cent or $2.7 billion above the Budget forecast. The prediction for 1991 of $18 billion is, I believe, an underestimate. In the Asian region, we are at the bottom of the economic heap. A recent survey by a business international global consultancy group showed that Australia's debt stands at $US104 billion. The next worst country in Asia is India with $US59 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, our current account deficit is much higher than those of other countries in the Asian region. At present it is running at $US15.2 billion, significantly more than India's, which is once again the second worst off country at $US3.7 billion, and is in a completely different class to Japan's surplus of $US53 billion. The study forecast a gross domestic product growth of 1.5 per cent in 1990 for Australia, the lowest of the 14 countries and just one-sixth of the leader, Thailand, at 9 per cent. It is not only in the Asian region where Australia has fallen behind. Figures released recently by Consensus Economics in Great Britain put Australia second last amongst the top 13 industrial countries in the economic stakes. This is a continuing decline from eleventh to twelfth spot on world rankings. Clearly, this slide has to be arrested. Australia needs to make economic decisions that will have long term beneficial effects on our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to our economic recovery is a taxation system that provides incentive to those who invest and those who are prepared to work harder; an industrial system that allows for enterprise agreements on the ground, one which will encourage them to expand business and join to be more efficient producers. In our current industrial process through the centralised wage-fixing system mediocrity is rewarded, when in fact it is those who perform who should get the rewards. </PARA>
<PARA> To put Australia back on the road to economic recovery we need to take the imposts off the backs of our efficient industries, effectively reform the waterfront and transport industries, take steps to make our manufacturing industries efficient, and put a stop to the many ridiculous work practices which strangle our performance. For example, in Asian ports they move more than 60 containers an hour; in Europe, approximately 35; in Australia, on a good day, they move 20. In Singapore a ship can be turned around in less than 24 hours. The same ship in Sydney can take up to 14 days. In Australia it costs approximately $220 for a bale of wool to be stored for a year. Overseas it costs approximately $120 per bale. I cannot accept that our costs have to be double those of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> To become internationally competitive it is essential also that we address immediately the problems of high levels of protection in a number of our industries, particularly textile, clothing and footwear and the motor car industry. Protection has a very damaging effect on our export industries and import competing industries. This is highlighted in the Garnaut report. But in particular I want to bring to the attention of the Senate the impact that protection has on families, especially low income families. The average cost per family of protection in the textile industry is in excess of $400 per annum. The cost of protection for each pair of shoes a family buys is in the order of $30 a pair. Recently when I was in Thailand I bought six pairs of leather shoes for a total cost of $96. In Australia similar shoes would have cost in excess of $100 a pair. </PARA>
<PARA> The featherbedding that has developed in many of our industries in the past 40 to 50 years has run its course. It is not compatible to have a deregulated financial system and yet continue with a regulated industrial system, protection for inefficient industries, a regulated transport system and a regulated waterfront. Australia must learn to compete across the full spectrum of industries. The fact is that if one interferes with the realities of the marketplace, that is, supply and demand, in the end the bubble will burst. In our case the bubble is our spiralling national debt and our current account deficit. Without effective competition in the marketplace across the full spectrum, our economic slide will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most serious indications of the decline in our economy is evident in small business. It is now a daily occurrence for small businessmen to be driven into giving up the fight, closing their doors and becoming just another statistic. Bankruptcies have risen by 11 per cent since 1985, forcing an average of six businesses a day to admit defeat. The Australian public has been told repeatedly that government policy on interest rates will benefit them in the long run, with a lower deficit and better balance of trade. That has not happened. The deficit is a ball and chain around the necks of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said previously, the current account deficit stands at $21.2 billion, of which 75 per cent is interest repayments to service Australia's net foreign debt of $124 billion. So $3 out of every $4 is paid on interest repayments. Consequently, our current account deficit is ballooning. These figures clearly show that Australia is caught in a debt trap with no visible means of escape. I will forgive honourable senators if they think that this speech is an economic lecture rather than a maiden speech but, as I said at the outset, certain issues led to my decision to stand for Parliament. I cannot, in all honesty, stand idly by and not appeal to all levels of government to accept that hard decisions have to be made that will, in effect, address our debt problems and rejuvenate our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter from what side of the political spectrum one comes, the impact, unless addressed, will be that Australia will not be effective with conservation, environmental or social policy. Outside politics it sometimes seems that the politicians do not understand what it is like to have lost a job, to battle with a home or business mortgage, to have a teenage son or daughter trying to find a job, or to have a farm or business disappear because of a forced sale. Having been recently elected to this place, being a farmer/businessman, and having been a shearer for 17 years in order to establish that business, I have a clear understanding of the economic pressures that are facing Australians today and I intend to highlight to all honourable senators, as often as is necessary, those problems and uncertainties. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to effectively address our economic problems, it is essential that we capitalise more effectively on our trading opportunities. As I have already stated, this means that our domestic manufacturing industries must be competitive. Talking of value-adding to our raw materials is pie in the sky unless we are internationally competitive. In order to maximise the performance of our producers in the trade arena, we must have economic and industrial systems that are compatible with those of our competitors. We must continue, through the Cairns group, to keep pressure on those countries, particularly the United States and Europe, to reduce the high levels of support which the taxpayers of those countries provide for their respective industries. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also pursue relentlessly the Asian opportunity. In Asia an economy the size of Japan's is growing every 18 months. It is predicted that this will continue for at least 30 years. It is in this area that Australia's trading future lies. To take advantage of it we must out-compete other countries around the world. It is only through maximising these opportunities that we can expand our net export performance in order, firstly, to stabilise our debt and then to start reducing it. In this effort there can be no complacency, nor can there be any tolerance of inefficient performance or work practices. We must maximise the comparative advantage we enjoy over many other countries and we must develop trading agreements which will, in fact, allow us to lower the cost of living in Australia and hence begin to improve our living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other issues on which I would like to talk in detail, but there is not time. These include the issue of foreign policy, and I support very strongly the stance taken by the Federal Government in conjunction with other countries of the United Nations in regard to the situation in Iraq. It is essential that when a country plays the big bully the rest of the world effectively says `no'. It is also important that the cost of applying sanctions be borne by the total community and not by a few industries or individuals. Steps must be taken to ensure that those affected by the sanctions imposed on Iraq are effectively compensated and the additional costs, because of the decision made, alleviated. In this case it is particularly important to our wheat industry because it has provided 96 per cent of our total exports to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Our foreign aid policy needs to be closely scrutinised to make sure that those countries we are targeting to assist are, in fact, receiving the benefits. Our social welfare programs need to be targeted so that those who are genuinely disadvantaged or unable to help themselves can get the assistance. I believe that those people who can afford to pay or help themselves should pay their own way and not be a drain on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a need to seriously address whether the regime of unemployment benefits that has developed over the years is in fact self-defeating, because I believe we now have a percentage of the community who think that society owes them a living, when the reverse is the case. I believe that our current health care program is in grave danger of collapsing. The waiting time at public hospitals is quite frightening. The emphasis has to be switched back to private health cover. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance to Aboriginal people must be based on allowing them to develop commercial independence as individuals. Without this they will not regain their dignity or their cultural identity and return to being the proud people they were many years ago. Our immigration policy must be based on what is best for Australia. Race, creed or colour has no place in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no regard for those who choose to operate above and beyond the law to achieve their ends. In effect, this is holding the country to ransom. I was involved in a number of precedent-setting cases in the industrial arena whilst I was Chairman of the National Farmers Federation industrial committee. I place on public record that this also included successful legal actions against businesses and governments because they were operating outside the law. To adopt any other position is, in effect, endorsing anarchy. I do not care whether it is an individual, a union, an employer organisation, a business, a government, or the judiciary-a person or body that breaks the law should be made accountable through our legal systems. There are many other issues that I could raise, but I believe what I have said will outline, without a shadow of doubt, where I stand in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to end my first speech on the issue of conservation, the protection of the environment and sustainable industry development. It is important that this matter be dealt with in a practical, constructive manner and not in some romantic way which allows policy to be developed by people who scream from the treetops yet have little understanding of the dynamics that make up a society and allow a profitable economy. Without a thriving, profitable economy which maximises employment opportunities, I do not believe that the conservation environmental issues will be effectively addressed. Industry will be forced into a survivalist strategy rather than being able to develop a long term sustainable position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important that the Landcare program, which has been developed throughout Australia, be resourced in a manner which allows it, in conjunction with land users, to protect and sustain our basic resource-the soil. I point out to the Senate that this program was started by amendments to the Soil Conservation Act in Western Australia in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very proud to state that the decision to amend the Soil Conservation Act in Western Australia was taken after a meeting between me, in my capacity as land use spokesman for the Western Australian Farmers Federation, and the Hon. Dick Old who was the coalition Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia at the time. In saying this, I am not claiming that we alone were responsible for the push at the time to have an Act which facilitated a progressive Landcare program. That decision which, in essence, set up the structure of soil conservation and district committees is now the Landcare model that is being developed throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that by the end of this year more than 85 per cent of agricultural and pastoral areas in Western Australia will have soil conservation districts operating. An important feature of this program is that it is industry driven by the land users themselves with the total backing of the Division of Resource Management, which is an arm of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia is very fortunate to have a man of the calibre of Dr Graham Robertson, who heads up this division. I must emphasise that, as this program develops, it is essential that it stay under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture and the responsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australian farmers planted more than 12 million trees last year and put in many kilometres of contour lines, interceptor drains and drainage systems. It is estimated that some 20 million trees will be planted on farms this year. The emphasis must be on covering the full spectrum of wind and water erosion and salinity control. In other States, as I understand it, the program is developing along similar lines. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a fundamental concern that the manpower resources required of researchers and scientists are not sufficient to meet the demand for essential research and extension that will be required to maximise the results of this program. It is, therefore, my intention to move, in the very near future, for an inquiry to conduct a thorough study of the resource requirements-both private and government-to maximise the benefits of this program. </PARA>
<PARA> A second major initiative in Western Australia is the integration of commercial trees into farming practice. This will have significant environmental benefits- particularly with the lowering of the water table, which will reduce salinity-and will also help to stabilise farm incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, following extensive community participation, a timber strategy and forest management plan was adopted. I wish to acknowledge Dr Syd Shea, the Executive Director of the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia, who was the driving force behind this plan. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that in recent years in Western Australia over 50 million trees have been planted. Western Australia has increased its forest conservation estate by 340 per cent; timber royalties have increased by up to 400 per cent; and woodchip royalties have increased by 500 per cent. In the southern forest the cut-over area has been reduced by 40 per cent and there has been an increase of 500 per cent in the southern conservation estate. This demonstrates that we can have a sustainable timber industry and satisfy the environmental requirements by stabilising and increasing the forest conservation estate. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the concerns of the people who have been parked in trucks around this place this week, if similar timber strategy and forest management plans could be developed in other States, their aspirations, and the aspirations of the opposing forces, could well both be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to thank honourable senators for the courtesy they have given me in delivering my maiden speech. I emphasise that the challenge we have before us is to make those hard decisions that are required to stabilise our debt and then to start reducing it. </PARA>
<PARA> We must maximise our export performance-which needs to be increased by 4 per cent net per annum during the 1990s-so we can stabilise our debt situation, and allow us to put Australia on the road to regain our position as an economic performer when measured against other countries in the world. It is then, and only then, that as a nation we will be able to tackle our other policy areas effectively. This will not be easy, but if we are not prepared to tackle it we will be negligent, not only towards our forefathers, who were the pioneers of this country, but also towards our children, because we would have passed to them decisions that we did not have the courage to make ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In assessing the Hawke Government's eighth Budget one must forcibly remind oneself that economic activity should not be an end in itself but that it should be, indeed, the means to achieve people's aspirations. This Budget, however, carefully avoids charting a positive direction. It confirms once again the ideological commitment of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to leave all decisions to the marketplace which takes no account of social and environmental values, or the long term consequences of ignoring them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that, as a community, we must integrate social, environmental and economic objectives and, further, that the community is entitled to expect that the government of the day will intervene to achieve such integrated objectives. Instead, the Treasurer has continued once again his ideological commitment to deregulation. There is no direction, let alone a vision for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> This abdication of the responsibility to govern on behalf of the people of Australia is, unfortunately, shared by the coalition parties. It is little wonder that Dr Hewson's response to the Budget was largely devoid of any substantive critique on specific revenue and expenditure items. In fact, it is no wonder that Dr Hewson has refused at least two media invitations to discuss the Australian Labor Party's privatisation program. He would have had to congratulate Mr Keating for implementing the policies of the New Right. The truth is that the Opposition agrees with the Government and supports the push to sacrifice the public benefit on the altar of private greed. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the coalition parties agree with the Government's Budget and that the Democrats are now the only real opposition and the only party to offer a genuine alternative to the Government's sell-out. </PARA>
<PARA> This non-Budget contains real spending increases of 0.6 per cent, and real revenue is budgeted to rise by 0.4 per cent, indicating a slight reduction in the planned surplus as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with last year and, superficially, `a steady as she goes' approach. But some of the increased expenditure, particularly in social security, is due to the country's declining economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is likely to get worse. The recent jump in unemployment by a further 43,000 indicates that the Government has underestimated the harvest its high interest rate policy is delivering. The social result of this strategy does not seem to have entered the equation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's housing portfolio Budget allocation has been cut by over 10 per cent in real terms, largely due to the axing of the first home owners scheme. Yet defence spending is forecast to be maintained in real terms. Our involvement in the Persian Gulf will no doubt blow out this particular estimate even further. So what sorts of priorities does this Government have? The Democrats' alternative budget details a real boost of 20 per cent to public housing which can be more than offset by economies of some $800m in the Defence portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign aid is to remain at the scandalously low level of 0.3 per cent of GDP, well short of the United Nations target figure of 0.7 per cent of GDP. This is a national disgrace and shows that Australia is years behind the rest of the world in its strategic defence thinking. It is also a matter which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is now prepared to acknowledge is indeed a national shame. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the increase in this Budget in research into alternative energy sources which the current oil crisis demands? Instead, the Government grants concessions to the petroleum resource rent tax (RRT) to continue our dependence on fossil fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> These examples are indicative of the thrust of Government policy: the public sector must be squeezed irrespective of the needs of the community, the needs of forward thinking or the aspirations of its citizens. We are harvesting the results of this inaction in poor public transport, inadequate environmental policies, perpetuation of poverty, inadequate health and education facilities, and a poorly regulated financial system which enriches the fast, smart operators at the expense of pensioners and low income earners, who lose their life savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government does have the duty to identify and rectify problems as they confront the Australian community. It is simply not good enough to draw an arbitrary line beyond which public spending cannot go and then arrange priorities to fit within that self-imposed straightjacket, no matter what is neglected. But this does not mean that fiscal policy should be loosened-far from it. Our alternative budget proposals do identify over $4 billion worth of badly needed expenditure items. However, that is only one side of the coin. It is the revenue side which the Treasurer should bolster, and the Australian Democrats will be pleased to assist the Government in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> High income earners should face more sharply progressive income taxation rates. All tax avoidance rorts should be crushed once and for all, and some form of wealth taxation should be introduced. We have shown that the extra revenue could and should be raised. More than $7 billion is identified in our alternative proposals which, coupled with our increased spending proposals, would deliver a further $3 billion surplus, or one per cent of GDP, which could be used to bring down interest rates and to achieve an exchange rate which enables our export industries to genuinely compete on the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> This is crucial to a fair economic strategy. The Australian Democrats believe that the burden of national economic development should be related to the capacity to pay; it should not rest on the indiscriminate basis of whether somebody is borrowing funds to buy a house or develop a small business. </PARA>
<PARA> We are an extremely low taxed country by international standards. Disregarding Turkey, we rank second lowest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in terms of taxation as a percentage of GDP. The only country below us is the United States of America, and it must be remembered that the United States has a huge Federal Government fiscal deficit, whereas we enjoy an historically high surplus. If those in the corporate sector continue to argue for further cuts to community services to get taxes down, we could suggest that they should start at their end, for instance, by removing tax deductability for salaries above $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that the current push towards privatisation must be viewed. If anything demonstrates lack of vision and bankruptcy of intellectual analysis, it is the absolute faith in the private sector to do things better on every occasion. The fact is that there is absolutely no evidence to support such a contention. Its idea of the national interest is to ensure that any profitable public sector business is sold to the Government's mates and any consumer service obligation is simply left to lapse because it is not profitable. Yet the Commonwealth Bank, last month's victim, shows a better return on funds than its private competitors. Similarly, OTC Ltd shows a rate of return in excess of those achieved in the private sector and, according to OECD figures, delivers the cheapest overseas telephone calls in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare that with the performance of the Bonds, the Skases and the Lowys, who managed to ruin a thriving television industry in a takeover spree lasting years. Compare that with at least $8 billion in non-performing loans in the private banking sector for which Australian families are now paying the bill. Then consider whether we can still say that private sector management is inherently more effective and efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system is to be sold to the private sector despite the fact that it is a monopoly and can be used to hold gas consumers to ransom. Right now the Government is attempting to get around its contractual obligations to push up transmission costs to increase the pipeline's market price, a somewhat unedifying spectacle at the expense of private and industrial gas consumers in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the introduction of market principles, the users of telecommunications services in the United States and the United Kingdom are faced with price increases well in excess of the consumer price index. It will be no different here if the Treasurer cannot be stopped. Higher executive salaries, higher borrowing costs and the constant need to show short term profits will all be reflected in higher costs to the consumer. Meanwhile we retire debt at today's prices and give up a growing stream of revenue for future generations and a stake in strategic public interest industries like telecommunications and banking. Imagine the value today of significant Commonwealth involvement in the oil and aluminium industries. This was irrevocably terminated by the privatisation decisions of the Menzies Administration in 1953. </PARA>
<PARA> The community is seeking long term vision from its elected representatives, not short term Budget-driven decisions. The Treasurer's failure to lift revenue means that there is still an over-reliance on monetary policy despite his desperate pleas to the banks to drop rates. The one question to be asked here is: When will the Treasurer stop jawboning and refer the banks to the Prices Surveillance Authority to check their margins?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy was in a similar position in the early 1950s. Excess demand contributed to a blow-out in the current account of similar proportions to the one currently facing us. The policy response was to increase taxation to stabilise this demand. Depending upon the type of taxation method utilised, this is a much more equitable method of demand restraint and certainly does not squeeze home buyers or cripple small business. </PARA>
<PARA> The other depressing aspect of the Budget was the total inaction on the continued decline in public infrastructure. This is happening while our cities are falling to bits and more people are joining the unemployment queues. The Australian people are seeking more and better services and it is they who deserve attention rather than the financiers. It is heartening to hear that at least one senior Government Minister shares this concern about the need for urban renewal. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the expenditure measures, we find some slight increases in various portfolios, but most also include some unfortunate policy decisions. In the health area, for example, the $2.50 pensioner prescription fee and the increase in the maximum patient contribution fee are regrettable and will be opposed by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to deem that certain deposits held by pensioners in financial institutions earn the minimum rate of interest of 10 per cent is symptomatic of the attitude of this Government-hit the poor, the pensioners and the low income earners. The emphasis should be on ending the effective subsidy which this arrangement has granted to the banks and other institutions, rather than putting pressure on an estimated 300,000 pensioners, arguably the most vulnerable section of our community. Many will not be able to rearrange their affairs, either through ignorance of the rules or a misunderstanding of their effect and will consequently face a cut in their pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have announced their proposal to ensure that the banks, rather than the pensioners, should bear the burden of this provision. Our alternative proposal is for the Government to legislate to compel the financial institutions to pay at least the deemed rate of return on the appropriate deposits of pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support the significant boost to corporate legislation that the Australian Securities Commission will provide. We will urge the Government to be unrelenting in its pursuit of corporate criminals. There are still many deficiencies in the legislation. For example, public company reporting must be improved by increasing the frequency of profit and loss statements and balance sheets; by the standardisation of all key financial indicators; by mandatory cash flow reporting; by much stricter disclosure regarding related party transactions and management fees paid to companies owned by directors; by the licensing of independent experts and the availability of class actions for share or unit holders. The Government must address these matters as a matter of urgency. Mr Hartnell's recent announcement on the range of amendments related to directors' responsibilities, unit trusts and insider trading is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Treasurer's failure to block tax avoidance loopholes, Commonwealth revenue is predicted to increase to more than $100 billion for the first time. This is a big Budget and it does contain some good news. Following the laudable measures to exclude full rate pensioners from the tax system altogether, part rate pensioners are now completely outside the provision of the tax system. This is a worthwhile achievement and one supported by the Democrats. However, this does not complete the total integration of the tax and social security systems for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer announced in last year's Budget that part rate pensioners would be completely exempt from taxation by 1995 and we will certainly keep him to that promise, but why must pensioners wait five years for this reform? If the Treasurer adopted some of our anti-tax avoidance proposals he would be able to achieve this reform much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we are also dismayed at some revenue measures. The proposed relaxation of the resource rent tax is alarming. By relaxing the strict permit area test that currently applies at a cost of $35m, the economic rent derived from the exploitation of the resources is in danger of escaping appropriate taxation. We concede that in the long term the switch to include Bass Strait in the RRT regime may well be revenue positive, but in current straitened circumstances the concessional treatment of exploration expenditure should have been funded by increasing the rate of the resource rent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the proposal to further weaken the new taxation of foreign source income rules is both unnecessary and indefensible. When times are as tight as the Government says they are, there should be no concessions to the international corporate sector. How favourable tax treatment to foreign buildings and industrial property can be part of a Budget that slugs chronically ill patients is something a Labor Government will have to explain, if it can. </PARA>
<PARA> The imputation and bad debts proposals are welcome, yet long overdue. The possible double dipping on overseas bad debts by financial institutions arises purely from a drafting oversight. Such technical problems arise frequently and are often exploited by scheming lawyers and accountants. This shows the need for an annual income tax technical corrections Act, as is the practice in the United States, to reverse such unintended consequences of new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisional tax anti-avoidance measure appears reasonable yet unnecessary as the income involved should have been subject to pay as you earn provisions and to penalty tax in the case of non-compliance. The zone rebate review, although limited, has identified and remedied some anomalies in the rebate and the decisions taken are supported. The decision to abolish the distinction between rebates available to residents residing in the special areas of zones A and B is a worthwhile simplification. One reprehensible measure, however, is the proposal to slash the value of the medical expenses rebate by nearly 30 per cent. The concession provides a vital safety net to ensure that taxpayers will not be bankrupted by huge medical expenses which they must meet personally. We will be pressing the Government to reconsider this harsh decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax rollover proposals concerning assets destroyed by natural disasters and temporary absence from a principal residence represent sensible decisions and are supported. However, in another area the review of income tax treatment of environmental related expenses is still not complete, holding up urgent reforms in that area. The completion of that review is keenly anticipated. Small business has no cause to be impressed with the Government's token response to the recommendations of the Beddall committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. However, the limited progress with respect to the timing of tax remittances is welcome. Apart from the need for immediate interest rate relief, the Government must introduce measures to protect small business lessees under the Trade Practices Act, to improve advisory services for small business, and to simplify the tax system as well as the other matters addressed in the Beddall committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we have been offered a Budget which fails to deal with any of the big challenges facing Australia today. It makes no attempt to increase the capacity of individuals to lead more independent, useful and active lives. For that we would have needed better access to education for all and an increase in the free income limits for pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no attempt to move us closer to the clever society. A substantial increase in the funds for scientific and postgraduate research would have been a good start. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no serious attempt to conserve energy or to change from cars and trucks to rail and public transport. This would require a national rail system and more funds for public transport, financed by a higher fuel excise and a road freight levy on trucks. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that the environment is more than a token issue for the Treasurer. To tackle the challenges here would involve land care, endangered species and habitat restoration programs and firm targets for the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide emissions and also an international rainforest protection fund. Yet none of these are in this Budget to any effective degree. </PARA>
<PARA> There are few measures designed to help business play its part. Trade training, export market development, reduced interest rates and a stronger Trade Practices Act would all have made a start. Finally, there is no sign that the Treasurer is aware that his high interest rate policy has failed and that we need a higher surplus to reduce both the exchange rate and the cost of finance. The money for these and other urgently needed measures to ensure we move towards a socially stable, economically active and environmentally sound society could have come from plugging 22 tax avoidance loopholes, yielding some $2,600m; from taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations who are not now paying their way, yielding $2,085m; and from indirect tax increases, imposed on a selective basis, yielding $1,980m. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Labor Government has to resort to targeting pensioners, students, families and public assets to balance the books whilst there is still great injustice and inequality in our society, is it any wonder that more and more the public cannot distinguish between the major political parties and turn to the Australian Democrats for an alternative which is fair and just. It is an alternative which is also feasible, as the Democrats alternative Budget proposals have shown. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This first report of the Committee contains one disclaimer from a member who was unable to attend any meetings of the Committee, and dissenting reports from five other Committee members. Before outlining the proposals in the report, I should like to make some introductory comments. The Committee was established by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand MP, with a wide ranging brief to consider changes to the Migration Act and regulations, and any other matter referred by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> As a priority the Committee decided to examine the difficult and sensitive issue of illegal entrants, given the pending end of the limited concessionary arrangements on 1 June and 30 June this year. These concessionary arrangements require illegals to, first, leave Australia, thereby not incurring any time penalty should they wish to reapply immediately for entry to Australia; or, secondly, apply to regularise their status on spouse or economic grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> This deadline was perceived by the Committee to create serious problems of implementation for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs of any recommendations requiring amendment and of potential injustice to some of those affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, upon deciding on this inquiry, considered that it could be thought to be unfair if some people were required to leave after 30 June and before the Committee had an opportunity to examine the problem and present a report of its findings to the Parliament. The Chairman of the Committee wrote to the Minister on 20 June this year arguing that, while not wishing to encourage illegal entrants currently here to remain, the Committee was seeking further evidence in respect of these matters, and therefore requested an extension of time beyond the current 1 June and 30 June dates until 30 September 1990 for the concessionary arrangements now applicable and for voluntary departure without re-entry restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister agreed to extend the concessionary period until 31 October 1990 and, in doing so, emphasised that this would be the final deadline. At this point I must emphasise that the amended Act and regulations came into effect on 19 December last year. The new regime was effective from that date and not, as has been reported, from 31 October this year. A very limited concession was introduced on 15 January 1990 and extended several times to finish finally on 31 October. I said `a very limited concession' because very few people qualify to remain under the concessionary arrangements. Those who can qualify do so on spouse or economic grounds and if the Minister is satisfied that there are compelling reasons for the grant of a permit. </PARA>
<PARA> The numbers applying to take advantage of the concessionary arrangements are low. However, the concession does not extend to those people here illegally and who choose to leave prior to 31 October 1990 who will not incur a time penalty should they choose to re-apply for entry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee further determined that it would report as early as possible in September in order to give the Minister and Cabinet adequate time to consider the report and to draft any necessary legislative amendments. The Committee members now recognise that this extremely tight reporting deadline has imposed severe and near impossible constraints on the Committee, particularly its secretariat and our adviser. The Committee is of the view that, if it is required to meet such severe time constraints in the future, we will have to determine guidelines that are more reasonable. The resources presently allocated to the Committee are not adequate to meet such tight schedules. Even without the severe deadlines, the issue that the Committee has been formed to examine, migration regulations, is extremely complex and detailed and the Committee is therefore deserving of resources adequate to the task. </PARA>
<PARA> Widespread interest has been shown in the inquiry, with over 90 submissions having been received. The Committee held public hearings in Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney and consulted with a large number of community groups as well as the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Australia's migration laws have been developed to control the entry and stay of non-citizens in Australia. There is, therefore, a need to maintain the Government's migration program within predetermined levels and to facilitate the removal of persons who are either illegally in Australia or whose presence in Australia is not in the best interests of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is also a need to consider some of the cases of those people here illegally prior to 19 December 1989 when the law changed so dramatically and where it can be shown that their case merits consideration. The Committee does not condone or encourage illegality as a backdoor entry to permanent entry to Australia. It supports the efforts of the Government and the Department to, firstly, minimise current levels of illegal entry and, secondly, prevent a future problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances a majority of the Committee believes that some limited opportunity should be made available for a small proportion of the total number of illegals to regularise their status. The majority report is concerned with some of these people who may be innocently illegal-those who have a compelling compassionate case or those who have been absorbed into Australian society for at least five years and can show that they have made a substantial contribution to Australia. It is suggested that a limited window of opportunity would encourage people to come forward before 31 October and would help to minimise the extent of the illegal twilight society. </PARA>
<PARA> A majority of the Committee believes that the main way of dealing with the problem of long term illegal immigrants generally is by empowering the Immigration Review Tribunal to consider applications from illegal immigrants who come forward or who are apprehended before 31 October this year. It is suggested that, in the case of innocent illegals, the Tribunal be empowered to make recommendations to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, but in all other cases to be able to make a determination. </PARA>
<PARA> A special category of people which the Committee is particularly concerned about is those people who are now illegal or who in the future may become illegal through no fault of their own. The Committee is unanimous in its concern about this particular category of people, the innocent illegals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that people can become illegal entrants even if they are honest in their dealings with immigration staff, have no knowledge of their illegality, or have no intention of becoming an illegal. Certain children born or residing in Australia fall into this category. The Committee argues that an innocent illegal should have the opportunity to regularise his or her status. </PARA>
<PARA> All members of the Committee, with the exception of myself, are of the view that the Immigration Review Tribunal should consider the cases of innocent illegals and other cases of compassion. An expanded role for the Tribunal is therefore recommended. The majority of the Committee further recommends that illegal entrants should be able to apply to the Tribunal where they:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) believe themselves to be an innocent illegal immigrant, as defined in chapter 3; or,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) meet the following conditions:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) have been in Australia for at least five years prior to 31 October 1990 (that is arrived in Australia prior to 31 October 1985) and are able to present evidence demonstrating this fact; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) have come forward and presented themselves to the registrar of the Immigration Review Tribunal before 31 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>In making its determination, the Tribunal will take note of the following relevant circumstances which are adopted from British immigration rules: age, length of residence in Australia, strength of connections with Australia, personal history including character, conduct and employment record, domestic circumstances, compassionate circumstances, and any representations received on the person's behalf. A major issue of concern to the whole Committee which particularly affects innocent illegals is the requirement in regulation 42 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Where an applicant for an entry permit is illegal, that application has been lodged not more than 12 months after becoming illegal. </PARA>
<PARA>Innocent illegals are predominantly children or those who are unaware of their illegal status. The illegality may not be discovered until many years after the time they became illegal, yet they will be caught by regulation 42, no matter what their circumstances may be. The Committee has recommended in chapter 5 of its report that a provision for a waiver of the time period for lodgment of an application in appropriate circumstances be incorporated into the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> On pages 73 and 74 of the report, an assessment is given of the total number likely to be successful in an application to remain in Australia if this process is adopted. Of the 90,000 illegal entrants presently in Australia, between 3,000 and 4,000 may be able to stay. The majority report rejects the argument that this concession will establish a precedent and that people will be encouraged to hide away for five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the Government must demonstrate that it is serious about enforcing the 31 October deadline. It must publicise the fact and, in doing so, encourage people to come forward by that date. It should point out that they will suffer penalties and that no further concessions will be available in the future. It is because of the severity of the scheme after 31 October 1990 that the majority of the Committee has recommended that this one-off concession be made. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of those senators who served on the Committee, I want to express gratitude to Dr Kathryn Cronin, the legal consultant to the Committee. Dr Cronin's dedication, professionalism and expertise were highly valued by the Committee. I would also like to thank the staff of the secretariat, Robina Mills and Heidi Quinlan. Members of the Committee recognise the work they have done in the last few weeks in order that this report could reach the Parliament at an early date.</PARA>
<PARA> It might be more appropriate to apologise to Kathryn, Robina and Heidi and their respective families for the enormous pressure we have put upon them in the recent past. The fact that the report has been delivered on time is a real identification of their commitment and loyalty to the Parliament and the Committee. This loyalty required long hours of work that severely intruded into their personal lives. This would have placed intolerable strains on their families. I reinforce the earlier comment that the Committee is under-resourced and request that the matter be addressed at an early date. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of this speech, the Committee was divided in its conclusions. We were divided across party lines, between the two Houses and between parties. We were forced to take sides. After much deliberation and soul searching, I came down on the side of people who seek to enter Australia by legal means. As a representative of Western Australia, I felt that I had an obligation to represent the views of constituents in my State who were desperately seeking to have family members join them in this wonderful country. I came down against those who abuse our laws and treat our migration system with contempt. I do not agree that law-breakers should be given advantage over those who comply with the laws and treat the system with respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat the quote in the introduction to chapter 2 of the Committee's report:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's immigration system limits the number of immigrant visas available. There is a long waiting list of applicants seeking migrant entry. For each immigrant who secures a visa by fraud or each illegal entrant permitted to remain, other qualified applicants may be left behind or left to wait longer for a visa. Illegal immigration severely taxes resources of immigration staff and may undermine the political resolve needed to maintain an expansive immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA>I make no apologies for repeating this quote. I quoted the paragraph twice in my dissenting report, and I will repeat it again and again during the debate on the illegal entrant question. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>For each immigrant who secures a visa by fraud or each illegal entrant permitted to remain, other qualified applicants may be left behind or left to wait longer for a visa. </PARA>
<PARA>That sentence is a very important statement, and it was an unanimous statement of the Committee. Honourable senators should remember the preceding sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a long waiting list of applicants seeking migrant entry. </PARA>
<PARA>It was the meaning and intent of these sentences and this paragraph that encouraged me not to agree with the majority report to create and open up another can of worms in immigration. I call the Committee's recommendation on the Immigration Review Tribunal only a can of worms. I do that because of the respect in which I hold my Committee colleagues. But I suspect that constituents, residents and citizens of Australia will use much stronger language when they hear and fully comprehend the recommendations of the majority of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I warn the Senate and the people of Australia not to be misled by the low estimation given by the Committee that only 3,000 to 4,000 illegals will be allowed to settle under its proposal. The figure could be much higher, and honourable senators can be assured that it will grow in future years as the precedent for absorption becomes enshrined once again in our system. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether it is fair or equal, just or moral, illegals will come to accept that if they stay hidden for five years, or however many years is determined, they will look for a reward. That reward will be permanent residency in this country. It will be a reward given at the expense of a person who waits patiently in a queue in Bombay, Athens, Moscow, London, Harare, Beirut, Seoul, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Rome, Washington or even Dublin, or from wherever potential migrants to Australia will apply. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think the Hobart people are doing very well. I thank Senator Cooney for his interjection. Honourable senators should remember that those people in cities right across the world are competing for places in a smaller pool. The migrant intake for 1991 has been reduced by 10 per cent from last year's level. There are now only 126,000 places available. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs supplied the Committee with evidence that some 90,000 illegals are currently in this country. Relative to Australia's total population, that figure could be considered to be tiny. However, put in its proper perspective, it represents nearly 75 per cent of the annual intake of migrants and makes one realise that Australia is experiencing a major problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 90,000 figure that I use is the one provided to the Committee by the Department. According to the Department's calculation it represents the number of illegals in Australia at 30 April this year. The figure for July last year was 60,000. I am aware that the Department's figures have been questioned in other places by other authorities. There are those who put the current figure as high as 150,000. For the purpose of this debate I shall accept the Department's figures and use the official figures to highlight the 30,000 increase that occurred between July of last year and April this year. That amazing increase of 50 per cent occurred during only nine months under what the Committee Chairman, Dr Theophanous, described as a tough regime and during what was again described by the Chair as the biggest round-up of illegals since the war. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently in Australia there are 90,000 people who do not believe they live under a tough regime and they are not scared off by a round-up. They just think it is a joke and they treat the rules and laws with contempt. They do not believe the Government's strong words. As I said on page 3 of my dissenting report, the initial concessions and the three later extensions since granted have been interpreted as a lack of resolve on behalf of the Government to implement its tough provisions on apprehension, detention and deportation. Illegals know that sections of the media will sensationalise deportation stories when they inevitably happen. Graphic coverage has been provided in the past. Sometimes those stories generate public sympathy, and some illegals and a variety of organisations have sought to pressure the Government not to proceed with its actions in regard to deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past illegals have sought to use this pressure and gain sympathy to remain here. It is undoubtedly a powerful tool to use against whichever government is in office at the time, and there is no doubt that that pressure is keenly felt by many people, including the local member of parliament. Those people, now 90,000 in total, were told in December 1988-nearly two years ago-that the Government was going to crack down on the illegal entrants problem. The then Minister for Immigration gave illegals a clear and unambiguous warning that the Government was going to tighten the provisions. He said he would adopt measures consistent with the recommendations of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies-the FitzGerald report. In recommendation 54, which was presented to the Parliament more than two years ago, Dr FitzGerald said:</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who is illegally in Australia by unauthorised stay beyond the expiry of a visa or by illegal entry should forfeit the right to apply for immigration while here or be automatically rejected if they have already applied. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the recommendation made to the Government by Dr FitzGerald after an intensive inquiry. Those illegals, who now number at least 90,000, did not believe it. In fact they directly challenge the Government. They do not accept that the Government has the right-indeed the obligation-to determine Australia's immigration program. They as individuals decide for themselves who can come to Australia and who should remain here. They challenge the integrity of our immigration system. They should not be given any advantage over other potential migrants who pursue the proper course of action. The proposal to allow illegals, albeit a small number, access to the Immigration Review Tribunal is ill-conceived and ill-considered. It gives long term offenders an advantage over other people and it has the potential to choke and stifle the work of the Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the Government accepts the proposal, I have grave doubts that the machinery necessary to implement the proposal could be put in place by 31 October. Even if this could be achieved, a major publicity campaign would need to be mounted in order to ensure that all illegals are aware of the further concession. I suggest that such a campaign should be engaged in, but for a different purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> In my dissenting report I recommend that the Government use all methods of communication with all sections of the media. I make particular reference to the ethnic and foreign language media, although I do not want to point the finger at any particular nationality which may be currently abusing our system. It is of note that, according to the Department's figures, the major abusers of this system actually come from the United Kingdom rather than a country which, perhaps, does not have such close links with Australia. I am not necessarily pointing the finger at any particular ethnic body or nation, but it will be important for every sector of the community, even those people who do not speak or understand English, to be aware of what the Government intends to do in just over six weeks when the final deadline of 31 October is reached. All illegals and their supporters-and there are many of them, judging from the evidence the Committee received during its inquiry-should be aware that the Government will crack down. Government must engage in this publicity campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report was tabled in the other place on Tuesday of this week and since its tabling I have been heartened by the commendations that I have received for the remarks in my dissenting report. Those commendations, I might add, did not come only from colleagues in my own political party, the Labor Party; they also came from my parliamentary colleagues from other political parties as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased to note that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) is now calling upon the Government to crack down on illegals. The ACTU is particularly concerned with those who are here illegally and are working. According to estimates that the Department gave to the Committee during the inquiry, I would guess that some 60,000 illegals are further compounding their illegal status in Australia by engaging in full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of illegals is a huge one for Australia. Of greater concern is the fact that it is a growing problem, judging from statistics that the Department gave to the Committee. I highlight the fact that there is some dissent concerning the figures that the Department has supplied. I indicated earlier in my speech that there are sources in our community that estimate the problem to involve 150,000 people, rather than the 90,000 that the Department estimates. Whatever the figure-be it only 90,000 or 150,000-it constitutes a direct challenge to the integrity of Australia's immigration system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned that advantage is being given to people who take the law into their own hands and decide for themselves that they are the ones who should settle in Australia. I think it is the job of government to make the necessary rules and regulations in order to determine who is suited here. If we go along with some of the suggestions-and some groups made extreme suggestions during the inquiry-to allow perhaps open slather on illegals, it would certainly resolve the problem momentarily, but if we did it once it would open the flood gates. </PARA>
<PARA> Immigration is a big debate in Australia at the moment, particularly with regard to the number of people who should be allowed to come here. The Government cut the number by 10 per cent earlier this year, and the figure is now 126,000. There is argument from some sources that we should have a nil immigration figure. I do not accept that and I also do not accept that, whatever the number of people that come in, it is the individual who should determine who should or should not settle here. That is the job of government and it is the job in front of each and every one of us, as political representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> We have given clear warning over two years. There have been many articles and programs on radio and television to say that the illegals will sooner or later have to leave Australia. They have had two years' warning. If we buckle under yet again we will only be compounding the problem. Others have seen the concessions we have made so far as a sign of weakness and have interpreted them as an indication that the Government is not willing to bite the bullet and follow through its own policies using the laws that have been given to it by the Parliament. If we weaken yet again, I think Australia's immigration program will be in grave danger of falling into an enormous heap. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion and, in so doing, wish to state briefly the reasons why the Australian Democrats support the majority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the neglect of previous governments has left Australia with an unsustainable legacy of illegal entrants, estimated variously at between 90,000 and 150,000. We agree that this number must be reduced. Hence, we support tough measures to apprehend and deport illegal entrants. We also agree that this is necessary to protect the integrity of our immigration program. To the extent that we allow queue jumpers to get away with breaking the law, we reduce our capacity to receive refugees and family reunion migrants who are taking their turn in the normal manner and in the approved process. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government's attempt last year to codify Australia's immigration laws has produced a rigid and oppressive body of legislation which makes it virtually impossible to take account of individual circumstances where the strict application of the law would produce unjustifiable hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> In years gone by the Minister for immigration was able to use his or her discretion in such matters. However, as I said, the codification attempt has made that virtually impossible. We have had cases which obviously merited special consideration. One, without naming names, is that of a young person who arrived here with his parents, who came here as illegal migrants. That young person was not aware of his parents status or, consequently, his own. He attended school in Australia all his life. He was dux of his school, was ready to enter a professional career, was engaged to be married and yet was deported to a country where he no longer had any ties-social, educational or personal. In such instances we must provide a window of opportunity, if you like, for our system to be tempered with some compassion. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is essential to provide a mechanism to allow our system to take account of such exceptional circumstances. Unless that is done, our legal system will be brought into disrepute, people who deserve compassionate consideration will be driven underground, and we will compound the problem of illegal migrants. If people feel they have no chance at all, yet they have compelling and compassionate circumstances that force them to stay here-for instance, to help some aged or ailing relative-then they will try to evade the law. We believe that after 30 October such exceptions should be-and indeed, if the Committee's recommendations are accepted, will be-at an absolute minimum. But prior to 31 October we must find the means to reduce the current undesirable level of illegal immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA> We have these two problems: firstly, what do we do in the future? We believe that we should be tough, both in admitting migrants and in enforcing our compliance regulations. Secondly, we must deal with the people who are illegally here now, and consider how we can reduce that level. </PARA>
<PARA> If the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations are accepted, our goal will be achieved by a carrot and stick approach. Illegal entrants leaving Australia voluntarily before 31 October will be able to reapply from abroad without any time restrictions. Illegal entrants apprehended after 31 October will suffer time restrictions on their ability to apply, and, in addition, will have to meet all costs associated with being deported. In fact, in recognition of that we are informed that several thousand people have already chosen to leave to avoid these disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support the recommendation to empower the Immigration Review Tribunal to consider applications from people who believe they are innocent illegal entrants-people who have entered Australia and stayed here not knowing they are illegal; people in a similar situation to the person in the example I quoted earlier of children who arrive here with their parents, unaware of their parents' circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we believe that an exception should be granted to enable people who have been here more than five years to apply. It is not a blanket suggestion or condition that leads to their being given permission to stay; it is a threshold requirement-the majority report suggests-which would enable them to apply and have their cases considered. Applicants who apply under this exception will also have to satisfy public interest criteria, and will be required to demonstrate that they have made a positive and substantial contribution to Australia. Also, they will have to show that there are compelling compassionate circumstances which contributed to their illegal standing, and which should be taken into account as reasons for granting permanent residence. </PARA>
<PARA> To portray these exceptions as an overall amnesty is, therefore, quite erroneous and, in some cases, I believe even mischievous. I believe that the totality of the approach laid down by the majority report acknowledges the need for tight controls, but tempers this approach with compassion for people who deserve consideration on public policy and humanitarian grounds. It should be noted that these exceptions-out of a total of, say, 150,000 illegal entrants-would only affect 10,000 or 11,000 and fewer than half are expected to apply. This means that we are only talking about 1 to 2 per cent of people who deserve some specific consideration out of the total illegal entrants in this country. The Democrats support the majority recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations which prepared this report entitled Illegal Entrants in Australia-Balancing Control and Compassion. I was one of those who dissented. Although a number of the 10 people on the Committee dissented, I think the general thrust of the report-balancing control and compassion-was accepted by all those who attended the meetings. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) was unable to attend any of the Committee meetings. He took no part in the deliberations on this report, and has made that clear in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that the dissensions and the differing opinions expressed by people on the Committee arose from the problem of what should be done in what really is an impossible situation. Australia is a big country-a country we can all be proud of-but, unfortunately, it is not big enough to take in all those who want to come here, so choices must be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that the choice is not between the good and the deserving and the bad and the undeserving, but between the many people who are good and deserving and who can put forward the most heart-rending of cases in support of an application to come here. Indeed, illegal immigrants, in most cases, can put forward a proposition to stay here that is supported by evidence indicating that it would be a harsh decision to deport them. This Committee, this Parliament and, indeed, this country have to wrestle with the constant difficulty of who amongst these decent people who simply want to come here for a better life, and to make a contribution to this country, should be allowed to stay. The same applies in the case of illegal immigrants who want to stay here so that they can pursue a life that they find attractive and at the same time make a contribution to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation, how are we to choose who will stay and who will not? In the end, every member of the Committee came down on the side of those who make applications to come to Australia according to due process. I, for one, have a lot of sympathy for people who come here as temporary visitors, find the place attractive, and want to stay. I do not believe it is a heinous crime to be attracted to this country and to want to stay, but it is wrong to do so without going through the proper processes. It is for that reason that those who do so must take second place to those who go through the proper processes. As a nation, we face great difficulties in deciding who will be allowed to come here. The point is not whether a person who has come here illegally is deserving of the right to stay here, but whether that person should take priority over a person who has made a proper application; that is the real question. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the proposition that any person who stays here illegally denies a place to those who have applied properly. There has been a denial of that proposition as it has been said that people who are here illegally do not go into the numbers of those people who come here as legal immigrants; therefore, it is a false argument to say that a place taken by an illegal immigrant denies that place to a person who applies properly. The Government has made it quite clear that that is not true and that people who are here illegally do deny a place to those who want to come here legitimately. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the person most in the hot seat in this area is the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). When one thinks about the choices he has to make and the program he has to run, one can have considerable sympathy for him because making choices in these situations is a terrible burden. </PARA>
<PARA> All people on the Committee impressed me with the dedication they showed in trying to grapple with an impossible problem. I also join Senator McKiernan in giving high praise to our legal consultant, Dr Kathryn Cronin, and the staff, Robina Mills, Heidi Quinlan and Francis Kleiss. I think that they performed their duties in a most outstanding way. </PARA>

It is a tragedy and a problem that cannot, I think, be solved satisfactorily. The best we can do is to try to impose standards of fairness and equity. In my opinion, that can best be done by giving priority to those who come here according to a legitimate process but at the same time extending compassion to those cases which any decent reasonable person would say should be placed into the category of people who show exceptional reasons for being able to stay here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill is to facilitate and encourage the amalgamation of unions. It is clearly being introduced by the Government in response to very great concerns in the union movement about its declining support from the traditional base that it relies upon. This problem was identified very starkly by Mr Kelty in May of 1987 when he produced a document called Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement. He admitted then that the union movement was in decline for a number of reasons, which were identified, and he then strongly promoted the view that the number of unions in Australia should be reduced from over 300, as they then were, to about 20.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly the situation has not improved from the unions' point of view since then. Indeed, in the private sector the strength of union membership has declined to an all-time low of 32 per cent of those employed in the sector. Union membership has declined particularly badly-from its point of view-among the young, casual workers, women and particularly in the rapidly growing service sector of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is obviously a very real problem facing the union movement. Only now, because of that campaign by the union movement, is the Government taking action to effectively give, in the legislation, recognition to the problem and to provide a solution along the lines which the union movement itself is calling for. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has been dressed up by the Government as an improvement to the industrial relations process. In his second reading speech the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) referred to the number of independent inquiries over the last 10 or 15 years which have found that there are too many unions and that fewer unions would be a major advantage in improving the industrial relations climate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has fallen back upon a view which has been fashionable over the last 15 years or so-that is, that there are too many unions, that they are all old-fashioned craft based notions of a past age and that it would be better if employees were herded together in a very small number of large unions which would be industry based. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Minister has referred to a number of independent reports which have put forward that view, the Minister does not refer to the fact that there have been some other, more up-to-date and very different views expressed in recent times by people and organisations who also have some authority in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Minister did not mention the report of the Business Council of Australia of October last year on enterprise based bargaining units. He did not mention the views of the National Institute of Labour Studies which were expressed in its bulletin of December last year. He did not make any mention of a recent report of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which also referred to Australia's union structures. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at these views we will find that they are very different from the one that the Minister put forward as the solution-the view that big is beautiful and is the best solution. These people are very knowledgeable on the subject and they suggest a very different solution, namely, that there should be a focus on enterprise based unions. </PARA>
<PARA> A problem which the Opposition has very clearly identified is the number of unions in the workplace. The simple creation of large unions, even though there might be fewer total unions, will not necessarily mean that there will be any significant reduction in the number of unions which have representation in the workplace. That is the hub of the problem. The average number of unions per workplace at present is five. Even in small enterprises the owner may have to deal with a number of unions. If we have fewer unions, this may lead to fewer in each workplace, but there will still be an undue number of unions represented in each workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in some larger workplaces in Australia there are more than 10 unions that have to be dealt with. Again, if one simply creates fewer but very much bigger unions and still organises them on the same old craft-based occupation notion, it is not obvious that that will really make any significant or worthwhile difference to this basic problem. It is pretty widely recognised that the real problem is the number of unions which are represented at the workplace. Previously the concern has been the number within industry, but now, nevertheless, the recognition is more on the problem in the workplace or the enterprise itself. That, rather than the large number of unions, is really the hub of the concern. </PARA>
<PARA> This notion that, as a contribution to our better industrial relations processes, there should be fewer unions is also said to be established in other countries. A particular example is Germany. For many years in that country there had been something like only 20 unions. I think it is perhaps 19 at the moment. Because Germany has been a great economic success and still has one of the really strong economies of the world, there is seen to be some connection with the fact that it has fewer unions. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the other great successful economy of the Western world is Japan's. In Japan there is a totally different union structure based on enterprises. There are hundreds of unions in Japan based upon the enterprise unit. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember many years ago when this idea of amalgamations and fewer unions became popular. Germany was presented as the country that had the solution to the industrial relations problem. I happened to be on a study tour to Germany to discuss this particular subject, which I did with a leading union official. To my utter surprise, that official gave all sorts of very interesting and sound reasons why industrial relations were better in Germany than they were in other parts of the world and particularly in the United Kingdom. But he did not see the fact that Germany had a few large unions as the reason for better industrial relations in that country. I was very struck by that response at the time and very surprised, particularly in view of all the rhetoric we were hearing in Australia. It is now something like 15 years later, and we still have this Government pursuing the rhetoric that a few large unions will really be the solution to our industrial relations problems. As I say, that reasoning is totally contradicted by the Japanese experience and, on the basis of my own discussion some years ago, it did not seem to be accepted even by a union leader in Germany as the real reason why its industrial relations and processes were more successful than those of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will be opposing the second reading of this legislation. We have objections to it based on the grounds that we do not believe that it is likely to be successful. It is also contrary to the solutions which we as the Opposition believe are the ones to our industrial relations problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I will run briefly through the reasons why the Opposition is opposing this Bill. It is promoting amalgamations for its own sake. It is not addressing amalgamations in the context of the problem of craft or occupational-based unions, which is really one of the major problems. The Bill is not going to actually solve that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill may result in a greater reduction in the number of industry focused unions instead of a reduction in the number of craft or occupation based unions. As I have already said, it will not really solve the problem of too many unions in the workplace and it will-this is prob- ably the most worrying aspect-deliver industries into the hands of militant left wing unions in a number of cases, strengthening the position of those militant unions. When this is combined with compulsory unionism it will, of course, make it even more difficult for unionists to have a choice of membership, or indeed for employees to have a choice of membership, because it will place greater power in the unions with individuals being further dragooned and their interests, of course, ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the Opposition saying these things about this proposal. I refer to the views of Laurie Short, one of the most respected unionists in Australia. His comments on this proposal are reported in the IPA Review of December 1989. First of all, he believes that the Kelty plan is `an impossible dream and is focusing on the wrong issue'. He says-I have already dealt with this-that the size and number is irrelevant to the diagnosis of the terminal illness the union movement is suffering. He mentions two different concepts, in Japan and Germany. The views of another highly respected unionist in Australia, the former Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union, Mr Joe Thompson, are also recorded in a recent article in the Review. He said this about the Kelty plan:</PARA>
<PARA>The net result could well be to give the ACTU greater power to pursue whatever political objectives its Executive decided upon-and an increased potential for large-scale disputes based on such objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Thompson concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>With 20 mega unions of the type envisaged by Mr Kelty it can clearly be seen that industrial power and muscle would exist to virtually force every worker in industry to join one of these mega unions under the threat of no jobs and no work if they refused. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Opposition's second concern is that not only will this proposal lead to this greater concentration of power in unions really of the same sort as we have come to know them in our system, many of which have become larger and militant already, but that we will be simply strengthening their position and not addressing the real problem. We also have very great concern about this because if in fact this legislation goes through, if it does go according to plan-hopefully Mr Laurie Short's views will prevail-it will, as I say, probably result in a worse industrial relations climate and system than we have at the moment. The only possible reason for the Government moving in this direction is either that it is simply doing the bidding of its masters in the Australian Council of Trade Unions or that it is looking to solutions which are now well and truly out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> Our second concern about it is that, if we go down this path of creating these larger unions, it will make it much more difficult to develop in the future a new union structure which will be enterprise based. I have already indicated the arguments about the need for improved industrial relations which would occur if at the workplace there were fewer unions, or preferably only one union, covering the employees in that workplace. That is an ideal which the Opposition espouses. As I have said, it is the experience in one of the world's most successful economies, namely, Japan. This is clearly the problem in Australia, as identified by so many people. I do not think the Government would deny that there are too many unions in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the arguments for introducing this legislation was to have fewer unions in the workplace. But we will still have a number of unions in most workplaces. This legislation is presented more as getting unions focused on an industry basis rather than reducing the number in the workplace. I know that one of the new objectives of the Industrial Relations Act is to encourage and facilitate the development of organisations particularly by reducing the number of organisations in an industry or enterprise. But it mentions only reducing the number. Even if that were successful, there would still be too many in any one workplace. The reason is that the really basic structure of unionism in Australia, namely, the old craft or occupation concept, is not addressed in this legislation-and it will not be addressed simply by herding more employees into perhaps fewer but certainly very much larger unions. That will probably make industrial relations even more difficult because the employers, the managers, will not be dealing face to face with their employees but with remote union bureaucrats; if they are of a militant character, as many of them will be, it will just make it very much more difficult to establish the sort of harmony in the workplace that is the object of Opposition policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have some other objections to this legislation that I will run through fairly briefly in the time left. It seems probable that the process of amalgamation over the next few years will of itself create more industrial unrest because the process will be resisted by a large number of the unions, not only the small unions. There will be big fights between the already big unions about who will get the cover as it is unlikely that they will be able to carve it up amongst themselves. If they do, that will be another problem that will be solved behind closed doors. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that even at the moment when we have about 300 unions there is in the Act a threshold for union membership of 1,000 members. Nearly half of our existing unions already have well below that threshold of 1,000 members. There is a section in the Industrial Relations Act which permits the Industrial Relations Commission to allow small unions to continue. There is a lot of evidence that people will wish to preserve their own corner and that there will be a great deal of debate, discussion and industrial unrest over this process that the Government is setting in train. </PARA>
<PARA> If unions are of a great size, there will be less flexibility and less communication with their membership and will certainly be very difficult for the particular circumstances of each workplace to be given any consideration. In the future, unions must play a much smaller role in negotiations. Amalgamations will probably happen for the wrong reasons. In many cases they will reflect particular traditional union rivalry, factionalism or, indeed, the Labor Party's own priorities and factionalism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should tell us how it proposes to justify the impact on the right to freedom of association. No doubt the Australian Democrats in this place will be very concerned about this aspect of the legislation, because people will be required to join large organisations and refused the right-I doubt that it will happen-to have smaller organisations. Freedom of choice is an internationally recognised human right and the Opposition strongly believes in that right. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally-I have already made the point that the Bill is essentially a gift to the Australian Council of Trade Unions-it is the ACTU solution to the problem. It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem, the one in the national interest. The Government is simply giving a legislative rubber stamp to the solutions suggested by Mr Kelty, in particular, and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem that should be mentioned-and this will be dealt with more particularly at the committee stage-is that the legislation, in order to encourage this amalgamation, will weaken the secret ballot process and it will weaken the views of the less powerful unions and groups of employees in the community. There are, therefore, a great many objections to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not simply a doctrinaire reaction by the Opposition based upon rigid adherence to Opposition policy. Clearly, the Opposition is very concerned about the impact of this legislation on the implementation of our policy when we are returned to government and the amount of unscrambling that will have to be done. This legislation will make the implementation of our policies more difficult. That is a very serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is opposed to this legislation basically because it does not address the real problem of industrial relations in this country. It probably does not really address the problem of declining unionism in this country unless, of course, the power that is to be given to the bigger unions will mean that they will be able to dragoon more people into union membership simply by muscle rather than by persuasion. That may be the real reason for the legislation. It is probably Mr Kelty's aim. It may well be the real reason the Government is introducing this legislation, which does not address the problem of industrial relations processes in this country. For those reasons, the Opposition opposes the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I will begin my comments in very general terms by looking at the industrial relations scene that we have seen unfolding in Western society over the last 10 years. I will then state the broad position of the Australian Democrats on industrial relations and move on to the specific provisions of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last decade has seen rapid change in industrial relations in Western society. Australia was relatively slow to respond, but there are now a number of clear trends which will usher in great and significant change. We can probably discern a number of quite specific trends which are well and truly under way in the industrial relations scene in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a real decline in union membership and influence and I think it is legitimate for unions to address that. A process of union amalgamation has been under way for some years-and the specific intention of this Bill is to accelerate that process-complemented by a process of award restructuring, and those two processes must be seen together if there is to be any real understanding of what the Government is attempting to achieve through this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Another discernible trend has been an emphasis upon enterprise bargaining. This is the trend which the Opposition cites as the one it would like to see as the most dominant in the next decade. As a part of that process, there is an emphasis on productivity in the workplace. The economic circumstances of Australia are such that that emphasis is very appropriate. So those five broad thrusts and areas of concern can be identified. </PARA>
<PARA> Two legitimate models of industrial relations have prevailed in Western countries, and they have been cited by Senator Durack. He has chosen to emphasise his preference for one. The first of these two legitimate models prevailing in Western society, generally referred to as the centralised model, which the Hawke Government has enacted, is dependent upon an accord between unions, management and government and its chief objective is economic restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> The second industrial relations model is that proposed by the conservative parties which sees a deregulated labour market where groups of employees, or even individuals, negotiate both pay and conditions within a framework directed by government and supervised by an industrial relations commission. In this model, there is an emphasis upon productivity. Senator Durack has cited Germany and Japan as examples of those two industrial relations models. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to clarify the position of the Australian Democrats in relation to those two models and state our preferences. By doing this, I hope it will become obvious why we take the position that we do in relation to this Bill. As the party holding the balance of power in the Senate, the Democrats are in a position to influence critically the legislation enacted and, hence, the model that will prevail in the 1990s. We take that responsibility very seriously indeed. The bottom line is that the Democrats have very serious reservations about a deregulated labour market. In a stressed economy, such as Australia will inevitably be in the 1990s, there is great potential for a labour market out of control, one in which there will be big winners and big losers. We therefore favour retention of a centralised controlling authority, namely, the Industrial Relations Commission, with the responsibility of overseeing and maximising justice, harmony and best economic outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Without apology, we identify with the centralised model. We see the inherent dangers of the decentralised model as having big winners and big losers. To put it in more precise terms, we might see executives of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) doing very well from a decentralised model; however, the tea ladies and the cleaners may do considerably worse. Within the framework that we favour, that of the centralised model and the overseeing role of a strong Industrial Relations Commission, the Democrats will support the processes of amalgamation, award restructuring, industrial democracy and increased productivity through diversity of agreements at industry, enterprise and individual levels. However, we believe that all of these should be subject to approval by the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of which model is pursued by government, this Government or subsequent governments, the Australian Democrats will seek industrial relations legislation which meets the following criteria. We will seek legislation which, firstly, acknowledges the need for and is complemented by a national income support scheme; and, secondly, avoids such divergences in pay and work conditions as to polarise the community, with minorities trapped in poverty. We see that as an inherent danger of the decentralised model. We will seek legislation which, thirdly, constrains wage growth to responsible levels and maximises worker participation and cooperation between management and labour; fourthly, protects hard-won benefits such as leave, safety and superannuation; and, fifthly, facilitates award restructuring and union amalgamations, where supported by the membership. That is an important qualification, which I shall address in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA> The final criterion that we would apply in deciding whether or not to support legislation is whether the legislation requires compulsory registration and public perusal of all agreements, be they between employer and union or work council and individual. We believe that, if circumstances arose whereby individuals went behind closed doors and negotiated their own precise and specific deals with their employer, there would begin the process of erosion of all of those dimensions that give rise to justice, social justice and equality in this country, hard-won as they have been over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several areas of concern under the general heading of industrial relations that I believe will be addressed specifically by this Parliament. This will be a critical Parliament in relation to industrial relations. The first of those areas is the purpose of this Bill. In other words the general area of amalgamation and restructuring will be the first area of reform addressed during the term of this Parliament. The second area that I believe will be addressed fairly quickly is the outstanding matters relating to sanctions, compliance and a labour court. In broad terms that basically means: What happens to those who do not obey the rules, who do not accept the umpire's ruling?</PARA>
<PARA> The third area of concern to me, which has given rise to a private member's Bill that I have initiated, is the right to strike and the provisions of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. I believe that must be and will be addressed soon. The fourth broad area relates to compulsory versus voluntary unionism and the rights of individuals. The Australian Democrats have always opposed compulsory unionism. Therefore we look forward to the private member's Bill that the Hon. John Howard has indicated he will be initiating in the other place. They are the four broad areas of concern which we see as being addressed-and quite rightly-within three years or less. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill addresses the first of those only-that is, the processes of amalgamation and restructuring. The Government has been dissatisfied with the pace of amalgamation and restructuring and sees these things as essential to the crucial changes which are long overdue in Australian industrial relations. The provisions of this Bill are designed to accelerate these processes. The Australian Democrats identify with this need and will, therefore, support the Bill in principle, although we will seek to amend it in some specific areas to which I will return shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill incorporates a range of amendments to the Act under seven broad headings and new objects of the Act will be demanded by the intention of the Bill. It addresses a fundamental area, the essence of the Bill, under the general heading of amalgamations and this raises the question: what should be the minimum size of a union? The Bill addresses the general powers of the Industrial Relations Commission and its involvement in this process of accelerating amalgamation and restructuring-which are specific powers which may change the structure of unions. It addresses critical and controversial areas of preference and it also addresses how we can secure observance of awards by employers, which gives rise to a number of technical changes. These are the broad headings contained within the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that an extraordinary degree of consensus has been reached, which probably emerged, we believe, as a consequence of five major reports which were put to the Parliament over a number of years and which have said certain things. Senator Durack has, quite appropriately, cited alternate statements which have been saying different things. But I think that in the five major reports which were cited by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in his second reading speech, we see the beginning of what has become a broad consensus in the community concerning the need for fewer unions. I do not think that Senator Durack will agree with me, but I believe that there is consensus that there should be a movement towards industry unions, and that process is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main forums for this consensus-and this, I think, is to the credit of those who take part in this forum-is the National Labour Consultative Council (NLCC), comprising the Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Confederation of Australian Industry, which come together periodically. In recent months there has been quite extraordinary consensus about the provisions of this Bill. In fact, the majority of the proposals within the Bill have the approval of the National Labour Consultative Council. The two broad areas of dispute which have been the most obvious ones within the NLCC have related to union size and to the question of preference. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to congratulate the Minister, Senator Cook, on what he appears to be achieving and on the speed with which he appears to be achieving this through forums such as the NLCC. In my dealings with him-and I have consulted with him very closely on the provisions of this Bill-I have been impressed by his overview and far-sightedness in relation to the general area of industrial relations. I think he has a very clear view about what the Government intends to do and how it should achieve this, and I have found him to be very open-minded and certainly very articulate in enunciating that. I would like to cite a speech made by the Minister at the Australian Financial Review conference on 19 July 1990, and, indeed, I would like to quote from this document because I think it pulls together the Government's position in relation to this broad area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister had been asked to speak specifically on the relationship between the Government's policy and increased productivity within the Australian economy. I am quoting this document because I found it valuable in terms of bringing together my own focus regarding the broader aspects of government policy. In the Minister's introductory remarks he said that the essential thing we have to do is to create conditions where productivity can be improved within the Australian economy, and we have to do this quickly. I will quote three brief paragraphs from his speech. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the role of the industrial relations in improving productivity. Microeconomic reform will complement and facilitate microeconomic policy only if the industrial relations system sets out the environment for it and acts as its engine. This is a central point of the Government's policy. This policy has three inter-related levels: the overhaul of awards; rationalisation of the union structure; and retention of control over aggregate wage outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite obviously this Bill is addressing the second of those aspects quite specifically. The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The objective of each of them is (among other things) a more responsive and more flexible economy-and therefore a more productive and more efficient one. </PARA>
<PARA>I am prepared to accept that this Bill, in fact, meets those objectives. The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been accepted on all sides that our award structure has impeded microeconomic reform. It has herded employees into narrowly confined job paths and work patterns unsuited to modern machinery and modern times. It has complicated employers' dealings with employees and discouraged them from investing in training and other means towards using human resources more effectively. It has locked industry into old and (in many cases) obsolete forms of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Award restructuring is aimed at getting this burden off our backs. Its primary means is through the Structural Efficiency Principle (SEP), adopted by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the last two National Wage Cases. There shouldn't be any need here to explain at greater length what SEP entails, except to underline the point that workers can't get access to wage improvements if they haven't participated in award restructuring aimed at improvements such as more flexible organisation of work. </PARA>
<PARA>What it is doing is pulling together the critical role of amalgamation and union restructuring with award restructuring, and relating that to economic outcomes of productivity. Frankly, I found that a very helpful statement and, therefore, I took a couple of minutes to draw it to the attention of honourable senators. Our role simply is to create an appropriate legislative framework within which industrial relations plays itself out. The internal dynamic of that process is not our business. Unions will squabble; there will be continued disruption; there will, in fact, be an attempt to preserve vested interests on the part of those who have belonged to smaller unions for years. That is the internal dynamic-it is separate from the legislative framework. It is our obligation to address that legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have three broad areas of concern. Those areas of concern will become the focus of our subsequent amendments in the committee stage of the Bill. The first relates to union size and the need to strengthen exemption provisions; the second concerns participation processes; and the third relates to the rights of individuals within the legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment for a couple of moments on what is being proposed about structure and amalgamations. Traditionally, of course, there has been a horizontal structure within unions, and the general thrust and movement worldwide is to try and make those structures more vertical. The vertical structure seems to be appropriate and is being adopted in many countries. I make the observation-and it was made to me yesterday by the Association of Professional Engineers-that the vertical structure may be all very well, but once we start to talk about the involvement of professionally trained people, we probably need to impose upon that a lateral or horizontal structure which acknowledges the special role of professionals and scientifically and technically trained people which has to reach across a number of industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association draws attention to the Swedish model, and has presented its responses to, and arguments in favour of, that alternative structure in a document entitled, `Union Amalgamations-The Challenge for Professionals'. It is dated September 1990 and I commend it to honourable senators as being a statement of a very reasonable argument for a modified vertical structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Another general principle which we would enunciate is that we do support a strong Industrial Relations Commission in overseeing the process of amalgamation and restructuring. It is appropriate-as this Bill does-to strengthen the role and powers of the Industrial Relations Commission in relation to this process of accelerated amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> We do accept the need to set goals for numbers and times. The view of the Confederation of Australian Industry is that there is no need to prescribe numbers or time frames. We believe that there is value in setting a goal and setting a time frame within which those goals are to be achieved. We do not believe that they will be precisely achieved-in terms of either numbers or time-but there is value in setting the goals and the objectives. If they are not set there will not be the accelerated process which we regard as, and are convinced are, necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> We reject the ambit figure of 20,000 as being appropriate. We believe that from the very beginning it has been an ambit figure claimed by the Minister-probably on behalf of the ACTU. We think it has unfortunate and unnecessary connotations of mega-unions. We believe that the final outcome will be unions ranging from hundreds of thousands in strength down to a few hundred in strength, and that the precise figure really has no significance other than to act as a goal and to accelerate the process of amalgamation. We need not be preoccupied with it. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be moving an amendment to change the figure to 10,000, but only in very broad terms-it could be 9,000, it could be 11,000, it could be anything. We will be prescribing a time frame shorter than that prescribed within the Bill. In other words, in general terms, the Democrats are saying, `Sure, accelerate the process of amalgamation but don't create mega-unions en route-but we believe that it has to happen quickly'. </PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadow an amendment which I will move in the committee stage for a reduction of the ambit figure from 20,000 to 10,000, and a reduction of the time frame from March 1995 to possibly March 1992 or 1993. We will deliberate about which is the most appropriate of those two dates between now and the committee stage, which is some time off, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important aspects of this process, as far as we are concerned, is to strengthen the exemption provisions. Within the present Act there is provision for small unions to argue special circumstances and say, `Look, we have walked the course of amalgamation; it was a bad experience; we don't want to be forced back there again; it does not make any sense for all sorts of reasons'. As I say, within the present Act there is provision to argue special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Act as it now stands, however, is suggestively coercive and does suggest to the Commission a pressure to amalgamate. We will be seeking a rewording of the Act through an amendment which will more clearly communicate to the Commission and to the court that coercion is not the aim of the game. To put it in blunt terms, we are not in favour of shotgun weddings and we believe that, in the final analysis, if union members do not support the process of amalgamation, it should not proceed. We believe that that spirit is brought out in the newly stated objectives of the Act, which emphasise the importance of participation in the process of amalgamation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will move on to that aspect of participation in a minute. We believe that this more adequately accommodates the need dictated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) covenant, signed by Australia, which supports freedom of association. We believe that the strengthening of the exemption provisions will more appropriately comply with the ILO covenant. Senator Durack asks are we not frightened by the aspects of the Bill which amend the processes of participation? Initially, on first examination, we were. We have looked at those provisions in detail and are now convinced that they will not reduce the process or threaten the processes of participation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three things that are suggested within the Bill will happen under certain circumstances, and these circumstances must always be approved by the Commission and must always be overseen by the Electoral Commission, which are in themselves two very strong provisos. Provided the Industrial Relations Commission is convinced that participation and democracy are preserved, it will exempt ballots under some circumstances, such as those ballots for the marriage of larger components. The Commission will also allow the processes to occur through secret ballots at mass meetings rather than necessarily through secret postal ballots. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought clarification on the arguments that have come to me. I find those arguments convincing, and our Party finds them convincing. We do not believe that participation in democracy is threatened by the exemption provisions of the Bill. I will give more attention to that point obviously in the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The final broad area of concern to the Democrats-and this is a very challenging one-is the rights of individuals. We believe that there is an inherent danger still within the Act not adequately addressed by the provisions of the Bill. The inherent danger is that individuals can find themselves disadvantaged because the essential rationale of the Act and the Bill is a focus on organisations and collectives. We believe there has to be a strengthening of the protection of individual rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite, but not name, a case that is currently before the State Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales, where an individual by law does not have access to the Commission unless it is by special writ of the Minister. In the case of this individual now before the Commission, I obtained that special writ from the State Minister. This individual, an unemployed person, on the dole, now finds himself standing before the Commission without legal aid and arguing his case against QCs, not even able to cover the cost of photocopying the transcript of proceedings from the previous day unless he pays $2 a page. Therefore, he has to stand and, by hand, transcribe from court records and proceedings. That person does not have equal rights before that court. We believe that there are in the present Act inherent dangers which are not sufficiently addressed by the Bill. In essence, the Democrats support in principle the thrust of the Bill. In the committee stage we will seek to rectify the inadequacies I have cited. We commend the general intention of the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

It indicates that the old ways have persisted despite the union movement's splendid record over the last decade and despite the fact that there have been considerable changes in eastern Europe and a rapprochement between East and West. In spite of those very significant changes in the climate in which we live, there are still people and organisations-and the Opposition is one-that talk about left wing imperialism, left wing dissent and left wing corruption, and say that these things will be typified by the amalgamation of unions. The record is against that. Under this Government the culture, aspirations and mood of Australia's industrial relations have changed dramatically. In a little while I want to make some key points about that from the economic data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The adversarial relationship that existed between worker and management before March 1983 has been transformed into a much more cooperative one. More and more, all levels of industry are coming to understand the need for consensus in the workplace. This is essential not only for the economic health of the nation but also for its democratic ethos. I want to stress this because it has not been stressed enough. During the last decade the approach taken by this Government to industrial change has done much for the Australian way of life. The approach should be seen not simply in terms of industrial policy or economic policy but also in terms of the political fabric of this society, the sorts of values we have and the culture that we live in. </PARA>
<PARA> Great reform has taken place in society without violence to the tenets of a free community. This is an achievement that deserves high praise. During the 1980s dramatic shifts occurred in the workplace practices of other countries. I think that matter has already been dealt with this morning by both Senator Durack and Senator McLean. </PARA>
<PARA> The sacking of the air traffic controllers in the United States at the beginning of the decade signalled the harsh social changes which have occurred there. During the same period, industrial reform was carried out in the United Kingdom with much bitterness between workers, employers and government. There has been a lot of change in industrial relations in both the United Kingdom and the United States over the last 10 years. In both cases the style of that change, the method of it, has left a lot of bitterness. The sorts of riots that we have seen in the United Kingdom, and that have been dramatically demonstrated on the television screen, have not happened in Australia. The sorts of violence, poverty and degradation that have occurred amongst the have-nots in the United States have not happened here. The two nations that Benjamin Disraeli spoke about, both the United Kingdom and the United States, have grown during the 1980s but that has not happened here. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great achievements for this Government will be to bring about the change that is needed, but to do it via preserving the very fabric of democracy. Democracy is not simply a matter of having the ability to cast a vote every three years. It is also a matter of having as many people as possible take part in the process of change and having those people take part not on the basis of confrontation but on the basis of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic and industrial policies pursued by the Government over the life of the four Parliaments that it has now controlled has established in Australia the sort of ethos, culture and political approach that is an example for the rest of the world. I think that this Government has reason to be very proud because of that. The course that the Government has pursued has enhanced the character of this nation as a free and cohesive society. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the key points of the economic data. These figures have been quoted again and again in this chamber in many debates over the last few years. They are worth repeating in the context of talking about the next step in the process of making this country even better than it presently is. The consumer price index increase was 1.6 per cent in the June quarter of this year compared to 11.5 per cent over the last years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into the exercise of saying that the present problems in Australia date back to the Fraser years, although there is much merit in that proposition. I simply want to illustrate at this point in the argument that the economic indicators that this Government can quote are much better than those that the Opposition could quote when it was last in Government. Average weekly earnings are up 6.7 per cent over the year to May 1990. The real unit labour costs, on the other hand, were down 12.8 per cent between March 1983 and March 1990. Productivity is up 4 per cent in the non-farm market sector and 3.8 per cent in manufacturing in the period 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment is up 1.68 million under Labor. Again, I do not duck the problem that still exists in the increase in the number of people who are unemployed. Anybody who is unemployed deserves the sympathy of us all. Under its policies this Government has produced a remarkable number of jobs. The rate of unemployment under it is well down on what was the position when it came to government in March 1983. At that time it was 10.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the level of industrial disputes-this is the last figure I will quote-is down 60 per cent under the Australian Labor Party on the level of the Fraser years. When this Government brings legislation into the chamber and asks Parliament to accept and pass it, it does so in the context of its remarkable record, not only in terms of industrial relations or economic policy but also in terms of the way of life that we now enjoy, the democratic processes that it has enhanced and the cohesive society that it has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government can come to the Parliament with confidence and say that on the record it has established the Parliament ought to give very solid consideration to passing this legislation. The Australian Democrats have accepted that and have said, `Yes, we have looked at this legislation and, subject to some amendments we want to make which we will pursue at the committee stage, we agree with the general thrust of what the Government has done'. I suppose part of the Opposition's approach is to oppose-that is what it is here for-but we hope that in opposing the legislation it will do so constructively rather than simply saying, `This is a left wing plot; this Government is the captive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions; it is all dreadful and therefore we will throw it out'. </PARA>
<PARA> Why not look at the legislation and see what it does? In that context it might be worth while going to the Bill itself. Much of this has been pointed out already, but it starts off, in clause 4, by stating quite candidly what it is about. It says that it is going to amend the principal Act by adding to the objectives the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (j) to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of organisations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (k) to encourage and facilitate the development of organisations, particularly by reducing the number of organisations that are in an industry or enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Bill is about. It wants amalgamation because the evidence is that amalgamation is what is best not only for the union movement but also for the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Amalgamation is not some new process that is going to take place under this amended Act. There have been amalgamations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for a long time. In 1975 the Federated Artificial Fertiliser and Chemical Workers unions amalgamated and continued under the name of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia. The world did not collapse when that happened. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 the Australian Workers Union and the Wool and Basil Workers Federation of Australia amalgamated. The interesting thing is that in 1979 the Graziers Association of Victoria and the Victorian Farmers Union Employers Association amalgamated under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to join the Victorian Farmers Federation Industrial Association. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982 the Tasmanian Farmers Federation employers association and the Tasmanian Farmers, Stockowners and Orchardists Association amalgamated to form the Tasmanian Farmers and Growers Industrial Association. Those are employer organisations, which indicates that employer organisations understand the need to amalgamate and the need, as society changes and we get closer and closer to the twenty-first century, for amalgamation and reform, and undertake it in that context. </PARA>

We have made inquiries about some of those activities but I have to say that none of them seem to breach any aspect of Australian law at this stage. We have checked to see whether in fact the Australian defence export provisions could be affected, but they relate only to goods going into and out of Australia. I also checked with the Attorney-General's Department to see whether the issue fell under the jurisdiction of the foreign incursions and recruitment controls. I am advised that the matter would not fall within the scope of the legislation, and it was also reiterated that the defence export provisions were not being breached by the particular company concerned. As Senator Hill knows, defence and foreign affairs matters constantly overlap. I have expressed the view that I do not think the Australian Government would give any great support to those sorts of dealings, and would indeed object to them.

So there is no linkage. Not one computer screen in my Department could ever tap into Tax, which is the central way that one would get an Australia Card type arrangement. That is prevented by the method that we are using on this occasion. Tax file numbers are already being collected for unemployment benefit beneficiaries; that is no secret to anyone; it has been announced. No tax file number appears on any screen anywhere in my Department. We are already showing that we will not do what the Opposition and Tracey Aubin are accusing us now of doing. For computer matching purposes, all we need is the tax file number and it remains discrete within the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article in today's Australian again mentioned the Privacy Commission. The article contained an extraordinary piece of selective quoting. What Mr O'Connor has been at pains to say is that he will be involved in drafting guidelines for this system-and he most certainly will be. I have already said that the Government will implement the guidelines that he introduces, whatever they are, and that we will provide him with staff for the purpose. There are inbuilt guarantees right through the system against the tax file number becoming an Australia Card.</PARA>
<PARA> This ought not to be a political issue. It is about raising hundreds of millions of dollars from cheats, from those who cheat and bludge on the system. Every Australian has an interest in making sure that those hundreds of millions of dollars now being ripped off by cheats are no longer ripped off.</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note what was said, after the presentation of the Budget, by the Leader of those opposite-honourable senators opposite remember him; Dr Hewson in the other place-the invisible man. It is easy not to remember him, but they do. After the Budget he actually showed just a hint of courage. He actually said he supported the Government on this question; he said he supported us on deeming.</PARA>
<PARA> But what has happened since? The rest of his Party, which claims some sort of economic responsibility, is once again backing off. The intellectual giants like Senator Boswell once again lead the Liberal Party by the nose. I ask honourable senators opposite to show some real courage-examine the proposal properly and make sure they join us in stopping $400m a year being ripped off Australia's taxpayers by cheats and bludgers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find this question somewhat confusing, because I am sure the Prime Minister said something similar to what the honourable senator has referred to at the Australian Council of Trade Unions conference in 1987. He said at that time, as I recall, that instrumentalities that had natural monopolies, and he used that expression, such as Telecom Australia and Australia Post, should not be sold. I do not know what newspapers or other things Senator Powell has been reading in the past few days, but Telecom is not to be sold. There is a distinction between selling an enterprise and exposing it to competition. The Government course on this matter will be to expose Telecom to competition in particular areas where in the past it has not been so exposed. But that is not to be confused with the issue raised by Senator Powell, of whether or not Telecom is to be sold. It is not to be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's remarks may well have been made in 1987, as Senator Powell said. They reflect views he has expressed recently, to the effect that the Government will not sell Telecom. The Prime Minister's figures to which Senator Powell referred were authoritatively based, being sourced from the telecommunications authorities of the relevant countries or from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is no good Senator Powell coming in here and saying this happened in the United Kingdom or something else happened in the United States of America at a particular time and prices may have gone up or may have gone down and therefore one can draw conclusions about the principles which the honourable senator sought to enunciate, I suppose, in a fairly obscure way, in the substance of her question.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's view is that effective competition will lead to reductions in prices. It is not only competition that will lead to reductions in prices, but also technological change. The Government has made it clear that, in its view, telephone prices will fall. The other issue is whether services provided by Telecom and a range of value-added industries also will fall. The anticipation can be that they will. I might add that the appropriate safeguards to which the Government has referred in recent days will protect the position of disadvantaged groups. I refer particularly to the community service obligations of Telecom, which are not to be confused with the commercial obligations of the Commonwealth Bank, as they were yesterday by Senator Powell's colleague Senator Spindler.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not challenge in any sense Senator Kemp's view, but I do not recall the Government's saying in 1987 or whenever it was that the new television ownership rules would lead possibly to a reduction in the number of networks. If the honourable senator says that was said, I accept that it may be so. On this issue the Minister for Transport and Communications last night made the Government's position fairly clear: first, that the policy objectives underlying the current broadcasting legislation should continue to be observed; second, that these policy objectives include an adequate and comprehensive service and limits on cross-ownership of television stations; and, third, that the Broadcasting Tribunal has the job of implementing these policies. More importantly, Mr Beazley last night made it clear that the Government will back the decisions of the Tribunal. If it proves necessary, this backing will include appropriate amendments to legislation effective from last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Kemp then went on to ask me to speculate about some circumstances which might arise if certain things happen in the marketplace. All I can say about that is that, having set the principles, as Mr Beazley did last night, it is not appropriate for me to act on any supposition, rumour or scuttlebutt about what might happen in board meetings today or in certain other circumstances which might affect the television industry. However, I repeat that, in terms of the policy, the Government will act if the facts justify it.</PARA>

Can the Minister confirm these reports and, if they are correct, what action has the Government taken to protest at this further abuse of human rights in Myanmar?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in Myanmar is certainly increasingly tense and unhappy. The military regime has shown by its actions that it is unwilling to consider seriously a transfer of power to the representatives elected in the national elections on 27 May. The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council-or SLORC, as Senator Schacht said-is continuing to rely on repression and intimidation. On 7 September, in what can only be described as a pre-emptive clampdown against the country's major political party, the National League for Democracy, the spokesman and acting leader of the NLD, Kyi Maung, and four other leaders of the party were taken into detention in the early hours of the morning. I condemned that action in a formal statement that was issued in very strong terms later that day. On 8 August, a little earlier, in Mandalay, police, for the first time in over a year, used force to put down a demonstration, killing six or seven demonstrators-most of them monks and students. Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the NLD, is still being held under house arrest, well over a year after she was first detained, and no indication has been given as to when she might be released.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the elections, there have been further widespread arrests of political activists, most of them associated with the NLD. The SLORC, very regrettably, has made it clear that it does not see the May elections as leading to genuine democratic change. From its public statements, it is evidently expecting that the representatives elected so overwhelmingly in May will simply be charged with drawing up a new constitution. This would then have to be approved by the SLORC and perhaps put to a referendum prior to a further election from which a government might then be formed. Such a process could take well over a year, if not much longer, and would deny the clear wish of the majority of the population for meaningful democratic reform within a reasonable timeframe. However, to date, the SLORC has set no date even for the convening of an assembly for the limited purpose of drafting a new constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> For its part, the NLD, which honourable senators will recall won 392 out of the 485 seats contested in May, is clearly becoming increasingly, and increasingly justifiably, impatient. At the end of a delegates' conference on 30 July, the NLD called for a convening of a national assembly with full legislative powers by the end of September. It is that action that has now created the tension and uncertainty in the situation to which I referred.</PARA>
<PARA> As to Australia's response to all of this, I will quickly detail it. Shortly after the election results were announced, I wrote to senior General Saw Maung, Chairman of the SLORC and Myanmar Foreign Minister, urging that there should be a prompt transfer of power to democratic government. At my request, our ambassador asked the authorities if he could call on Aung San Suu Kyi to deliver a message of support. That request was refused. However, I also wrote to the Acting Chairman of the NLD to congratulate the party on its success in the elections. I have informed other interested governments of the actions taken by Australia and we have been encouraging them to take similar action to support a transition to democracy in Myanmar.</PARA>
<PARA> In early July, I indicated that I would not review the suspension of the Australian aid program to Myanmar unless there was a transfer of power to a democratic government. Later in July we called formally for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and expressed the Government's profound disappointment at the decision of the military regime to extend her detention; and, of course, I repeat that again today. I hope that when I go to New York shortly for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, I will be able to meet again with the leader of the Myanmar delegation to discuss the situation in Myanmar and to further communicate our concerns about the situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter of judgment, Senator. The utility of trade sanctions has to be measured, among other things, by the extent of international support for them. It can be an empty, quixotic and counterproductive gesture unless there is a broader base of support. No doubt that is something the international community will have to shortly turn its mind to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the matter of international cooperation generally, which was the last part of Senator Schacht's question, I simply want to say that Australia has maintained close contact with other countries similarly concerned over the situation in Myanmar with the aim of taking joint action whenever that is possible. We have been regularly associated with joint diplomatic demarches in Yangon in which the United States and European Community countries have also been prominent. I raised the situation in Myanmar with my Association of South East Asian Nations ministerial colleagues at the ASEAN post-ministerial meeting in July. I will be exploring with likeminded countries the possibility of taking further measures at the forthcoming General Assembly.</PARA>

Has Sir Peter also been critical in pointing out that by sending Senator Gareth Evans to represent our Head of State, Australia would have observer status only?

I ask if this intrinsic part of the Government's economic reform strategy is working successfully, particularly as part of the Government's intention to facilitate award restructuring at the enterprise level?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2365" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has embarked on a program to underpin the very good work that has been done, based on the accord submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission over the last several years encouraging award restructuring. This will ensure that the fruits of award restructuring are reflected in better arrangements in the workplace. That program is, as Senator McKiernan has said, the workplace reform program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say, as someone associated with industrial relations for a long time until 1983 and coming back to it just this year, that I am astonished by the amount of change that has occurred in rationalising the award structures in Australia and some of the shibboleths that have been broken down over that period in order to broad-band award structures and make their format more flexible. I commend the union movement, employers and the Industrial Relations Commission for responding to the accord-based submissions that have enabled that to occur. The next challenge is to translate those gains, which are reflected in the way in which the awards are written, into real life practices in the workplace. To do that requires a continuation of the revolution, starting with award restructuring. It requires two parties to be involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia has funded a survey conducted by Monash University of examples of what is, in fact, going on in workplace reform. The survey found, inter alia, that the biggest obstruction to achieving genuine reform in the workplace is conservatism by employers in embracing the opportunities that the restructured awards provide. There is a serious obligation on employers to actually look creatively at the changes that have occurred in award restructuring and apply them to the workplace, in consort with the unions in that workplace, to achieve better flexibility and more efficient processes and generate greater productivity.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that is part of accord mark 6 is direct bargaining in the workplace to share the achieved productivity and profitability goals. There is a willingness, I think, on the side of the union movement; there is a willingness at peak level in employer bodies; and there is a reluctance to embrace the opportunity in the workplace by particular employers. Our program is aimed at motivating change in that area. We fund work change agents to work with employer groups and unions to do so. I think, with the impetus that we are able to put behind that program, that we might well be able to encourage significant change in the workplace for the benefit of the economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I do not do Senator O'Chee an injustice if I say that I hope, by inference, that his question does not indicate that the coalition has the same hypocritical approach to this issue as it has to the issue of accountability in the social security services that are provided in this country. Recently, at the Australian Transport Advisory Council, I listened very carefully to the debate on this very subject. I was interested in the unanimity of opinion among the Labor and conservative State leaders at that conference, with caveats put on by the Labor governments of South Australia and, I think, Queensland; certainly the conservative Government of New South Wales; and the Northern Territory, which also put on a caveat. They all agreed in principle on the fundamental thrust of this, I must say, overdue reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What this Federal Government is trying to do-and, I believe, it will succeed-is get some sort of rational national transportation system established in this country for the first time since we federated as a nation. It is long overdue. We are currently faced with the ridiculous situation in the rail and road area of having widely differing regulations applying to the transportation systems from State to State. The widely differing registration charges that apply from State to State put State governments-conservative and Labor-in a very difficult position because, when they try to be responsible and introduce road charges which equate, for example, with the cost of maintenance required to repair the damage caused by the transportation of freight, they are frustrated by the simple expedient of truck companies not moving to States physically, but setting up companies in States where the registration charges are massively lower and simply continuing to operate from State to State.</PARA>
<PARA> If I might make a plea for the conservative Government of New South Wales-and Senator O'Chee might like to direct his attention to the problems faced by his conservative colleagues there- one of the difficulties it faces is that New South Wales is an interstate route. It is a big problem when one thinks about it: an enormous amount of traffic from Victoria to Queensland, and vice versa, passes along the road systems of New South Wales. That is just one small example, in a very complex issue, of the problems that the Government is attempting to alleviate, with-I must say-an enormous amount of cooperation from State governments now.</PARA>
<PARA> The principle involved is that there be some sort of national road system introduced. It is inevitable that in trying to set up such a system anomalies will occur. That is the nature of this country and of the particular kind of constitutional set-up we have: State and Federal governments, with the enormous distances and our highly urbanised population. I have said in this chamber before that we have one of the most difficult transportation and communication tasks of any nation on earth.</PARA>
<PARA> There are anomalies. Some of the obvious ones have been raised by Senator O'Chee. Everyone agrees, conservative and Labor, that the principle is worth pursuing, but there are certain areas of Australia where particular modes of transport are used which are not used anywhere else in the country. In particular, I refer to road trains in the Northern Territory, massive vehicles, commonplace to us, more than 100 feet in length, which are in regular use on our roads. They operate economically but cannot be used anywhere else in the country because of the nature of the highway systems and the congestion of traffic elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in respect of those vehicles is that the Inter-State Commission has taken on board the concerns of truck companies in those situations. On behalf of my constituents affected by this problem I have personally made representations to Mr Butcher. The Inter-State Commission complied with its undertaking that an investigation would be carried out into these anomalies. Further recommendations dealing with this issue raised by Senator O'Chee have been provided to the Government and it is currently in the position of considering those further recommendations of Mr Butcher from the Inter-State Commission. The Government will be in a position shortly-I hope before the end of the year-to make a statement on its final position regarding the Inter-State Commission's recommendations in this important matter.</PARA>

Like Senator Collins, we have all been making representations over the enormous impact this will have on the road transport industry, but it does not seem to be doing much good. I direct Senator Collins again to the question of the enormous increase in costs, of up to 700 per cent. It is a cost borne not just by road train operators but also by semitrailer operators, and when the Federal Government receives over $6 billion a year in fuel excise and returns a little over $1 billion to the road network, how does Senator Collins justify these enormous increases in charges?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is simply a repeat of the question I have already tried to answer but I will answer it again for Senator O'Chee. We have a country the size of the United States of America, with a population the size of the city of Los Angeles; we have an area of 3 million square miles-and I am afraid I still think in square miles-with most of our population concentrated in two cities and the rest of us spread across the country and there are enormous distances to be covered by quality road services. How we pay for and maintain it is a huge problem. Frankly, as someone who has used those roads for most of my life-that is, in the outback-considering the problems involved in crossing those huge distances with small populations, I am amazed that we have a road system of the quality that we have in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give an indication of the kinds of difficulties that I am talking about. Between the southern border of the Northern Territory and Darwin are the towns of Alice Springs, with 20,000 people, Tennant Creek, with 3,000 people, and Katherine, with 5,000 people. Then there is the Big Apple at the end of the highway, Darwin, with a population of 65,000. To join those cities, comprising a total population of about 100,000 people, requires 2,000 kilometres of very high quality road indeed. That is one indication of the kinds of problems I am talking about. That road system has to be paid for.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that in the last couple of years the spotlight has finally been put by this Government on that very problem of how we develop a brand new approach to rationally paying for those roads. In conclusion, I ask Senator O'Chee to consult his conservative colleagues in State parliaments. He should have a talk to them because they are joined with this Government in the pursuit of this goal.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can advise the Senate. The Senate should, like others in Australia, consider that, according to the average weekly ordinary times earning index, if the rate of full adult male earnings is 100 per cent, the full adult female earnings rate is 83 per cent. If the index is calculated on overtime, females earn 78 per cent of male earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for that disparity is not that this Government has not supported equal pay. The first equal pay for equal work decision was made in 1968; the second equal pay for work of equal value decision was made in 1972; in 1974 the Whitlam Government supported changes to enable minimum rates of pay to be extended to females on the same basis as they have been extended to males. The reason is that there is a considerable amount of gender discrimination in the work force, notwithstanding those decisions, and there are a whole host of jobs which traditionally or typically are low paid and regarded as `women's work'-type jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite our enlightenment and attention to equal opportunity, it is not surprising these days to still walk into an office in the central business district of any city and see an office full of women doing all the menial work, with a male supervisor. They may not have promotional opportunities because traditionally it is simply the view of some employers that women ought not to be promoted to those areas of responsibility. It is also the case that where women are clustered in low paid jobs those low paid jobs are deliberately undervalued in terms of their true worth in comparison with male jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of those problems the Government concluded in February with the ACTU an accord mark 6-a commitment to establish in the Pay and Equity Division of the Department of Industrial Relations an equal pay unit. The Government announced the funding of that unit in the Budget. The purpose of the unit is to take part in wage cases to try to overcome these difficulties, to encourage in the award restructuring program and in the workplace reform program steps to overcome that process and to provide a basis of advocacy in cases more generally before the Industrial Relations Commission to address the issues of pay inequity that so bedevil the work force. The unit, which is now having staff recruited to it, will be in action shortly and will be an important supplement to the Government's efforts to ensure equity in the wages system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that yesterday the Government referred to pay inequity issues in the body of its general submission to the national wage case. For the interest of the Senate I table the Government's submission to the national wage case yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General-and I believe that today it will be Senator Evans. Is the Minister aware that some basic human rights which are explicitly listed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and to which Australia claims to be committed, are denied to some residents in New South Wales? Is he aware that in New South Wales employees are not recognised as persons in their own right before the industrial jurisdiction and that if they gain access to the court by specific ministerial writ they are then excluded from legal aid in that jurisdiction, even if they may meet all other requirements-for instance, being on the dole? Can the Minister advise when Australia will sign and ratify the optional protocol to the ICCPR which will allow the United Nations Human Rights Committee to consider communications from individual Australians? Finally, can he advise when the Government will communicate Australia's declaration under article 41 of the ICCPR to the United Nations, recognising the competence of the United Nations Human Rights Committee on questions of human rights in bilateral State-party issues in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the first two parts of the question-although these matters of State legislation are properly matters for consideration by the appropriate State authorities-I am able to say nonetheless that the procedural matters to which Senator McLean refers provided for in the New South Wales Industrial Arbitration Act do not, in our judgment, contravene a requirement in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that all persons are to be equal before the courts and tribunals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the legal aid aspects of his question, I am informed that as individuals are not parties to industrial proceedings, legal aid is not normally made available to them.</PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator McLean's third question, the Attorney-General is actively pursuing the matter of the first optional protocol with his State and Territory counterparts in the forum of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The decision on signatory ratification has to await the outcome of the process of consultation. I simply hope and expect that that action will not be much longer delayed.</PARA>
<PARA> The declaration under article 41 of the covenant to which he finally referred is of course related to that issue of the first optional protocol. The Government believes that the key step is to achieve accession to the first optional protocol. The Government is therefore concentrating its efforts on achieving that accession and will then put its efforts to the article 41 declaration and other related matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. I understand the Minister to be saying that the State legislation does not contravene the requirements of the international covenant and yet, would not the Minister agree, individuals have no access to a court of New South Wales unless it is by the grace of the Minister. Would he not agree that when they get there they are disadvantaged if they do not have legal aid, if they are employed, for instance, and is it not a fact that the Federal Attorney-General has formally advised the United Nations that all Australians have equal standing before all courts of this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have much further information with which I can respond more specifically than I have. It is my understanding that the nature of the proceedings in question in the New South Wales Industrial Commission relate to the fixing of hours, rates of pay and so on and proceedings in those matters, and appropriately one would think they would be commenced not by individuals but by parties to industrial matters-namely, employers and representatives of employees, the trade unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The procedure of the Act requires such a proceeding to be commenced by an application and a prescribed form to be signed by an employer or a union. There is also provision for reference of such matters by the relevant Minister or by the Commission itself. I think it is really stretching a long bow to argue that these relatively familiar industrial proceedings in specialist tribunals somehow call into question the applicability of fundamental human rights standards. I am not saying human rights standards have no application in industrial matters, although that is an argument that I suppose could be run-that the area of litigation is sui juris and not related to individual rights and issues of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA> I think I have said enough to make it apparent that there is a reasonable prima facie response to what Senator McLean is saying. If he wants to take it up any further, he can take it up with the New South Wales Government and leave us alone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday Senator Lewis asked me a question relating to trade practices legislation. I said I would seek further information about it. I have that information from the Attorney-General. The Trade Practices Commission decided not to take legal action against Toshiba Australia in respect of alleged resale price maintenance in computer hardware in exchange for a formal undertaking by the company to set up long term compliance training for its staff. The training program covers executives, staff and agents, and is to be conducted over three years. The Chairman of the Commission is reported as saying that this resulted in a better market result than would have been obtained from costly and protracted litigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case illustrates that there are times when actions other than court actions may lead to a more satisfactory outcome, and it highlights the need in all areas of the law to look closely at alternative ways of resolving disputes.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the level of penalties for infringements of the restrictive trade practice provisions, which was another part of the honourable senator's question, I mention that the Act provides for a pecuniary penalty of up to $250,000 for each offence of a corporation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 August Senator Short asked me a question, in my capacity as Minister representing the Treasurer, relating to the State Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of Victoria. The Treasurer has provided information. The Reserve Bank informed the Treasurer that in December 1989 the State Bank of Victoria issued $300m worth of floating rate stock which qualified as capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank's capital adequacy guidelines. This was the fourth issue by the State Bank of Victoria of debt which qualified for inclusion as capital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The normal practice when a bank wishes to raise debt capital is that prior to making the issue it discusses terms and conditions with the Reserve Bank to ensure that the proposed issue will meet the Reserve Bank tests for inclusion as capital. State Banks follow this practice also. The Reserve Bank does not have any contact with Commonwealth Ministers about proposed issues of capital instruments. These processes were followed in relation to the State Bank of Victoria issue. The Reserve Bank did not approve, nor was it aware of subscribers to the State Bank of Victoria's debt capital issue. The Bank does not normally seek such information. On the basis of audited figures the State Bank of Victoria met its immediate capital requirements under the Reserve Bank's guidelines at the end of December 1989.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other day Senator Harradine asked me a question in relation to hidden unemployment; that was one aspect of the question. Senator Harradine is not present in the House. It is a somewhat long answer and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Harradine asked me, on 11 September 1990, a question without notice on the causes of the current level of unemployment including hidden unemployment. I undertook to provide further information on that part of the question dealing with hidden unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>I can now advise the Senate that:</PARA>
<PARA>* The best available information on hidden unemployment is the ABS estimate of discouraged jobseekers.</PARA>
<PARA>* The primary difference between discouraged jobseekers and the unemployed is that the former are not actively seeking work because they believe they would not find a job for one or more of the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> - they were considered too young or too old by employers;</PARA>
<PARA> - difficulties with language or ethnic background;</PARA>
<PARA> - they lacked the necessary schooling, training, skills or experience; or</PARA>
<PARA> - there were no jobs in their locality or line of work.</PARA>
<PARA>* The most recent discouraged worker figures are for September 1989, when ABS estimated that there were 76,100 hidden unemployed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>* This Government has addressed the problems of hidden unemployment in several ways.</PARA>
<PARA>* The Active Employment Strategy announced in the February Economic Statement incorporates a range of specific measures to encourage active job search and participation in the labour force. It seeks to maximise participation and minimise the number of long term unemployed who might otherwise become discouraged job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA>* All recipients of the new Job Search Allowance and NEWSTART Allowance, incorporated in the AES, will be required to undertake active job search and/or preparation for employment through training. Under the NEWSTART allowance, which is conditional on such activity, recipients will agree to accept training or other activities assessed by the CES as necessary to improve employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA>* The AES will provide for considerable enhancement of programs and program places to support the increased training activity.</PARA>
<PARA>* The changes build on a number of developments that have been introduced by the Government, particularly the successful NEWSTART strategy for the long term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>* I should mention also the provision made in this year's Budget for assistance to spouses of DSS beneficiaries and pensioners, previously a significant area of hidden unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> - $1.2M has been made available this year, and $2.5 in future years, under the Jobstart and Jobtrain programs which target especially disadvantaged job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA>* The Active Employment Strategy includes the most significant changes to assistance to the unemployed, including the hidden unemployed, in almost fifty years. Rather than simply doling out money and consigning people to long term or permanent unemployment, it emphasises training and support in getting people back into the labour market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I have some supplementary material to add to the answers I gave to Senator Hill and Senator Teague yesterday on the subject of sanctions and reports that Iran might supply food and medicines to Iraq in exchange for oil. Yesterday I said those reports needed to be treated with caution. That point holds even more firmly in the light of the supplementary information since provided to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Embassy in Tehran has reported overnight that its inquiries indicate that Iran intends to comply with the trade embargoes imposed on Iraq under United Nations Security Council Resolution 661. In addition, the Tehran Times newspaper, which I think was the source of the original report and which is certainly taken to reflect the opinions of President Rafsanjani, yesterday quoted an official Iranian spokesman as denying reports that Iran had agreed to send food and other supplies to Iraq in exchange for oil.</PARA>
<PARA> I note also that United States State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, commented yesterday that the United States has no evidence that commodities have been exchanged in any significant way between Iran and Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another theme of the questions asked yesterday. Mr Boucher also commented in relation to the remarks by the leader of the Iranian revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, criticising the United States presence in the Gulf region. Mr Boucher stated that these remarks appeared to be based on a misunderstanding of comments by United States Secretary of State Baker concerning regional security structures and arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Secretary Baker had, in fact, made clear in his testimony to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 5 September that the United States had no intention of imposing itself on the region but was concerned rather to assist in finding mutually acceptance arrangements which would help to guarantee peace and prosperity. Mr Boucher emphasised the United States had no particular model in mind, but remained committed to UN actions and to the role of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the question of full international compliance with sanctions obviously needs continued very close watching by the international community, including in relation to Iran specifically. That is not helped by jumping to conclusions on the basis of individual news reports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, yesterday I gave an undertaking to Senator Boswell to pursue his question as to whether the Government was investigating the disposition of the assistance package it had provided to the Ravenshoe Mill. The short answer to Senator Boswell's question is yes. The Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has provided the following response:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The mill is continuing to operate with all its work force. The mill went into receivership in April and the creditors are dealing with the receiver manager. The Commonwealth's agreement with the holding company was terminated in July 1989 since receivership constituted a breach of the agreement. Therefore, the Commonwealth has no existing agreement with the mill. The Commonwealth remains in close contact with the receiver manager. The company went into receivership for reasons related to the management of the holding company, which were not caused by World Heritage listing of the wet tropics.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Senate Boswell's specific question about the disposition of the assistance provided, financial advisers commenced an inspection of the company's accounts prior to the company going into receivership. Those inquiries were not completed, however, prior to the company going into receivership and these inquiries are now an active matter for the receiver manager.</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly wrote to the receiver manager on 19 June 1990 seeking the details Senator Boswell is requesting. On 27 June, the receiver manager wrote to Mrs Kelly to advise her that he could not meet this requirement at this time. The Government is still waiting for a detailed response from the receiver manager. The Government will determine whether further investigations are required when that information is available.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has provided approximately $7.5m in assistance to the Associated Plywoods Sales saw mill. About $3m was in operating subsidies and $4.5m in loans. The company has so far repaid $300,000 of the loan.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great honour to have been elected by the people of Victoria as one of their representatives in this chamber. I believe the Senate performs an indispensable role in our system of government. I am one who strongly supports the role of upper Houses in the Westminster system. Many of the developments in the Senate in the last two decades have enabled this chamber to act as a more effective House of review-a trend the founding fathers of our Constitution would have viewed favourably. The increasing powers of executive government have further emphasised the need for effective upper Houses. This chamber has acted responsibly in carrying out its constitutional duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My introduction to the Senate came when I was senior private secretary to Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. I was fortunate to work with Dame Margaret for five years. As one of the Liberal Party's and this nation's distinguished politicians, Dame Margaret showed that politics could be conducted with dignity and decency. She showed that a successful political career could be built without vicious personal denigration of opponents; that politics in sensitive portfolios could be conducted successfully without sordid deals with vested interests. I also had the great honour to work for a short period of time on the staff of Andrew Peacock, a man whom I regard as a great Liberal and good friend. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to this chamber after seven years at the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA), one of a number of private sector think tanks which expanded its activities in the 1980s. It was a valuable experience to work at the IPA with such talented people as Des Moore, Ken Baker, Dame Leonie Kramer, Hugh Morgan, Les McCarrey, Charles Goode and Sir James Balderstone. </PARA>
<PARA> The IPA has been active in promoting such public policy issues as smaller government, privatisation and micro reform. From time to time people as eminent as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) used to call such people troglodytes and reactionaries. Other observers, happily, have pointed to the significant role that these think tanks are having in promoting more market-oriented policies. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister said that he had changed his mind about privatisation. We on this side hope that he will change his mind about other policies such as the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the Government's new approach on privatisation. But its task in selling this new agenda to its own party has undoubtedly been made more difficult by its cynical attempt to whip up anti-privatisation fever in recent Federal and State elections. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very conscious of the support that I have received from many people in seeking a political career. I would like to take a few moments to acknowledge some who have been especially important to me. I am delighted that my wife, Daniele, and daughter, Nathalie, are in the gallery today. My son, Alexander, could not join the family because of other commitments. Without Daniele's strong support, it would not have been possible for me to stand for election. I am also pleased that my family are joined by my sister Rosemary and brother David, the honourable member for Goldstein. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great blessings anyone can receive is to have devoted parents. Here I count myself particularly rich. My mother has always had a very active interest in the wider concerns of politics, but I record here today how much I admire her other qualities, her family commitment, strength of character, her erudition and Christian principles. </PARA>
<PARA> My father was one of the founders of the Institute of Public Affairs, its Executive Director for more than 30 years, and, I might say, its inspiration. In this role he was very active in promoting the free enterprise philosophy. The importance of his work in this area has been acknowledged by a number of recent studies. He was a leading opponent of the fashionable socialist view which had achieved a degree of dominance in academic and, to a certain degree, in public service circles in the 1940s and 1950s. In that period he was one of what were an endangered species: a free enterprise economist. It has been generally acknowledged that his work made an important contribution towards turning back the onrush of socialism in Australia after the War. He was one of those who helped establish the intellectual climate in this country which contributed towards the final defeat of socialism as a credible philosophy in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to be part of the Liberal Party. I believe its traditions and principles reflect the values, hopes and aspirations of most Australians. My involvement with Liberal politics started at the University of Melbourne in the mid-1960s. I regularly meet with Liberal students, and it is particularly encouraging to me to witness the strength of the Liberal movement on so many campuses today. The vigour of the Liberal student movement reflects in part the strong reform agenda of liberalism in the 1990s. The Liberal Party of the 1990s has a special appeal to youth. Our platform calls for major economic and social reforms, which have often been vigorously pushed by Liberal students. I commend the Liberal student movement for its initiatives in promoting such important issues as voluntary student unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> I am conscious that my election to this chamber reflects the outstanding performance of the Liberal Party in Victoria in the last Federal elections. Anyone who is No. 3 on a Senate ticket-and I guess there are a few here today-benefits greatly from the effectiveness of his fellow State and Federal politicians. The strength of the Liberal Party organisation under Michael Kroger and Petro Georgiou also contributed mightily to the splendid State result we received in the last election. My good friends Julie Reid and Charles Gilles were with me at the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the philosophy of the Liberal Party, with its emphasis on the individual, free enterprise and liberty, is as relevant to the needs of the Australian people today as it was in the period of Alfred Deakin or Sir Robert Menzies. Indeed, of all the political philosophies that have dominated this century, it is liberalism as we recognise it in this country, and liberalism alone, that has stood the test of time. Who would now stand in this chamber and advocate socialism? Liberalism provides a rational framework for policy. Any philosophy which is not compatible with promoting maximum opportunities for the individual, which does not recognise the vital role of free enterprise and which does not protect the individual from oppressive governments and institutions, is doomed to failure in Australia. Therefore, I view with the deepest concern the development of what has been termed widely the corporate state in Australia, with its attendant powerful lobby groups claiming a key role in government decision making. There have been too many decisions that have not been in the public interest but have been to the advantage of powerful vocal special interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party offers a sharp contrast to that corporate state approach. Our guiding philosophy requires the party to pay particular heed not so much to the trade union bosses as to the trade union members; not to the powerful and sometimes politicised environmental groups, but to all Australians who are concerned about the environment; not to the social planners, but to the families struggling to bring up their children in a failing economy; and not to powerful business interests, but to the 700,000 men and women who are running Australia's small business enterprises. I view with a considerable amount of pride that the Liberal Party in so many areas is now regarded as setting the agenda for change. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the policies upon which our opponents regularly heaped contempt just a few short years ago, such as privatisation, labour market reform, smaller government and tariff reform are now the lights on the hill illuminating the direction in which the Government must go. Liberalism does not accept the view that politics and political processes provide the main answers to our economic and social problems. The wealth of our society lies in the experience and knowledge of our people. It is for this reason that our Liberal philosophy attempts to limit the political domain and emphasises the need for strong independent institutions to protect the individual and the community from executive power. Who would argue now with the fact that Australia would be a better place today if a number of our vital institutions, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, had been able and prepared to adopt a role more independent of government?</PARA>
<PARA> The alarming decline of an independent Public Service ethic has not, in my view, strengthened our body politic and is one of the factors behind the debacles that we have seen in public administration in the last decade. We are now witnessing a strong move to conscript our universities into the corporate state. Government policies, in recent years, I regret to say, have savagely limited their independence. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the intensely political role that the trade union leadership seeks to play in Australia benefits this nation or, indeed, the trade union movement itself. Like the major business lobby groups, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has no right to claim a special role in government decision making. I believe that this unique period in Australian history, when the trade union leadership has been effectively given a place at the Cabinet table, is now coming to an end. Australia's experiment with corporatism has been a disastrous failure. Despite the huge privileges which have been granted to trade unions, membership continues to decline as workers rebel against a union system which is not responsive to their own needs and has, in recent years, delivered falling living standards. The reform of the trade union movement must be an important element in any program of micro reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party supports trade unionism. Our program spells out how we can make trade unions more responsive to their members. A paradox which will not be lost on some observers is that the Liberal Party policy of voluntary enterprise unions which are fully accountable to their members may well be the only way to arrest the decline of unionism in this country. We need more, not fewer, unions; but the focus of this new union movement must be in the factories and business enterprises around Australia, representing directly and intimately the real interests of workers. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to a matter at the forefront of public debate. The Liberal Party philosophy emphasises that competitive markets are better than political processes, which are so often captured by special interests at reflecting individual needs and values. I see the Liberal Party program of privatisation as a means of increasing real public control and influence in many of our enterprises now under government control and ownership. Monopoly power, allied with a ready access to the public purse, often creates government enterprises which are insensitive to community needs, as well as being inefficient in their use of scarce resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has barely commenced the historic process of freeing its economy from large intrusive government. Overseas observers would undoubtedly be shocked by the pain in government circles caused by the partial privatisation of a few government enterprises. This is not to deny that government will continue to play an important role in the overall management of the economy-of course it will-but this does not mean that government should be in the business of regulating every nook and cranny of our economy or running business enterprises which would be run much more effectively in the private sector, as Senator Crane outlined this morning in his first speech. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways the decade of the 1980s is one of which Australia cannot be proud. By almost every comparative measure, Australia is in a worse position than at the start of the 1980s. I believe history books will record this period as a wasted decade. It has been a decade marked by economic failure. The scandals we have seen in government administration in Victoria and Western Australia, which have cost the Australian community billions upon billions of dollars, have no parallel in our history. The widespread corporate abuses of the 1980s have brought Australian business reputation to an all-time low. The economic standing of our nation is reflected in the oft-repeated statement that we are heading for Third World status. </PARA>
<PARA> The leading British journal the Economist publishes each week a series of comparative tables on the performance of major world economies. In practically every area-inflation, interest rates and balance of payments deficits-Australia has been one of the poorest performing economies. And to top it all off, we are now in the process of entering a serious recession caused essentially by internal economic mismanagement rather than, as in the past, external factors. </PARA>
<PARA> The malaise affecting Australia is not only economic. I have already pointed to the decline of some of our public institutions and the trade union movement. I would like to comment on some aspects of the legacy with which we have been left from the last decade. Survey after survey has indicated that politicians and parliament are at present held in low esteem by the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the lead that John Hewson has given in the short time he has headed the Opposition in highlighting the need to improve the operations of parliament and the behaviour of parliamentarians. The scandals which have plagued government administration and the business community have undermined public confidence in some of our central institutions. Perhaps the most serious has been the alarming decline in community standards. The increase in crime and mindless vandalism is well-known and well-documented. Deregulation in the business area gives greater freedom to individuals and managers. It has not always been accompanied by a necessary and corresponding increase in business and community responsibility. Freedom unaccompanied by responsibility leads to anarchy and the law of the jungle. Responsibility, we should always bear in mind, is the other side of the coin of freedom. The two are indivisible. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak a little on living standards. Australia's economic failure in the 1980s is reflected in the stagnation of family living standards. Real wages, for the first time since the war, have declined for most of the decade. This is a direct result of the accord, a savage tax regime which discriminates against families with children. The economic crisis in which we find ourselves will almost certainly ensure that family living standards will continue to decline. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent report showed that in no other period since 1945 has there been such a dramatic decline in living standards for the person on average weekly earnings. It is worth recalling that, in the period just after World War II, the individual on average earnings with a dependent spouse and two children effectively paid no taxes. I believe it is a central priority that not only do we carry out the economic reforms which will ensure Australian living standards can commence to rise again, but also we must look closely at the tax-government spending regime which imposes such heavy burdens on families. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to highlight an extraordinary feature of economic management over the last 20 years; that is, the acceptance of high unemployment as part of our economic arrangements. I agree with Mr Keating that unemployment is the major cause of poverty in this country. It is worth recalling that in the postwar period there was a consensus between the major political parties that high levels of unemployment could no longer be tolerated and for almost a quarter of a century unemployment figures were at levels which, by the standards of the 1970s and 1980s, could be considered unattainable. </PARA>
<PARA>  The lack of interest in the issue of unemployment reflects, I believe, an unwillingness to and, indeed, a fear of tackling labour market rigidities and the disincentives in our social welfare system. The latest figures show that, among young people in the 15 to 19 years age group looking for work, unemployment is now over 20 per cent and rising. In earlier periods, in the time of Chifley and Menzies, this would have been regarded as a national scandal. I believe that the Senate can help put a full employment policy back on the public agenda. We should conduct an inquiry into examining the methods by which we can return to a full employment economy. Do we believe what our predecessors could achieve in the 1950s and 1960s is beyond us in the 1980s and 1990s?</PARA>
<PARA> I have a particular interest in the development of small business in Australia. Small business, as Peter Boyle, the National Director of the Australian Small Business Association, points out, does not seem to rank in any importance in Australia's corporate state. Small business is one of the great outsiders. I agree with Peter Boyle when he argues that the single most important assistance for small business would be the deregulation of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the high interest rate policies pursued by government and its effect on small business. Comparative interest rates for business borrowings in Australia have been 5 to 8 per cent higher than those of our major competitors. This differential has been largely constant for the last eight years. It has come about as a deliberate policy and has had savage effects on business competitiveness and family living standards. How we can expect a major export industry to develop in this high interest rate environment is beyond comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980s Australia failed to address the major economic problems facing the nation. The lack of will in the economic arena can perhaps in part be traced to the negativism and lack of confidence that too many of our opinion leaders have in our nation. I say this because another feature of the last decade has been the growing tendency to denigrate our past without any sense of our nation's great achievements. This is clearly demonstrated by the debate surrounding the bicentennial program in which Senator Shirley Walters played quite a prominent role. </PARA>
<PARA> I have long been of the opinion that there is an astonishing gulf between the guilt-ridden view that many of our so-called elites have of Australia and the patriotism of our people. For those who may doubt this statement, I invite them to read the number of denigrating and uninspired histories of Australia which were released during the year. My good friend Ken Baker at the Institute of Public Affairs has been very effective at bringing this issue to public attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 Time Australia published a feature essay by a man often acclaimed as Australia's leading historian, Professor Manning Clark. It read, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the coming of the British was the occasion of three great evils: the violence against the original inhabitants of the country . . . the violence against the first European labour force in Australia, the convicts; and the violence done to the land itself. </PARA>
<PARA>The same year saw the publication of the four volume  A People's History of Australia Since 1788. This has been listed as a general resource in the course development and support material for the new Victorian Certificate of Education in Australian Studies in Victoria. It frankly admits in its editors' comments:</PARA>
<PARA>This history is critical-</PARA>
<PARA>It continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Held up against the millennia of Aboriginal experience, the last 200 years seem but a brief, nasty interlude. </PARA>
<PARA>This history, the editors claim, rejects myths of national progress and unity. Will this encourage schoolchildren to view their forebears with pride or with shame? Will it encourage them to work for a better Australia? The answer, I believe, is no. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Australian history has not been without its injustices and cruelties. Geoffrey Blainey, who is a notable exception to the tendency to look with rancour on the past, has written:</PARA>
<PARA>In the past 200 years Australia has had powerful achievements and every part of the nation has contributed to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Blainey writes:</PARA>
<PARA>A people's sense of history can unite or it can divide them. It is hard to instil a sense of purpose in a people who believe that history which formed them is worthless. </PARA>
<PARA>It is of great importance, Mr Deputy President, that the students of today have a proper appreciation of the achievements of our nation, of the struggles of our pioneer men and women, and of their fortitude and their courage. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the 1980s is in many ways a failure of leadership. It is not that we lack resources. Indeed, Australia is immensely wealthy in terms of its mineral and land resources. It is not that our people are not enterprising. Indeed, as a nation we can draw on the enormous vigour and determination of a migrant heritage. It is not that our people lack a strong commitment to our nation. There is every evidence that the Australian public has an uncommonly high degree of patriotic feeling compared with other nations, as I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is this: our leaders have constantly told us that their policies are working. How can we hope to address our economic problems when our political leadership will not take people into its confidence? The Australian people are waiting for leadership. The Liberal Party has a detailed program of reform, a philosophy reflecting basic Australian values, and a leadership determined to take the Australian people into its confidence and to honestly inform them of the steps which must be taken to put Australia back on the road to prosperity. It has a clear vision for Australia. I will be working to implement that vision. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we can give high praise to Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, no matter when, Senator McKiernan. Before lunch I was talking about amalgamations and the fact that unions have a history of amalgamations. Indeed, so do employer organisations. Perhaps the classic example of amalgamations is those unions which have gone into making the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. I have been speaking of the amalgamations which have taken place since 1972. In 1976 the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union amalgamated with the Federated Shipwrights and Ship Constructors Association to become the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union-the name was not changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1982 the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and the Federated Moulders Metal Union of Australia combined to become, again, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. I think it is presently in the process of amalgamating with ADSTE, the Association of Drafting, Supervisory and Technical Employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Metal Workers Union is a classic example of the benefits to be obtained from amalgamation. That union has done mighty work for its members and for the nation as a whole. One illustration, of course, is the way the Victorian branch of that union saved the shipbuilding yards at Williamstown and has helped to make them a viable and major economic unit in the economy of not only Victoria but also Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> So amalgamation is a process which is needed and which should be facilitated, and that is what this Bill does. It does it in the grand traditions of democracy. The amalgamations that will take place as a result of the Bill will take place pursuant to ballots by members of the unions which are to amalgamate. Senator McLean has referred to an exception to that and has quite accurately said that it is a proper exemption in the circumstances. He looked at that first. He had some reservations about it, but he is now assured that that exemption from the ballot is a proper procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill starts off by adding objectives to the Industrial Relations Act 1988, which I have already discussed. It then goes on to talk about demarcation disputes in this context:</PARA>
<PARA>In exercising its power in relation to a demarcation dispute, the Commission:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) must consider whether it should consult with appropriate peak councils that are representatives of organisations representing employees or organisations representing employers; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) may consult with appropriate peak councils.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission already has power to settle demarcation disputes by awarding work to a particular union. This enables it to make reference to peak organisations in reaching its decision, and that is a sensible reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The next clause I ought to refer to is clause 12, which sets 20,000 as the minimum number for a union. Again, this has been taken up by Senator Durack and Senator McLean. That figure is subject to an order by the designated presidential member that a small organisation may continue to exist if it is in the public interest for it to do so. Even though the standard is to be 20,000, the new legislation contains a provision to enable a much smaller union to exist if it is in the public interest to do so. It is not an overriding provision for a minimum number, but it is the standard which must be met unless it can be shown that a smaller number is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have been going through these matters I have noticed the entrance of Senator Burns into the chamber. In speaking of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union earlier, I should have paid tribute to him. He was the president of that union in Queensland, served it with great distinction and has brought into this chamber the experience he gained over the years. He has served this chamber with a great deal of merit and his presence has been of great benefit to the Senate, to the Government and the nation generally. I think that he is in agreement with the provisions of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of federations. This is a new concept that has been brought into the Act in the following way. Proposed section 236 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The existing organisations concerned in a proposed amalgamation may jointly lodge in the Industrial Registry an application for recognition as a federation. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about that provision. It is envisaged that where organisations which propose to enter an amalgamation want to join a closer relationship in the meantime they can do so under the provisions of proposed section 236. Before the ballot is taken they are able to come to some sort of relationship that is preparatory to a full amalgamation at a later date. That eases the way to amalgamation in a way that is not presently available and ultimately lends itself to a better organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 240 talks about approval by the committee of management. Before an amalgamation takes place the committee of management of the unions proposing to amalgamate must agree to a scheme by which the amalgamation will be forwarded. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 241 talks about the community of interest declaration that the organisations that are to amalgamate must exhibit before the presidential member gives the go ahead for the amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Act set out how the Industrial Relations Commission is to supervise the process of amalgamation. Proposed section 248 talks about how the Australian Electoral Commission is to be notified. It should be pointed out to those listening that the ballot for amalgamation is to be conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission, except in certain circumstances. The general rule will be that the Australian Electoral Commission will conduct a ballot by which the amalgamations are to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision within the new legislation for Yes and No cases for amalgamation to be put to the members. There is provision under proposed section 253J for a secret ballot of the members. There is provision under proposed section 253N for the way in which the approval of the amalgamation is to be forwarded after the ballot is conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 253ZD talks about validation of certain acts done in good faith. This is to cover a situation where there may be faults in the process under which the amalgamation takes place but which have been done in good faith. This gives power to the court to validate steps. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very quick run through of the provisions of the legislation, but it is enough to illustrate that the whole process of amalgamation is to be done in the context of a democratic process. The Industrial Relations Act 1988 ensures that democratic processes will be followed and ensures the ability of members of unions and of organisations registered under the Act to take a full part in the running of the organisations. It is therefore in keeping with the general thrust of the legislation brought down by this Government and it deserves to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp in his maiden speech, which I have already commented on and praised, spoke about the need for strong and vital institutions to stand up for the citizen against government. From the terms which the Opposition has used in the debate so far, it is clear that if it should ever become government, the workers of this country will need a strong and vital institution to stand up for them against the government which would then be in power. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation ensures that the union movement will be well equipped to withstand the onslaught that will eventuate if the Opposition ever forms a government. That union movement will provide the strong and vital institution to stand up for the citizens against the government which would then be in power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, I would like initially to identify in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, the area about which I agree with him and then deal with those areas or aspects with which I disagree. The part of the second reading speech with which I agree states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The achievement of good industrial relations in Australia is essential for the success of our economy and the furtherance of social justice.</PARA>
<PARA>That is about where our agreement ceases. In speaking to this Bill one has to make a number of judgments. Firstly, will it maximise our ability to be internationally competitive? Secondly, will it maximise efficiency in our domestic industries? Thirdly, will it effectively address our problems on the waterfront, in the transport industry, in our meat industry and elsewhere in our key industries? Fourthly, does it allow freedom of association? And, fifthly, does it protect the rights of the individual? In my judgment, the answer to all of these questions is no. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept that I most object to in this Bill is the concept of big is beautiful. This is a concept that has constantly failed Australia. I also object to the preference clauses in the Bill. There is no logic in giving preference to individuals just because they happen to belong to a union. In fact, it discriminates against the freedom of choice of an individual. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now highlight where Australia stands with regard to the International Labour Organisation convention No. 87, to which Australia is a signatory. I will quote from some parts of it. In part 1, the `Freedom of Association' section of the Convention states:</PARA>
<PARA>Article 1</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill contravenes a convention we are signatories to. I note Senator McLean's comments on exemptions, but I wish to say that, in my view, he is wrong. The only way we can satisfy this convention is to exempt all from the compulsory and privileged aspects of this Act. This `big is beautiful' Bill will only enshrine in legislation the unholy alliance between the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Government and some big businesses. Of course, one must note that some of these big businesses have gone into liquidation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that if in fact mega-unions were the answer, they would have been introduced in the marketplace. Trying to justify the Bill by citing farm organisations, as Senator Cooney did, is wrong. The restructuring of farm organisations was done at an enterprise level, and as an example I cite the National Farmers Federation-the general purpose organisation of farmers-the Australian Wool Council, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Grains Council of Australia. There are many others, and they are all autonomous, all enterprise based. In addition, at a State level I cite the Deer Breeders Association, the Goat Milk Producers Association and the Strawberry Growers Association, to name a few. Once again, they are all autonomous, all enterprise based-some big, some small. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is just a belated attempt to force individuals to become members of a union, to arrest the rejection of so many workers to voluntarily join unions and so vest power in the hierarchy of a few. I informed honourable senators in my maiden speech today of the economic position of Australia with regard to Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. It is worth repeating the position of Japan. Japan is the leading country in the ASEAN group. It has a current account surplus of $53 billion. It is also, in world terms, one of the leading industrial based countries. It has an enterprise system. </PARA>
<PARA> What will this Bill do to improve our international competitiveness? I believe little or nothing. Let us look at our position in the meat industry, in particular, the beef industry. In Australia, abattoir costs are $193 a head. In Uruguay, they are $82. Will this Bill effectively address this problem? No. This problem will be addressed only at an enterprise level within the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to state that I am not aware of one registered employer organisation who supports it. I am aware of many who oppose it. In fact, I have been contacted by a significant number who are absolutely and totally opposed to the big unions and preference clauses concept that is contained in the Bill. The only way we will become internationally competitive is with enterprise agreements, where the rewards are based on throughput. This Bill will enshrine in legislation enormous power in the hands of a few. It will do little to promote efficiency or harmony at the enterprise level and hence improve our international competitiveness, and as such it should be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>The tabling of these Finance minutes today reflects the ongoing concern of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the accountability of the Executive to the Parliament. Arrangements to ensure that appropriate action is taken in response to comments contained in the Committee's reports have been in operation since 1952. The arrangements have been that after a report by the Committee is tabled in the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Committee forwards a copy of the report to the responsible Minister. A copy is also forwarded to the Minister for Finance together with a request that the report be considered, and the Chairman subsequently be informed of actions to address the Committee's recommendations. The reply, in the form of a Department of Finance Minute, is then examined by the Committee and submitted, with comment if necessary, as a report to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In its Report No. 291, Revised Procedures for Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which was tabled in June 1988, the Committee advised that it would consolidate the tabling of all Finance Minutes into one annual report; the only exceptions being Finance Minutes that were urgent, lengthy or for some other reason required immediate reporting to the Parliament. The Committee tabled a consolidated volume of Finance Minutes for the first time in November last year. This consolidated volume of Finance Minutes was the Committee's 301st Report, appropriately entitled Finance Minutes! In this report the Committee noted that it intended to continue the practice of tabling all Finance Minutes received in a particular year within one volume, but that it also intended to make each Finance Minute available to Parliament as soon as practicable after it is received by the Committee. The reason for this action is to facilitate the progress of accountability. This action involves a slight revision of the procedures for handling Finance Minutes which were outlined in Report 291, which referred to only an annual tabling of Finance Minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the overall process of accountability is aided by the prompt tabling of Finance Minutes. This gives parliamentarians and the public an opportunity to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the responses by the departments to particular concerns and recommendations of the Committee. In turn, the Committee can only benefit from taking account of such comment when it considers the Finance Minute in detail at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The tabling of these Finance Minutes should not be taken to mean that the Committee is satisfied with the contents of the Minutes as the Committee reserves the prerogative of conducting detailed analysis of a particular Finance Minute at a later date. There have been instances where such analysis has led the Committee to a further formal inquiry. I would stress that while detailed analysis of a Finance Minute may follow-rather than precede-its tabling, this does not indicate the Committee has reduced in any way its oversight of the responses to the reports. Nor does it indicate any reduction in the importance with which the Committee views the Finance Minute process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Finance Minutes that I have tabled today deal with three recent reports of the Public Accounts Committee-on engagement of external consultants by commonwealth departments; on efficiency audits on safety principles for explosives in the Department of Defence; and on the Commonwealth's offsets program. I commend them all to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I protest at the lateness of this response. I make the point that the presentation of this response has been rescheduled at least three times this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate has been waiting for this report since November 1988. I believe that the only reason it has been made available at this time is as a result of the change of chairmanship of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Recently Senator Rosemary Crowley succeeded Senator Black as Chairman of the Committee. Obviously, Senator Crowley demanded that some action be taken. The previous Chairman, Senator Black, was also engaged in the preparation of the report dealing with drugs in sport. I believe that that was a worthwhile inquiry. Unfortunately, it tended to put this report to one side. </PARA>
<PARA> The response praises the beauty of Kakadu National Park. I totally agree with that comment. I spent quite a bit of time in the park when the Committee conducted inspections. We visited the better places, the drier places, the places where the buffalo herd used to run, Mudginberri station and other places. I certainly agree that it is a beautiful place and should be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean that we should not be looking at other uses for Kakadu. As I said, I have no argument with what has already been done, that is, the extension of the third phase of the Kakadu National Park by some 2,000 square kilometres. However, one must also look at other uses for the park. </PARA>
<PARA> The company that obtained leases at Coronation Hill many years ago was given every indication that if suitable ore was found there would be a fair possibility that mining would be permitted. This Government has done nothing but delay. Two inquiries are under way at the moment. One is considering the situation in sleeping sickness country and the other is centred on the South Alligator River. These inquiries have been going for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember the Government saying just before the election, when it was supposed to make a decision as to whether mining was going ahead or not, that that decision would be made after the election. That was a good six months ago now. Unfortunately, the Government has found another excuse for not making a decision. Page 1 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Kakadu conservation has been almost entirely incorporated in stage 3 of the park. A new 48 square kilometre conservation zone is the subject of comprehensive and concurrent inquiry processes relating to land use options for the entire zone. A resource assessment commission (RAC) inquiry is covering environmental and economic considerations. A second inquiry is being conducted by the chairman of the RAC and using common resources examining Aboriginal heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>That second inquiry, as I mentioned previously, is centred on the sleeping sickness country. Then follows, as far as I am concerned, the most relevant two lines in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> A decision on the Coronation Hill project will be made following the Government's consideration of reports from these two inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>How long do the people of Australia have to wait to make use of sustainable resources in Australia before the Government finally comes to a decision? I believe that if there is something to be done, we should look for an excuse to do it, not an excuse not to do it. That is the case here. There have been several inquiries. How many more inquiries are around the corner before the Government finally makes a decision?</PARA>
<PARA> How many more inquiries are there around the corner which will delay making a final decision? I believe that we will not get a decision during the term of this Government. If the Government makes a decision against mining, so be it, but this matter has been dragging on and on without a decision being made one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The exploration work on Coronation Hill, as I said before, has been going on for a long time. When the Committee was looking at the park and the proposed mining venture, the company produced a table showing some of the drilling results. I read the results as fast as I could, and some of them were quite fantastic. Up to 400 ounces a tonne were found in some drill holes. Australia could do with projects such as that but, unfortunately, a decision is not being made one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting Coronation Hill into perspective in relation to Kakadu National Park, the area is minute. Anyone who listens to the noises made by the radicals and those who want all resources closed up around Australia would think that Coronation Hill covered a large area in the better part of Kakadu. However, my view is that it is in the less pristine area of Kakadu National Park and certainly does not cover a great area. It is in stage 3, as I have said, and is minute in area when compared with the rest of the park. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the tables, the company constructed a contour model of the whole park. It was roughly one metre by two metres in size. One fellow said, BHP's proposed mine at Coronation Hill is in the model. Can you find it?'. Everybody looked, and then the man reached over into the middle of this contour map of Kakadu National Park and indicated a little area that was no more than half a centimetre square on the side of the hill; it was minimal. I was hoping to do a comparison of the size of that area with Kakadu National Park, but I have not been able to due to the report having been called on at short notice. However, it was very minute and was in a not very pristine area of the park. So when these radical groups-and I believe the Government is playing along with them to a certain extent-put out this sort of propaganda on size and the damage mining will do, I wish they would give us the proper perspective, because the area is minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> Millions of dollars have been expended by the company in its search for gold. It has not been able to get any result because of this Government's delay in coming to a decision. As I said before, if the Government made a decision that was against mining in Kakadu National Park, so be it. The company could then make a decision on whether it moved off or waited for appeals in the hope that the decision would be overturned. But no, this Government is just delaying and doing nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been waiting for this response since November 1988. Part of the reason for that delay was to get the last elections out of the way. That having been done, we still wait for the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now detail some aspects unrelated to the Coronation Hill matter. I was associated with the minority report of the Committee, which looked at other aspects of the inquiry, such as commercial fishing. That report recommended that the commercial fishing organisations that would be affected by the recommendations should be given some sort of compensation. That would not set such a great precedent because these things have been done before. A certain amount of compensation has been paid already, but obviously not enough, regarding the logging of certain forests in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Shark Bay has been included in the Government's hit list, although the Government denied about two years ago that it had ever heard of Shark Bay. The then Minister, Senator Richardson, denied that the Government had any proposals involving Shark Bay, but it now seems that the area will be closed off. I believe that compensation should be given to pastoralists and tourist operators who may be driven from the region. The Government has decided that no compensation will be paid to those in the fishing industry who will be affected by its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the inquiry into Kakadu National Park, much was made about the buffalo herd. Honourable senators will remember the famous remark by Senator Evans, probably while flying over the area, that it was only clapped-out buffalo country. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there were problems with brucellosis in the buffalo herd there, but there was a big drive to shoot the animals, to get rid of them, and ultimately most of them were destroyed. That activity was related to the Mudginberri station and the famous Mudginberri meatworks, which a lot of those on the other side of this chamber would like to forget. The National Farmers Federation and my colleague-I am proud to say-Senator Winston Crane, who made an excellent maiden speech today, along with Senator Kemp, took on the unions at Mudginberri. </PARA>
<PARA> With the elimination of most of the buffalo herd, the meatworks closed down. I am aware now, though it was not known to me at the time, that a buffalo herd, one hopes free from brucellosis, has been reintroduced to the region, for the purpose of providing rations for the Aborigines. That is good thinking. Many fears were expressed at the time the buffaloes were shot. The mentality of some of the radical groups who wanted to get rid of the buffaloes went beyond logic. Though there were campaigns to save the whales, to save the ducks in Western Australia, to save this and that, when it came to the buffaloes, which are beautiful looking animals I believe and part of the staple diet of the Indians in the mid-west of the United States of America years ago, I was surprised at their attitude. Only eight or nine years down the track that attitude has been reversed and a new buffalo herd has been introduced to provide food for the Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to what I said before, some fears have been expressed that certain weeds that only the buffaloes ate-from my experience in the grain area, I would describe them as tumbleweeds-have gone wild. Certain moves have been made to start aerial spraying in order to control the weeds that have taken over. It is two or three years since I have been to Kakadu National Park but, hopefully, due to the controlled introduction of brucellosis-free buffalo, some of the problems with the weeds might be eliminated. I look forward to the day when a reasonable number of buffalo herds return to the area, because natural control of those weeds is far better than aerial spraying, with all of its attendant problems. Furthermore, when there is a build-up of these weeds, other natural vegetation in the park is stifled off. So one can see that eliminating even an introduced species such as the buffalo has its side effects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government spokesman mentioned taking up the recommendations concerning the Office of the Supervising Scientist. I have not had time to go into those recommendations in detail because it has been two years since I have seen the report and I was unsure as to whether the subject would be discussed this afternoon, so I am uncertain which recommendations were accepted. The Office of the Supervising Scientist has a very important position in the park. It is funded through Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd and other mines that have operated in the area. Unfortunately, I believe that it has rather run away with itself in terms of its jurisdiction. In our minority report we have recommended that that Office should be moved to Darwin so that it is located in a living city rather than being holed up in the national park all the time. It could then see what it is like to be in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly believe that the Office did its job on the experimental side in the dissipation of water from the mining sites to natural vegetation. However, I believe that the anti-mining attitude of the Office is rather overzealous. I believe that in Australia today we need mining as much as we need conservation. In other words, we need a balanced situation. However, I will return to the recommendations concerning the Office of the Supervising Scientist at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in its response has examined the option of putting a levy on mining exploration, if it does get going in Kakadu National Park, to put the proceeds back into the park and into the native communities that operate the park. I believe that that is the right way to go. It will certainly not be the first place in the world where such a measure has been taken up, and hopefully the same situation will apply at Coronation Hill when mining occurs there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that a full and detailed plan for rehabilitation should be required before any mining operations are allowed at Coronation Hill. I do not think that companies such as Pancontinental Mining Ltd, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie would even think of starting mining ventures or projects today or putting such a proposition up to the environmental authorities if a detailed report was not in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted this recommendation, subject to its getting things moving. The Government recognises that Kakadu is an outstanding example of the original Australia. I agree with that. Much of the value of the area stems from the fact that there has been relatively little human disturbance. Even in the time that we were there, I believe that we probably walked over ground that had hardly ever been walked over by a white man before. Other areas of our continent have been overrun by goats, donkeys, rabbits or weeds. I realise that that has happened, especially in the eastern part of Australia where European colonisation took place. The settlers had no other option but to make a living from what was there, without destroying what was around. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have learned many lessons in 200 years. If mining is permitted at Coronation Hill, I am sure that these mistakes would not be repeated. There are measures to make sure that they are not repeated. Many mistakes have been made in the past, and many lessons have been learned; but that does not mean that we have to lock up our resources forever. This is a good time to talk about locking up resources because of the truck blockade around Parliament House in relation to the logging of our forests. I think the trucks are still there after we come in in the morning; we do not get another opportunity to go outside until very late at night. We have got to the stage where we should be looking at what we are doing in locking up our resources because Australia needs to be competitive with the rest of the world. In the two maiden speeches that were delivered today, it was pointed out that we are fast going down the gurgler. Therefore, we have to look at sustainable development. I am certain there is enough good thinking in Australia to ensure that we go down that path. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask that the next speaker seek leave to continue her remarks later so that my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne can contribute to this debate when he returns. Unfortunately he has been away this week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really appreciate the general tone of this response to the report entitled The Potential of the Kakadu National Park Region by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts regarding Kakadu National Park, particularly the opening gamut that Kakadu National Park is a very special place. I think anybody who has visited it would agree with that. I draw attention to the final statement in the response, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government will continue to give the protection of this globally significant area a very high priority and will not allow any activity that poses the risk of unacceptable damage to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the line that I think is very important to understand. I hope that the Government can follow through with that promise not to allow any risk of unacceptable damage to the environment of Kakadu. Having said that it is a very special place, I think it is important that the Government takes into very careful consideration not only the environmental aspect of life in Kakadu, but also the Aboriginal people's views about what should and should not happen there. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I was very privileged to be able to visit Kakadu National Park. Through the help of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS), I had a very good overview over several days of what is actually happening at the moment in Kakadu in terms of the management of tourism, the management of the fragile ecology and also the inclusion of Aboriginal people in the board of management. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of those respects I was very impressed indeed with the ANPWS officers whom I met in Kakadu. Not only were they helpful and good educators but also they seemed to be extremely committed to the ecology and Aboriginal interests. I was very impressed with their attitude and the great care that they take to include Aboriginal concerns in their deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, what is happening at the moment in Kakadu National Park is of a great deal of interest around Australia because it has World Heritage listing, and also because of the threat posed to it by the possibility of mining in the Coronation Hill region. The Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) is due to report to the Government by 25 April next year. Submissions are open to the RAC process at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, I must mention that the Jawoyn people, who are the traditional owners of the region that is under consideration-the stage 3 area of Kakadu National Park around the controversial Coronation Hill site-need more Government help in order to be able to make their submissions to the RAC. They have had a considerable amount of help in terms of a linguist interpreter but they need financial support-as other groups around the country have had financial support-to make well-considered submissions to the RAC. It would be good if more help could be forthcoming in the direction of the Jawoyn people, the traditional owners in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I was privileged to meet some of the traditional owners among the Jawoyn people. It is very important to put on record that only in a situation where they were under extreme pressure-and I noted that Senator Panizza wanted Senator Crichton-Browne to have a go on this issue later on in the debate-may it be said that certain words were got out of some of the Jawoyn people at a meeting at which Senator Crichton-Browne was present. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke to the traditional owners, and they have been canvassed by so many people. In fact, there is a great deal of exhaustion among the Jawoyn people because they have been asked over and over about this. They say, `Well, how many times do we have to tell you people? We don't want mining to go ahead at Coronation Hill'. It is very significant country to them. It is Sickness Country-Bula country to the Jawoyn people. They believe there will be very adverse reactions if further disturbance of the Bula country is allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there have been mines in the region before. There are six or seven leftover mines in the so-called conservation zone-very badly named, I might add, because conservation for mining is about what it has been-and there have been, over the period of those mines from the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, severe negative consequences for the Jawoyn people in terms of diseases which have gone right through the community. They do attribute this to the disturbance of the Bula country. They believe that if the Coronation Hill mine is allowed to go ahead there will be such severe disturbance of that spirit area in the Sickness Country that it could mean the end of the Jawoyn people. </PARA>
<PARA> We really need to take this very seriously on Aboriginal grounds alone. We need to listen to the age old wisdom of the people who have maintained this area, looked after this area, for thousands and thousands of years. Their word ought to be good enough. We should not allow the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) or any other company to mine in the Coronation Hill region or, indeed, in any other part of Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> We already have the whacking great Ranger uranium mine on the north-eastern edge. We cannot stop that, but it will be seeing out its life in the foreseeable future. We do not believe that there should be any further mining at either Koongarra or Jabiluka in that region allowed to go ahead. The fact that it is uranium certainly compounds the problem because there are so many negative environmental consequences associated with uranium mining. The proposal of BHP is for gold, platinum and palladium so it does not involve that very controversial mineral, but I submit that there are plenty of other places where there are rich deposits of those minerals, and because this area is so special it should be left free of the ravages of mining. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also privileged to meet people from the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) in the national park region. Of course, it has a very close association with the Ranger uranium mine. I also went over the Ranger uranium mine and found that very interesting indeed. However, I think that the advisory and monitoring role of OSS at the moment is very limited. It does a very good job, as far as it has the capacity to do it, in those respects-in advising and monitoring what is going on with the mining that is already taking place within the park. That is an historical problem which certainly does not bear repeating. </PARA>
<PARA> But the OSS really needs some teeth. It really needs to be able to prosecute if a company goes outside the guidelines for operation, as has happened many times with Ranger. On environmental grounds, the South Alligator River system needs to remain intact as an entire river system. Justice Fox in his report in 1978 said very clearly that the entire South Alligator River system needed to be maintained as an integrated river system free of the risks of mining. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the final line of this Government response-that no activity should be allowed that poses a risk of unacceptable damage to the environment. I submit that if permission is given for the BHP mine to go ahead in the Coronation Hill region it would pose serious consequences for the environment. The proposed tailings dams would be within 400 metres of the South Alligator River, and that is far too close for comfort because of the leaching that could take place from the cyanide used in the processing of gold, platinum and palladium. So it is too great a risk to take, in my estimation. </PARA>
<PARA> On environmental grounds alone the Government should not allow BHP to go ahead; on Aboriginal grounds alone the Government should also leave Kakadu National Park free of any further ravages of mining. BHP should be given a very firm no. So should Pancontinental and Denison, as they will no doubt try in the future to open up further uranium mines if Government policy changes, which I would regret greatly, or if the Opposition got into government and had a different policy about uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that people in the community around Australia understand that they do have the option of making submissions to the Resource Assessment Commission, which is looking at both the environmental aspects and the Aboriginal heritage aspects. From what I heard in the Northern Territory, I was impressed that the RAC commissioners are listening very attentively to the voice of the Aboriginal people, as they will no doubt be listening very attentively to the mining lobby and conservation lobby as well. They need input from the Australian community. This is not just a Northern Territory issue. It is important not only for the rest of Australia but as a global issue because of Kakadu's special properties. Once a place is listed for international heritage on the World Heritage List, it means that it is a mecca for tourists. This is another side of the management that the ANPWS needs to be very cautious about-that we do not love our parks to death. But because of the World Heritage listing, this is a special place that has very special status in global terms and should be preserved for future generations as such.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government response which has been tabled this afternoon in respect of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts relating to the potential of the Kakadu National Park region is naturally one that vitally affects many of my constituents in the Northern Territory. The response that has been made by the Government gives me cause for concern, not only because the report was not made available to senators in reasonable time in which to consider it and respond to it; in fact, I have had to jump after having quickly read the response here in the chamber. I am sure many other senators have not yet had time to look at it in detail or study it in any way whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that the response is basically limited to 3 1/2 A4 pages is really just a disgrace. It shows up the attention which the Government has given to, I think, some 39 recommendations which were made in the Senate's report. It has bulked them together into bulk considerations and made comments such as, `Many of the recommendations are already encompassed by existing government policies and procedures'- and then put down the various recommendations. Or it says, 'The plan of management of such and such an area covers . . .' and lists them all. There is no comment or response that is meaningful or that discusses, debates or argues in any way whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the Government has a hidden agenda with regard to this region of Australia, Kakadu. Because the word `uranium' is mentioned we know that the Australian Labor Party runs even further away from the issue; it duckshoves it out into various committees of its national council and asks them to report. In this coming month or two the Labor Party will bring on a special conference to discuss other current issues but is not game to bring out the report of its own committee which is looking at the long term implications for the development of uranium mines in Australia. It is not game to face up to the decent debate that is being demanded by the community on environmental and economic grounds. The issue is being covered up and duckshoved. I believe that the response today also is indicative of the pure politics that the Labor Party is playing on this one by attempting to now put it in the rubbish bin. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues addressed affect all of our industries, whether in the Northern Territory or nationally-not only the important uranium and nuclear issues that must be debated adequately in the community but also industries such as tourism, the broader mining perspectives of areas such as Coronation Hill, fishing, national park administration, buffaloes and other wildlife, et cetera. I am disgusted at the Government's complete lack of regard for the major issues addressed in the report itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I am not surprised. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory made a submission to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in June of last year, June 1989, with regard to the transfer of power to the Northern Territory for full self-government. Many of these issues were addressed very adequately and properly in that now very public submission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government response today to the Senate report into the crucial area of national park administration does not even mention whether the matter put forward by the Northern Territory Government is under consideration. Even if the Government is choosing not to pick up Chief Minister Perron's proposals or reactions, the Government response does not address the issues. The issues of national parks, uranium mining and environment legislation were all properly addressed in the Chief Minister's submission to the Prime Minister of June 1989. What has now been tabled in response to this important Senate report does not comment on any of those important constitutional, environmental, economic and development issues that should meet with much more adequate and proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to note that during the last Federal election campaign the Liberal and National parties covered many of these issues in their Economic Action Plan and in the wide range of policies that they put forward. They were covered in our environment policy, our Aboriginal policy, our resources and energy policy. Our policies picked up issues relating to Aboriginal land matters, the administration of national parks, the operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region and the key issue of the administration of national parks themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Liberal and National parties will continue to give very close attention to these matters over the coming years and, of course, in the lead-up to the next Federal election campaign. The real challenge to the Government is to make sure that the environment is properly managed, that Aboriginal interests are properly coordinated and considered, that the economic barometers are properly read and that the opportunities for the development of jobs and energy resources of the world are properly accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have been insulted with this particular response which in no way addresses any of these fundamental issues. The Government has again walked away and chosen to hide behind the camouflage of reports that it has coordinated by the Resource Assessment Commission and a series of other reports relating to Aboriginal matters. Whenever it gets into a difficult corner, the Labor Party hides and covers up. It is not prepared to face up to the facts. It will only be as we give leadership on this side of the Parliament in these issues over the coming months that we will see the Labor Party properly react, properly pick up some of our issues, as it is now seeking to do in a number of other important policy areas. Unless it addresses the real undercurrent, the proper issue of the economy of Australia, there is no way that reports such as this will be given proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that in the coming weeks the Senate will be able to spend more time on both this report and the inadequacy of the Government's response. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has concluded that there is a need for the provision of a new Dedicated Computer Centre for the Australian Taxation Office at Bruce, ACT. The proposed new centre will have an area of 6,300 square metres encompassing two levels. The mainframe computer will be on the upper level, while a number of support activities will be on the lower level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the need for the dedicated facility stems from a number of factors, including a need for the Taxation Office to operate computer systems at two sites, the nature of the existing facilities, especially at the Parkes site, the modernisation program now under way within the Taxation Office and the non-availability of alternative accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending that the work proceed, the Committee believes that the Taxation Office and Australian Construction Services should review the requirement for dual independent power supplies to the building, in view of the provision of substantial backup facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also focused attention on the question of the energy efficiency of the building. It was claimed that energy efficiency and management would be a prime consideration. The report notes that, whilst measures will be included to produce an energy efficient building, there is no evidence of the magnitude of the cost savings which these measures could produce. The Committee therefore gives notice that the inclusion of design and engineering principles designed to improve the energy efficiency in new buildings will be kept under close scrutiny. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be seeking leave to table documents today. If it is refused, that is fine. I will just cite the fact that I would normally have been seeking leave. If the other procedures are, as you have suggested, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I pass those documents over for perusal beforehand, which has been a convention-and I accept that-it places into the hands of somebody other than myself the decision as to whether I table that document in support of my allegation. Frankly, I believe that I am the one who should make the decision as to whether I choose to table or not to table documents in support of my allegations. I do not deny the fact that other senators have their right to make a judgment but, frankly, I believe that I am the one who should make the judgment about whether a document is relevant to an allegation that I am making. So I was frustrated by that procedure yesterday. I may be frustrated again. I may have to devise an alternative procedure, but I have not been able to do so in the meantime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was describing to the Senate a very complex case of Mr and Mrs Rigg of Nowra who were encouraged by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to enter into what was known as an offshore borrowing option. Offshore borrowing options became quite common between 1984 and 1986. It is estimated that approximately 1400 Australians were enticed into this attractive bank product and, as a result, went bankrupt and lost their businesses and their farms. I contend that it was a deliberately contrived banking practice that contravened the fiduciary relationship, which is the fundamental obligation on the bank to consider the interests of clients and the interests of the bank equally. It was driven by the new modus operandi under deregulated banking of maximising profit at virtually all cost. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not entitled to legal aid. I was in the process of elaborating on the mechanism of this procedure of offshore borrowing options. I had been citing a number of documents, and I was elaborating on why the bank would insist upon customers accepting an exchange risk, which is an inherent risk in this procedure, as opposed to accepting it itself. I was citing a bank memorandum from the Corporate Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank, dated July 1984 and entitled, 'Simulated Currency Loans'. It gives an example of simulated currency borrowings that the customer wishes to simulate. 'Simulate' is a key word. We are talking about pretend, unreal loans that never actually become a reality. They were contrived and simulated, and that variant is a very important point. The memorandum gives an example of a simulated currency borrowing where a customer wishes to borrow a simulated, say, Swiss franc borrowing for the equivalent of, say, $1m for six months. In this example we assume from the starting date of the transaction that the Commonwealth Trading Bank Swiss franc selling rate, the spot rate, is 1.9985, while the six months forward rate is 1.9311. The memorandum states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In effecting a 'simulated borrowing' the customer obtains AUD 1 million net finance by say drawing bills under an acceptance/discount facility for face value of $1,064,603 which provides for discount and bank margin of $64,603 (all up interest cost of 13.1% p.a. on 365-day basis). </PARA>
<PARA>The customer sells forward in Swiss francs for six months to the equivalent of his Australian dollar commitment including interest-that is, $1,064,603 at 1.19311, which equals 2,055,855 Swiss francs. We presume that the spot exchange rate for Australian dollars and Swiss francs does not change between the start date and the maturity date of the transaction. At the maturity date, the customer would receive a compensation payment for the close out of the forward contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale price of the original contract would be $1,064,603, and the purchase price in Swiss francs, as I said, was 2,055,855. A table shows the consequences of that transaction, and I seek leave to incorporate that brief four-line table, rather than attempt to verbalise it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The outstanding feature that emerges from this example is that the customer has already been locked into an expensive bill facility. Upon the drawing down of the bill, the net finance of $1m is credited to his account. Upon the maturity of the bill, the gross amount of $1,064,603 would in the normal course be debited to the account and the customer would be liable for the bill drawing down cost of $64,603. What the bank is saying is that if the customer enters into a simulated foreign currency loan and makes a profit on the exchange risk that profit will soften the bill draw-down costs-in this example by $35,904. It is quite evident that the bank used the exposure to the exchange risk as a marketing ploy to induce customers to accept the expensive bill facility. What is happening therefore is that this softening of the risk is being used to induce people into transactions. The other reason for the bank insisting upon its customers accepting an exchange risk is self-evident. In the example given above, there is a qualification:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the final result of a simulated borrowing, as with an actual foreign currency borrowing, will depend upon the movement in the spot rate of exchange for the currency(ies) involved. </PARA>
<PARA>What this means, in effect, is that if there was a downward movement in the Australian dollar against the Swiss franc, the customer would suffer a loss and that loss would be added to the bill's draw-down costs. If the bank had been honest it would also have given an example showing how the exchange loss would increase the bill's draw-down costs, but of course the bank was not motivated by honesty; the bank was motivated by greed, as I outlined yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> On 9 October 1984, the bank held a seminar at Wollongong. Mr Rigg's financial adviser attended the seminar. Mr Rigg later attended a similar seminar at Nowra. At Wollongong Mr Phil Henshaw, the bank's senior foreign exchange dealer, delivered a paper entitled Management of Foreign Exchange Risk. The paper dealt with offshore versus domestic financing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear from an examination of the paper and the notes that Mr Henshaw was promoting the same scheme as referred to in the example above. That is, the customer commits himself to the bill costs and, depending upon the currency fluctuations, makes a profit which softens the bill costs or, alternatively, makes a loss that increases those costs. Again, no example is given of a case where a customer makes a loss that increases the costs. What Mr Henshaw was promoting at the seminar was nothing more than a shabby ploy to line the bank's pockets at the expense of customers and, I would suggest, clearly in breach of the fiduciary obligations under law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>By a letter dated 5 June 1985, the bank made an offer to Mr Rigg which reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have approved facilities on the following basis:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Anthony Thomas and Dorothy Anne Rigg</PARA>
<PARA>A Bills Discount/Endorsement Facility (including a Simulated Foreign Currency Loan Option) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Your covering fully at maturity of the hedge contract, any exchange loss that might eventuate should an adverse exchange rate movement occur. The Bank will discount each bill in accordance with market practice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>2. Tony Rigg Welding &amp;Manufacturing Pty Limited</PARA>
<PARA>An overdraft limit . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We confirm acceptance of the Bank's offer. </PARA>
<PARA>(Signed: A T Rigg D.A. Rigg. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave not granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I offer copies of that letter to anybody who seeks them from my office. I presume that for all of the annexures that I will be referring to hereafter this will be the situation. The bank contracted to provide Mr and Mrs Rigg personally a bill discount facility with simulated foreign currency loan option. The bank contracted to provide to the Rigg company an overdraft facility. Mr Steve Bennett of the bank's Nowra Branch had handed to Mr Rigg a copy of the memorandum dated July 1984 entitled `Simulated Currency Loans' and which I previously described. Mr Rigg states that he accepted the bills discount facility in reliance upon the representations made in the memorandum and the representations made by Mr Henshaw to his financial adviser that the simulated foreign currency loan would soften the costs payable on the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bank even congratulated itself on the representations made to Mr Rigg and his financial adviser. A bank memorandum of Mr W. J. O'Reilly, Acting Senior Manager, Nowra Branch, dated 6 May 1985 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an invitation was extended to Mr Rigg to attend a seminar conducted by this office by Group Treasury staff on foreign currency lending. Mr Rigg was impressed with the obvious expertise the bank has in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Any shading of fees will create a good impression with (Mr Rigg's financial advisor) with whom we have a good working relationship. He is likely to refer more of his clients to us if he knows we are prepared to be flexible . . . He conducts his personal banking with us and we consider it only a matter of time before we obtain the business connection as well. </PARA>
<PARA>The memorandum, which was addressed to the Regional Manager, also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Your office is well aware of our recent marketing efforts in this area and the substantial gains made from other banks. Approval of this application will further our sound reputation in the local business community. </PARA>
<PARA>When Mr O'Reilly wrote those words he was not to know that the approval of that application would lead to the bank being regarded with hatred, ridicule and contempt by the local business community for the manner in which it breached its fiduciary responsibility and pursued a practice which subsequently sent approximately 1,400 small businesses to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank did not provide to Mr and Mrs Rigg the bills discount facility in accordance with the market practice. The bank did not provide to Mr and Mrs Rigg the simulated foreign currency loan. On 7 April 1986 the bank offered Mr and Mrs Rigg, and Mr and Mrs Rigg accepted, a fixed rate bills discount facility. The bank did not provide that facility either. What the bank did was to provide a series of sham bill transactions, whereby the bank pocketed not only the usual fees and margins, but the interest as well. Moreover, the bank, by fraud, debited the bills roll-over costs to an overdraft account of the company, thereby earning additional compounded overdraft interest on these debits. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of that fraudulent conduct was that the bank absorbed the company's working capital and crippled the business, thereby destroying valuable export earnings for Australia. The Senate will recall that I cited an example in which I made similar observations about the Huon Valley Springs saga. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank well knew the standing and potential of Mr Rigg's business. The bank well knew the consequences to Mr Rigg and his family that would flow from any fraudulent misconduct. I refer again to the memorandum dated 6 May 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rigg has proven management ability and the Company has shown it can operate profitably . . . The arrangement with Lysaght Brownbuilt Industries and the assistance of the Department of Trade should ensure that lucrative overseas markets will open up . . . As the Company will be earning offshore income it will have a natural hedge against exchange rate movements for its foreign currency option . . . This will be the first simulated borrowing at this office where an exporter has been involved. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the phrase:</PARA>
<PARA>This will be the first simulated borrowing at this office where an exporter has been involved. </PARA>
<PARA>The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The overall project is considered viable as it will be the only warehouse of its type south of Wollongong, where the majority of building trades will be represented. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier I suggested that if the bank wanted to go behind market practice with a sham transaction, it would discount the bill to itself and insert its own name as an acceptor of the bill-a procedure which I outlined yesterday. The bill would be kept at the customer's branch of the bank and would not be negotiated on the open money market. That is what happened in the Rigg incident. </PARA>
<PARA> The seeds for the fraud were sown in the memorandum dated 6 May 1985, where the Riggs' repayment capacity was demonstrated, in summary, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A T &amp;D A Rigg:...86,000</PARA>
<PARA> Tony Rigg Welding and Manufac-</PARA>
<PARA>turing P/L:...56,470</PARA>
<PARA>Their total capacity to pay was $142,470, less various items amounting to $24,800; the net amount was $117,670. The memorandum concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>$117,670 will be available to meet an estimated interest expense per annum of $75,175 on the bills discount/endorsement facility of $485,000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What the bank was saying was that the capacity of Mr and Mrs Rigg to service the bill facility would be dependent upon utilisation of the income of the company to supplement income derived from Mr and Mrs Rigg. This was taken further in a letter from the bank to Mr and Mrs Rigg dated 26 February 1986. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have reservations as to your ability to meet interest costs on your indebtedness once the development is fully completed and tenanted. The following table is an assessment of estimated net income and interest costs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is a table of about eight lines which is in fact contained within the letter. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The bank is now saying that the whole of the net income of the company will be required to service the loan-a different requirement from that which it had outlined in a previous memorandum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bank is now foreshadowing an interest rate of 20 per cent per annum on the bill facility. The bank is now foreshadowing that the servicing of that exorbitant interest rate will absorb all the income of Mr and Mrs Rigg in the company. What happened to the simulated foreign currency loan? What happened to the overall interest factor of 5.66 per cent, shown in the earlier table in the bank memorandum dated July 1984? What happened to Mr Henshaw's estimated 8 per cent per annum in the light of this now incurred 20 per cent per annum?</PARA>
<PARA> How could the bank take the benefit of the 20 per cent interest for itself? The answer is simple: discount the bill to itself. That is what happened-because it had left this option open to itself. How could the bank ensure that the net income of the company serviced the interest? The answer is simple: debit the interest to the overdraft account of the company. That is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there was a problem. If the net income of the company was to service the interest, the only working capital available to the company was the overdraft facility. If the interest payments were debited to the overdraft account, those debits could take the overdraft over the approved limit, causing the bank to bounce cheques and effectively cripple the business-and that is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the bank well knew the consequences of its fraudulent conduct. In a diary note by Mr G. S. Judge, Senior Manager of the Nowra branch, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rigg telephoned to complain about the dishonour of the company cheque for $4,310. Interest of $6,860.80 was charged on 23 December 1986 which took the balance over the temporary limit of $138,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Judge knew the bank was crippling the Riggs' business. Why did he do nothing about it? Why did he not reverse the fraudulent debits out of the overdraft account? Why did he not implement a simulated loan without exchange risk?</PARA>
<PARA> In a letter from Mr G. R. S. Kyngdon to Rigg, dated 19 February 1987, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We understand your concern that the interest charges on the bills are placing heavy pressure on the company's overdraft account and restricting your ability to continue to trade. To alleviate this problem we are prepared to allow temporary excesses on the overdraft account of 150,000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would normally have sought leave to table that letter, but a copy is available. That was a stupid and meaningless gesture. The next interest debit took the overdraft over the new limit. Kyngdon knew the bank was crippling Rigg's business. Why did he do nothing effective about it? Why did he not reverse the fraudulent debits out of the overdraft account? Why did he not implement a simulated loan without exchange risk?</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the reason Judge and Kyngdon did nothing effective was that they did not want to. I suggest that the bank had embarked upon a deliberate strategy calculated to extract every last drop out of the Riggs. I suggest that the bank did not care if the Rigg business was crippled. I suggest further that the bank wanted Rigg to go under, so that the bank could realise on its first mortgage security. In June 1987 the bank's fraudulent conduct finally crippled Rigg's business. A letter from Mr G. S. Judge to the company dated 19 June 1987 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We regret that we are not in a position to honour further drawings including your weekly wage cheque unless covering funds are provided. </PARA>
<PARA>I would normally have sought leave to table that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the documentary evidence of the fraud. Bills were drawn down or rolled over on 34 separate occasions. Upon each occasion the transaction was evidenced by various documents prepared and issued by the bank. The first bill was discounted on 14 August 1985. The action sheet prepared at the bank's Nowra branch shows the following: first, the names of the customers were A. T. and D. A. Rigg. All subsequent actions named the customers as A. T. and D. A. Rigg. Second, the account number of the customers was 181.407. That number was crossed out and the number 181.415 inserted, that is, the current number of the overdraft account of the company. That is significant. That action enabled the fraud whereby the bill draw-down, or roll-over costs, representing interest on the transaction, together with the bank's usual fees and margins, were debited to the overdraft account of the company. All subsequent action sheets nominated the account number of 181.415. The third matter appearing on the action sheet was that upon the draw-down of the bill the net proceeds of the transaction, that is, the face value of the bill less the interest, fees and margins, were credited to account No. 181.829. All subsequent action sheets showed the net proceeds as crediting account No. 181.415 or, when the bank's accounting procedures were changed, showing the interest and margins as fees debited to the account, which had the same result for the customer. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only a little more to present and I shall have to return to this on a future occasion. What I am doing, quite deliberately, is putting into the Hansard a classic case of the exercise of the overseas currency option debacle. The Rigg case is an outstanding one, and I am putting it in detail so that it can be read and observed by other Australians. On a future occasion I shall have to return to the short remaining explanation of that account. </PARA>
