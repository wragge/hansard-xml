<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the procedures laid down in standing order 81 and the Privilege resolutions of 25 February 1988, Senator Newman has raised with me a matter of privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter which she has raised relates to whether evidence given before Estimates Committee B in May this year in relation to the use of asbestos by the Royal Australian Navy was misleading.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the procedures prescribed by the Senate, I am required to determine whether a motion to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence of other business, having regard to the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its Committees and for Senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respective matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA>In making my determination, I do not make a judgment on the facts of the matter raised or on the question of whether any contempt has been committed.</PARA>
<PARA> In previous rulings I have indicated to the Senate the way in which I apply this criteria. I have given precedence to a motion if I consider that the matter raised is capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting criterion (a), and if there is no other readily available remedy.</PARA>
<PARA> I consider that a motion relating to the matter raised by Senate Newman ought to have precedence, having regard to the criteria. The Senate has always taken very seriously any suggestion that misleading evidence has been given to a Senate Committee. Senate Newman has drawn my attention to the fifteenth report of the Privileges Committee, indicating the seriousness with which that Committee regards the obligation of witnesses to give evidence which is not misleading in any respect. I have had regard to that report in making my determination.</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore determine that a motion to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence over other business.</PARA>
<PARA> I table the letter from Senate Newman and the documents which she provided. I call on Senate Newman to give a notice of motion.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I have great pleasure, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, in presenting the Flags Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for amendments to the Flags Act 1953 to ensure that the Australian National Flag is not altered except with the approval of the Australian people voting in a referendum, that the Australian National Flag is not supplanted by use of the powers under the Act, and that the appointment of other flags and ensigns is subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes strongly in the integrity of the National Flag as it is presently designed and responds to a strong feeling in the community that it should not be altered without approval from the Australian people at a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has already been introduced to the House of Representatives and I look forward to the opportunity to debate it in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people today talk rather vaguely about having our own flag because we are now `grown-up' and `independent'. As somebody has already said, we gained our flag because we are already grown-up and independent. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1901 the Flag of Australia design contest drew some 32,000 entries and I understand five of the entries were considered of equal merit. The final design incorporated each of the features suggested by those five. As a symbol of a British settlement it made use of the Union Jack, in the form of the British Blue Ensign. But most conspicuously it displayed the five stars of the Southern Cross from which the early discoverers (Cook) of our land plotted their passage. An additional large, white star was placed in the hoist. This corresponds with nothing in the sky, it is purely symbolic of the Australian Commonwealth, its seven points representing the six States and the Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The flag was created at the same time as the Commonwealth of Australia itself was inaugurated under the slogan `One people: One Destiny: One Flag'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Flag was accepted immediately by the people, and, although originally intended mainly for use by the Government and Armed Forces, by 1947 it had become so popular that Prime Minister Chifley announced it was to be flown `freely' and `with appropriate respect'. In 1953 Prime Minister Menzies and Opposition Leader Calwell both strongly supported the Flag Act, signed personally by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mr Calwell's words, `it represents something of immense value' and `therefore we ought to give it great respect and teach our children to feel that while it flies there is hope for Australia and its future'. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Queenslander I must add that the first official unfurling of the Australian National Flag, the Blue Ensign, was at the opening of the Townsville Town Hall on 16 September, 1901 by the Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun. Earlier that month Prime Minister Barton and Lady Hopetoun opened the ceremony for the naming of the winning design at the Exhibition Building in Melbourne and the flag was flown from the great dome. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this history as the passing of time can lead to distortion and neglect. The creation of the National Flag is an important part of our history which should not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> Every move by the Opposition to protect the flag and prevent it being changed without the approval of the Australian people by referendum has been thwarted by the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been trying to make legislative provision for such protection since 1985. But on that occasion and two subsequent ones Labor has blocked amending Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Following his flurry of national fervour during the Bicentennial year Prime Minister Hawke would have us all believe the Labor Government and its apparatchiks in the Labor movement have no such wish. </PARA>
<PARA> But can they be taken at their word? As recently as 1981 the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I think we can do rather better than the present undistinguished and indistinctive bit of cloth which we have inherited from our colonial past and which manifestly does not set anybody's pulse racing in the community at large except, perhaps the occasional Returned Services League blimp or a proportion of the tory backbench opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>This from the same Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who wore a Ho Chi Minh badge whilst on official Australian Government business in Vietnam. Four hundred and twenty-four Australians sacrificed their lives in battle against Ho Chi Minh's Marxist Leninist revolutionary North Vietnamese forces. Tens of thousands of Australians of Indo-Chinese origin were forced to leave their homes in Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos because of oppression by liberation movements generated by Ho Chi Minh and his ilk. Surely they would find the Minister's attitude sinister?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no doubt that the majority of Australians, of every differing status, race and creed, are drawn together by the symbol and history of our present National Flag. The Opposition also believes that the Labor Government and Labor Party have people within their ranks who cannot be trusted with the legislation as it now stands. We believe that in the event of a change the people of Australia must be consulted. We believe that the Flags Amendment Bill must be debated fairly, and as a consequence brought into law. </PARA>

<PARA> The Bill proposes a variety of amendments to Acts dealing with defence matters. The more important amendments:</PARA>
<PARA>A. Amend defence force retirement and death benefits legislation to increase the orphans' benefit from $702 to $5000. </PARA>
<PARA>B. Remove restrictions on the Chief of the Defence Force's power to make single service command appointments and organisational arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>C. Modify provisions relating to the enlistment of soldiers and sailors to enable the open ended enlistment scheme to operate more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>D. Amend Commonwealth acts to replace references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation with references to the Defence Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments:</PARA>
<PARA>A. Remove redundant provisions dealing with seniority. </PARA>
<PARA>B. Amend the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to replace obsolete references to the offence of rape with references to the current A.C.T. provisions that have replaced that former offence. </PARA>
<PARA>C. Amend the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No. 1) 1985 to remove an unnecessary provision dealing with allotments. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with the more important amendments. The other changes are explained in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Orphans benefits</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The increases in the orphans benefits proposed by the amendments in schedule 2 are those that the government announced in both Houses of Parliament on 11 May 1989 in responding to the report on personnel wastage in the Defence Force by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (the Cross Committee). As was then indicated the level of orphans benefits under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme were considerably less than those under the Commonwealth superannuation schemes. The increase of some $4300 for each orphan will correct the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The total benefits payable in respect of the orphans of a deceased member or pensioner will be capped at the maximum rate of pension that would have been payable to the member or pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> About 140 orphans will benefit immediately from the increases. </PARA>
<PARA>Command power of the Chief of the Defence Force</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Current command arrangements allow the Chief of the Defence Force to command all operations conducted by the Australian Defence Force. These arrangements have been put into place as a result of the on-going process of refining the command of the Australian Defence Force. They are the result of implementing the recommendations of a study into ADF command arrangements conducted in 1987. The existing legislation obliges the Chief of the Defence Force to implement single service appointments and organisational arrangements through the service chiefs of staff. To provide the appropriate legal basis for the current arrangements, these restrictions upon the Chief of the Defence Force's command power need to be removed. The amendments make the necessary changes to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in no way detract from the provision for command appointments and organisational arrangements under the Acts, as remaining provisions will contain adequate authority for these matters. There will therefore be no need to replace the provisions that have been omitted or repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> The new operational command arrangements have been implemented with the support of the service chiefs of staff. While they no longer conduct operations, they continue to train and administer their respective arms of the Defence Force, and provide advice as the professional heads of their respective services. </PARA>
<PARA>Open ended enlistment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act were amended to allow service administrators to offer enlistment to retiring age as well as enlistment for a fixed period. A soldier or sailor enlisted until retiring age may claim his or her discharge on giving an appropriate period of notice (which in relation to members of the permanent forces is 12 months or such lesser period determined by a chief of staff). </PARA>
<PARA> It was the intention of service administrators at that time to offer, initially, enlistment for a fixed period followed by the option of extension until retiring age. Service administrators now consider that it is more efficient to enlist a soldier or sailor initially until retiring age but require that a minimum period of service be required before a discharge may be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act include a provision so that a soldier or sailor of the permanent forces who has enlisted until retiring age does not have a right to claim a discharge during the first 6 years of service, or such lesser period as a chief of staff determines. Historically six years is the minimum initial period of service required to be served. </PARA>
<PARA> To enable effective implementation of the open ended enlistment scheme, the amendments proposed require that the approval of a chief of staff be required for any variation or withdrawal of a claim for discharge. This amendment is required to avoid manipulation of the procedure of claiming a discharge. </PARA>
<PARA> Factors required to be taken into account by a chief of staff in determining a lesser period of service before which a discharge may be claimed and in considering approval of a variation or withdrawal of a claim for discharge are included in the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> It will still be open to a soldier or sailor to request a discharge at any time. </PARA>
<PARA>Joint Intelligence Organisation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 1 March 1989 the then Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley announced some changes to defence intelligence arrangements, and in particular the combining of the functions of the Joint Intelligence Organisation with those of the intelligence group in the Australian Defence Force headquarters. Mr Beazley also announced that this restructured body will be known as the Defence Intelligence Organisation the new name better reflects the body's central role in the preparation of defence intelligence assessments and the provision of operational intelligence for the Australian Defence Force. The amendments make consequential name changes to the various Commonwealth Acts containing references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation. These changes will enable the formal re-naming of the body. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial impact statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the increase in the orphans' benefits will cost approximately $600,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The other provisions of the Bill have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to repeal the current power to detain and search persons suspected of unlawfully carrying prohibited goods, and insert in its place new division containing a more comprehensive range of customs detention and search powers. The Bill gives effect to several major elements of the Government's anti-drug strategy. Foremost amongst these is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision to implement the legislative framework for the detention and, if necessary, search of persons reasonably suspected of importing narcotics by internal concealment, which has been settled in consultation with the Commonwealth-States Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy as one of the outcomes of the 1985 `Drug Summit', and</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision announced on 18 July 1989 to allow authorised customs officers to stop and frisk search persons for prohibited goods within customs controlled areas at international air and sea ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is substantially the same as the one which was introduced last session into the Parliament, with the exception of minor amendments which have arisen as a result of briefings on that Bill with the Law Council of Australia and the then Opposition spokesperson on customs. The amendments in particular provide:</PARA>
<PARA>an express right to an interpreter for detainees not able to communicate with reasonable fluency in English, to allay concerns that a detainee might not appreciate the consequences which flow from a failure to cooperate with a frisk-search, for example, by reason only of the detainee's inadequate knowledge of the English language. This new right appears in proposed new section 219zd, on page 16 of the attached Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The other two minor amendments are to proposed sub-sections 219r (10) and 219v (11), and are explained in detail in the relevant notes on clauses in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this Bill, on pages 20 and 26 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indeed an unfortunate fact of our modern-day life that there are persons who wish to corrupt our society by importing illicit drugs, and some of those persons will even go to the extent of concealing the drugs inside their bodies or force a courier to do the same, in order to escape detection. Tragically some of those persons or couriers pay for this very dangerous and difficult attempt to avoid detection with their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Customs Act power to detain and search persons reasonably suspected of carrying prohibited goods has remained largely unchanged since Federation, and is currently contained in section 196 of the Act. The section however does not deal adequately with the problem of internal concealment in that it does not expressly provide adequate protections and rights either for the officers or suspects concerned or the medical practitioners who may be asked to conduct an internal search. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other end of the spectrum, the present detention and search regime is unnecessarily complicated for the simple frisk of a person at the customs barrier. With evidence to hand of a growing trend towards the importation of drugs using concealment on the body, and the community's expectation and legitimate demand when travelling for a speedy clearance through the customs barrier, a corresponding mechanism for the quick and efficient checking of persons reasonably suspected of carrying prohibited goods is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new division lB inserted by clause 8 of the Bill, proposes 23 new sections for part II of the Customs Act 1901, bringing together the full range of proposed customs body-search powers, from the least intrusive frisk, through external search, to the more intrusive internal search. By splitting the three types of searches into distinct subdivisions, the new division not only highlights the progressive strengthening of the statutory protections and rights afforded persons to be searched as the level of intrusiveness increases, but it also highlights the more rigorous legal requirements on officers of Customs and police as the searches become more invasive. </PARA>
<PARA> The first level of search, the frisk search, is set out in proposed new subdivision a of the Bill, new sections 219L to P. It is limited to customs controlled areas at international air and sea ports, and will be available to enable the detention of persons by customs where a customs supervisory officer suspects on reasonable ground that a person is unlawfully carrying any prohibited goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The search itself, which is a common and widespread barrier feature of most customs administrations around the globe, involves the quick pat-down of a person's outer garments and must be carried out as soon as practicable after the person is detained, by an officer of customs of the same sex as the detainee, and in private if so requested. The proposed regime includes the right of customs to require the production of any thing revealed by the frisk search, in order to determine whether the thing is, or contains, prohibited goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Failure to submit to a lawful frisk search, or to produce upon request a thing revealed by the search, shall constitute sufficient grounds for the next level of search, an external search, under proposed new subdivision B. </PARA>
<PARA> This second level of search, the external search, in proposed subdivision B, new sections 219q and r, effectively continues the current detention and search power in section 196 of the Customs Act, with minor drafting amendments to make it consistent with the proposed new frisk and internal search regimes, and express provisions to highlight a person's rights if detained for such a search. The initial decision to detain a person under this regime is one which must be taken by an authorised customs officer, an experienced officer of supervisory rank, or an officer of police, who must decide whether there is sufficient cause to suspect that a person is unlawfully carrying any prohibited goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a person is detained the detainee must be taken as soon as practicable to either a special detention place or a place that offers the detainee adequate personal privacy. The customs or police then must apply, as soon as practicable, for an order for an external search from a justice of the peace, the Comptroller-General of Customs or an authorised officer of supervisory rank, unless the detainee consents to be searched. </PARA>
<PARA> Special protection is provided for those detainees which the Bill describes as `in need of protection'; effectively those persons who because of their age, under 17, or mental or physical incapacity, are entitled to special rights. Consistent with the spirit of Australia's international commitments under human rights and privacy conventions, especially with regard to children, such persons may only be searched by order, and any search order is to be carried out in the presence of the detainee's legal guardian or another person capable of representing the detainee's interests, with that person, so far as practicable, being acceptable to the detainee. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, similar to the frisk regime, where an external search is to be carried out on a detainee, the search must be carried out by a person who is of the same sex as the detainee. Further, an express right to an interpreter has been provided when communication with or by the detainee is to take place, for those detainees not able to communicate orally with reasonable fluency in the English language. </PARA>
<PARA> The final level of search proposed by the Bill is the internal search, proposed by subdivisions C and E, new sections 219s to 219z, and 219zf to 219zj. The term internal search has been defined as an examination by a medical practitioner of the body of a person, including an internal examination of the person's body, to determine whether the person is internally concealing a narcotic substance, and includes the recovery of any substance suspected on reasonable grounds to be so concealed. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding policy of this proposed regime is that if a search is not consented to, it will only be ordered as a last resort. To give effect to that policy, the Bill provides for two periods of 48 hour detention, which may only be ordered by a magistrate or judge, to maximise the chances of any drugs being eliminated naturally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appreciates that the detention of a person on suspicion only is a serious and very sensitive matter, and were it not for the fact that the control of the importation of drugs requires strong powers, the civil liberties implications of detention represented by this regime would not have been countenanced. Therefore the Bill provides detention will occur only when that action is authorised by an appropriately senior judicial officer-that is a judge or magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect, this part of the Bill is similar to the Customs Amendment Act of 1979 which proposed an internal body-search regime, but which was never proclaimed. The protections afforded suspected persons under the terms of that amendment Act were not considered adequate and, partly as a consequence, all the States and the Northern Territory were not able to agree to provide access to the necessary judicial officers before the Act could be proclaimed. As far as the detention and internal search provisions of this Bill are concerned, the Government has included specific provisions to protect the rights of persons detained, while retaining the practical and necessary flexibility for customs officers and police officers charged by the community with the responsibility of controlling the importation of narcotics. All States and the Northern Territory have been consulted on the terns of the Bill and are expected to agree, this time, to allow access to judges and magistrates to consider applications for orders to detain or search under the terms of the internal search regime. This exercise has been a protracted one and various amendments and suggestions made in the course of those discussions have been incorporated in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, consultations on the obvious privacy and human rights implications of this regime have occurred over the period during which this Bill has been settled, to ensure as far as practicable that the rights of the individual are not submerged by the community's interest to control the influx of drugs into this country. The rights in particular of a detainee at any time during detention under the internal search regime to consult a lawyer of his or her choice, to have adequate opportunity to obtain legal advice and legal representation in relation to detention and search order applications, and to have the services of an interpreter where the detainee is liable to communicate with reasonable fluency in the English language, are ample evidence of the civil rights emphasis proposed by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think it is important to put into context the frequency of current detention and search activity at the customs barrier, to allay any fears that the proposed powers in this Bill might in fact alter markedly the current practice of passenger processing. </PARA>
<PARA> The power of search of persons under the Customs Act presently is exercised mainly by customs officers and mainly at Australia's international airports. In 1988-89 the total number of persons searched was 2,505, which represents 0.06% of the total arriving passenger population of 4.2m. Of this number of searches, 102 persons where detained for internal search and, in most cases, those persons consented to x-ray by a medical practitioner. The figures clearly show that the present power is exercised in a judicious and controlled way, and it is not expected, as a result of this Bill, that the number of persons searched should show any marked increase. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial impact statement</PARA>
<PARA> The costs associated with this Bill relate to the provision of medical and judicial personnel for the internal search regime (new subdivision C and E of proposed new division lB). It is estimated the costs for medical personnel and facilities to carry out those internal searches which are ordered, and the costs of the States' and Territories' judicial officers to service detention and search order applications, will total $150,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr President, the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments to a number of Acts administered by the Administrative Services portfolio. The amendments are of a kind which, in recent years, it has been the practice to include in an omnibus Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Archives Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that the Australian Archives should charge for certain discretionary services to Commonwealth agencies where such charges would promote efficiency and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the levying of charges by archives for any of its services must be prescribed by regulation in accordance with section 71 of the Archives Act. It is proposed that the Archives Act be amended so that the Director-General may levy charges on Commonwealth agencies without recourse to regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment is designed to provide the Archives with the same degree of flexibility in its charging policy as will be available to any private sector competitors who are able to determine charges in accordance with market conditions. This amendment is necessary to enable the Archives to implement fully the Government's policy of using interdepartmental charging to impose economic discipline on both the suppliers and the users of common services with the Australian Government administration. </PARA>
<PARA>Repeal of the Naval Properties Act 1925</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Act provides for ratifying agreements between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Government for the transfer of Cockatoo and Schnapper islands from the New South Wales Government and part of Goat Island from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the New South Wales Government granted an easement in gross which protects the Commonwealth's maritime rights. Thus this Act is no longer necessary and the Bill proposes that it be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA>Repeal of the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act has two essential features. It provides a legislative basis for a preference scheme in support of the purchase of Australian goods by government authorities and a framework for centralised purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has been contentious since its enactment. It has since been overtaken by a series of purchasing reforms and new preference arrangements, developed following consultation with Australian industry, being phased in from 1 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill also seeks to amend the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952. The Act provides for the continuation of salary payments to members of the Parliament from the date of dissolution of either House or of the Parliament until polling day, where members are to be candidates for election.</PARA>
<PARA> The Act also sets the circumstances under which additional salary and allowances determined by the Remuneration Tribunal are paid to certain office holders of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the Act provides that additional salary and allowances are not payable to office holders with the exception of the President of the Senate, Speaker of the House and the chairmen of both Houses between the dissolution of either House and polling day. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the considered view that all office holders continue to exercise their responsibilities over the period in question and consequently that the Act should be amended to reflect this. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that salaries and allowances payable to office holders who are candidates for election continue to be paid between dissolution of either House and polling day. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930 and Social Security Act 1947</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> These Acts are amended to remove reference to the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services which was sold and is now no longer a Commonwealth instrumentality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to speak to that motion because it covers the points I want to make. The question of disclosure of in camera evidence is a serious one and those honourable senators who have served on committees will be aware of the difficulties in receiving requests to take in camera evidence, in determining those requests, in taking the evidence, and then in working out what to do when one writes the report. I want to place on record as an individual senator, because we do not have a Party position, my gratitude to the Standing Committee on Procedure for having looked at this matter but my disappointment at the way in which it has determined the matter. What the Procedure Committee appears to have said is that it wants the Committee to work towards consensus in the way it deals with this matter. It says on page 4:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Committee suggests, however, that the following guidelines should apply . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I take it that these are the guidelines we are looking at in the motion. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A dissenting Senator who wishes to refer to in camera evidence should advise the committee of the evidence concerned -</PARA>
<PARA>I do not object to that-</PARA>
<PARA>and all reasonable efforts should be made by the committee to reach agreement on the disclosure of the evidence for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not disagree with that. The question, which I will return to, is that the difficulty arises where people cannot reach agreement and nowhere in the recommendations of the Procedure Committee do we deal with the question that arises when people cannot reach agreement.

<PARA>Witnesses who gave the evidence in question should, if it is practicable, be informed in advance of the proposed disclosure of the evidence and should be given reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure and to ask that particular parts of the evidence not be disclosed.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne sharpens the point that is at question. People give evidence in camera for what seem to them to be good and proper reasons. What we are trying to determine as a chamber is what procedures we want to apply when it is sought to use that in camera evidence, often in a proper way to draw attention to it without naming the person, or otherwise use it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This happens in committees where, because of the nature of the Senate, there are often party groupings represented and there may be differences of view on the particular evidence. My concern is that the guidelines laid down on pages 4 and 5 really do not take us very far. I will not take up too much of the time of the chamber on this matter. They indicate that if we can work towards consensus we should do so and of course we should. But the question that should arise in this chamber is: What happens when we cannot reach consensus? What happens when there is a difference of opinion? Senator Collins and I worked together on a select committee in which we received some in camera evidence and a very real question arose as to how that evidence should be dealt with in the report, both as to its generality and as to the particularities within it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we could work towards consensus on that matter then we would do so, but if we cannot work towards consensus the question is how should we then proceed. I have to say that the Procedure Committee has failed completely to assist the Senate in answering that question. Of course we should seek some clearance from the person giving the evidence and if we receive that clearance there is no problem, but what should we do if the person will not give a clearance? The Procedure Committee has failed totally to help us on that matter. I believe that what I am asking for as a senator is more guidance from the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I am perfectly happy to accept and support the notion that we should work towards solving these matters around the table wherever we can, but the matters which remain unresolved go to the core of the problem. Therefore I would want to see the matter referred back to the Procedure Committee with the view of this chamber that what we want the Committee to resolve for us is some way in which we should proceed where these matters remain unresolved, after we have sought to achieve agreement and work together, where we have sought to achieve a common position and have failed to do so. That really is what the issue is about. So accordingly I would move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ``That', insert ``the matter of disclosure of in camera evidence be referred to the Procedure Committee for further consideration''. </PARA>
<PARA>I do that in a constructive spirit because I want this question resolved and I want to give to the Procedure Committee an indication of what the will of the Senate might be on this matter, because I do want an answer and I want an answer that actually goes to the questions which were simply omitted in the report which we are considering now. </PARA>

I will not ask for those words to be struck out but I will just say this to Senator Ray through you, Mr President: when was the last time a Labor member of the Senate voted differently from all the other Labor members in the Senate on any of these matters? The situation is that the members of the Liberal and National parties view these matters as matters for their decision themselves and vote in accordance with their fundamental beliefs on the matter. That means that all of the new senators on our side of the chamber are required, since they have been sworn in on Tuesday, to now apply their minds to this report made on 2 May 1989 and make their own personal decision on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

Frankly, we have different priorities in our Party room. We discuss policy, not Standing Orders. I can never remember a Standing Orders debate in the Caucus. What if we do all vote one way?

I am not sure whether new senators are aware of what this means and how it might affect their rights to raise in the Committee of the Whole certain questions about expenditures of various Government departments. The proposal as I see it-I will certainly be corrected if I am wrong, as I am always so corrected-is that only those matters that are referred to in the Estimates Committee report, plus any other matter that an individual senator might raise which is then appended to the report, are able to be dealt with during the discussion of the Estimates by the Committee of the Whole in this chamber. That is a very serious departure from what has been the case heretofore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Previously any senator could raise any matter relating to the Budget-that is, the proposed expenditures of the Government and various Government departments-in the Committee of the Whole. He is able to question the Ministers in this chamber about that proposed expenditure. That is a very important function of each individual senator. It enables that senator to exercise his rights of audit and control, so far as that is possible, over the expenditures of government. That is a very important function of a member of parliament-to ensure that the Ministers are accountable to our constituents. </PARA>

Those areas will only be able to be referred to in the Estimates committee report by a decision of that Estimates committee or if an individual senator-I assume this is the procedure that will be adopted, and I would like to have some enlightenment from a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure-can write to the Estimates committee and ask it to place a particular item on the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am not a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure, but might I give my view so that someone might tell me if I am wrong? I think there are two separate matters. What Senator Harradine has been discussing is not the matter contained in the report of the Procedure Committee. There are two circumstances in which people might write to the Secretary to an Estimates committee. The first is to seek departmental answers, and it seems to me that what is being proposed here is that if one wants information early in the process, one should write the letter not to the department of state or to the Minister but to the secretary to the Estimates committee concerned, thereby setting in train a process which has been described.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine is asking about the trigger which would later enable participation in the debate of the Committee of the Whole on any particular matter. The question for the Senate then is: what is that trigger? The trigger is now the inclusion or mention of that particular matter in the report of the Senate Estimates committee. That is a separate question from the one which is contained in this report of the Procedure Committee. I think I am correct that it is the right of any individual senator to write to an Estimates committee and ask that any matter be mentioned in the report of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case, then the concern of Senator Harradine, which is a very proper concern of any individual senator, is actually dealt with adequately. However, what is proposed here is a different matter, one that goes to the way in which questions of fact might be put to departments in a regular way in advance of the hearings of the committee. Doing it as suggested by the Procedure Committee ensures that all members of the Estimates Committee have a copy of the questions and that those questions will go through a channel which will ensure that the departments receive them, and so on. In no way, as I read it, does it abrogate or lessen the right of any honourable senator to have a matter included in the report of the Estimates committee and therefore to trigger, as it were, the mechanism which would allow participation in the debate of the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with and accept the comments of Senator Peter Baume-and you, Mr President, of course. The matter I want to raise is that the Standing Committee on Procedure seems to have ignored one of the grounds of concern of the Estimates Committee that referred this matter to the Procedure Committee. Its concern was that the practice was being used by senators to obtain information without the need to attend the meetings of the Estimates Committees. The report appears to me to say nothing about that concern. One can only presume that the Procedure Committee was of the view that that did not concern it. If a member of the Procedure Committee could advise me one way or the other about that, I would be interested to know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter I would like to raise cannot be dealt with by the Procedure Committee. My concern is that the answers given by the departments frequently are not given to the Estimates committees until long after the hearings of the Estimates committees, no matter how early the questions are submitted. Members of the Estimates committee get the Estimates, go through them, prepare their questions, and frequently then send off to the secretary to the committee for distribution to the department prior to the hearing. My experience is that sometimes departmental officers will say, `Yes, I have that question, and the answer is . . . '-whatever it is. But more often than not they say, `Well, we will supply a written answer to that question at some later stage'. I find that very concerning because it means we are unable to follow up with further questions which might arise out of the answer we receive. That is a matter for the Government, the various Ministers who are before the Estimates committees and, I suppose, for the individual Estimates committees themselves rather than for this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> (8) The President may delete extraneous matter from notices and may require a Senator giving a notice contrary to the standing orders to reframe the notice.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a difficult change, in my view, speaking only as an individual, because it involves value judgments to be made first of all by those who draw up notices of motion and then there is a duty on behalf of the President to occasionally cleanse them of extraneous matter. The difficulties that we have had with notices of motion will be solved only if people take the moral sanction existing in this clause and apply it to the notices of motion.

<PARA> I would rather it be in the Standing Orders than not be there, as this amendment frames it. But I say in advance that I cannot see that it will necessarily overcome the problem. That is up to the self-discipline of all individual senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I substantially agree with what Senator Robert Ray has said, that it does put quite an intolerable burden on the President to determine whether or not the standing order has been adhered to and how he will handle it. It would also be my view that senators ought to treat the giving of notices of motion with greater self-discipline. All of us, though, probably at times stray when we believe that something needs to be said. I no doubt have done so. I might think it is all right to do so but when someone else does it, that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to link this matter with the answering of questions. While the President under this standing order, if it is adopted, will be given the opportunity to discipline senators in respect of how they express their views in notices of motion, day after day the President, when challenged in relation to the answer that some Minister is giving, sits there and says to us, `I have no power and no status to tell a Minister how he shall answer a question'. Before we adopt this motion, we ought to look at ways in which the President can equally require Ministers to treat Question Time with more respect, to answer the questions that they are asked, not to debate the issues, and not to engage in personal abuse or go into other areas that have got absolutely nothing to do with the matter that is before them. </PARA>
<PARA> What I resent most about this motion-which I substantially agree with as a guideline to senators-is the fact that back bench senators are being constrained in a way that Ministers are not. I think the two things, though totally separate, are not unrelated from the point of view of the way the Senate is treated and the way the President is treated-that he has to say to back bench senators who would be the ones giving notices of motion of this kind that they are to be constrained while Ministers are able to continue in the way that they have done over the last few years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that I would be opposed to this proposed standing order. It is my view that we are all politicians and that we will find a way of expressing ourselves, however the Standing Orders are written. What has happened is that, as a result of other changes in procedures, senators have found it opportune to make certain statements by way of notice of motion. We heard one this morning from Senator Vallentine which went on for some considerable time, as we will recall. But, on the other hand, if one thinks about it, she was reading words which she had prepared in anticipation. So it was probably much briefer to do this than if the President had allowed her to move the suspension of Standing Orders for some reason or other and prattle on for 20 minutes or so about the matter, which is the sort of thing senators will do in order to make their point. The matter would not have been dealt with anywhere near as quickly as it was this morning. The senators in the chamber in any event indicated their disapproval of what she was doing, and no doubt she has taken that into some regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my view that senators in this chamber will find ways of expressing their views. If their notices of motion are restricted they will find some other way of doing it. That will be to the detriment of the proper use of our time in considering matters of much more importance than a notice of motion read out by some senator first thing in the morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This standing order seems to me and my colleagues to be reasonable. We understand the additional burden that this places on the President and Acting Deputy Presidents. All standing orders place a burden on the President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed new standing order contains the phrase `within the competence of the Senate'. I see this standing order as a means of exerting discipline. As Senator Ray has said, an important aspect will be self-discipline on the part of all senators, but it will not amount, in effect, to a gag. If it does, then what Senator Lewis has said is absolutely correct: other means will be found. However, I think we are all concerned that notices of motion have become a device-and I note in particular the wording of this proposed standing order that refers to an inordinate amount of quoting of documents and so on, which is an area which sometimes has got out of hand.</PARA>
<PARA> This is really an exercise in discipline for individual senators. It is for raising matters which are within the competence of the Senate. Using the example that Senator Lewis has used of Senator Vallentine's motion this morning, and others of a similar nature, it is certainly within the competence of the Senate to pass motions on issues of national and international import. Therefore, a motion such as that would not be ruled out on the basis that it is not within the competence of the Senate to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> I would not anticipate either the President or any of the Acting Deputy Presidents currently on the panel ruling on that basis. The new standing order will be an exercise in self-discipline for all of us, as indeed are all of the Standing Orders, and I hope that it will lead to all senators considering seriously what we are doing when we give notice of motions in this place.</PARA>

Effectively, what it says is that, instead of burying late in the afternoon reports that people have worked on for two years, we should give them some sort of prominence in this chamber and at least allow five minutes for each senator or for key committee members to speak on it. Effectively, that intrudes into the time allowed for Government Business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the Senate take note of the first section of the report dealing with conditions for television broadcasting of Senate proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>It is some while since I have looked at this matter. Basically, what it says is that there will not be too many rules because rules will be gotten around, and it is very hard to enforce them. It comes back, I suppose, to my original criticism about the way the whole issue of televising of proceedings in this chamber started. That was: notice given; a gun put to our head and being told the numbers were there-`Get it over and done with or we will delay your legislation; no consultation this time; no blending it through the party rooms or anything else'. That procedure is all very well, except that no-one thought up the rules in advance. Hence today, we had to let through a notice of motion from Senator Vanstone so that Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television would not be broadcasting petitions, notices of motion and some of the other less glamorous things that occur in this chamber, and so we could go straight into Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Standing Committee on Procedure has taken a fairly sensible view on this. The more rules one writes on this issue, the more they will be honoured in the breach rather than the observance. But there are still a couple of fundamental issues. Senator Harradine indicated that he wanted to raise one, and that was on the question of fairness: how do you make sure that the broadcasts of the proceedings are fair? I just say that one cannot; it is impossible. What is fairness? Is it X amount of minutes devoted to the Labor Party and X amount to the Liberal Party? We have heard them do that in elections, have we not? They tell us: `Look, you've had three hours 10 minutes mention of the Labor Party, and the other side have had three hours 10 minutes'. The fact that the other side's time may have all been focused on their leadership splits or something else and is not quality time promoting their particular point of view is ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> So we cannot have fairness here. We will not be able to enforce fairness. Indeed, who can judge the fairness? Can anyone sitting on this side judge or on that side judge whether proceedings are fair? Of course not; and there is no independent person around that can. The President cannot; the clerks cannot--</PARA>

What my concern is-and it was also Senator Harradine's when he spoke out of turn a little earlier-is that personal explanations or misrepresentations following Question Time should be included. If a question has been put by one of the Labor back bench to a Minister and it is derogatory about a member of the Opposition or about one of the Independents or Democrats, and after Question Time a point of order is taken for either misrepresentation or to give a personal explanation, it is certainly unjust if that is not included in Question Time. It ought to be included in `Question Time', otherwise the public who are watching that Question Time will not get the benefit of the true situation, or certainly of the situation of defence of a particular honourable senator in this place.

It is the general working that is to be reviewed. But to ignore in Question Time a personal explanation or a point of order on misrepresentation does allow, for a continuing period of six months, an injustice that would not be seen by the public as being remedied.

But in a live broadcast, one cannot expect that to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is a realistic proposition during this trial period-which I emphasise is only going until 19 October-to say that the ABC television at 3 o'clock has to hang on and interrupt the rest of its programs-which I understand is Sesame Street-just to check in case somebody stands up to make a personal explanation after Question Time, which, of course, will be some minutes later, after further answers from Ministers. It would just be an impossible situation. I think we just have to accept that, during this period, we will not get the personal explanations after the event. It might mean that there will be more attempts during Question Time for people to take points of order which are not strictly points of order in order to get their denial across, but this is an experiment which we adopted on the suggestion of the Opposition. If it was concerned about having just the one hour of live broadcast of Senate Question Time, it should have thought about this problem at the time. But we have this brief experiment. I would acknowledge that there would be more likelihood that if there is a serious accusation, there is more chance of the Opposition standing up in the middle of Question Time and taking the point of order to say, `That's a ridiculous thing', the President will say, `That is not a point of order', and that will be the end of it. But I do not think we can seriously have the one hour being extended just in case somebody stands up 10 minutes later and makes a personal explanation. </PARA>

<PARA> I fully support the televising of parliament, and I have always done so for the 14 years that I have been a member of it. But we have to be realistic about the extent of damage to people's reputations from this injustice continuing for another two months. In respect of this dreadful calumny being delivered on national television, the reality is, I have no doubt-without any disrespect to the Senate-that that attack on a person's reputation, if it does occur, will probably be viewed by only 10 people and a dog.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it today the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill, which will repeal the Airlines Agreement Act 1981, the Airlines Equipment Act 1958, the Independent Air Fares Committee Act 1981 and related regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is one of those strange ironies that happen in political life that I have been asked to put the Opposition's case in supporting this legislation. Going back through Hansard, I found that there are only 16 senators now who were present when the 1981 Bill went through. There is more than a touch of irony in the fact that, if I had had one more vote in 1981, the 1981 legislation would not have gone through. I was very strongly opposed to it. I had to take the position of opposition, at considerable personal difficulty and stress, to my own Party, which was in government at the time, because I believed very strongly that what we were doing then was not in the interests of the Australian nation in a commercial sense. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Bill passed through the Senate by a majority of two votes. If one other person had changed his mind at the time, the Bill would not have gone through. I believe we would all have been better off if the two-airline Bill had not been passed in 1981. In my judgment, by the end of the 1960s and certainly by the early 1970s, the two-airline agreement system regulating that there be only two major carriers within Australia had ceased to have any relevance or benefit. Today I am quite sure that, when the shadow Ministry asked me to manage this Bill on behalf of the Opposition, no one recalled the history of what was involved, in asking me to do that. I have much pleasure, therefore, in saying that the Opposition supports the Government in what it proposes to do with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will mean that control over importation is removed. One of the ways in which the two-airline Bill was enforced was by having in the Customs Act a prohibition which denied any airline other than Trans-Australia Airlines- TAA, as it was then-and Ansett Airlines of Australia the ability to import aircraft into Australia. That meant that, if the legislation was outflanked by any means and a licence was granted to an airline, it did not help much because the airline simply could not get aircraft into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The great benefit-and what I was arguing for in 1981-was that it may well have been that two major carriers were all we needed in this country, but we certainly needed the opportunity for a third or even a fourth carrier to be able to enter the market; and the threat of another carrier entering the market would have provided some stimulus to the smug duopoly that we have enjoyed in this country for decades.</PARA>
<PARA> I was also opposed to the introduction of the Independent Air Fares Commission, which was one of the consequences of the 1981 Bill. I have a view that it is not the business of a government-any government-to be involved in the commercial marketplace. I think that the market has its own systems of censure and reward which provide adequate guidance to commercial operators, and the business of deciding what an air fare should be should be left in the hands of those who are trying to make a living out of it. They have far more expertise than the best-intentioned public servant trying to sit in judgment on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government gave notice on 5 June 1987 of its intention to terminate the agreement. At the time, the Minister stated that the policy had `outlived its usefulness to the Australian public and was unduly restrictive'. The 1981 Bill provided that the two-airline agreement would stand until 1990, but that any of the three signatories to the agreement were able to give notice of termination from January 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-airline Bill failed because it did not provide any avenues of commercial competition between the two airlines. In effect, the less commercially successful of the two airlines set a fare structure so that it could maintain some profitability. As I said in 1981, all that that Bill has produced in terms of competition has been a very phoney form of competition to see who could give away the most food and drink. That has only added to the cost of travel to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> All the indices done on Australian airlines-I use Australian in a national sense; I do not mean Australian Airlines Ltd-show that in terms of passengers per employee and tonne miles of freight carried, the Australian domestic airlines shape up very poorly when compared with overseas competitors. These overseas competitors are not merely 50 per cent more efficient; American operators are probably many times more efficient. This has occurred because there has been no commercial pressure on the Australian domestic airlines. They followed whatever practices they wanted to because basically they were operating on a cost-plus basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned yesterday when speaking on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute, the lack of commercial pressures enabled the managements of Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines to indulge whatever demands their employees made upon them, not only during a one- or two-year period but over the decades. The airlines ended up with probably twice the number of employees that they really needed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the sequel to the pilots dispute we see that the airlines are now getting by with about 50 per cent of the pilots they had before, admittedly with reduced services and hours flown. I venture to suggest that if they were to adopt the same approach to the baggage handlers, the flight attendants and the maintenance people very significant reductions would be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> But all that will change in the period after the repeal of this legislation. The possibility for some competition will exist. </PARA>
<PARA> How did we get into this position? We have to look at the history of Australian main trunk carriers. In November 1944, during the time that a Labor government was in power, the Acting Prime Minister decided that the Government would set up a wholly owned statutory authority to operate the internal airline services, which meant that the then Australian National Airways (ANA) would be nationalised. During that period ANA was the major airline within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal was thrown out because the High Court held that it was not possible for the Commonwealth to restrict trade between the States. The counter to that was to introduce the Australian National Airlines Bill, which created Trans-Australia Airlines Ltd. Trans-Australia Airlines was a very different airline from what it has become. It was staffed mainly by ex-Air Force pilots and officers. It was fairly well managed. At the time it was an aggressive and an innovative company. Through the late 1940s and the 1950s it provided a great deal of competition for Australian National Airways. </PARA>
<PARA> It was really the competition that it provided, coupled with the poor commercial judgment of Australian National Airways at the time, which led to Australian National Airways getting into very considerable commercial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian National Airways failed to appreciate the changes in technology that were taking place in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, such as the introduction of pressurised aircraft. It persisted with DC3s and DC4s, which were eminently practical and suitable for the routes, but TAA came along with the pressurised Convair 240s and offered a better service to the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> We then had the introduction of the first of the turboprop aircraft. TAA was one of the early customers to buy Viscounts. The difference between the turboprop Viscounts and the DC6As and the DC6Bs, which ANA was operating at the time, was very marked in the eyes of the public. TAA got most of the passenger trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Sir Ivan Holyman, who was the principal force in the old Australian National Airways, died in Honolulu coming back from America. The company had also been under pressure from other lesser airlines, such as Ansett and Butler Air Transport in New South Wales, and the company simply could not carry on. </PARA>
<PARA> Reginald Ansett, as he was then, made an offer to take over the Australian National Airways company. This meant that he had to borrow a great deal of money, which he did not have. He simply would not go ahead and take over Australian National Airways without some guarantee from the Government of the day that he would not be run out of business by the Government putting all its resources behind a government owned airline which could afford to operate without respect to a balance sheet, secure in the knowledge that it could get whatever it required from the public purse to keep it going. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister of the day, Robert Menzies, very wisely said that he did not wish to see a monopoly develop in the internal air services. He did not want to support the merging of TAA with ANA as it was. Thank goodness he did not. If he had supported that, we would have ended up with air services as bad as those of Telecom Australia; again, we would have had a giant monopoly run by the unions, and it would have been so bad that we would probably all be driving between capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The two airline agreement had its origins in providing defence for the private or the public company competing with the government airline. However much the far Left of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) might hate it, this legislation seals the fate of Australian Airlines. As a consequence of this legislation, Australian Airlines must be sold at a future date, however unpalatable that might be to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who is at the table. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the two-airline agreements was put in place. There was a disparity with respect to equipment. The equipment that TAA had was far more advanced than that of ANA from a public appeal point of view. There was some rather unusual cross-chartering-maybe even sale-agreements where some of the TAA Viscounts were transferred to ANA and ANA transferred at least two of its DC6Bs to TAA. They were quite useful on the long hauls between Melbourne and Perth because they were pressurised and were long-range aircraft. They were more suited to that route than the early Viscounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Restrictions were introduced on competition. There had to be equal access to the routes on the major trunk sectors. There had to be equivalence in passenger capacity. In all ways, the Government tried to level the playing fields between the two airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time that policy was eminently appropriate. It was successful. However, by the end of the 1960s the need for it had passed. By the time we entered the 1970s it should have been replaced by some other form, guaranteeing the opportunity for companies to provide internal services on the Australian trunk routes. </PARA>
<PARA> The final piece of legislation was the 1981 Bill, which I referred to earlier and which really set in place the earlier agreements. It provided that the two airlines could operate virtually without challenge from a third competitor. In a sense it made it worse in so far as it set up the Independent Air Fares Committee (IAFC) and thereby increased the possibility of no airline losing money on the system. The airline just had to appeal to the IAFC and say, `These are our operating costs. We therefore need a fare structure on these grounds to keep us solvent'. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, we have the withdrawal of that legislation and the prospect from October that third or fourth companies can enter the Australian internal trunk routes. The Opposition supports that because some years ago we came to the conclusion that was what was essential for Australian air travellers. There are certain consequences of that decision which we should spend a few moments looking at this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> It is inevitable that Australian Airlines has to be sold. One of the arguments that have been advanced in the public debate-and the Labor Party fights out all its factional brawls in public-is that it does need to be sold on the basis of equity capital alone. That is a very important point. If Australian Airlines, which is hugely undercapitalised at the present time, is to buy new equipment, it needs to have very large sources of money. It simply cannot get that from the Government. It has to go to private industry. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the coin, the argument that led Reginald Ansett-as he was at the time-to demand that if he bought Australian National Airlines in 1957 he had to be protected against a government-owned airline which theoretically could lose money ad infinitum and drive any other airline out of business, is as valid today in 1990 as it was in 1957. That is a point that the government of the day, irrespective of its political complexion, has to cope with. That argument will resurface in time. It is not currently being debated on the public platform. But it is a very real argument that will have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to descend to the level of entering into any of the rather vicious factional warfare that occurs in debates in the Australian Labor Party but I was interested to see the President of the Labor Party in Queensland talk about the impossibility of selling Qantas Airways Ltd because, after all, it was a national asset and it was developed by the people of Australia, the taxpayers, and it could not now be sold. Like the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, who is sitting at the table, the President of the Queensland ALP has very little depth to his aviation knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas was started by private enterprise. An uncle of my wife was one of the first directors of that company in the early 1920s. It was largely private money from Queensland that led to Qantas being set up. Only after the Second World War did the Labor Party buy Qantas from private enterprise. Qantas was established not only as a private domestic airline but developed as an international carrier through private capital. There is nothing wrong with having private capital running airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland President of the ALP, who is a member of the far Left and, as far as I can determine, has never taken any interest in defence matters, made the case that somehow or other it was important to have Qantas owned by the government because if we had a defence emergency that asset would be available to us. Qantas was a privately owned company. It lost aircraft during the Second World War. Many crew were killed. This private company served this nation as faithfully and as loyally as did the armed services. It is absolute nonsense to make the claim that because an airline might not be owned by the government it will not be available to us in times of emergency. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to a second point that the Government has to address: the reform of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The regulation system for aviation in Australia is very run down. We have a huge amount of overregulation which inhibits the operations not only in the commercial areas but in the private and recreational areas. The Government has made a constructive move in advertising around the world for the two senior positions in the Civil Aviation Authority. Personally, I am very optimistic that the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Dick Smith, will bring long overdue changes to the regulatory system. The magnitude of some of those changes required is quite enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the regulation of airspace, for example, we are still in a situation where many of the airspace requirements in Australia are arguably determined on the performance characteristics of aircraft in the 1940s. Quite huge blocks of airspace are reserved around our capital cities, for example, for the primary control zones. There is absolutely no need for this whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State the primary control zone for Brisbane Airport is so large that all the light aircraft traffic-of which about 98 per cent is single engine traffic-is forced to fly over some of the most inhospitable and dangerous terrain within about 100 miles of Brisbane. Those planes must fly at low level, at about 1,500 feet, over a tract of ground for about 20 or 30 miles where there is little possibility of a successful forced landing if an engine is lost. There is no reason on earth why the eastern boundary of the lane of entry to the north from the Brisbane Airport cannot be displaced three or four miles to the east. Instead of a ceiling of 1,500 feet, there is no reason why it could not be raised to perhaps 6,000 feet or more. </PARA>

<PARA> We also have the problem of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). It is all very well to say that we will get rid of the duopoly situation with respect to Australian Airlines and Ansett and allow third or fourth parties to enter into the provision of regular public transport services on main trunk routes. The passengers, and their baggage, have to get on those aircraft. This Government in collusion, principally, with Ansett has behaved very dishonestly with respect to terminals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Airports Corporation legislation passed through this Parliament enabled that body to control a number of airports in Australia. Principally, the FAC controls the airports used by the two major internal carriers. The FAC, therefore, legally has control of the terminal buildings at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and the other primary city airports. The Minister at the time, Senator Gareth Evans, entered into negotiations, principally with Ansett but also with Australian Airlines, which virtually gave them prior claim to the terminal facilities at the major capital city airports. Brisbane is about the only one where any capacity exists for a third or fourth airline to use the new terminal. We have the situation in Sydney where Ansett has blocked out the possibility of anyone else getting in. </PARA>

<PARA> The legislation was belatedly amended to provide that new airlines should have some access to some of the terminals at the discretion of Australian Airlines and Ansett. Honourable senators can imagine what sort of accommodation those airlines will give. It certainly will not be on the basis of parity. Again, on the problem of the FAC, we see the way in which the Government has failed to cope with the huge costs to the Australian travelling public of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government was prepared to act to resolve that eight years ago. We are now in the eighth year of office of this Government and we see procrastination after procrastination and huge fights within the Labor Party as to whether there will be a third runway. But nothing is being done to clear up the congestion in Sydney. The cost of congestion in Sydney is not 20 minutes time lost by the incoming traveller; it is the thousands of tonnes of fuel burnt needlessly each year and the thousands of air frame hours, air crew hours and maintenance hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that in the early 1980s the estimate of the cost of congestion in Sydney was $25m or $28m. I have no idea what the cost would be today, but it may well be that a nought should be added to the previous figure. But the Government has done nothing and has no intention of doing anything to resolve those difficulties. Those difficulties, along with cleaning up the CAA and the FAC in order to make those bodies efficient, are some of the consequences of this legislation. Having made those points, on behalf of the Opposition, I wish this Bill quick passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Some people have been calling the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill 1990 the deregulator of the Australian airline industry. The fact is, however, that the industry will still be subject to significant regulation. State regulations will still apply to intrastate operations; Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd will retain long term leases over airport terminals; Qantas Airways Ltd will not be allowed to carry domestic passengers; foreign airlines will not be allowed to interline and there will still be limits on foreign investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation will, theoretically, allow the entry of new airlines to compete against Ansett and Australian Airlines. The Australian Democrats will be opposing this legislation in principle. We are doing so because we believe that the many benefits touted by proponents of deregulation will not eventuate due to the small size of the Australian market. We believe that it is a futile exercise which may-and I stress may-in the short term yield some gains but no long term benefits for the travelling public of Australia. We also believe that this has serious implications for the safety levels of the airline industry in this country and that the efficiencies we are seeking to achieve with this Bill can be obtained without such an open form of regulation. Ten years ago I, too, was attracted to the claims made for deregulation. It was easy to have a commitment to a theory, but we have now had enough time to see that, in practice, the theory does not always work. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon has given us an historical overview of how we have come to this piece of legislation, but he has not addressed the facts concerning what has happened in the United States, to which I now turn. Deregulation began there in 1978 with the only condition of entry being a fitness test on the general economic and community standard of the proposed entrant. The immediate effect of deregulation was the emergence of around 200 new operators. This led to significant drops in air fares over the major routes and a greater availability of discount fare packages. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the United States is often held up as a shining example of the benefits of deregulating the airline industry. However, deregulation there has also led to severe congestion, causing flight delays at some airports, and to some substantial fare increases over the lighter routes. Importantly, it must be pointed out that the reduction in fares seen in the United States resulted, in the main, not from reduced inefficiencies but from the airlines negotiating more favourable wage deals with their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer term, the airlines maintained lower fares through delaying the replacement of their aircraft fleet-in many cases much longer than their designers intended. The ageing fleet evaluation program by the Boeing Commercial Aeroplane Co., completed in early 1989, found that more than 25 per cent of the Boeing 727 aircraft in use throughout the world were beyond the 20 flying years period for which they were designed; that 25 per cent represented more than 400 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now seeing in the United States, as was predicted by industry economists when deregulation was first touted, a reconcentration of the industry. Ironically, the megacarriers that existed before deregulation are now, in the deregulated market, carrying a higher percentage of traffic. Ninety per cent of passenger traffic is now handled by just eight carriers, compared with 15 in 1984. Virtually all of the new entrants-over 140 companies-have either gone broke or have been taken over by the established megacarriers. The carrying patterns of the major operators have changed. The emergence of the hub and spoke networks has meant that major operators have become virtual monopolists in certain areas. So the concentration of the industry to the major players has actually increased with deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the barriers to entry to the United States market are now so great that there are unlikely to be any new entrants. Not surprisingly, this reconcentration in the industry and this monopoly power have been accompanied by increases in air fares, even on the trunk routes, and a decrease in the number of discount packages offered. These increases have been compounded by the need for airlines to finally purchase new aircraft after years of stretching out the use of old ones, as fare wars meant that there was underprovision for capital replacement and expansion.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 average United States air fares rose by 11 per cent and on some routes fares rose by as much as 33 per cent. Interestingly, there are now calls for some form of reregulation to be introduced to the industry in order to tighten entry controls, to relieve congestion and to allay fears of declining safety standards. So the United States' example shows that, while deregulation may bring short term benefits to the consumer in the form of lower fares, these benefits have not been sustainable and the customer may in the long run actually end up paying higher fares and having safety compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> I predict that the Australian experience will be that we can expect similar results on a smaller scale to occur here. Inevitably, there will be some new entrants-around 11 at the last count. But, given the dominance of the two existing airlines and the massive barriers to entry, new entrants will target their markets. We will not get competition across the board. Initially, the new arrangements will yield some cheaper air fares on major routes. However, contrary to Senator MacGibbon's beliefs, it is my contention that market forces will not be nearly as strong in Australia and that Australian companies will not be able to negotiate wage deals as favourable wage as those in the United States; thus fare reductions will not be as great. I do not believe it will be possible to sack maintenance, baggage and general staff and cabin crew, in the way Senator MacGibbon would like us to do, in the name of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements will also yield increased fares on lighter routes, for example, the Northern Territory, and a decrease in the quality of the services provided. For example, jet aircraft may be replaced by smaller propeller planes. The arrangements are also likely to worsen congestion problems which at Sydney Airport-as those of us who travel through there on our way home know-are absolutely woeful. Furthermore, the additional noise generated by a greater number and wider variety of aeroplanes must be closely monitored and controlled. Cheaper fares that do result will be sustained only long enough for existing operators to break or take over new entrants. Sir Peter Abeles has already said that he will kick the heads of competitors as they stick them up-this is, of course, the essence of true competition-and, with the backing of TNT Ltd and News Corporation Ltd, no doubt he will; and he will probably win. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansett and Australian already carry a significant number of passengers on discounted fares, and we have had some limited experience with competition in Australia with East-West Airlines Ltd. Between 1981 and 1986 East-West competed strongly with Australian Airlines and Ansett over various trunk routes offering a no-frills one-class service. In order to provide competition to the majors, East-West was reportedly losing over $1m per month and was inevitably taken over by Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA> In the deregulated environment, the Trade Practices Commission is to oversee the industry and supposedly prevent predatory pricing. However, the powers of the Trade Practices Commission are limited in this regard and they failed to prevent predatory pricing in the competition with East-West. The Trade Practices Commission's role in overseeing the newspaper and television industries is hardly a consoling example. In this regard I believe it is essential that adequate information be maintained and disseminated in regard to the economic performance of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The cycle of the United States will be repeated where large, existing operators are prepared to take significant revenue losses in the short term in order to cripple new entrants. Once they have, fare competition decreases and fares return to roughly pre-deregulation levels. Some may say, `Well at least we get cheap fares for a while'. However, it is not only fares that are affected by deregulation and this is where the Democrats have some real concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience has also shown that fierce competition has led to airlines short-cutting various procedures, in particular safety, in order to cut costs. In my first speech which I gave to the Senate last night, I mentioned the example of the American carrier, Eastern Airlines, which is currently facing 60 safety-related criminal charges including, incredibly, the faking of maintenance records. Reportedly, some United States airline companies have even calculated comparative costs of a hull loss versus the cost of compensation to the relatives of crash victims. </PARA>
<PARA> The safety standards of Australia's major airlines are presently second to none, and this is a tribute to the dedication of the pilots, engineers, maintenance and safety staff and cabin crew, and I commend the airlines for this. But in a deregulated environment the competitive forces may be such that some operators see potential gain in short-cutting procedures. I have been a passenger in a plane which sat on the tarmac for one and a half hours in St. Louis, in the United States of America, while those in charge decided whether to get a maintenance engineer out to look at a small problem. The crucial factor was that it was a Sunday and he was entitled to higher pay. Honourable senators will not be surprised to know, and I was not comforted by the thought, that they decided against seeking his advice. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent comments of the new head of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Dick Smith, to the effect that in the pursuit of affordable safety we can abolish over 200 existing safety regulations, do nothing to reassure me. It is true that the cosy duopoly referred to by Senator MacGibbon did have some problems but the Democrats feel it is a great pity that the Government did not choose either the revised regulation or even the partial regulation options of the Thomas May report of the Independent Review of Economic Regulation of Domestic Aviation. The option chosen by the Government and supported by the Opposition will not, I believe, turn out to be in the best interests of future Australian travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> If deregulation is to go ahead in the form proposed-as it obviously will with both the Government and the Opposition supporting it-I urge the Government to consider placing a freeze on our current safety regulations at least until the inevitable frenzy of a newly deregulated environment subsides. The safety of our travelling public must be guaranteed, and I ask the Minister in his speech to clearly enunciate what measures and financial resources the Government will be taking to ensure passengers' safety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. Senator MacGibbon has made it very easy for me to assist him in his desire to give this Bill speedy passage through the House by making 90 per cent of his speech completely irrelevant to the Bill; so there is nothing to respond to. So far as Senator Kernot's contribution is concerned, I am aware of the arguments canvassed by her and in fact agree with some of the things that she said. But the two issues I want to take up principally in respect of her contribution were the question of safety, which is an important public issue that must be addressed during this debate, and the reality of the Australian aviation market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of safety Australia has-and it is well known-one of the strictest and most closely regulated aviation safety regimes in the world. That regime remains in place. It will be completely unaffected by the deregulation of the airline industry on 31 October this year. The two issues in respect of the Australian aviation industry are simply not connected in that sense. The safety regulations that the Civil Aviation Authority implements apply to a great many airlines currently. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparisons with the United States-I have made this statement before not just in relation to the aviation industry but to a whole lot of other things in terms of public affairs in Australia-are fraught with danger. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Beazley is well aware of that, and that is why it is important-and I have said this many times during this public debate-not to make the extravagant and overstated claims as some have about the likely beneficial impacts of deregulation in the Australian market. That is why I said that I do partially agree with some of the things Senator Kernot said. We have a country the size of the United States with a population the size of the city of Los Angeles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have an aviation market in Australia which is tiny compared with the aviation market of the United States. Just one American airline-the major airline in the United States-has got 20 times more aircraft than the entire combined fleet of all airlines in Australia flying over the same distances. I raise this because in particular comparisons with air fares between Australia and the United States, so often made by our political opponents with Senator MacGibbon among them, are almost entirely not valid for the same reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about a high quality service in Australia with one of the most modern airline fleets in the world, in terms of the age of the aircraft, servicing a great many ports with what is, by international standards, a very low volume of traffic. It is very easy from where I come from to run an argument and get lots of public support for it that the air fares from Darwin to Sydney or Canberra are, in comparison with the air fares from New York to San Francisco, very high. That is not a valid comparison because it is a different market with different commercial realities applying to it. There was a prospect raised by some that when the airline industry is deregulated on 31 October there will be a flood of applicants all falling over each other to get into the industry and compete with the majors that currently are in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I found it interesting as the responsible Minister, when the question was raised of deregulation and new entrants, that one of the first things that were asked of me in the very first interview I gave on the subject was: `Is the Government going to provide substantial financial assistance to the new entrants to provide an even playing field for them to compete with two airlines that have had a government guaranteed monopoly for 40 years?', which simply indicates the mindset that a lot of people in this country have about the role that governments should or should not play in this kind of enterprise. The answer to the question was: `No, we are not going to'. </PARA>
<PARA> What I said yesterday in a debate on telecommunications applies in this debate: there are two very important sectors of public activity in Australia, that is, the areas of both transport and communication, where for a very long time to come a natural monopoly applies. That remains in the airline industry. It is a very expensive industry to get into. The overheads are horrific in respect of the general aviation area, that is, charters and commuter traffic. The only reason that one would want to be an executive in that particular industry is if one loved flying very much indeed. One has to be pretty committed. It is a tough industry in which to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read everything that Senator MacGibbon has said in the Parliament on the two-airline agreement. He is perfectly correct in saying what he did about his contribution to the debate in 1981, but the two-airline agreement did serve the country very well for quite a long time. A myth has been created that today the two-airline agreement is still performing a useful social service, as was referred to by the Australian Democrats. The facts simply do not support that contention any longer. They did once. There is a myth that Australian Airlines, because of its government ownership, provides a useful social service in, for example, servicing ports which perhaps there is not a clear commercial reason to service. That is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently Australian Airlines services 25 per cent of the ports that were serviced in the mid-1970s. For the last 20 years Australian Airlines has been taking decisions in terms of its operations that are entirely commercial, thank goodness. That is one of the reasons for the current very successful operation of Australian Airlines. I might say that Senator MacGibbon's claim that the sale of Australian Airlines is automatically predicated on the passage of this legislation and the new regime that operates after 31 October is nonsense. If the Government were minded to provide 100 per cent of the additional equity that is required by Australian Airlines, which the Government is not minded to do, Australian could continue to operate aggressively and successfully, as it is now operating against Ansett. There is no question but that the time has now arrived for that agreement to be concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say, coming from the Northern Territory, that I was a member of the Government when it took the decision to give the necessary three years notice to terminate the agreement. The time has now arrived for the agreement to be concluded and for other entrants to be allowed the opportunity to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received some criticism from some of these new entrants because I dared to discuss publicly the very things I am discussing now-that is, the reality of the Australian aviation industry and the very strong likelihood that there was not going to be an avalanche of new operators rushing to the gates to get into the airline business because of the cost of getting into it and the reality of the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those new operators took some considerable exception to the remarks that I made about the potential result of deregulation on the two major airlines. Senator Kernot quoted Sir Peter Abeles, apparently in some sort of criticism that he made this extraordinary statement that he was going to kick the head in of any competitor who tried to compete with Ansett. That is not a very extraordinary statement to make. I expect that he will, and so will Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said publicly, it is going to be a very silly new entrant in the airline business in Australia who comes into it thinking that the two majors are simply going to continue to operate the way they are currently operating. They will be very much mistaken if they do. That is the purpose of this particular exercise-to change the nature of the Australian aviation industry to provide now for that additional competition, to sharpen up the activities of the two existing operators, and to remove that comfortable duopoly which Senator Kernot seriously wants to maintain. I am not sure why she has such a passionate enthusiasm for supporting Ansett. Nevertheless, the Government is not of a mind to continue to support the duopoly and we are going to allow some new entrants to come in. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to explain why the Government decided to opt for the decision it made to terminate the agreement and not simply to provide for a three-airline policy, which is what East-West Airlines wanted. Do not let anybody think that Mr Grey from East-West Airlines was interested in deregulating the airline industry when East-West started up in its operations against Ansett in Australia: it wanted a three-airline policy. We could have opted for that course, but it is the view of the Government-and frankly I think that that view is being sustained right now, even though it is only early days-that the regulator that is provided naturally by the Australian aviation market will be sufficient to provide for whatever regulation is required after 31 October. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some criticism that the arrangements that were made in terms of gate access, which is very important for new entrants, were not going to be sufficient. Today Senator MacGibbon delivered another piece of nonsense consistent with the trail of nonsense that he has delivered in aviation debates ever since I have been here. He said that these were outrageous arrangements. He painted a picture of all these new entrants waiting at the doors unable to get a gate. The reality is that that is rubbish. Currently, rather than the 11 new starters that Senator Kernot mentioned, as I speak the only new entrant on the blocks-not yet ready to fly but in a position where it certainly will be flying-is Compass Airlines. So far the only new entrant which is even in the process of negotiating for gate access at the airports is Compass Airlines-one entrant. If Senator MacGibbon has information about airlines that are currently unable to get gate access and are ready to start flying and using the gates-they are expensive facilities and Senator MacGibbon would be the last person to agree that they should not be used-I would like to hear from him which companies they are. I know that the response to that invitation will be a resounding silence. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as safety is concerned, there is also a myth, perpetuated and pushed to extremes all through the dispute by Senator MacGibbon's good friends, the executives of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, that deregulation in the United States has led to a drastic reduction in safety standards. The facts indicate precisely the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be amazed to hear that safety was a matter of some concern in the United States of America and that American air travellers are just as concerned about their safety as Australian air travellers are concerned about ours. As a result of this concern, the President of the United States commissioned a major investigation into the effects of deregulation on air safety and a presidential report that was commissioned, and which I have read, indicates that, in the 10 years after deregulation in the United States, safety standards have improved compared with those in the 10 years prior to deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I hasten to add that the report was also careful to point out-and I make the point here-that that was not necessarily due to the magic of deregulation. There is no magic attached to deregulation. It could well have been due to a whole range of other factors which the report listed. But the argument that deregulation in the United States has led to a massive decrease in safety, and an increase in accidents, deaths, fatalities and injuries, is simply nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot mentioned a major airline operator in the United States who is facing a number of charges for the extraordinary crime of faking maintenance reports. There is nothing extraordinary about it; it is certainly heinous and deserving of the maximum penalties, but I regret to advise the honourable senator that it has occurred in Australia under the existing system. One operator in the Northern Territory was guilty of faking maintenance records by having a drawer full--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of safety, it is irrelevant whether one is a passenger on an interstate or intrastate aircraft if one goes nose first into the ground from 10,000 feet and gets smeared all over the landscape. The safety regime in Australia applies equally across all air operations. It does not just apply to the majors. The Civil Aviation Authority and the Australian Bureau of Air Safety Investigation are responsible for regulating and investigating accidents in all aviation sectors in Australia, both interstate and intrastate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Matters such as faking maintenance records are entirely relevant to the question of aviation safety. Things like that occur. The important thing is that they be discovered and the people responsible be prosecuted. That is exactly what happens in Australia. There is no reason whatever to draw a conclusion that the entry of additional operators into the market in Australia will lead of itself to a diminution of the current regime of safety. It will not. The reality of the Australian market will dictate that there will not be a flood of new entrants flying port to port over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot also raised as a criticism the fact that there is likely to be limited competition from the new entrants on certain routes in Australia. She said that they are not going to compete across the board. Of course they will not. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable senator's interjection, I will tell her why we are deregulating it. As regrettable as I might find it, a very large number of our citizens choose to live in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Coolangatta and Brisbane, and a very substantial number of Australians will benefit from deregulation after 31 October. In respect of the honourable senator's concerns for the Northern Territory-and I appreciate them-I assure her, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I keep a very close eye on the loadings of aircraft in and out of the Northern Territory. I am in constant consultation, and I was before becoming the Minister, because of the concerns I have for the Northern Territory's interests and the kinds of loadings in the Northern Territory. They are holding up very well indeed, and as a result we are still getting very frequent flights of aircraft such as Boeing 767s into the Northern Territory, because the bums are there to fill the seats. At the end of day, that is what counts. Places such as Alice Springs, in particular, have nothing to fear from deregulation and its effects on the amount of traffic going through their airports. In fact, they have the prospect of everything to gain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said again yesterday, there will be a shake-out in the industry; there is no question about that. What is detrimental to one interest will end up being beneficial to another. Yesterday Senator MacGibbon raised the question of Mount Isa in another classic piece of nonsense. He said that the port of Mount Isa is no longer serviced by major airlines because of the airline pilots dispute. He never addressed himself to the question of why they have not gone back there since the dispute was resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that debate yesterday, someone spoke to me about recently travelling out of Mount Isa in an 18-seater commuter aircraft. That is exactly what will happen in some places. If jet aircraft do not service them because of the short distances involved and the low number of passengers carried, regional airlines will pick up the benefit and provide that service if the demand is there. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those points, I stress again that on the question of air safety in relation to deregulation the Government has given very clear statements which will be implemented and which say that there will be no-I repeat, no-reduction in the standards of air safety applied in Australia after deregulation. As Senator MacGibbon has said in his contribution to this debate, the reason why this legislation deserves the support of the Parliament is that, despite the fact that the two-airline agreement did serve Australia well for a very long time, the time has now come for a new regime to be implemented to provide for additional competition. However, having said that, I stress that it is ridiculous in the same argument to overstate the case by suggesting that there will be massive decreases in air fares and avalanches of new operators waiting at the gates to get into the industry. There will not be. I believe that in the nature of Australia's aviation industry there will be a gradual change which will be to the overall aggregate benefit of a majority of Australians who fly. For that reason, I hope that the Senate supports this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and join Senator MacGibbon in hoping that it has a speedy passage through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It falls to my lot to speak to the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill on behalf of the Opposition as during the period it was under shadow Cabinet consideration and party room consideration I was acting shadow Minister on behalf of my colleague Senator Michael Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the establishment of the Australian National Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour in Sydney. More particularly, it outlines the functions and powers of the museum and provides for the establishment of the Museum Council to replace the Interim Council. </PARA>
<PARA> At first glance, the legislation itself certainly appears to be non-controversial. That is certainly not the case with regard to the issue of the establishment of the museum itself. Indeed, for some considerable time it has been fraught with controversy and disagreement between the present New South Wales Government and the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, while one could not question the establishment of such a museum and the benefits which will be derived by the Australian community through the establishment and bona fides of such a project, one can question very seriously the way in which the establishment of this museum has been handled by the present Federal Government and the previous New South Wales Labor Government. There is no doubt that as it has been established, in terms of its location and its development, it has been very much a creature of politics. Its initial establishment and announcement was an election ploy and, from the outset, this project has been manipulated to further political ends. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to establish the museum at Darling Harbour was linked very closely to the political requirements of the New South Wales Wran Labor Government and in particular with its toy, the Darling Harbour development. In fact, the Director of the National Museum of Australia, Dr McMichael, commented to the effect that the initial announcement of this museum was a nice thing to say but not a decision that was made carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because this initial decision was not made carefully that it has been fraught with controversy ever since that announcement. At the time that Neville Wran went to a State election in March 1984, Prime Minister Hawke promised him $30m to establish a maritime museum. However, this promised provision of $30m was nothing more than a guesstimate in terms of what the museum would actually cost. As I have said, it was announced at that time purely as an election ploy in support of the then Labor Government in New South Wales to assist with its re-election. </PARA>
<PARA> The memorandum of understanding that was agreed to between that State Labor Government and the present Federal Labor Government stated that all costs in excess of the original figure of $30m would be met by the New South Wales State Government. In effect, the then Premier, Neville Wran, and the responsible State Minister, Laurie Brereton, now a member in the other place in this Federal Parliament, effectively signed an open cheque with the Federal Government with regard to this project. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that was part of the overall mismanagement of the Darling Harbour project that was very much a feature of Laurie Brereton's administration as a Minister at that time. He was very keen on fast-tracking the development of this project and, of course, as part of that fast-tracking concept, the fast-tracking of the establishment of this museum was included. </PARA>
<PARA> The $30m that was agreed to be contributed by the then Federal Government was based very much on indicative plans. There was no detailed architectural plan, no detailed concept developed at the time at which the New South Wales Government agreed to accept an offer of $30m from the Commonwealth Government as sufficient to cover the cost of this project. Also, the $30m related only to the cost of the building itself. One can question the competence of people who entered into such an agreement and completely ignored the fact that, of course, further money would be necessary to establish the museum itself once the building was constructed. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health whether he is aware of concerns expressed about the use of the Medicare card in proposals to reform the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). What is the Minister's response to these concerns?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2059" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health is, of course, very aware of concerns that have been raised on privacy grounds with the proposal to use the Medicare card to establish eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits scheme purposes. The measures announced in the Budget include very significant savings in government expenditure through administrative reform of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I wish to table a letter from the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Peter Staples, to the Privacy Commissioner which details the Government's intentions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the PBS, pharmacists are paid by the Health Insurance Commission to recompense them for the difference between the cost of drugs and the amount patients have to pay for them. A pharmacist is entitled to a higher payment from the Commission for a prescription dispensed to a pensioner than for a prescription dispensed to a general user, and the Government believes no subsidy at all should be paid for non-residents of Australia such as foreign tourists.</PARA>
<PARA> To run a tight system, it is necessary that the Commission be able to accurately verify the amount a pharmacist claims, and that will depend on what drug has been dispensed and in what quantities, and the status under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme of patients-whether they are residents of Australia, whether they are entitled to a concessional benefit or not.</PARA>
<PARA> When patients present at a pharmacist claiming to be entitled to a subsidy that they are not entitled to, who then should bear the cost-the patient who is not entitled, the pharmacist, or the public? The Government believes the public should not have to. So, if the pharmacist is not going to be made to bear the cost, the pharmacist needs a secure method of satisfying himself or herself of eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA> It is in that context that the Government has proposed a system which will be entirely voluntary for pharmacists. No pharmacist will be required to use the Medicare card system.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, any pharmacist who does use the system will be protected. They will be paid by the Commission whatever subsidy the Commission tells the pharmacist they are entitled to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In February, the Privacy Commissioner raised essentially two concerns with such a system: first, the flow of information from the Department of Social Security (DSS), which determines whether people are entitled to concessional pharmaceuticals, to the Commission and from the Commission to the pharmacist; and, second, the risk of embarrassment to patients when they claim a subsidy in the pharmacy, perhaps in the company of other customers, and are advised that it is not available. The Government has proposed to deal with those two concerns by legislation, to be introduced this sitting, which would, first, strictly define that the only information the DSS can provide to the Commission for these purposes is identity information and the status of the person under the PBS-DSS will not be permitted to provide any income or other information to the Commission; second, strictly define the information the Commission can provide to a pharmacist as being the PBS status of a patient inquired about; third, strictly regulate the use of Medicare identifier information by pharmacists and doctors and their staff; and, fourth, provide for the Privacy Commissioner to issue binding guidelines on the use of Medicare identifiers within pharmacies or doctors' surgeries following consultation with the relevant professional bodies. In practice, whenever a pharmacist knows his or her customer and is confident the customer is honest, there will be no need to use the system-and I think that answers Senator Boswell's primary concern-with the normal relationship between a longstanding customer and the pharmacist.</PARA>
<PARA> I think I have put the concerns that people have expressed in the proper context, and I believe my general answer yesterday still holds true-that, in trying to balance protection of the revenue with privacy considerations, quite clearly, the role of the Privacy Commissioner is going to be vital in determining the correct balance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to Senator Gareth Evans's statement in debate in the Senate on Tuesday that he believed a United Nations endorsement for military enforcement of sanctions against Iraq to be necessary and, in fact, to his understanding that the UN Security Council debate was then in progress. Regrettably, I now note the failure of the United Nations Security Council to resolve to enforce the sanctions or, I think, even to formally meet on the issue. I ask, firstly: How does the Government interpret this failure? Does it indicate a lessening of international resolve? What does the Government understand to be the obstacles being experienced in negotiations? Secondly, how will a failure by the international community to give UN sanction to the Gulf force affect Australia's role, particularly in light of President Bush's clear indications that he is running out of patience?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia would view with substantial disappointment any indecision from the United Nations, but I think in other public statements made by me, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade it has been indicated that the past history of the United Nations has not always been exemplary in trying to act with haste on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst there is a general resolve in the United Nations to carry, I think, four separate items relating to condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, imposing mandatory economic sanctions, going on to declare Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void and, finally, demanding that Iraq permit the facilitation of the immediate departure of foreign nationals, the Security Council has yet to grapple with what we all regard as the major issue: what good are economic sanctions without some enforcement? That is precisely the leadership that the United States has shown in this issue, and many other countries have responded. It is clearly the priority and the choice of the Australian Government to have UN sanction of that sort of interdiction. However, if it does not occur, we still believe that under international law the Americans are acting properly and we would continue to support their actions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for reminding me of that, Senator. The obstacles are a fear of threat of veto by one of the nations involved that is showing disquiet. The reasons for that disquiet could be not even related to this particular issue, but a bargaining chip somewhere else. The matter, when it was deferred by the Security Council, hinged on Yemen's agreement to deferring an Iraqi ship from visiting its ports and, if you like, put the issue off. If there is anything further I can gather on the subject, I will let the honourable senator know. We would still hope, however, that the Security Council would tackle this issue, but, as it has only really shown its resolve to tackle an issue of this consequence once before in its 40 years, one cannot rely on it to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources. Is it a fact that Australia is still not self-sufficient in petroleum products, leaving us sensitive to international oil industry developments? If this is a fact, can the Minister advise honourable senators what plans the Government has to stimulate oil exploration in Australian territory, particularly in the light of the implications of such emergencies as Iraq's attack on Kuwait?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2061" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is equivalent to about 90 per cent self-sufficient in crude oil at the present time. However, the problem is that Bass Strait reserves are running down at a rapid rate and, despite the fact that the Timor Sea and North West Shelf recent finds are replacing that depletion, we will be facing about 35 per cent self-sufficiency by the year 2000. That is a reasonably bleak scenario. That will happen if there are no other finds of oil, and that is the important consideration. Of course, that has major implications for our security. It also has major implications for our current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a lot of ill-informed talk about oil, and I just want to say this: there is really no need, if one is an Australian, to panic about the decline in self-sufficiency because Australia is a net exporter of energy. We are the world's leading exporter of coal; we are a major exporter of liquefied natural gas; we export uranium; and we export solar collectors of the renew- able energy sort. Our trade account balance in energy is in surplus and is expected to remain that way through to the end of this century.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done in the Budget is to recognise what a prudent government should always do, that is, look at ways in which there could be some stimulation of exploration in Australia. There are three determinants of the amount of exploration activity that goes on. One is the price of a barrel of oil. We all know that has been low until recently, so there has not been a price fall to stimulate exploration. Another is the prospectivity of the land to be explored. Australia is a lightly explored country. In 1867 the United States of America had drilled 5,500 exploration wells. Until 1990 Australia had drilled the same number of wells. That gives an indication of how lightly explored we, as a country, are. The other determinant is cost, of which tax is a subset.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget on Tuesday night the Treasurer announced that there would be tax deductions for the removal of offshore oil platforms-a major concern for the Bass Strait producers in particular; that from 1 July there would be deduction across the company for costs against the resource rental tax payments for exploration; and that from 1 July resource rental tax would be introduced into Bass Strait. That would mean that Australia would forgo revenue of over $700m this year and next year, although in 1992-93 it would return a revenue positive result. We believe these steps will stimulate considerable new exploration in frontier areas that need to be explored.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my answer by saying that that is not just the Government's view-it is the industry view. Peter Willcox, who is the Chief Executive Officer of BHP Petroleum, in a press release on Tuesday referring to the Treasurer's statement, said:</PARA>
<PARA>BHP believed that this would result in higher levels of exploration . . . BHP agreed with the principle of applying an RRT in Bass Strait . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking for his company, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe this change will make a number of new oil developments in Bass Strait economic.</PARA>
<PARA>Most importantly, Keith Orchison, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, a group that until now has been a trenchant critic of Australian government policy on tax as stimulant for oil production, told Alan Griffiths, the Minister for Resources, in a telephone call-and then said approvingly, `Yes, of course, you can quote me wherever you go'-that his view of the Budget measures was: `At the end of this century when we look back on last night's Budget it will be seen as the most decisive moment in promoting oil exploration in Australia'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I preface my question by emphasising that I am asking Senator Button this question in his capacity as the Prime Minister's representative in the Senate. Firstly, does the Government believe that the protection of Australians in Kuwait and Iraq will be jeopardised by a military attack by Arab or United States (US) forces on one or both of those countries? If not, why not? Secondly, if war does break out, what changes will the Government make to the role and operating locations of Australian warships now en route to the Gulf of Oman? Thirdly, does the Government agree that a first strike on Kuwait and, possibly, Iraq would violate President Bush's assurance that US forces in Saudi Arabia are only fulfilling defensive roles? Finally, if so, was the Prime Minister misled on this critical point by President Bush in their phone conversation on Friday, 10 August?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Question Time yesterday Senator Powell asked me a question about some of these issues which invited me to speculate on the views of a number of commentators, particularly in the United States, which she cited in her question. Today, again, each of her questions invites me to speculate on the possibility of an attack by the United States on Kuwait or Iraq and to speculate further on reactions by Iraq to such an eventuality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made it clear yesterday that I did not think that was a particularly productive exercise. I further made it clear that I thought it was not very wise to indulge in speculation on this matter. The situation in the Middle East is, as the Government has made clear on many occasions, a very tense and difficult one. To speculate about military escalation and, in particular, to say anything that might run any risk of increasing the danger for our nationals now in Iraq or Kuwait would, in my view, be irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the part of the question that relates to a repositioning of the role of the Australian defence presence in the region is concerned, that is a matter which Senator Ray dealt with yesterday and I have nothing to add to what he said.</PARA>
<PARA> The only comment I am prepared to make is that our hope and the aim of the policy-including in the interests of Australian nationals caught up in the situation-is, of course, for a peaceful solution. Australia's posture of supporting the sanctions by assisting in a multilateral effort to make them effective, accepting the need for the United States and others to deter further Iraqi aggression and playing whatever role we can in diplomatic efforts is all directed towards that goal of a peaceful settlement of the situation in the Middle East. I cannot see that public speculation about an escalation of that situation into open conflict could do other than work in exactly the opposite direction, which, I am sure, Senator Powell is concerned about. The proposition that the Prime Minister has been misled by President Bush is, as far as the Government is concerned, nonsense.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I refer to the Minister's answer given to Senator Boswell yesterday, concerning the massive extension of the tax file numbering system in the Budget, in which the Minister advised that assurances had been given by Ministers that it is their intention that Mr Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, be involved in the monitoring the way in which these provisions work. I ask whether the Minister is aware of Privacy Commissioner Kevin O'Connor's remarks in this morning's media, where he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the Privacy Commissioner's concerns. In fact, during the course of the Government's discussions about a month ago on what would be in this year's Budget I had a meeting with the Privacy Commissioner. Because we were aware that there would be privacy concerns which would result from any extension of the use of tax file numbers, he was consulted early. Unfortunately, there has been some misquoting of the Privacy Commissioner. In fact, while I was in Sydney this morning a fax arrived in my office. It is very short and I propose to read it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Clearly, the extension of the TFN system raises significant privacy concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have acknowledged consistently, it is up to the Government and Parliament to decide what is appropriate by way of-(1) use of numbering systems for specific administrative purposes; and (2) the need to implement effective systems for control of waste and overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not indicated at any time that there is any breach of the law involved in these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated consistently, if these extensions occur and datamatching programs are increased, I will seek to ensure that strict privacy safeguards are applied.</PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Commissioner made his concerns-they are very proper concerns-clear to me some time back. Ever since that moment, the Government has been keen to act in accordance with his wishes. He will be circulating a discussion paper which will go into the kinds of guidelines that the Government should observe in the extension of this system. We will be very happy to implement guidelines proposed to us by the Privacy Commissioner once he has been able to undertake those consultations.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, we have provided resources to him to make sure that he and his staff can monitor whatever my Department does in this respect to ensure that people do not have to worry about their private affairs being exposed.</PARA>
<PARA> There will be no linkages between departments. The important thing to note here is that magnetic tapes will be carried between departments and information on them matched. Information will be destroyed every three months. There will be no central data bank. I might say that personally I would not have a bar of one, anyway.</PARA>
<PARA> Innocent people have nothing whatsoever to fear. The Privacy Commissioner will be peering over our shoulder every second to ensure that, as he should do. We have made sure that extra resources are provided to him for exactly that purpose. Those senators opposite will not need to worry about it; neither will any Australian. The only people who need to worry are those who are ripping off the system.</PARA>
<PARA> One does not come up with a figure of $400m a year for the next few years that one can get from cheats, unless one is confident that this new kind of technology, this high-speed computer matching, will catch many people who have ripped off the system. We will catch those people who might be receiving an unemployment benefit and are declaring other incomes. We will catch those people who are claiming somebody as a dependent spouse even though they are getting a sole parent's pension. A whole range of people who are rorting the system can now be caught by the use of new technology. From the very first second of its implementation, privacy has been uppermost in our mind. Privacy concerns will not be ignored.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations: Do the figures recently released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) concerning labour costs in 1988-89 show that the proportion of employees covered by superannuation has risen considerably in the past three years? Given that a key objective of the Government is to extend superannuation cover to all, who are the beneficiaries of this policy? What are the implications of the ABS survey?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2065" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 August the ABS published a survey on major labour costs. It showed a number of interesting features, one of which, by way of an aside, is that the cost of workers compensation in Australia as a component of overall labour costs has declined, indicating that at least in the area of compensation greater efficiency has been achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that in 1985 the percentage of the work force covered by superannuation was about 40 per cent, it showed an increase in 1988-89 to 54.6 per cent of the Australian work force now having some form of superannuation cover. It indicated that 80 per cent of workers covered by awards of either the State or the Federal Commission are now entitled, as a consequence of the national wage case decision in December 1986, to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA> That indicates an immense and significant social change for Australia. It is one that the Government has supported on social justice and equity grounds. It is one that we have supported on the basis of encouraging people to make proper provision for their retirement so that in their old age they can enjoy a higher standard of living than they might have otherwise anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course it is proper for a government to do that on the basis that we recognise that the greying-that is, the ageing-of the Australian population will impose on future governments significant retirement costs.</PARA>
<PARA> However, one of the elements of the survey indicates that while 80 per cent of workers covered by awards have access to superannuation, only 75 per cent of those with award coverage are receiving superannuation. That indicates a high level of non-compliance. When that level of non-compliance is disaggregated, we find that there is very high to almost perfect compliance in extending superannuation provision in the public sector. But in the private sector there is less than full observance of the award entitlement by private sector employers.</PARA>
<PARA> This raises an important question. Superannuation, where it appears in the award as a prescribed right, is a legal obligation on employers. It is an offence not to provide it. Where it is not being provided, those employers can be prosecuted and the workers obtain a payment to a recognised superannuation fund. The employer can then be fined for not complying with his legal requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of observing this indication in the statistics, the Commonwealth Government is now forming a national strategy to encourage compliance with the law. Any individual who finds in his particular case that the law has not been complied with is free to prosecute to obtain compliance, and should do so.</PARA>

<PARA> I conclude by saying that it is my very firm advice to employers who are in any doubt about their legal obligations to contact either my Department or the Confederation of Australian Industry-indeed, join it and receive its industry service. Otherwise they will be liable to prosecution and, having now been warned, they will have no further excuse.</PARA>

In part, the letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To enable pharmacists to confirm the eligibility of patients to general or concessional entitlement, the Commission will move to an interactive processing environment whereby pharmacists can be connected on-line to the Commission's computer system.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Will this mean that every time elderly pensioners, war veterans or the average family with a safety net card go to their pharmacy to get their pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) medication, they will first have to wait for their identification details to be checked via computer against other government records before the pharmacist is authorised to dispense their prescription? Is this not the same system that was canned by the previous Minister, Dr Blewett, just prior to the Federal election because of the concerns held by the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, and because of protests from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Medical Association that the Government was trying to introduce an identity or Australia card by stealth?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the capacity of a pharmacist to use the system of checking on the identity of a person by use of the Medicare card is, as I said previously, purely voluntary. A pharmacist will not have to adopt that process at all when an old age pensioner, a veteran or an ordinary member of a family in the district with whom he has a good relationship and knows well comes into his pharmacy. The pharmacist will know the person and know that he is entitled to the PBS benefit. Therefore, the pharmacist will not be taking any risk in dispensing the prescription with the expectation of payment under the PBS at the level to which that customer of the pharmacy is entitled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no need to fear a growing queue of the elderly, the infirm, veterans or ordinary family persons approaching a pharmacist. I am sure this matter is one where commonsense will prevail. As Senator Boswell has indicated, the local pharmacist will know his customers very well and will be able to process their prescriptions without any need to use this system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am no expert on the Cambodian situation, so I appreciated Senator Schacht giving some advance notice of the content of his question. Hence, I am able to give him an adequate answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of reports that between 100,000 and 150,000 Cambodians have been displaced as a consequence of the recent intensification of fighting within Cambodia. In May this year the Government provided $158,000 to the Australian Freedom from Hunger Campaign for emergency food assistance for displaced persons in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA> This followed an appeal from Phnom Penh through international agencies and non-government organisations. During 1989-90 Australia provided a total of $6.6m for humanitarian basic assistance within Cambodia through non-government organisations and international agencies. The Government is prepared to provide further emergency assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> A representative from the Australian Freedom from Hunger Campaign is currently in Cambodia to obtain details of what may be required and to prepare a proposal for the Government's urgent consideration. I can assure the honourable senator that the Government will consider sympathetically and urgently the proposal when it is received. Australia would also welcome contributions by other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia very much regrets that the intensification of fighting has brought further suffering to the Cambodian people. This has been largely as a result of increased military activity by the Khmer Rouge. These developments make it imperative that international efforts focus on achieving a comprehensive settlement as that is the only way of bringing an end to the conflict.</PARA>
<PARA> I can confirm press reports that China's Premier, Li Peng, has told the Cambodian resistance leader that the time was right for a political solution to the Cambodian problem and that China was willing, along with other concerned parties, to make efforts for a comprehensive, just and reasonable solution. In a statement issued in Beijing, the Cambodian resistance said that they supported a vital role for the United Nations and a comprehensive settlement; that they were willing to attend a meeting of Cambodian parties to be organised by the Paris conference co-chairmen-Indonesia and France-and to discuss, in a spirit of compromise, the establishment of a supreme national council at the earliest possible date; and accept that the agreements of the permanent five constitute the framework of a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia. This is in accordance with the ideas for a comprehensive settlement which Australia has been actively pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the statement by both China's Premier and the Cambodian resistance. The endorsement by the Cambodian resistance parties of the permanent five agreements and the efforts of the Paris conference co-chairmen could be an important step towards bringing about a comprehensive settlement with an enhanced United Nations role as a vehicle for settlement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly many pensioners are expressing some concern about that decision and are displaying a degree of confusion. That is not too surprising. It is a complex matter to explain to anybody, particularly to those in the community who are the most vulnerable and in that sense have the most to fear. However, on this occasion every person who will be affected by this decision to assume an income of 10 per cent on all funds over $2,000 will finish up with more disposable income and obviously will then be better off. Their pension may be reduced, but the private income they earn, even after tax, will mean that every single pensioner affected by this measure is better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One concern that has come through very clearly in the last two days is that pensioners might lose fringe benefits. Obviously that is important to many pensioners. They lose fringe benefits once they earn over $95 a week for a single pensioner, and I think $160 a week for a married couple. Because the Government knew that that would be a concern, there were long discussions about it and we have ensured that no pensioner who is receiving fringe benefits will lose them, irrespective of what interest may be assumed from any deposits that he or she has. So many, or most, of the concerns that pensioners have been expressing present no real reason for worry. I have spent quite a bit of time trying to put that to them.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of giving pensioners some advice, a financial advice system for pensioners-the financial information service, or FIS scheme-has been operating within the Department of Social Security (DSS). It has been operating for some time and 25,000 pensioners have taken advantage of it. There were only 25 officers around the country but we have increased that number to 65. So if pensioners wish to ring their local DSS offices, they will be able to be put in contact with people who will give them very good advice-much better advice, I might say, than that given by those who have been getting pensioners to stick their money in accounts at interest rates of 3 or 4 per cent, actually depriving themselves of income. People who are on pensions are not having a dream run in this society and we ought to do all we can to encourage them to use their money better and hence to be in possession of more disposable income and have a bit better time of it.</PARA>

Trade with Iraq has been the subject of a number of representations by rural organisations to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. This is one of the themes of Senator Crane's series of questions concerning wheat, and that commodity has been the subject of particular representations to the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I inform Senator Crane that the Minister indicated in a press release on 7 August that it is too early at this stage to consider specific compensation measures; that the Wheat Board has confirmed that no losses have been sustained at this stage; and that the Government and the Australian Wheat Board are monitoring the situation closely. He went on to say that any substantial reduction in wheat grower returns from previous year pools is protected by the underwriting arrangements-I understand that that is one of the elements of the honourable senator's question-and that these are unlikely to be triggered. He said that the Government naturally assumes that Iraq will honour its debts, and that there is a possible contingent liability under the national interest provisions of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation if it does not.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also the question of outstanding existing contracts, which total some 356,000 tonnes of wheat and 22,000 tonnes of rice. The Government will be looking at both these issues in due course.</PARA>

The Australian imports from Iraq were negligible.

At the time that nomination was made, the FAC manager of the airport at Coolangatta issued a written instruction to all staff that the site that was undisturbed was not to be interfered with, and no further sand was to be taken. Indeed, the FAC has taken some measures to protect the area and is taking additional measures by erecting a fence to further protect the area.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision by the Government to clear VHF channels 3, 4, 5 and 5a of television transmissions to permit extension of FM radio broadcasting is resulting in a degree of disruption to television reception on the south coast of New South Wales, particularly affecting the transmission of WIN-TV, the television station that is based in Wollongong. Its signal had emanated from Knights Hill near Wollongong and, as a result of the change and because of the local topography, about half of the resident population cannot get adequate reception of the new UHF signals from Knights Hill. This is a major inconvenience to the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now decided to try to resolve this problem by recommending that a UHF transmission site be found on the south coast to allow the UHF signal to be repeated in this area. The ideal site for this is in the Moreton National Park. The New South Wales Government has given formal approval for an area of the Moreton National Park to be made available for this purpose, provided the environmental problems are adequately examined and resolved by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is the report of the inquiry into this matter. One would have hoped that it would have resolved it. Unfortunately this report has not resolved it. Although it does say that there are two points in the Moreton National Park that would be suitable-and it gives a preference for one-it nonetheless suggests that there should be another inquiry to examine whether or not a different technical system might be adopted to bring this signal in in another way, and that the costs of such a different technical solution should now be examined. </PARA>
<PARA> As the shadow Minister for heritage, I am naturally concerned that the Moreton National Park be retained as a very important part of our heritage. Nonetheless, I also recognise the proper demands and requirements of people in the area who are being disadvantaged by a governmental decision. I simply ask the Government when it is considering this report that, if it is to inquire into the costs and disadvantages and advantages of this alternate system as recommended in this inquiry, it does so with remarkable speed, with more speed than it has shown in its approach to this matter in the past, and that it resolves the matter before any signal changes permanently disadvantage people in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> My own view is that ultimately the Little Forest Trig site is the one that is likely to be followed. It is the one that I understand suits both the transmission operator, WIN 4, and the community better. It involves very little ecological interference. There is not much, I must say, upon a quick reading of this report, that shows that there would be major damage to the region if this course of action were pursued. If the Government is going to have a supplementary inquiry into possible alternatives, it should, for heaven's sake, do so quickly and stop the disadvantage that would be there for residents of the south coast. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate that the plan of management submitted by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) into the Ashmore Reef national nature reserve is one of significant constitutional importance to Australia. The Ashmore and Cartier islands have had a very complex history. I note that on page 12 of the plan of management there is a very abbreviated statement with regard to sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the plan of management has been prepared by the ANPWS, which has always shown a contempt for others in the Northern Territory with regard to land grabbing for national parks and, in particular, the aspirations of the Northern Territory Government with regard to the Ashmore and Cartier Islands, I am very suspicious of this plan of management. Many honourable senators would be aware that at the time of self-government for the Northern Territory in 1978, the Ashmore and Cartier Islands were in effect annexed by the Commonwealth, which assumed responsibility for them. This action was taken by the Commonwealth in 1978 without consultation with the Northern Territory at the time of self-government. The issue became very controversial and was addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Marshall Perron, made a major submission to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in June of last year with regard to full self-government for the Northern Territory. That submission included a complete chapter, chapter 10, on the Ashmore and Cartier Islands, which addressed the appropriateness of re-incorporating the Ashmore and Cartier Islands into the Northern Territory, where there exists the appropriate constitutional framework for the management of laws and the appropriate management of the reef. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me is that that document has been on the Prime Minister's desk since June 1989, yet I note that in the proposed plan of management the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service gives no consideration to these constitutional issues. It does not address the fact that the Government ought to be giving attention to the appropriateness of the constitutional status first and foremost. It is not in any way addressed in the plan of management; it is not even addressed, and perhaps rejected, in the eyes of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> If the plan of management is to be implemented, it would have effect for 10 years until the date specified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette stating that the plan had come into operation. Ten years is a long time. Given that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory made a submission to the Prime Minister in June of last year in order to resolve this issue, I am most concerned that this matter has not been addressed. It appears to be another usurping of functions by a Commonwealth agency to bypass the proper arrangements that ought to be made between the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the report addresses many other proper environmental issues that should be addressed. I have not had time to go into a great deal of detail with regard to the environmental aspects of the report. I am sure that, given that professional aspect of the work of ANPWS, I would not want to question many of the issues relating to fishing, the environment or perhaps many of the very necessary issues that have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am deeply concerned that the constitutional issue has been bypassed, that the ANPWS has not engaged in and reported on a process for full and proper consultation. The plan of management just appears to be another greedy, nasty, sneaky means of the Hawke Government to bypass a proper appropriation of land and further administration to the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to address the plan of management for the Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve plan of management. The foreword to the report in front of us says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve with its major breeding colonies of seabirds and coral reef ecosystems is a biological resource of &gt;utstanding value. </PARA>
<PARA>The important issue before us is that that area be adequately protected and managed. If I might reflect for a moment on Senator Tambling's remarks, it is clear that in the past this area has not been adequately protected. Slightly after the section to which he drew our attention on sovereignty the report deals with the weather station and says:</PARA>
<PARA> An automatic weather station was erected on West Island in 1962. By 1970 all equipment had been stolen and the inner walls removed. The station was refurbished in 1971 but pilfering and vandalism again resulted in the destruction of the station. It was abandoned in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Commonwealth does not have the resources to adequately supervise these islands, one wonders just how well the Northern Territory might be able to manage that task, given that we are looking at a very small group of islands and a very extensive reef system which is closer to Timor than it is to the Australian mainland. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The islands and waters of the Reserve support extremely high concentrations of breeding seabirds, many species of which are nomadic and have their main breeding sites on small isolated islands. The islands are important as staging posts for the migration of those birds which migrate between Australia and the northern hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Forty-three of the seventy-eight bird species recorded from the Ashmore Islands are included on the Japan-Australia and the Australia-China Migratory Birds Agreements. These Agreements oblige Australia to protect the environments of the listed migratory and endangered bird species. </PARA>
<PARA>These statements make it quite clear that this group of very small islands play an extremely valuable role in conservation, not only for Australian biology but also for the protection of species which do not recognise national boundaries. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Large colonies of Sooty Terns, Crested Terns, Bridled Terns and Common Noddies breed on East and Middle Islands-</PARA>
<PARA>two of the three islands-</PARA>
<PARA>with the number of breeding pairs ranging up to 50,000. </PARA>
<PARA>It is of concern, therefore, that in the past, as I have already said, the islands have come under extreme pressure, particularly from over-exploitation of the fishing reserves, from the poaching of eggs and adult birds by visiting fishermen and by the destruction caused by introduced species, particularly the common black rat, Rattus rattus. </PARA>
<PARA> It is encouraging that we have a plan of management for this area but at the same time rather concerning that the level of surveillance which is necessary to ensure the success of that plan of management will not be carried out sufficiently. It is essential that the Government not only proclaim a plan of management for an environment of significance-the environment of Ashmore Reef-but also provide sufficient resources properly to monitor and manage that environment. Without proper resourcing the destructive practices which we have seen in the past on the reef will simply continue, and the reef system and its bird populations will further decline. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is confident that the current management practices will be sufficient to protect this reserve from illegal fishing. However, I am not convinced that adequate measures exist to control the illegal fishing industry on other offshore islands in the Timor Sea. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of oil exploration is also raised in this report and the comments on the representations concerning Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve plan of management, which we will be debating next. It is suggested that a 50-kilometre exclusion zone be established around the Reserve. In view of the very extensive feeding habits of some of these migratory birds, one wonders whether that 50 kilometre exclusion zone will be sufficient to ensure that some of those species are sufficiently and adequately protected. Of particular concern are the four species of frigate bird and booby, which may-and we do not know this-have a foraging range which runs out as far as 300 kilometres. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Included in the documentation tabled with regard to the comments on the representations concerning the Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve is a copy of a submission from the Curator of Echinoderms and Molluscs from the Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory, Dr L. Vail. It is pleasing that the plan of management picks up the professional representations that were made. A number of important ecological and environmental issues are addressed in the submission from Dr Lyle Vail and have obviously been taken into account in the plan of management. </PARA>
<PARA> This highlights the point I was making in discussing the earlier paper: that the professionalism of the officers is certainly not in question in addressing the major issues of the management and the environment that do need to be attended to, particularly with regard to these very important islands in the Ashmore and Cartier islands structure. This only heightens my concern that I reflected on when speaking to the previous paper, that similar consultation was not engaged in on the other very important issues that relate to constitutional matters and administration. For that reason I see the political overtones, the fact that professional arguments can be addressed by the museums and art galleries of the Northern Territory and many others that have put submissions in. The fact is that the political representations that have been made to the Government directly from the Chief Minister to the Prime Minister have obviously been totally ignored and are not addressed in the plan of management. This therefore only heightens my concern with regard to the constitutional aspects of these important papers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I would like to congratulate the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories for publishing separately the comments on representations concerning the Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve. It is very encouraging to be able to read these submissions and comments in some detail and to form, as it were, an independent opinion about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One aspect in relation to the submissions and the comments to which I briefly referred a moment ago is the question of oil drilling on and in the vicinity of the reef. The document now before us speaks of the 50-kilometre exclusion zone but quite clearly recognises that, should exploration within that area lead to the discovery of oil, it is anticipated that exploitation of that reserve might be countenanced. It goes on and talks about the sorts of protection mechanisms that might be mandated for that to occur `safely'. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that during the months when the birds are nesting on these islands, somebody is on the islands to, as far as possible, ensure that poaching and destruction of eggs do not occur. I also understand from a person who has been on the islands that they are an extremely frightening place during the cyclone season. They are very low islands and it is extremely hazardous being there at that time of the year. I merely raise the prospect of a spill of oil occurring within or near the 50-kilometre zone under those sorts of circumstances. Is it realistic to expect that the sorts of protective measures which are hinted at in this report could indeed be effectively prosecuted? I very much doubt whether they could be. Therefore, it seems to the Australian Democrats rather dangerous to allow that sort of exploration with the prospect of exploitation within that 50-kilometre exclusion zone. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I raise in relation to this particular document goes back to the matter of proper surveillance and protection. One of the points which the Democrats have made over some considerable time is the desirability for Australia to purchase a fleet of the Canadian CL215 aircraft which could be used for aerial surveillance and interception in this area. I understand that the person who is on the island is equipped with an inflatable rubber boat which is quite incapable of going out to intercept invading or poaching fishermen. By the time the Royal Australian Navy is able to get a ship out into this vicinity to intercept these fishermen, they are over the horizon. When the Navy ship goes, the fishermen come back again. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential, if we are going to properly supervise the vast area across the north in terms of protecting these very important wildlife areas, protecting fish closer to Australian shores and preventing drug running and the importation of exotic diseases into Australia, that we have an adequate and rapid means not only of surveillance but of interception of people entering these areas and acting illegally. It is for that reason that we believe Australia would be wise to buy a fleet of these CL215 aircraft which could go out,directly land on the water and intercept these activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the question of surveillance, may I bring to the Senate's attention that a fortnight ago I visited the Cook Islands and was able to see one of the two Australian patrol boats which were given to that country being trialled and its crew being trained for surveillance purposes. Two days after the trials, at which the capacities of these boats were demonstrated, the boats, acting on some radar information, captured two Taiwanese fishing boats which were trespassing upon the Cook Islands. They were not trespassing in terms of directly spoiling the flora and fauna of an island-a matter which was raised by Senator Coulter. But they were taking hundreds of tonnes of fish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make this interesting observation: a radio operator who spoke Maori was placed on each Australian patrol boat so that all radio communications between the two boats could not be understood by the fishermen on the Taiwanese fishing boats. The patrol boats were able to communicate properly yet not be understood by the trespassers on their territory. This was a feature of this first success of the Cook Islands patrol boats capturing trespassing fishing vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> I put the suggestion that the Aboriginal people of the Kimberleys or the Northern Territory might well be employed as radio operators on aeroplanes or naval vessels. Their own language could be used to coordinate operations. If this were done, the chances are that any trespasser, whether from Indonesia or even Taiwan, would not, by understanding English, be able to learn what strategy and tactics our planes or ships might be taking. This would ensure the proper surveillance of Australia. I leave that suggestion for all honourable senators to ponder. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that this report, which has been tabled in the Senate today, is dated 8 July 1988. I draw that to the Senate's attention by way of comment on the fact that the time involved in presenting this report will not break any track records. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters I wish to raise generally are of Commonwealth funding to sport. Of course, that is a matter which relates not only to 1988-which this report covers-but also the latest Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It was noted in this report that there was some concern about the extent to which there was inadequate liaison between the State and Federal governments in the provision for funding for elite athletes. This is a matter that I want to pursue at some length. I do not have the time to do so now; I am simply drawing attention to the fact that it is a matter that the Opposition is concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I want to raise is the organisation of disabled sport in Australia, which was agenda item 12 at this meeting and was also raised at the March 1989 meeting, which is the subject of the next paper on the business sheet. The Opposition in general and I in particular are interested in and concerned about the need to provide adequate Federal financial support for disabled sport in Australia, not simply as a sporting factor but also in the areas of rehabilitation and health. Apart from the psychological benefits that emerge from participation in disabled sport, there is also a clear physical benefit to be gained. </PARA>
<PARA> With that in mind, I attended the World Disabled Games in Assen in northern Holland last month. I might say that any Australian who visited there would have been impressed to see the very high standard of competition from disabled athletes. In fact, the Australian from South Australia who won the World Games judo contest-he is totally blind-is a State open champion and can hold his own in non-blind competition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very grateful to the organisers of the World Games for allowing me, as a visiting Australian politician, to present the gold medal to an Australian for winning that event. I also presented some bronze medals to track and field athletes. I think all Australians would be massively proud of the extraordinarily good result that disabled athletes were able to achieve in those World Games at Assen. </PARA>
<PARA> I am strongly of the view that there should be greater support for these events. I certainly supported the decision taken in 1988 that there should be a proper inquiry into funding for disabled games. Frankly, I would encourage the Government to pay far more attention to the funding of disabled sport than to its attempts to pick winners through the concentration of additional funding to elite sports. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not knocking the concept of providing support for elite sports. However, it concerns me that there appears to be an unevenness in the handling of sporting activities. I do not think it is the Government's job to go around the place trying to pick winners at the next Olympic Games. I think it is the job of the Government to provide broad-based support and I would like to see bigger proportions of that support going to disabled games. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The achievement of good industrial relations in Australia is essential for the success of our economy and the furtherance of social justice. This is even more the case during a time when the Australian economy is being fundamentally reformed. The reform objective is crucially affected by the operation of our national industrial relations system. Such a system should be capable of being an effective instrument for change in a way which is fair to employers, workers and their unions, while safeguarding our national economic and industrial interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has, since taking office in 1983, sought to ensure that this is achieved. Our considerable success in improving Australia's industrial relations performance is on the record and has been internationally recognised. Credit must be given to the union movement for its restraint and preparedness for reforms in the national interest. Employers and their organisations are generally demonstrating a constructive approach towards economic and industrial change. Broadly put, a substantial degree of consensus has emerged that micro-economic reform is a key national priority and that industrial relations has a key role in it. </PARA>
<PARA> No sector of industry is immune from the need to become more efficient and competitive. Governments, employers and workers must be partners in achieving reform quickly, fairly and without industrial friction. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade unions which choose to participate in our national industrial relations system must have the capacity for constructive participation in the reform process. Their capacity depends to a crucial degree on the relevance of their structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for a more rational union structure has been recognised and appreciated for some time now by almost all involved in industrial relations. It has been emphasised in no less than five major economic reports to various Australian governments. The Jackson report on manufacturing industry in 1975, the report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1977, the Myers report on technological change in 1980, the report of the Hancock Committee of review of Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems in 1985 and this year's report by the Australian Manufacturing Council all agree on this point: that the multiplicity of unions is an impediment to industrial and administrative efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The union movement itself recognises that there is a need for its rationalisation along broad industry lines and that the process of reform should not be complicated by the involvement of numerous unions in the requisite negotiations and bargaining between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly in the interests of workers that they share in the benefits of economic restructuring. Those benefits will be maximised if their unions are to have the capacity and organisation to identify more closely with the interests of individual industries and enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The major thrust therefore of the measures which I am presenting today is intended to reform the national industrial relations system in ways which will meet these needs. An inter-related package of legislative and administrative measures is to be implemented. Changes will be made to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which affect the size, number and industrial coverage of federally registered unions. The amendments are designed to encourage:</PARA>
<PARA> * a substantial reduction in the numbers of such unions; and</PARA>
<PARA> * those unions being more oriented in their industrial operations towards particular industries and sectors of industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The main elements of the amendments are:</PARA>
<PARA> * additional objects in the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> * new requirements as to the membership of unions for their registration or continued registration under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> * the recognition of federations of organisations proposing to amalgamate;</PARA>
<PARA> * revised procedures to bring about speedier amalgamations;</PARA>
<PARA> * changes to the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make orders altering the coverage of work by federally registered unions; and</PARA>
<PARA> * some revision of the Act's preference provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>New Objects</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In exercising their powers under the Act, the Commission, the Federal Court of Australia and the Industrial Registrar must have regard to the scope and purpose of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This is reinforced by the Commission's express statutory obligation to take account of the Act's objects, which include those expressed in section 3. </PARA>
<PARA> Two new objects are to be included in that section. One is to encourage and facilitate amalgamations under the Act. The other is to encourage and facilitate the development of organisations registered under the Act, particularly by reducing the numbers that are in an industry or enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> These new objects reflect the underlying intention of the Bill, namely to assist in the rationalising of organisations, particularly unions, in a way which is consistent with our national economic, industrial and social interest. I must emphasise that the objects are not intended to be read individually. To the extent that it is appropriate, they are to be taken and applied together. </PARA>
<PARA>Size of Unions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> At present to be registered a union must, unless there are special circumstances, be industry-based and have at least 1,000 members who are employees or whose usual occupation is as an employee. Existing registered unions with fewer than 1,000 employees will have their continued registration reviewed from 1 March 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> These requirements are to be changed under clauses 12 and 14 of the Bill. The figure of 1,000 will be altered to 20,000, but a union with a smaller membership will be able to be registered if it can show that its registration is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> For existing small registered unions, the 20,000 membership requirement is to be phased in, so they will be subject to a two-stage review. The existing review relating to unions with fewer than 1,000 members will proceed in 1992. A review of the continued registration of unions with fewer than 20,000 members will commence on 1 March 1994. In either case, the union's registration is to be cancelled if it cannot be shown that there are special circumstances which justify its continuation in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that cancellation of a union's registration will not be automatic. There will be due process. Each small union will be given an opportunity to present its case. Decisions will be reviewable on appeal. It will be for the Commission to decide on an appropriate order according to the circumstances of each case. The Commission could, in some cases, be influenced by the absence of another union which could properly represent the interests of employees in a particular industry. It may consider the industrial or economic consequences of deregistration, particularly if the small union concerned is the major union in the particular industry or sector concerned. In appropriate cases, the Commission may take into account the views of the workers affected as to how their industrial interests should be represented. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also noted that the minimum size requirement does not affect the existence of a union, or its operation, outside the federal conciliation and arbitration system. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provisions will encourage small unions to consider their place in the national industrial relations system, and put the onus on them to justify it. </PARA>
<PARA>Federations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A new provision will be included in the Act's revised amalgamation Division to permit the recognition for the purposes of the Act of a federation of registered organisations proposing to amalgamate within a prescribed period of three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a federation will be voluntary and the organisations concerned will be able to dissolve it, if they wish. While the federation exists, however, it will be able to represent for the purposes of the Act all or any of its constituent organisations, for instance, in proceedings before the Commission. A federation will, however, not be capable of being a party to an award. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will help registered organisations, whether of employers or employees, to prepare for amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA>Amalgamations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The voluntary restructuring of the union movement should be encouraged. To assist unions to rationalise, the Act's amalgamation provisions are to be completely revised. Their operation will be quicker and more adaptable. Mechanisms for avoiding or minimising technical difficulties and other problems will be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 of the Bill repeals the Act's existing amalgamation Division. The new Division has several notable features. </PARA>
<PARA> A statement of legislative intention is to be included. This will emphasise the importance of the Act's new objects relating to amalgamations and the development of organisations as well as the existing object concerning the efficient management of organisations. Speed and the avoidance or minimising of problems in the amalgamation process will be emphasised. Reference will also be made to the existing object concerning the need for democratic control of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> This will provide guidance to the Commission and the Federal Court of Australia when they come to exercise their powers in relation to amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing amalgamation procedures will be telescoped and modified to overcome their current unnecessarily protracted and sequential operation. Amalgamation proposals which now can take anything up to two years to be decided under the Act should be able to be completed in a few months at most. This will also be assisted by a provision giving a Presidential Member wide powers to resolve any difficulties encountered in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> A designated Presidential Member of the Commission will be responsible for hearing and determining certain matters before a proposed amalgamation may be submitted to ballots of members. Among other things, the member will deal with any application for a declaration of a community of interest between the organisations. Such a declaration will result in less onerous requirements for approval of an amalgamation ballot. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing provision relating to a community of interest is to be changed in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide greater flexibility in the processes, organisations proposing to amalgamate will be able to seek a declaration before formally lodging a scheme for a proposed amalgamation, or at the same time as the scheme is lodged. </PARA>
<PARA> The community of interest test itself will be changed to improve its operation. There will be specified criteria which if met will lead to the making of a declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will also have a discretion to find a community of interest in other circumstances. The criteria themselves will be changed to make them more practical. At present, they are effectively inoperative where a very large organisation seeks to amalgamate with a small organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> To overcome this, a substantial number of members of one of the organisations will have to meet the criteria. Currently a substantial number of members of all the organisations must satisfy those criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in line with views expressed in 1980 in the National Labour Consultative Council and supported by a Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change will be to dispense with the present requirement that the Commission be satisfied that the amalgamation will further the objects of the Act. It is considered that this will be redundant, given the Act's new explicit objects and the statement of legislative intention to which I have referred. To the extent that the objects are applicable to a community of interest matter, they must be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Some changes are proposed to the requirements for amalgamation ballots which are to be conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be possible to have a secret postal ballot or a ballot at meetings of members with secret voting. In the latter case, a Presidential Member must agree and there must be appropriate protection for members, such as provision for absentee voting. The Federal Court may inquire into any alleged irregularities. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, if a Presidential Member approves, a ballot need not be conducted of members of a large organisation which is amalgamating with smaller organisations. Such an exemption may be granted where the membership of the smaller bodies does not exceed 5 per cent of the total membership of the proposed amalgamated organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure will be increased to 25 per cent. There are practical difficulties, including problems of organisation and cost, where a very large organisation is proposing to amalgamate with smaller organisations. The higher figure balances such practical considerations against the effects of an amalgamation on the interests of the members of the larger organisation. An exemption will still be subject to approval by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> New provisions are also to be included to provide for the automatic succession of an amalgamated organisation to the rights, liabilities and property of an organisation which is deregistered when an amalgamation takes effect. The Federal Court will have power to resolve any difficulties that may arise. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be new provisions which validate unintended irregularities in the amalgamation process. Irregularities in ballots cannot be validated in this way. The Federal Court will be able in appropriate cases to overrule the validation of an irregularity. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change is to be made to assist the amalgamation process. A committee of management of an organisation will be able to use the organisation's funds and other resources to support a proposed amalgamation up to the close of the ballot, provided the committee so resolves. Members will need to be given reasonable notice of such a decision. This provision is intended to address difficulties arising from a recent Federal Court decision which restricted the period in which resources could be used in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>Orders changing union coverage of work</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> If union rationalisation is to be effective and occur quickly, there must be an effective mechanism for adjusting the rights of unions to represent the interests of particular classes or groups of workers. At present, the Commission may only make such adjustments to resolve actual or likely demarcation disputes. This is too narrow and some technical legal problems have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, a new provision is proposed which will permit a Presidential Member or a Full Bench of the Commission to alter a union's representative rights by making those rights exclusive, removing them or conferring them. That power will be exercisable on application by an organisation, an employer or the Minister. In exercising it, the Commission will be obliged to have regard to the public interest and to the Act's objects. One of the new objects will be especially relevant. That object relates to the development of organisations, particularly by reducing their numbers in an industry or enterprise. Even so, the objects of the Act as a whole should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The power to adjust union coverage will be available to prevent or settle disputes, but it is to be hoped that Australia's industrial parties are sufficiently mature to address issues of union coverage in a rational, constructive way. Agreed changes can be implemented under this provision. A greater industry orientation for unions, which is widely supported, should be achievable. </PARA>
<PARA> Larger unions are more likely to take part in voluntary changes of coverage than smaller unions. That situation will be brought about by smaller unions taking advantage of the new amalgamation provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Preference</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Some changes are proposed under clause 11 to the provisions of the Act governing the power of the Commission to award preference. To clarify the provision, specific examples are to be given of the types of matters which can be the subject of preference orders. These matters are within the scope of the Commission's existing powers. In addition, the Commission will, if it thinks fit, be able to require preference to be given to persons who have applied for membership of federally registered unions. At present, preference can only be awarded to particular unions or members of unions. It will still be a matter for the Commission to decide whether preference is warranted in particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-legislative initiatives</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments that I have outlined will provide the necessary legislative framework to enable restructuring to take place. To reinforce the effectiveness of the changes, increased financial assistance will be available, as announced in this week's Budget, to help federally registered unions to meet the considerable costs involved in amalgamating. Amalgamation negotiations are at a critical stage in a number of industries. Successful amalgamations depend on rank and file support. The Government's budgetary allocation for 1990-91 will help unions to promote the amalgamation process among union membership. </PARA>
<PARA> A new Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be appointed to assist specifically with union amalgamations. The position will be located in Melbourne and complement the existing Sydney based Deputy President dealing with amalgamations. The establishment of this new position will ensure that appropriate resources are dedicated to the Government's priority of rationalising union structures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also, if necessary, enhance the resources of the Australian Industrial Registry to enable it to perform its functions effectively following the amendment of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes a number of other amendments of a minor policy or technical nature and includes appropriate transitional provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The new amalgamation provisions provided in the Bill are likely to have the effect of encouraging a greater number of amalgamations between organisations than has occurred in the past. An increase in the number of amalgamations will result in additional cost to the Commonwealth, as it meets the cost of amalgamation ballots conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the increased costs which may result, given the difficulty in judging the impact of the new legislation on the number of amalgamations between organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that this Bill will be seen as a pivotal development in the history of industrial relations in Australia. It seeks to be a profoundly significant agent of reform at a time when reform is rightly judged to be the pre-eminent economic challenge before us. It provides the process by which the Australian union movement can be both part of, and facilitator of, this reform. With the significance of this development in mind, I commend the Bill to honourable senators. I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ANIMAL WELFARE TABLING STATEMENT-INTENSIVE LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION REPORT</PARA>
<PARA>The report that has just been tabled on behalf of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare was prepared by the Committee in the previous Parliament under the Chairmanship of Senator Ray Devlin now retired. </PARA>
<PARA>This Intensive Livestock Production Report deals with animal welfare aspects of intensive production in this country of pigs and the domestic fowl-layers and broiler (meat) chickens. </PARA>
<PARA> The report highlights the importance of these industries which contribute significantly to the economy and to the daily diets of most Australians. They provide food, employment and generate activity in the millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into intensive livestock production was undertaken because of the developing perception in Australia that the welfare of our domestic livestock is being jeopardised in many of the housing systems operating. </PARA>
<PARA> Intensive animal husbandry has become a controversial issue in most developed countries around the world. Physical and psychological stress associated with close confinement, high stock densities, lack of access to outdoors and certain surgical husbandry practices underlies much of the concern about intensive production systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits of intensive husbandry from the human point of view is the encouragement of maximum production; efficient food conversion, due partly to the controlled environment and partly to the improved genetic make-up of animals; the maximum utilisation of equipment and buildings; and a reduction in the number of workers needed to look after the livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> Benefits for the livestock are freedom from predators, malnutrition, vagaries of the weather, and parasitic infestation. Such benefits inevitably involve some degree of restriction on activities and some modification to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Critics consider that the extreme forms of intensive husbandry which have evolved in recent years and which restrict movement, space allowance and social contacts raises quality of life questions for these food animals. </PARA>
<PARA> Submissions were first made on these matters in 1984 shortly after the Committee was established. While evidence has been taken and establishments inspected over several years, competing priorities has meant that the Committee could not concentrate on the subject fully until 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate is aware this Committee has to date tabled five inquiry reports, Export of Live Sheep from Australia; Dolphins and Whales in Captivity; Kangaroos; Animal Experimentation; and Sheep Husbandry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Intensive Livestock Report focuses on the three areas of most concern in intensive livestock production-the pig, chicken meat and egg industries. It outlines the development in Australia of intensification and economic and social pressures including farm cost input and consumer interests and concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> It presents the key issues in the welfare debate including the various welfare assessment standpoints. It is a complex field involving both ethical and practical considerations. The concept of physiological and behavioural needs of animals is generally accepted in Australia. The debate today centres around whether there are specific conditions that result in physiological or behavioural responses that are in themselves the result of undue suffering or are indications of such a state. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental issues confronting this Committee in its inquiry were whether:</PARA>
<PARA> * intensive systems deny the welfare of animals;</PARA>
<PARA> * animals should be able to undertake particular innate behaviours;</PARA>
<PARA> * an animal bred and reared in a series of generations really does suffer some sense of deprivation about the things it is denied access to;</PARA>
<PARA> * the proposed alternative systems can produce the quantity and quality of food that society seems to demand;</PARA>
<PARA> * they are capable of producing this food at a price society is willing to pay;</PARA>
<PARA> * alternative systems have a true welfare advantage for the animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee came to the conclusion at the end of investigation that intensive systems are appropriate if the health of the animals or birds are not affected and if their behaviour is not disturbed. But it also recognised that while trauma in intensive systems is clearly recognisable in some circumstances in others it is not observable or easily measured. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations contained in this Report are directed at improving the social and physical environment of intensively housed livestock and at exploring viable alternative husbandry systems.. They include recommendations on welfare and welfare assessment, housing systems evaluation research, stockmanship, education and training, legislation and regulation, standards husbandry systems, tax incentives, and off farm handling. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations relating to the domestic fowl include reductions in the stocking density for caged layers, ways to overcome the problem of overstocking, and improvements to cage design, alternative housing systems, husbandry practices (beak trimming and induced moulting) and handling and transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations on broiler (meat) chicken production are concerned with reviews of stocking densities and improved processing practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations on pig production involve research and development of alternative housing systems, stocking densities and the consequences of pen space, stocking rates and group sizes, and husbandry practices (tail docking and teeth clipping). </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations concerning breeding sows includes the encouragement of alternative approaches to accommodating these animals through their various life stages and the improvement in husbandry skills needed to avoid welfare problems associated with close confinement. The Committee has recommended a move away from individually-confined stall systems for housing the dry sow and a complete ban on tethering. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President/Deputy President animal welfare is part of the growing community concern for the environment and for the quality of life of both humans and animals. This report documents those concerns and proposes reform in specific areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether radical reform, of the kind that has been proposed in Tasmania and several European countries, can and should occur depends on complex social and biological priorities. Incomplete knowledge about the technical, economic and positive welfare potential of different methods of husbandry compounds the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President/Deputy President I was appointed to this Committee on 31 May this year the day this Inquiry Report was finalised. I congratulate those involved, past Senators Ray Devlin, John Morris (past Chairmen) and Norm Sanders, my colleagues Senator David Brownhill (Deputy Chairman), Senator Paul Calvert, and Senator Barney Cooney, long serving and active members of this Committee, and recent appointee Senator Robert Bell. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report provides a much needed review of the economic, scientific, ethical, aesthetic and practical concepts associated with this controversial subject and it underlines the need for close liaison between governments, producers, scientists, and animal welfare groups to ensure that animal production remains sustainable in the face of mounting community concerns about animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Report to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. This report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on intensive livestock production took us some time to prepare. We had a close look at three intensive industries-the pig industry, the laying hen industry and the other bird industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a lot of community concern expressed in other parts of the world-especially Europe-about the welfare of animals in intensive systems. In some of those other countries lobby groups have forced the closure of, or brought about substantial reform to, those industries. For example, the Committee did not support a ban on cages in the laying hen industry, which other people had been promoting and which other parts of the world had been moving towards, because we believe a return to the free range system in Australia to be neither economically feasible nor necessarily a sound welfare advance. The free-range laying hens which we looked at in South Australia and New South Wales were found not to be as good as people would have thought. In fact, in some areas they are clearly substandard. The birds were in muddy, exposed yards with little access to clean laying boxes. Basically, in many cases, the eggs were not as nice as those found in some of the caged systems that we looked at. </PARA>
<PARA>Animal Welfare Committee</PARA>
<PARA> If people who gave evidence that they bought free-range eggs were to see the conditions under which the free-range hens lived, they would be horrified. That is why the Committee recommended that the caged system remain. However, it is not without fault. This was reflected in the Committee's recommendations on cage size and design. In the caged laying hen industry we recommended that there be a change in cage sizes. The recommendation was that we take an initial step for the maximum stocking density for cages with three or more birds be reduced from 52 kilograms per square metre to 46 kilograms per square metre. That does not sound like a great difference. I know that some people in the industry were concerned about that. They believed that extra costs would be involved and that there would be extra problems for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we also recommended that there be tax incentives to increase the size of those cages and that people be allowed five years in which to bring about the changes in the cage sizes. The change in the cage sizes for laying hens constituted quite a big part of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> We also considered the banning of laying cages when it could be demonstrated that viable alternative systems can be developed suitable to Australian conditions and these alternative systems have positive welfare advantages. As I said, during the inquiry we did not find that there would be any great advantages by moving away from the caged system to a free-range system. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we do not expect the industry to change overnight. We also think that it should receive assistance by way of tax incentives and that these changes should be introduced over about five years. At all times the Government should be providing incentives to help people with better animal welfare practices. </PARA>
<PARA> We were concerned about the number of broilers and the way they gained in size when they first go into the shed system. At the end of the inquiry, I had a second look at broilers when they were in full size to see whether there were any problems and whether each bird had less space. I was satisfied that the industry is looking after its birds, both those in the caged laying hen system and those in the broiler industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee said that research work and constant revision of housing design in the pig industry indicated the growers' awareness and the importance of optimum housing and living conditions. The pig industry has made progress on this and it is to be commended for it. Some people in that industry are very forward looking. </PARA>
<PARA> The pig industry also is one in which there are free-ranging animals. Under Australian conditions this is not always the best way to go. There are good farmers and there are bad farmers. In our report we say that progress is being made and that the pig industry should continue with the evaluation and upgrading of housing systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In these intensive and extensive animal industries, stock husbandry is obviously of paramount importance. We made comments about its being the essential item. </PARA>
<PARA> No system-no matter how sophisticated it is-is of any benefit to animals, or to anyone, if the staff members are not skilled in handling the animals and do not understand their needs. People in the industry, especially those in the intensive industries, should be well educated in the needs of their animals and in looking after them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very difficult to work out how to legislate to ensure that a producer does not employ staff who have no understanding of the job and little love of the animals. Obviously people who engage in animal industries will employ skilled staff for the benefit of their animals. At the end of the day it is the good, well cared for animal that will produce the best and do it most economically. Anyone who has had anything to do with animals over the years knows that if animals are not looked after, the best result is not achieved. We must ensure that animals in intensive animal industries are looked after. The Committee believes that that is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the tethering of pigs should be banned. More work should be done on stalls and farrowing crates. More notice should be taken of body dimensions of the sows. In some instances, they appear to be cramped although they seem to be content. More evaluation of their movement and their need for freedom has to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has played a very big role in the welfare of animals. The new Chairman, Senator Burns, who has just moved the adoption of this report, will enjoy himself on that Committee because its members and staff work very well together. Before the Committee winds up at the end of the next year, we have other inquiries to make. I believe we have played a big part in helping the intensive animal industries and the other industries we have looked at in the past. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, before I commence my remarks, I congratulate you on your election as Deputy President. This is the first opportunity I have had to do so publicly. I look forward to working with you as a Temporary Chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I congratulate the secretariat on the work it has put into the final report on intensive livestock production. This report was not easy to put together. Public hearings began about three years ago but lapsed because of other inquiries that the Select Committee on Animal Welfare was undertaking. The new secretariat that came into being had to pick up the strands and comments that had been made quite a few years ago. Nevertheless, this report was put together in a very efficient fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I also congratulate our former Chairman, Ray Devlin, who was responsible for keeping an eye on us and helping us with our deliberations. I too would like to offer my congratulations to the new Chairman, Senator Bryant Burns, and particularly those new members who have joined our Committee, Senator Sherry and Senator Bell, who replaced Senator Morris, Senator Sanders and Senator Devlin. </PARA>
<PARA> For me, the most important recommendation made by the Committee in the intensive livestock production report was that the banning of laying cages be considered when it can be demonstrated that viable alternative systems can be developed suitable to Australian conditions. Throughout Australia, and particularly in Tasmania, cage laying birds have been a very controversial subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators may have even heard the name of a particular lady who has almost single-handedly changed the thoughts of the Tasmanian Government. I refer to Pam Clarke who was of a particular nuisance value and has been to gaol because of her beliefs. She has forfeited paintings. Over a fair amount of time she has made her feelings known to all and sundry. I would say that she is very committed in what she is doing. But from the Committee's point of view we had to look at matters other than the more controversial issues. We had to look at this issue in a balanced fashion. The recommendations that we have brought forward do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment further and reiterate what Senator Brownhill said about stock husbandry. No matter what system we have, and no matter under what conditions animals are catered for, stockmanship is the most essential item in any animal welfare issue or any intensive animal production unit. I hope that the Government will support the recommendations made concerning stockmanship education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also interested to note the responses we received from various groups in Australia. The response from the Australian Council of Egg Producers was basically favourable. I know that it is concerned about the recommendations we made as to the stocking density for cages. Nevertheless, the Committee was united in the fact that we found it unacceptable that the maximum stocking density of four birds per cage was too much. If our recommendations are carried, it will mean that one bird will be taken out of every cage. In other words, our recommendation would mean that in an intensive production unit, such as Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd operating near Canberra, where we observed 60,000 birds in one shed, 10,000 birds would be removed from that shed. That is quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I find comments such as those from Professor Singer, who was reported in the media as saying that for our Committee to go through all that evidence and say we can have an extra 100 centimetres is a joke, unacceptable to me and probably to my Commonwealth colleagues. We took only the decisions that we believed were fair in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> To contrast Professor Singer's comments, Mr Hugh Wirth, the President of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-a reputable animal welfare organisation in Australia-said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think there will be an intensive farming system in Australia that will accommodate all the concerns of the animal welfare movement. I am sure that is going to happen in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>When queried about the report, he said that he was happy with it, that he was a little disappointed with some aspects of it, that he did not think it went far enough but that in toto it was positive. I think that is very good coming from a member of such an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania, the State Labor Government made a commitment before the last election that on attaining office it would look at phasing out battery hens in five years. Since then, it has commissioned a working group to look at this matter. As yet it has not put down a decision. I hope that that working group would look at all the factors involved in intensive egg production as we, as a committee, did. If battery hens are phased out in Tasmania in effect 30 farms will be put out of business and up to 300 people will lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The net effect will be instead of the local shoppers having the choice of buying free range or intensive production eggs at their supermarkets, they will be buying eggs imported from Victoria and other States. People would still be able to buy the cheaper intensively produced eggs but Tasmania would lose what I think is a very good small industry. I have inspected some of the Tasmanian operations and found them to be top class. They are as good as, if not better than, most of the intensive egg productive units that the Committee members saw around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Brownhill has alluded to most of the important parts of the intensive pig production section of the report that I would have liked to comment on. However, I note that the document that is being considered by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services in Tasmania, Mr Wriedt, recommends the banning of tethered sows. It is interesting to note that the Committee also recommended this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that I hope that the independent inquiry into egg production in Tasmania takes a very good look at the report produced by our Committee. It was compiled over quite a long time and the recommendations were not arrived at lightly. I believe that, in all the circumstances, the recommendations that the Committee put forward are worthy of adoption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing a few remarks to the intensive livestock production report of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare, I would like to say that, although I only joined this Committee for a couple of meetings before the report was finalised, I am pleased to have been associated with its preparation. It is my belief that the Committee was particularly energetic in considering submissions and evidence from witnesses and in its formal inspection of about 15 establishments and properties involved in the intensive livestock production area. The result is a comprehensive and widely relevant report concerning our commercial treatment of animals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that our society has reached a sufficient degree of sophistication to enable us to spend time in the most important forum in this nation discussing our relationship with animals. The very existence of this 300-page report is an indication of the level of our society's development. We have at last acknowledged that we are obliged to consider the welfare of animals, and rightly so. Our relationship with animals is not something which should be taken lightly. Much of our culture, much of our civilisation and much of our successful functioning as a society is interwoven with and dependent upon our relationship with animals. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past we have worshipped animals. Animals have inspired all of our emotions. They have been the inspiration of great works of art and they have become entwined in our folklore and mythology. We love animals. We breed and nurture some animals for our pleasure and entertainment. We breed other animals for our sustenance, and we exploit animals as a resource. Animal welfare is not so much concerned with the fact that we exploit animals as it is with the methods of our exploitation of those animals. This Committee considered those methods, has received an extensive body of information about the methods and has made wide-ranging recommendations about them. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to discuss each of those numerous recommendations at this time. Most of the recommendations are specific and some are technical to the extent that they are meaningful only to those involved in the narrow area of a particular industry. One example is recommendation 8, which has already been mentioned by Senator Brownhill and Senator Calvert and which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the banning of laying cages be considered when it can be demonstrated that viable alternative systems can be developed suitable to Australian conditions and that these alternative systems have positive welfare advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> My interpretation of that recommendation is that our community is now obliged to demonstrate that alternative systems are viable and have welfare advantages. I suspect that the community will be only too keen to begin that demonstration. </PARA>
<PARA> Other recommendations from the report are general and are applicable to a variety of our dealings with animals. Recommendation 38 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also recommends that the Codes of Practice be revised to take account of advances in the understanding of the importance of stockmanship in the welfare of animals in intensive systems. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the last recommendation, recommendation 41, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Noting that standards are set for a range of commodities which are released onto the market the Committee recommends that governments with responsibility in this area develop standards for new and modified animal husbandry systems. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that such recommendations indicate the new and more enlightened attitude which our society is developing towards animals. As such, I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment briefly on the interim report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on the racing industry. This interim report has been awaited by members of the industry with much anticipation. We also had a reference to this Committee from the drugs in sport inquiry. I believe there are certain matters that our Committee will have to investigate further, and I refer to the investigations into steeplechasing and hurdling. Since our last public hearings, there have been some quite spectacular accidents in hurdle races, particularly in Victoria. Those people concerned about the welfare of animals in Australia are certainly concerned about the injuries sustained by horses involved in steeplechasing and hurdling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as drug use and detection are concerned, the Committee has been the guest of various racing clubs and has had the opportunity to observe drug use and detection in action. I believe the racing industry is doing all it can to detect the use of drugs in racing, but in an industry such as this, a $20 billion industry-probably the second biggest industry in Australia-which is mainly profit driven, the use of drugs is going to continue. I believe that is something that the people of Australia and those who are concerned about the welfare of animals will have to accept. No matter how good the detection equipment used, there will always be someone with overseas connections who comes up with something a little better than what is being used at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> The drug detection techniques have to keep pace with the drugs that are being produced. The use of both injury-masking drugs and performance-enhancing drugs is something that will be with this industry for a long time and it is something that the racing clubs will have to address. </PARA>
<PARA> During the hearings I was very concerned to find that this $20 billion industry, which is profit-driven, spends only $500,000 on research. I believe that it is an absolute disgrace that an industry of that size is putting so little back into the welfare of the animals. It was put to me by one of the people giving evidence that, as happens in the United States of America and England, a surcharge of 20c on each horse that participated in a race would raise quite a few million dollars for research. The Australian Equine Research Foundation gave evidence to the Committee which led us to believe that veterinary courses at some of Australia's leading universities might be curtailed because of the lack of finance. I believe that that is a pretty poor state of affairs. The veterinary surgeons involved in horseracing are a unique breed of people. They need special expertise, and unless more money is put into tertiary institutions to allow young people to study these methods of treating horses, the long term future of the industry will be the worse for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern that was raised is one that is felt particularly by former Senator Devlin. As we all know, former Senator Devlin is known to have a bet or two on a horse, and he certainly has a pecuniary interest in this particular report. He was very concerned about the practice of racing young horses. Evidence was given to us that owners, in the pursuit of wealth, tend to race two-year-old horses before the horses are physically mature. Of course, we then end up with horses that are burnt out and which suffer unacceptable injuries at a very young age. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major concern, which I think the Committee would have to agree with, related to track design. I believe that the racetrack ergonomics and track surfaces are a major cause of the injuries sustained by horses, whether they are in trotting, racing or hurdling. </PARA>
<PARA> There again I believe the Committee would need to take more evidence on track design, and I believe that since the dissenting report has been put together that more evidence has come forward from particular people who have expertise and interest in that area. In conclusion, I would say that whilst this report does highlight the major issues in the racing industry, more work needs to be done on this. Those particular matters I have referred to certainly are in need of more investigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support all the comments that have already been made by my colleague Senator Calvert. I just reiterate that what we looked at was the training and racing of unfit animals, the racing of two-year olds, drug use detection, and training in racing track design and surfaces. First of all I believe that the industry is well run and is a very big industry. I believe that we should have a further look at the animal welfare aspects and I support Senator Calvert in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to thank all the people who have helped us with this report and who showed us around the areas that we have looked at in relation to the racing industry, whether it be the greyhounds, the harness racing, or the thoroughbred racing industries. The areas in which I believe there can still be a lot more work for the benefit of animals is in improving design and maintenance of tracks to reduce the incidents of injuries. I think that is an area that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, alluded to a moment ago could have a lot more work done on it. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, we discussed training tracks with some of the leading trainers; the provision of proper training facilities and proper training tracks for such a big industry, and not only for the industry itself but also for the benefit of the animals which train on them every day when the trainers are trying get them fit for racing. I am not firm in my convictions in some of the areas like racing with two-year olds, jump racing, hurdling and steeplechasing. I think there are definitely some areas there to be considered, such as strapping the hind legs of horses as far as steeplechasing is concerned. I saw some injuries from that when I was in Melbourne and I believe that something could happen there, even moving to a softer top on the steeplechasing hurdles, or whatever the instrument that the animals jump over is called. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of whips was discussed quite extensively and I believe that we definitely should be having a further look at some parts of the industry, especially in helping the welfare of animals by having more work and effort put into track design and research in those areas. The other area was in drug detection, and the industry has to keep abreast of that area all the time because if one drug is detected there are shysters who, although they are not in the proper part of the industry themselves, will always find some other drug to make animals go slower or faster. That is an area that could be helped particularly with improved detection in pain suppressants and non-therapeutic substances. I commend this report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On 31 July I presented the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia to the President of the Senate pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 1 June 1990. Before addressing the recommendations and the conclusions contained in the report, I would like to comment briefly on the background to the inquiry and the conduct of the inquiry itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the detection of chemical residues in beef exported to the United States of America in 1987 prompted the Government and the Senate to initiate reviews of the regulation and use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. In 1988, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) requested that the Australian Science and Technology Council undertake a study of chemical residues in agricultural products. That study concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>The development and implementation of standards for chemical residues in agricultural products are satisfactory and chemical residues are not an undue health hazard to consumers of Australian agricultural produce. </PARA>
<PARA>In November 1988, the Senate, when passing the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, resolved to establish a select committee to inquire into and report upon the following matters: The adequacy of arrangements for administration and coordination systems under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988; the efficacy of pest management systems; and the economic, social and environmental impact of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Committee was established it was suggested by some that the inquiry would provide a forum for emotional radicals wishing to attack the chemical industry. It was also suggested that the inquiry had the potential to cause great harm to Australia's hard-earned reputation as a world leader in the production of clean agricultural products. As Chairman of the Select Committee I am pleased to report that these forecasts did not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received 256 submissions and held 18 days of public hearings. Contributors to the inquiry included several Commonwealth Government departments and agencies, State and Territory governments, chemical companies, rural organisations, consumer and environmental groups and interested individuals. On the whole, evidence presented to the Committee attempted to reconcile rather than perpetuate differing points of view. A common theme running through the evidence was that more needs to be done-more openness, more information and more research. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, comprising members from the four major parties represented in this chamber, has presented a unanimous report. I consider that the Committee's report represents a significant and wide-ranging response to issues relating to the regulation and use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. The report contains 45 recommendations and 18 major conclusions. When taken together, these recommendations and conclusions provide a sound basis for the effective and efficient regulation and use of farm chemicals in Australia. I also consider that the implementation of the Committee's recommendations will allay many public concerns about aspects of the regulatory system, the use of specific chemicals and certain practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report recognises that agricultural and veterinary chemicals contribute significantly to the production of quality food and fibre and to the prevention and alleviation of disease and suffering in animals. Nevertheless, the use of these chemicals should be neither pre-eminent nor exclusive but rather should be an important tool in an integrated approach to pest management. The Committee's report stresses that farm chemicals should be applied judiciously and responsibly and that research and farming practices should aim to reduce the use of pesticides wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Committee's report contains 45 recommendations. These fall broadly into the following seven categories: the legislative and administrative framework for regulation; information; monitoring of residues; research; alternative pest management strategies; specific public concerns; and education and training. I do not intend to review all of the recommendations contained in the Committee's report as I am mindful that other members of the Committee may wish to address specific findings of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address five general issues raised in the report. Firstly, the Committee concluded that the new arrangements for the clearance of farm chemical products established under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 are welcome. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that the regulatory processes can be improved. In particular, the report concludes that the regulatory system must be more open, accessible and accountable and must be seen to be so. To achieve these objectives the Committee makes recommendations for consumer representation on the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council and formal consultative arrangements between the Council, industries, interested groups and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee's report recognises that more information on the regulatory process, toxicological assessments and the safety, health and environmental aspects of agricultural and veterinary chemicals should be made publicly available. The Committee makes positive recommendations on how this should be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Committee notes that organic farming methods, although practised by only a small percentage of producers, have a legitimate role to play in Australian agriculture. Growing interest in these techniques should be reflected in government research, extension and export assistance programs. In particular, the Committee recommends that a uniform system of standards and guidelines for the production and marketing of organic produce should be developed. The Committee also recognises the need for further research into biological control strategies, integrated pest management techniques and minimum tillage. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, during the inquiry the Committee became aware of public unease and, in some cases, anger about particular social and environmental issues, specific chemicals or certain practices. Four matters were consistently drawn to the attention of the Committee. These were aerial spraying, the use of organochlorine pesticides, pest control and the possible long term effects of pesticides on public health. The Committee considered the evidence on these matters and has made constructive and appropriate recommendations that will allay many concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the Committee was told that, although the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia is as stringent as in other developed countries, these chemicals must be used safely, responsibly and in accordance with local directions. Therefore, education, training and safety courses are essential to improve occupational health and to ensure safety and the responsible and judicious use of chemicals. In particular, the Committee formed the view that education and training programs must recognise the significant role that rural women, as partners in agricultural enterprises, can play in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as Chairman of the Select Committee, I wish to commend the other members of the Committee for the positive and constructive approach adopted during the course of a topical and sometimes complex inquiry. In particular, I would like to thank my Deputy Chairman, Senator Brownhill, for his assistance during the course of the inquiry. On behalf of the Committee, I express our thanks to the Committee's staff for their invaluable assistance. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take great pleasure in supporting the remarks of the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, Senator Colston. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate him on his election to the position of Deputy President, which I did not do in the speech I gave earlier today. I wish him well in that position and I thank him for his chairmanship of this Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Committee was conceived in some anger, born in some resignation, but delivered with some pride and achievement. As Senator Colston has already said, it is a committee whose members worked very well together. I feel very proud to have been a part of a committee that worked as well as it did. The task ahead of the Committee when it was set up was daunting. It could have so easily developed into a witch-hunt and a vendetta. Instead, the Committee took a sensible and appropriate inquiring approach to the many facets of the questions of chemicals. While members of the Committee had a wide and varied knowledge and experience to bring to the inquiry, it nevertheless required a great learning process to be undertaken by us all. </PARA>
<PARA> We received hundreds of submissions and numerous inspections and public hearings were held throughout Australia. We had a fairly tight agenda and material to plough through. The fact that we ploughed through it so quickly was due in no small measure to the Chairman and the way that he pulled us all together. I believe that the resulting report is a document of some substance. While it has not created scandalous headlines, it has been well received by those who are affected by it. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity only last week to talk about the report with shire councils, veterinarians and stock agents throughout southern New South Wales. Their response was positive and complimentary. I believe the emphasis placed on education by the Committee in the report is important. That was one area I stressed the whole way through. There are a number of farm safety groups now established throughout New South Wales. They have a very active role to play in educating farmers and their families. At every field day and show one group or another has a display. They have made the rural community think about what they are doing with chemicals-chemicals they may have used for years without a second thought as to their own safety. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received a number of submissions concerning aerial spraying. Frankly, we heard some surprising stories of careless and absolutely negligent behaviour. I have also had personal experience of aerial spraying that has not always gone to plan. If one does not have a little smoke going in the corner of a paddock, for example, to know which way the wind is going or whether there is an inversion layer there when one starts spraying, one is in rather a mess. That is not something that is terribly hard to do, to make sure one does not affect one's neighbours. The good neighbour policy should prevail when people use chemicals. The report's recommendations on this issue are direct. We are saying that either those in the industry should get themselves organised and regulated or it will be done for them. There are regulations there now which they should be adhering to. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was speaking to the farmers last week I told them, and made the point to them very clearly, that they had to take a more responsible role in aerial spraying. There is always the temptation for people who have an aeroplane in the air and the paddock to be done to just tell the pilot to get into it and get going. That might have been good enough years ago, but it is not good enough now. It was not even good enough years ago. We have to be become more thoughtful. We have to have a better good neighbour policy amongst all those people who use chemicals. That also includes people who use chemicals in the cities and the towns, the housewives and the people in their backyard gardens.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if chemicals are not used-and we made this point in the report-there would be a loss to Australian crop growers of in the vicinity of $3 billion. We have to remember that they produce good quality food and fibre and they alleviate disease and suffering. Since we have been talking about animal welfare issues earlier today, there are a lot of chemicals that help animals have a better life on this earth. But those chemicals must be used judiciously and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Chairman mentioned when he presented the report a moment ago, this inquiry was born basically out of the beef residue problems. Let us hope that that does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has a substantial section on the issue of organic farming, which the Chairman has already alluded to. Organic, chemical-free and biodynamic farming are all becoming popular. There is an increasing consumer demand for products produced this way. The report suggests, however, that organically produced food or food purported to be produced without chemicals ought to be subject to the same testing as other produce, and we have recommended that organic produce also be included in the national residue survey. </PARA>
<PARA> We also suggest that international foods be subjected to closer scrutiny. It has long galled me that Australian products are subjected to much more rigorous testing than imported products. A classic example was that of Australian meat during the pesticide scare. It was tested much more stringently, of course, than United States domestic meat. If we do not watch out, we will find that in the future non-tariff trade barriers such as that will be set up in Australia. It is about time Australia started to impose on overseas products the stringent measures that other countries impose on us. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator Panizza and others want to speak, so I will not go on for much longer, but I want to make the point that the standard of national registration and its impact on our export industries is paramount. In our report we mention the desire of State governments to move towards more national registration because of that. In our conclusion, we moved towards it but pointed out that it needs more research and should be done in complete collaboration with the States. That needs to be moved very quickly; otherwise, as I said, we could have another problem with our export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultative committees are to be established and chemical products need labelling improvements. I would mention the role that housewives have to play in relation to chemicals that are used on farms. Integrated pest management has already been mentioned, as well as the national standards for pest control officers and the regular testing of people who are tied up with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> One area that concerned me about the pest extermination industry was household spraying. We received in evidence numerous examples of what was basically over-servicing and the use of chemicals that could produce excessive amounts of residues in houses. People should self-regulate in that area. I do not believe in regulation all the time; I think that we should be self-regulating. If we have a good neighbour policy, there is nothing wrong with chemicals being used now and in the future, as long as they are used judiciously. If they are used in a safe and proper manner according to the directions, they will be here for a long time to help the welfare of animals and humans and to make sure that we produce good clean produce that is acceptable on all the world markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is particularly pleasing to rise to comment on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia because two things became apparent during the genesis of the report and during the considerations of the Committee.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At that stage Senator Powell had the carriage of agricultural matters on behalf of the Australian Democrats. When Senator Powell initially raised the proposal for this Senate select committee inquiry it was supported by the Australian Labor Party but resisted, as Senator Panizza has interpolated, because the Opposition sought much narrower terms of the inquiry. A number of farms in Australia had been quarantined as a result of the use of organochlorine pesticides, and excessive residues had appeared in the meat from some of those farms. As I understand it, the Opposition's alternative motion was a much narrower one-framed merely to see how one would adequately compensate the farmers who had been so affected. The Labor Party then withdrew from its initial support, and it took Senator Powell some 12 months before the Labor Party agreed eventually to this inquiry, with its wider terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Brownhill has already indicated, it is particularly pleasing that, despite that somewhat shaky beginning, the members of the Committee worked extremely well together; in the end a consensus report was accepted by all members of the Committee. The fears which had been expressed by some members of the Opposition-and, indeed, outside the Parliament by the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry, for instance, and some farmer groups-that this Committee inquiry was merely a witch-hunt were not realised. </PARA>
<PARA> There were three strands which came together and led to the necessity of a committee such as this one. Since the Second World War we have seen the increasing chemicalisation of agricultural production. In view of a number of hazards to human health and the environment which had become recognised over those years, it was appropriate that there be a wide-ranging inquiry. In late 1988 we saw the Federal Government assume under its legislation the Federal registration and regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. That was supported by all parties in the Senate and was generally recognised as a good thing. As I have already indicated, we then saw significant damage done to Australian exports by restriction on the ability to export beef from Australia and the quarantining of certain farms. Those things came together and indicated that then was the time for a wide-ranging inquiry into all aspects of agricultural and veterinary chemical use. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee worked extremely well, as I have already indicated, under its Chairman, Senator Colston, and has come forward with an extremely useful report which has indicated a number of areas in which improvements need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the evidence which came before the Committee indicates the importance of the Committee. When the Western Australian Department of Agriculture came before the Committee and was questioned about the early evidence of the damaging effects of organochlorine pesticides-this is evidence which went back to the early 1960s-it indicated that it was aware that there were damaging consequences flowing from this and that as early as the late 1960s and early 1970s it believed that it was necessary to phase out the use of these materials. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department then went on to indicate that had the beef export problem not emerged when it did, but had its officers had another year, the persistent organochlorine pesticides would have been phased out and the problem would not have arisen. That indicated to the members of the Committee the laxity which has pervaded the control of the use of these agents in Australia over many years and the slowness with which bodies that have been charged with the protection of public health and environmental health have acted to execute their responsibilities. The evidence that has been taken by this Committee and the report which we have before us today may well go a considerable way towards changing that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill has already drawn attention to some of the evidence that was put before the Committee in relation to aerial spraying, particularly in Tasmania. We heard evidence of very nasty practices in relation to overspraying of schools-and spraying under conditions in which material should not have been sprayed. The report specifically recommends that that whole area be tightened up and that if that cannot be done, perhaps consideration should be given to banning aerial spraying altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also draws attention to the inadequacy in the past of the processes gone through by the various committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the inadequacy of the funding, and the speed and professionalism with which those bodies can carry out their tasks. The Committee recommends that more resources be devoted to this very important task. It also recommends that more attention be given to alternative non-chemical and less chemical intensive methods of agriculture and that extension services and educational services which give alternative advice to farmers be expanded. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that came quite clearly out of this whole inquiry is that Australia has not become as chemically dependent as many other countries. If we choose to go down the road of using as little chemical as possible, and using no chemical in situations where that is indeed possible, we place ourselves in a very favourable situation with respect to acceptance of our production on world markets. It is in the economic sense that we should avidly pursue the sorts of recommendations that are made in this report so that Australia not only protects the health of its people and its environment but also continues to produce clean and safe food which is as little chemically tainted as possible and which is as acceptable as possible on world markets and, therefore, does not face the problems which we faced during the closure of our beef export markets. That is the economic future which is suggested if this report's recommendations are carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise to speak to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia and add my remarks to those of my colleagues on this Committee. Perhaps Senator Brownhill put it more succinctly than I might be inclined to when he said that the Committee was born out of anger. I forget the rest of what he said, but it was not only succinct, it was also civil. The truth was elaborated a little more by Senator Panizza by way of interjection when Senator Coulter was speaking. The facts are that it was born out of a lot of annoyance and anger at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One sadness about the references now coming to committees is that they tend to emerge out of brawls in the Senate and not out of considered deliberation on what might be an issue of some major significance. There seems to be the use of numbers to crunch references through rather than a consensus on the importance of the issue. I am advised by colleagues older and wiser than I-or at least who have been around here longer-that this used not to be the practice in times past. Of course, what used to be the practice in times past is usually tempered by the gentleness of time. I am not going to push them on the truth and I have not repaired to the Senate Hansard of the time to make sure that that is always true. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the circumstances of this Committee's origins, it is certainly true that it proved to be very constructive. If there was any ill will about the Committee's origins, that was never reflected in its business and the way its members conducted themselves in its hearings and deliberations. Perhaps that should be said at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate very much the way we functioned as a committee. I think it would be appropriate to ascribe at least some of that to the chair, Senator Colston. In thanking him, it seems to be now voguish to add my congratulations to his succession to high office. I also thank my colleagues on the Committee. In particular, I thank the very hard working secretariat: Neil Bessell, the secretary; Dr Brian Sanderson and Mr Doug Hynd, the research officers; and Mrs Ros Franklin, the executive assistant. I know that those of us who have ever worked on committees appreciate the services provided by secretariats. But I place that on record for anyone who is listening and may not know just how demanding the work of a secretariat is. I would particularly like to thank them. </PARA>
<PARA> While I appreciated the assistance from all those people, honourable senators will shortly understand why I particularly make reference to Mrs Ros Franklin. This was not a high profile inquiry for women and that is a bit of a shame. So I was delighted to be able to wink at Mrs Ros Franklin from time to time when we both clearly understood the issues. I then proceeded to gently suggest a different view or perspective to some of my colleagues on the Committee. I would particularly like to highlight those aspects. I do so not because the others are not very vital issues-they certainly are-but I think they have been already very well canvassed by other speakers in this debate, including you, Mr Deputy President, Senator Brownhill, and Senator Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I say that is that time and again-and I have already had an experience today along these lines in another committee in a different place-issues in our society that are regarded as very important or stern are perhaps neuter in terms of sex, but in the end `and women' is tacked on to them. So, economics is not a matter for women but, ultimately, one might have to look at the effects on them. Agricultural chemicals is not a matter for women, but in the end we might have to consider some specific effects on them. I must say that I find it very surprising to find that after all these years we are still talking about women and their involvement in the community as though they are a kind of adjunct to mainstream society. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, in terms of economic recovery I read the wonderful line this morning-as I said, in another place-that the most important issue confronting a particular country is economic recovery, and that once that was in place we could then turn ourselves to the concerns of women. Where, may I ask, do we belong in terms of economic recovery? Do we not contribute to productivity? Do we not sometimes cost in terms of outlays? I cannot understand how we continue to have this thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I am very pleased that groups representative of women, such as the Country Women's Association and a number of other people-men and women-made submissions in which they were at pains to bring to the Committee's attention the consequences of the use of chemicals on men and women and the important role played by men and women in their proper use. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I am always shocked-but, again, I was shocked at the committee meeting I attended this morning-to find that deformed children are more the responsibility and concern of women in our society. I still find that quite shocking. Why should it be so? We know that that would be a matter of the gravest concern and pain for the mother of a deformed child. I should imagine it is probably that way for the men and boys in such a family. But to keep on talking in this society as though deformed children, perhaps as a consequence of the use of chemicals, are really a woman's issue is really to miss the point. To the extent that there might be any thinking like that residing in Australia, it is time it ceased. This report goes a long way to saying that that kind of thinking can no longer continue. I suppose-and I say this with somewhat of a wry smile, Mr Deputy President-that I could have perhaps pursued that with a little more rigour in the Committee, but it would be mere meanness even to make issue of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Environmental issues are critical issues for men and women in society. The use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals is a critical issue for men and women in our society, and this whole report has to be seen in that way. I emphasise that the various references to women throughout the Committee's report are not sops to that adjunct in our society called women. </PARA>
<PARA> They are, I think, perhaps in a good way, represented by the very first recommendation of the Committee, which is that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 be amended to include in the membership of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council one member nominated by the Commonwealth Minister for Consumer Affairs to represent consumer interests. That is something we felt was very critical. That point was brought to the attention of the Committee in submissions and was certainly raised by members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to place on record recommendation 3, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Consultative Committee include members from groups representing</PARA>
<PARA>* farmers;</PARA>
<PARA>* manufacturers, distributors and transporters;</PARA>
<PARA>* workers;</PARA>
<PARA>* veterinarians;</PARA>
<PARA>* consumers;</PARA>
<PARA>* environmentalists;</PARA>
<PARA>* other user groups; and government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the composition of the consultative body should provide balanced representation of interest groups and individuals and should include a reasonable representation of women. </PARA>
<PARA>`Reasonable' here, I think, refers to the number, not to their capacity. Are there any other than reasonable women?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan. Of course there are not. I take his laugh to be assent. The matters referred to by previous speakers have touched on these points, but they are very important and I would like to highlight them. Some of the women from the Country Women's Association and the National Women's Consultative Council in their submissions to the inquiry made some very interesting points going, for example, to the labelling of products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first problem was whether all parcels of all sizes of any chemical are adequately labelled. According to the evidence, in some cases small parcels are very adequately labelled, while very large supplies of chemicals do not have anything like the same depth or highlighting of labelling. That labelling, of course, includes safe handling instructions. </PARA>
<PARA> The women asked, for example, whether or not labelling ought to include any instructions about disposal. One woman told us that her husband, going out to use chemical, was advised that for every packet of the chemical he should have a change of clothing so as to minimise the possibility of absorption through the skin. She asked what he was to do when he got home and, in particular, what she was to do with five sets of clothing soaked with a chemical. There were no instructions about how to wash them. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people on rural properties do not have access to a sewerage line, so the water runs either into some kind of sewerage system they have or onto the vegetable garden. The questions literally were, `Can we use the water from the washing machine to water our vegetables as we have done through time?'. The chemical instructions were silent on these matters. The question arises: Can we wash other clothes with these chemicals too? In case anyone should think this is to trivialise the issue, I think we have only to reflect on the consequences of Wittenoom. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wittenoom experience has been that many people who are now suffering from mesothelioma are the wives and children of miners, who could probably have come into contact with the asbestos fibres only through the process of domestic treatment of clothing, through laundry and so on. It is not a matter to be treated lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again the Committee was confronted with the economics of this matter. We were told that if we impose all these restrictions, with too much labelling, too many restrictions and so on, this will become too expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> In reply the Committee and I say: Look at the Wittenoom example. What is the cost to individuals in terms of pain and suffering? What is the cost to consumers? What is the cost to this world? The cost to the shareholders of CSR Ltd is positively measurable at this point. There has been a long and disgraceful lag time before the consequences of continued contact with asbestos has been seen to be part of the equation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was very concerned that the economic modelling should be looked at too. We cannot work only on the consequences that are obvious now. We have to consider the huge economic consequences of health problems and downtime due to illness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had been speaking to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, and I was first of all wanting to add my comments in support to those made in this place on this report by yourself as Chairman, Mr Deputy President, and by Senators Brownhill and Coulter to this point, and I would be surprised if Senator Panizza was not going to endorse most of those comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had also made the point that this report is very important for any number of reasons, many of which had been canvassed by earlier speakers. But one of the points I wanted to raise was the importance of this report in terms of its effect and the involvement of it for women-not because I want, in any way, to trivialise the issue or, I suppose, because it is somewhat regrettable that I should have to worry that mentioning women in referring to a report like this might be seen as a possibility for trivialisation. Indeed, I was very delighted in making my earlier comments that when I mentioned the problem of how one washes clothes that are soaked with chemicals, Senator Patterson opposite wanted to say, `Well, of course, many people in rural Australia would run washing-machine water on to their vegetable garden'-and, indeed, just that very point had been raised as a matter of concern by the some of the women putting submissions and evidence before the inquiry. In fact, those are areas where labelling, in particular, and advice to users of chemicals is still insufficient and, of course, the Committee in its report made recommendations that those matters should be taken very seriously and addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I had also canvassed the problem of the effect of such requirements on costs and mentioned that, in fact, many of the assessments of the value of a chemical take into account only the current day costs, because we do not yet have any sufficient model for costing in the complications, the ill health, the disease and death, for example, that may occur down time. But, lest I should be seen to consider costs in terms of only illness or sickness or disease-all of which I think are absolutely critical-I would like to say that, of course, as was already mentioned by Senator Coulter and others, this inquiry was born out of the problem confronting Australia with organochlorins in beef. Of course, that is another cost that has to be considered in the use of chemicals: the cost of loss of export dollars to this country and, of course, the loss in terms of land that cannot be used, if not forever, at least for a very long time until such chemicals that are very heavily present in the soil are wasted away or lost from that soil. So the costs and our economic models have to take into account long term or down-the-line consequences of the use of chemicals and, indeed, I would hope to see continuing research in this vital area taking those sorts of considerations into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I had also mentioned the problem of deformed children and how often such children are seen to be a women's issue. I do not believe that is really true of our whole society, but it is certainly the way it is represented, and it is still certainly the way in which it tends to be debated: that is, the main users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals do not seem to argue, in defence or in anxiety of the use of their chemicals, the consequences on such things as the normal birth of babies. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to turn, by way of concluding remarks, to some of our recommendations and comments about the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and its involvement in the clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals, particularly in terms of the health consequences inasmuch as they can be reasonably assessed. The report says, at page 71:</PARA>
<PARA>For example, the Federated Association of Australian Housewives, Tasmania, was so concerned about recent decisions of the NHMRC that it recommended the establishment of an independent review board to evaluate the findings NHMRC. The Association had also called for an independent judicial inquiry or review of the NHMRC. </PARA>
<PARA>This was particular evidence in response to evidence given to us that betrayed a concern about, I suppose, a lack of confidence in the research data coming from the NHMRC. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for anybody who might want to raise this not to take those remarks of mine as conclusive. I would urge them, if they are going to follow that point at all, to read all of the report, but particularly pages 71 and 72-and I do not want to read that all into the Hansard. But, in fact, the Committee concluded that the NHMRC, while it is doing a very adequate job, should certainly be encouraged, and we make recommendations for it to continue its research and that that research should be properly resourced. </PARA>
<PARA> But in fact the point I wanted to make, particularly in terms of the problem of ill health or deformities and so on that we have had much discussion of in the press over time, is what I would call the problem of the reverse onus of proof. In some ways, what is required of citizens is that they must prove that `the chemical'-whatever the chemical might be-is causal of those deformities. I think that at some stage we have to address the question of why we do not require the chemical company to prove that it is safe, that it ought not be a charge against the consumer or the parents or people in the society to prove it is causal. What we have to have is a return to what is, I think, the proper onus of proof-that is, that the chemical companies have to be able to prove it is safe. </PARA>
<PARA> But I think the Committee-and I would certainly want to agree with this-appreciated that it is very difficult to prove total safety, and we appreciated evidence given to us on that matter. Dr Black said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible, under any circumstances, ever to demonstrate safety. One has to consider these matters in terms of hazard, relative hazard and the acceptability of risk. All chemicals, not just agricultural and veterinary chemicals, are potentially hazardous; and if they are to be used, one has to assess the toxicity of the substance and the way in which it is to be used, to arrive at an estimation of whether or not it is acceptable . . . it is not possible to prove . . . absolute safety under all conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from page 71 of our report. It is a lift from Dr Black's evidence. It is certainly not all that the Committee heard on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would simply say that, if we are being asked-and I think it is reasonable that we should be asked and I think it is reasonable that we should accept that one cannot conclusively prove absolute safety-then at least we should be saying that it should not be a charge against citizens to absolutely prove cause. We should at least be able to settle for a reasonable likelihood of cause. But again, I would prefer to see the charge being put back against the chemical companies, rather than an onus on the consumers or citizens in this regard-not that this was something that was canvassed at great length during our hearings, but it certainly was an issue of concern. I think those consumer concerns were very much, as previous speakers have said, present in the minds of the Committee all the time during its hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of considerable historical relevance, I suppose, that this inquiry did happen, notwithstanding the process of its birth that we have already alluded to, but there is an ever-increasing concern in the community about the safety of agricultural and veterinary chemicals-and about a lot of others besides. In fact, the Committee was concerned to take evidence about the allergenic properties of some of these chemicals and a variety of health issues concerned with their use. The important thing, I suppose, is to appreciate that we do have an individual response amongst humans to the use of chemicals, but this does not mean that claims by people that they are allergic to, or actually suffer ill health from being around such sprays should be dismissed as, one, a false claim or, two, not really very important because they are a very small percentage. </PARA>
<PARA> On those issues and the questions and concerns surrounding them we have made recommendations to be taken up by the NHMRC, and we would hope to see the consequences of our recommendations and, indeed, perhaps a response from the NHMRC over time. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues that were broadly canvassed were the environmental issues. The relevance of this inquiry in a piece of history when environmental issues have suddenly and, I think, with great appreciation become a serious matter for consideration meant that we were very concerned to address those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I could add to the remarks by Senator Brownhill about the concern the Committee had about the safe use of chemicals. We heard evidence from people who reported that drums which had contained chemicals-mostly empty, but certainly not necessarily washed out-were left on dumps, or put down one end of a property or perhaps even dropped in creeks. We appreciated that this was not necessarily the general practice in rural Australia, but it was a matter of considerable concern and the Committee wanted to give some serious thought to the matter of disposal of not only the chemicals but also the containers of those chemicals. Indeed, I think my colleague Senator Panizza not only offered to the Committee his own wisdom but also led-if I can use that word in the best sense-some of the witnesses to this very issue by his questions to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill has also alluded to the concern we had about the use of chemicals to eliminate pests in houses around urban Australia. That is a matter of great concern. Very many private operators-we concluded from the evidence we were given-are not necessarily adequately trained or educated as to the proper use of the sprays they are using, not only in terms of safe use for the occupiers or those soon to be the occupiers of those households, but also for their own health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all of those people would insist on covering themselves with protective clothing. Many of them seemed to be at pains to say, `It is perfectly safe; I have never been sick'. The Committee was concerned that such bravado should not persist, and that there is considerable evidence that the chemicals may be very dangerous not only to the householders, as I say, but also to the users. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recommended that there be training and education programs for the providers and for the companies providing those chemicals to spray in households. But I want to say, perhaps even more sternly than Senator Brownhill, that the Committee was of the view that, if self-regulation was not instituted and was not able to be seen to be effective, clearly further regulation in the industry would have to happen-not necessarily because we believe in regulations or because it is a good thing, but because, much more seriously, one would want to consider the questions I was raising earlier about the long term implications of the use of these chemicals for health and illness and their cost. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, while many of us might have had a doubt about why this inquiry should have happened, like many inquiries in this place it does give substance to the value of an inquiry, being as comprehensive and, I think, useful as it is. I certainly think it is a very useful document for anybody with any kind of concern and, certainly, any interest in this area. I suppose it will join those volumes on the shelves of either government printing offices or the offices of members of parliament-and, no doubt, other relevant places-as an excellent reference, an up to date review, of the process of regulation, testing and assessment of the chemicals in agricultural and veterinary areas, along with the recommendations that we have proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be very interested to see the Government's response to these recommendations. It has been a useful inquiry. I think it is very useful extra resource material in this area, and I certainly believe that those in the community who have a concern about things environmental, and about the use of chemicals, will find it an excellent extra resource. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, I would like to add my remarks to those made about this report and briefly touch on things dealt with during the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I get on to that, I would like to delve into the past and examine the reasons that we started this inquiry. I would add that the members of this Committee certainly worked well together over the period and in the different places we visited. At no time was there any attempt at political point scoring, except for this evening when my friend Senator Coulter tried to shift all the credit for this inquiry on to Senator Powell. He advised us that it was totally due to the Australian Democrats' efforts, and their efforts alone, that this inquiry got up. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the record straight, I will now read a motion from this side of politics that was moved on 15 December 1987 by Senator Lewis. The motion stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Agricultural Chemicals, be appointed to inquire into and report upon regulation by governments of the sale and use of agricultural chemicals in the beef industry, the use of such chemicals by governmental instrumentalities and questions of compensation and assistance for growers. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. That provision for the composition and powers of the committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>On that same day a motion was moved by Senator Powell along the lines of this inquiry. Those two motions sat around for six months until 19 April 1988. I can tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the only reason why that one got going on 19 April 1988 was that the Government needed numbers on some other Bill and, because the Australian Democrats were able to supply those numbers, they got this inquiry up on their terms. So much for that. On that basis, I think I have put the record straight. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now go back to the reasons for this inquiry. I think it was spelled out in the terms of reference. It was because of the pesticides in beef which caused consternation and loss of sales to the United States of America. It mainly affected the beef growers in the south-west of Western Australia. I know that Senator Knowles was down there and did a lot of work with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest problems seemed to come from the fact that much of the pesticide found in beef was a residue of dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) that was used in the horticultural industry a number of years ago. In fact, in some places DDT had not been used for horticulture for nearly 25 years, yet it was there. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been my belief that DDT had that big build-up because of its cheap price at the time. There was a certain lack of proper controls when it was applied. It was cheap and it was just fed into the irrigation lines instead of being applied through ordinary spraying, and that is how it got a big build-up. There was a great loss to farmers in that area and, I believe, in Victoria as well to a certain extent, so we decided to ask for an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the compensation clause in our motion did not get up-it was not accepted by the Government-but that does not mean the problem is not still there. In fact, today there is a problem with a farming couple in the south-west of Western Australia-I think around Donnybrook. Public instrumentalities used this chemical-whether it was Telecom or the State Energy Commission, I am not aware-and when it was used by them it infiltrated the ground. Although that couple did not lose their herd altogether, it was impounded for quarantine and it cost them I do not know how many dollars to put right. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that there was an inquiry in Western Australia because that couple tried to get reasonable damages from the instrumentality that was responsible. There was an inquiry by the State Government, and after that the State Government Insurance Office declined to pay out, but this couple could never get hold of the report, and it is still doubtful whether they should not have been paid. In other words, I believe they had a case. Unfortunately, there will be no freedom of information in Western Australia until the legislation is passed there. It is about to come before the Parliament but, Premier Lawrence tells us, it will not be retrospective. The problem regarding full compensation still exists in some parts of Australia. The Government could look at the idea. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many things have already been said about this report, but in the short time available to me, I will go briefly through a few points. Chemicals are an important part of the Australian economy, not only because they are used on the crops-I will come to that matter in a moment-but also by virtue of their manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, $457m worth of agricultural chemicals were sold and $189m worth of veterinary chemicals were sold. In 1988, when we started this inquiry, sales of agricultural chemicals had risen to $547m and sales of veterinary chemicals had risen to $249m. I can quite easily explain why the sales of agricultural chemicals rose. It occurred because of the very wet season earlier that year, which meant that more pre-emergent sprays were applied, so more chemicals were sold. I have no idea why the sale of veterinary chemicals rose by approximately $61m in 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures show that chemicals are an important manufacturing commodity in Australia. By the same token, their biggest value lies in the extra production they help farmers achieve. If farm chemicals were not used, 30 per cent of the world's agricultural production would be lost in addition to the 20 per cent to 40 per cent that is lost already because chemicals are not used. Chemicals certainly form an integral part of any farming system, especially in grain growing, where they are most important of all. They are especially important in land conservation, which is a major issue these days. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a trend towards minimum cultivation in the grain growing areas. It is virtually impossible to have a clean crop with minimum cultivation and without chemicals. Should one try to eliminate the chemicals, whether for pre-emergent or post-emergent, one has to turn back to intensive cultivation, which means more stirring of the soil. This requires more use of fuel which, with current world events, may turn out to be a scarcer commodity than we think. The Committee accepted that in recommendation 28. We spoke on page 117 of the value of chemicals, both to the manufacturing sector and to production.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations 2 and 3 are also very important. These were part of our terms of reference. Recommendation 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>which we have not long ago put into force-</PARA>
<PARA>be amended to establish an Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Consultative Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>This Committee would include representatives from different groups so as to get a wide cross-section of people involved. Recommendation 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Consultative Committee include members from groups representing</PARA>
<PARA>* farmers;</PARA>
<PARA>* manufacturers, distributors and transporters;</PARA>
<PARA>* workers;</PARA>
<PARA>* veterinarians;</PARA>
<PARA>* consumers;</PARA>
<PARA>* environmentalists;</PARA>
<PARA>* other user groups; and-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know who the other groups would be-</PARA>
<PARA>* government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>That shows that this Committee accepted many submissions from many people to cover as wide a range as we could. We got people involved so that they could have a say as to how chemicals would be used in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly refer to recommendations 29 and 31. These relate to efficacy of non-chemical management systems. There is an encouragement to people to get away from chemicals. The very high price of chemicals does encourage people to cut down on their use. That in itself tends to keep down the quantity of chemicals used, or to stop their overuse. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, I think there was a DDT build-up because it was too cheap. Recommendations 29 and 31 aim for a reduction of chemical use and to turn to organic farming. My best wishes and good luck go to those who want to use organic farming. The Australian Democrats seem to prefer organic farming. Unfortunately, with the way our soils are and because of our rainfall, it will be a mighty long time before organic farming can be profitable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Various groups that spoke to us recommended giving certain incentives to undertake measures. I certainly believe in incentives by encouragement, research and the use of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) findings. But I certainly do not go along with taxing some producers in order to give the others a handout to help them on their way and have them compete with conventional producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley mentioned the disposal of containers. The problem of empty chemical containers has been around as long as I have had anything to do with local government. A certain amount of money was always available in Western Australia to develop a vehicle with a machine on it to crush empty containers, get them into smaller sections and then properly dispose of them. But that has never been done. </PARA>
<PARA> That problem will pass fairly soon because there is a push into concentrated crystal-type chemicals in small containers. Madam Acting Deputy President, you yourself may know that because of your agricultural background. One particular chemical used as a post-emergent on crops comes in a container about 15 centimetres high. Each container has enough chemical to cover about 50 hectares of crop, thus eliminating the necessity to use at least four 20-litre drums. If there is any crystal left, it can be destroyed by being burnt in a proper made-up area measuring one metre by one metre. Even on big farms the containers can be burnt for the next 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the chemical companies, encouraged by the CSIRO and the different departments of agriculture, are heading that way. I can assure Senator Crowley that fortunately we are well on the way to solving the problem that she mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I consider that in years to come we will find that this has been a worthwhile report. We do have a long way to go. We have received all the submissions and have put all these recommendations in place. I certainly hope that the Government will consider them and act on them. It will have to be an ongoing inquiry-not by this Committee; this Committee will wind up-to make sure that things stay on track. We have had problems in the past. There were problems because of the overuse of chemicals, problems with meat not being tested before it left Australia and problems in aerial application. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the submission from the cotton growing industry with which I had had nothing to do before joining this committee. They are using helicopters, aeroplanes and drop-jet boom sprays in their activities across the country. I believe that with this report and the other legislation we brought in in 1988 it will make it easier to register chemicals in a centralised way. We also now have more knowledge of the side effects of agricultural chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to my earlier comments that this inquiry was commenced because of the discovery of pesticides in beef exported to the United States. At that time I said, and I still say, that this issue was a scaremongering tactic by certain unknown people to damage our trade with the United States. I spent 16 days in the United States. Recently I looked at the beef industry in the mid-West where the biggest feed lots in the world are located. I spoke with the packagers during that visit. The people I spoke with did not remember, until I mentioned it, the issue of pesticides in the beef imported from Australia. However, they did remember the kangaroo meat that was exported with beef. That episode does not seem to have been forgotten. The packagers asked me when we were going to stop exporting kangaroo meat in that way. I told them that I always believed that that was done as a sabotage move. If the farmers and the packagers in the mid-West knew about the pesticides in Australian beef, they certainly have forgotten it now. All they remembered was the kangaroo meat scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude my remarks by congratulating the chairman of the Committee, Senator Colston, and thank him for the impartial way in which he conducted this inquiry. He is a chairman who always gave other Committee members adequate time to question the witnesses rather than to take control of the questioning himself. I was very impressed with his chairmanship. In his absence, I congratulate him on his election to the position of Deputy President of the Senate. I express my thanks for the cooperation that I received from other members of the Committee. I look forward in the future to working on some other committee which will look at the improvement in the use of chemicals in Australia for the betterment of all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words about the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. I congratulate the Committee on what it has reported. I consider that it is a very balanced report that vindicates the continued constructive use of chemicals in Australian agriculture. It is certainly a rebuke to those in the Australian community and those senators who may from time to time espouse the view that agricultural and veterinary chemicals are somehow harmful per se.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is sensible for the report to recommend that consumer interests be represented together with agricultural, veterinary and environmental groups on an agricultural and veterinary chemicals council. Other recommendations of considerable significance call for expeditious evaluation of chemical and veterinary products, for review of clearance procedures, for expansion of monitoring of chemical residues and also for the monitoring of international developments in this area so as to be forewarned before problems arise with agricultural trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly endorse these particular findings as I am very conscious of the losses that were borne by farmers in my State of Western Australia who had followed all proper advice and direction in their previous use of chemicals to discover that they were bearing the cost of an unacceptable level of residue in beef exports. It is to be hoped that those recommendations designed to prevent the recurrence of this situation will be put into effect as soon as possible. We certainly do not want a repeat of a situation where DDT and dieldrin, prohibited in the United States in the early 1970s, were not banned in Australia until 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a shame tonight that Senator Coulter had to distort some of the facts coming from Western Australia, alleging misuse of chemicals. He suggested that the community had been advised that the chemicals had been withdrawn. In fact, they had not been advised until many years later. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1988, when the Senate was debating the establishment of this inquiry, I expressed concern on behalf of Western Australian agricultural producers that the terms of such an inquiry might encourage a negative witch-hunt against the use of agricultural chemicals in general. Today I am glad that this report has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to the report are the conclusions in chapter 9, that agricultural chemicals contribute significantly to the production of quality food and fibre and alleviate suffering in animals. I think it is important that one should dwell on that because it is a very critical part of a very positive report. The use of these chemicals `is an important tool in an integrated approach to pest management'. These balanced statements refute extremist and alarmist suggestions that agricultural and veterinary chemicals are a blanket threat to health and should somehow be dispensed with. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that there are senators in this chamber who have that opinion and I encourage them most sincerely to read this report because that might enlighten them about what is best not only for the agricultural producers in this country but also for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 9 also summarises valuable evidence supplied by the National Farmers Federation, concluding that the world demand for food would accelerate from 1995 to 2025 and that Australian farmers had already moved their emphasis from gross output to production efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should also note the evidence from the Bureau of Rural Resources that if farm chemicals were not used, 30 per cent of world agricultural production would be lost together with the 20 to 40 per cent already lost through weeds, pests and diseases. It should be understood that withdrawal of chemicals would badly affect the quality as well as the quantity of production. With our balance of payments and current debt crisis, quite frankly that is the last thing we can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be widespread support also for the conclusions of chapter 13 regarding the economic benefit of agricultural chemicals, and the need for quantitative assessment of their impact. As a senator for Western Australia I take special note of the fact quoted in paragraph 13.34 that the failure to use herbicides would reduce the State's wheat harvest by 32 per cent through competition with wild oats, by 24 per cent from barley grass and 8 to 20 per cent from rye grass. Uninformed critics of agricultural chemicals should be more conscious of such facts and remember also that within two years of ceasing chemical control Australia would lose the entirety of its export apple market worth $206m in 1988. That is yet another thing that I do not believe Australia can afford to lose. They should also read paragraph 13.22, that reports the statement of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations that the use of pesticides has benefited consumers through reduced livestock losses, reduced pest damage to crops, lower per unit production costs and longer shelf life. These are all positive aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now has the responsibility to act on these sensible recommendations, the implementation of which will protect the livelihood of producers, the export trade, public health and the environment. The Government also has a duty to ensure that the balanced view of the overall use of chemicals as presented by this report prevails over irresponsible and unsubstantiated attacks on the proper utilisation of chemicals in agriculture. Not least, it is pleasing to see that the Committee has rejected the bureaucratic option of licensing all users of these chemicals. That would be a really retrograde step. Correctly, the option of improved education and training is preferred. Had proper information been available to Australian farmers before the 1987 crisis, I am convinced that those problems would not have arisen. I congratulate the chairman, the deputy chairman and the Committee members on this excellent report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address a few remarks to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. As one who was not present at the time, it is interesting for me to watch several speakers now falling over themselves to take credit for the establishment of this Committee. That indicates to me that the Committee's work is acknowledged to be worthwhile and that it is work worth being associated with. Whatever the permutations, combinations and strategies employed to bring it about, as Senator Panizza reminded us a short time ago, the inquiry was established on Australian Democrats' terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome this report because, as was mentioned by several previous speakers, the Australian beef industry was under real threat in 1987 and the residues in export meat had created international problems for Australian farmers. The response by the Democrats, through Senator Powell, was to move a motion in this chamber that the Senate Select Committee which has prepared this report should be established. Whatever tactics were employed, it was established. </PARA>
<PARA> In the opinion of the Democrats, excessive use of chemicals damages our resource base, our soil and our water, not to mention the potential hazards they create for farmers and their families. An inquiry was long overdue. But it was important to the Democrats that that Committee should focus on issues which were broader than just the beef pesticides residues crisis, and that it should look specifically at the wider social, economic and environmental consequences of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Many might say that the Committee merely scratched the surface of the issues that it was charged to examine. For example, those people affected by drift from chemical spraying in north-western Tasmania are saying that the Committee should have recommended against aerial spraying. However, the Democrats are satisfied that the conduct of this inquiry was worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 be amended to include a representative of consumer interests on the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council and that an agricultural and veterinary chemicals consultative committee should be established. Moreover, it has recommended that this committee should include members from various groups, including environmentalists and a reasonable representation of women. We wholeheartedly support those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made a number of important recommendations concerning the system regulating the introduction, monitoring and use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. It noted that more and better disseminated information was needed. It recommended an improvement in the labelling of chemicals and that the feasibility of a comprehensive system of reporting industrial exposure to chemicals be established. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has noted that increasing numbers of farmers are converting to organic methods of farming, and has recommended that further research and development of organic farming methods and sustainable agricultural systems be undertaken. The Democrats particularly welcome the recommendation to assess the overseas market prospects for organic produce. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee found a serious lack of data about the impact of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The Committee was surprised that an overall quantitative assessment of the impact of farm chemicals on Australia had not been undertaken already. The Committee was not able to assess the social impact of chemicals, although it did recognise that the community holds serious and well-founded concerns about the long term effects of pesticides on human health. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the Committee's most important recommendations concern the need for further assessment surveys and research into the economic, social and environmental impacts of the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Again, as Senator Panizza has said, that indicates that the work of this Committee-not so much the Committee itself-should be continued, and the numerous sorts of research that should be undertaken might branch out into a variety of responsibilities for a variety of other committees or government instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA> If the recommendations of this Committee are acted upon, they will involve the Department of Community Services and Health, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council, the Department of the Primary Industries and Energy and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association Task Force. The Australian Democrats welcome these recommendations and will work to ensure that they are fully implemented. The findings of the Committee fully vindicate Senator Powell's concern when she first called for the inquiry two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> This report gives us yet again compelling evidence that as a society we do not monitor our products, processes and institutions very well. In fact, the report shows us that we are very prone to introducing models, processes and products without fully testing their effects. As the Democrats spokesperson on primary industry, I will be fully monitoring the impact of this report. The gaps, defects and concerns that it identifies are far too serious for us to ignore. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be very brief, but I wish to record a couple of views about the annual report of the Department of the Senate. It illustrates the continuing enhancement of the provisions in respect of the Department of the Senate, but it inexorably leads one to recognise the intrinsic and unique role of the Senate in the Parliamentary process. It raises the fundamental question, which I notice is also before us today in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, concerning the funding of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In this chamber we are confronted with those who have a very strong and passionate view that the Senate ought in some way to be subjugated by government and the House of Representatives, and through the House of Representatives the Speaker, until we are but an addendum to the functioning of the parliamentary system. A strong strain of opinion runs through a part of the Australian Labor Party that the bicameral system is not appropriate and that the Senate is an anachronism. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I just record the view, which I put before with some vigour, that the Senate has to maintain its intrinsic right to assess and establish for itself its own level of funding, its own requirements, its own obligations and its own responsibilities. If any member of this chamber who cares in any way for the functioning and responsibilities of this Parliament is not cognisant of the attempts to reduce not only the integrity but also the autonomy of this Parliament, he is doing less than his responsibility. It is not without significance to note the increasing role that the Senate has played in the process of the Parliament in the last two decades. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, with brief eloquence, let me say that this report, in its two or three pages, summarises some of the problems and disparate views that have been held by the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. It is not without significance as I read this report to be reminded that it now has a new member in the form of Senator Walsh, who replaces somebody less distinguished. I cannot remember who it is. I am sorry, I hope I am not being uncharitable or unkind to any honourable senator from the other side. Oh, yes, it is the honourable senator from Tasmania, the little man with the grey hair, Senator Coates. I have moments when I look at Senator Walsh and I am refreshed to see him there and then I have memories of his previous performances from time to time and I miss Senator Coates, so it is the curate's egg. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister can just hold his breath for a second or two longer I will do exactly that. I do not want to overplay the significance of Senator Walsh being on the Committee, but it really is germane to this whole debate about this Committee. Senator Walsh has always held the view that it is not the Parliament and it is not the Senate that are entitled to make appropriations in respect to the funding for the Senate. Senator Walsh has always had the view that the Executive Government has exclusive power and responsibility for determining the level of funding and, tied to that, the capacity and the ability of the Senate to fulfil its obligations and responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a time when the Stuart kings held pretty much the same sort of view which was that the level of capacity for democracy to function in a proper way was exclusively dictated by the king of the day. In other words, if the king cut the funding off, he cut off the Parliament, and if the Parliament is cut off, then one cuts off what was purported to be the human face of democracy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they cut off his head, that is absolutely right. I am reminded of one occasion where the Australian Democrats had the audacity to move for a select committee, and Senator Walsh said, `If you persist with that proposition I will ensure you do not have adequate funding to pursue the select committee'. He saw that as a frolic of the Democrats-not a view I shared. But on sober reflection after the events of the last couple of days I am starting to wonder whether Senator Walsh has been a bit compelling in his arguments and I have not been objective enough in accepting the point of view he has been putting forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one accepts that governments can decide exclusively the required levels of funding, then one has to accept that they can decide what the role and responsibility of the Senate ought to be, and that is what Senator Walsh says. It is a view articulated with less clarity, but I think with the same vigour, as the majority of the members of the Australian Labor Party. I shall watch with some interest over the coming period to see whether the members of the Democrats on the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing have the vigour and the competence to ensure that the funding for the Senate is not hijacked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my problem. The one political party that obtains the greatest benefit from the Senate having proper funding is the Democrats. If Senator Spindler had read the Hansard of two days ago when Senator Coates was suggesting that there should not be some continuity of some resolutions, it was Senator Colston for whom the Democrats voted and who argued against my proposition. Perhaps with a bit more experience some of those things might be looked at so that blind prejudice and bias does not influence all their judgments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the responsibilities of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee is to ensure that there are no significant or consequential changes in terms of the responsibilities of the Department of the Senate. It is mentioned in this report that there was a transfer of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. That was undertaken without proper consultation with the Appropriations and Staffing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to the President because I understand that there is some suggestion that there ought to be an amalgamation of certain services and responsibilities by at least three of the departments in terms of their administrative rearrangements. The President assures me that it is not an initiative of his or the Speaker's but rather an initiative of the departmental heads. That is a matter that I intend to pursue. I want to satisfy myself that the Presiding Officers are not unilaterally and independent of departments directing the Department of the Parliamentary Library or Hansard or any other department that they shall have an amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The present matter is that of corporate services. The President has absolutely reassured me that a commitment he gave at a recent meeting of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee was still in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one final observation, that is, that I notice Senator Coates has an absurd motion before us-that certain resolutions showing in the Standing Orders should not be of an ongoing nature. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for that because Senator Coates was seeking to obliterate the resolution of former Senator Georges, Australian Labor Party, left wing, Queensland, who moved in general terms that there be no changes to the responsibilities or duties of any of the parliamentary departments without the approval of the Senate. PISO was transferred into Hansard from the Library without consultation of even a modest nature. In my view, that flies in the face of the resolution of Senator George Georges, as he then was. If we obliterate that resolution on a continuing basis, we then allow the Executive to do as it will with the parliamentary departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All Senator Coates would need to do is to seduce the Australian Democrats and the resolution could not be carried back in the Senate again. With respect, it has to be an ongoing resolution, totally practical. Senator Coates suggests that there are a number of those resolutions that should not be ongoing. To sustain that argument we have to do away with the capacity of the Senate to have privilege, to be able to call witnesses, to subpoena documents and, in other words, to fulfil its normal obligations. I am pleased to hear from the Whip, Senator Margaret Reid, that that motion has been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this year for the first time we have established a baseline figure, on recommendation by the Committee, for a suitable appropriation for the Senate. The report concludes that it is not a satisfactory criteria, it is not a satisfactory figure, and that in due course it will require a change. The great difficulty in establishing a baseline figure for the Department of the Senate is that, because we moved from the old Parliament House to the new House, there is no normal average criteria that can be drawn as to the requirements of the Senate. The Department of Finance, and Senator Walsh in particular, have sought to claim that by now we should have a baseline figure. There is still one inherent difficulty in all this-that is, in terms of new items there is no provision in the baseline figure. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to say somewhere amongst its words that the Appropriations and Staffing Committee unanimously does not accept the figure as a necessarily appropriate figure. It points out that there is no natural process for new items. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is astounding. It is astounding on several grounds. Firstly, it is astounding the way this year's report has been sanitised compared to the report that appeared last year. Last year's report was an honest, straightforward and very detailed criticism of the Government's economic policy. There has since been a change at the top of the Reserve Bank of Australia, a change which was very controversial and a change which involved the Secretary to the Treasury being taken from Canberra and pushed into this job, pushing aside the senior people in the Reserve Bank who had every right to expect that they had a reasonable chance of becoming the chief officer of that Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite frankly appalled at the collapse of the independence of the Reserve Bank revealed in this report. No longer do we have a Reserve Bank that is prepared to criticise this Government in the terms of last year's report. Instead, under the ex-Secretary to the Treasury we have exactly the sort of acquiescence to the Government's failed economic policies that one would expect from someone who has worked so closely with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in creating those policies. Every fear that was expressed in this chamber about the consequences of this appointment to the Reserve Bank have now been realised. I will deal with that in some detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, however, I want to deal with another specific matter relating to the Reserve Bank's involvement in the collapse of the Pyramid Building Society. We had the most extraordinary Question Time incident today when Senator Button, when asked a very clear, direct, uncomplicated question, answered it in a way which was totally in conflict with the way in which exactly the same question was answered by the Treasurer. Senator Button said that neither the Government nor he as a Minister knew of any financial difficulties relating to Pyramid prior to 13 February-when, the Senate will remember, a joint press statement was issued by the Victorian Treasurer and the Attorney-General stating that deposits in the Pyramid Building Society were secure. I remind the Senate that 13 February was some five weeks before the Federal election, in which, I might also remind the Senate, the Labor Party was so on the nose in Victoria that the coalition won nine seats. </PARA>
<PARA> Having set that time scale, let us go over the question again. The Minister was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Was he or the Government aware of the financial difficulties of Pyramid prior to 13 February . . .?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button said no. He corrected that later on, after Senator Hill had asked a subsequent question pointing out that Mr Keating, in the other place, had given a very different reply altogether and had in fact indicated that he had been informed as events unfolded and that dealings did take place at officials level on this matter, clearly before the statement on 13 February. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to another question asked of the Treasurer revealed that contacts had been through the Reserve Bank and that the Reserve Bank had cleared those sections of the Victorian Government's extraordinary statement that related to elements of concern to the Reserve Bank. The Treasurer went on, as I understand it, to say that, while the Government and the Reserve Bank had been informed of developments, they did not advise or write the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that it was a political advantage to the Labor Party-though not sufficiently politically advantageous to prevent it from losing nine seats-that its monumental incompetence in managing the financial environment in Victoria-including institutions such as building societies, which are under the so-called regulations of an incompetent administration, should not become known before the Federal election on 24 March. It was in the Labor Party's best interests that any such disaster as Pyramid should not appear before that date. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the statement on 13 March saying that all was well, at a time when, it has become evident, all was not well, when the supervising authorities-the Victorian State Government-should have been capable of recognising that all was not well, and when it appears there was evidence that the Commonwealth was aware one way or another, through either its officials or its Reserve Bank, that all was not well with the Pyramid Building Society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to read the Reserve Bank report on this issue because the Reserve Bank has a way of dealing with the trading banks. It draws things to their attention. It never actually tells them what to do specifically; it `reminds' them or `advises' them; but this is Reserve Bank `slanguage' for what is, in effect, a direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that on page 38 of the Reserve Bank Report and Financial Statements, 30 June 1990 there was some discussion of the role of the Reserve Bank when non-bank financial institutions experience difficulties, as, of course, has occurred to excess, basically in States other than New South Wales, where that Government has exercised in the main a far more effective control over institutions such as building societies than the Victorian Labor Government appears capable of undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I draw attention to sections of the Reserve Bank annual report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if banks decide, on the basis of their commercial judgements, to provide short-term liquidity support to a non-bank financial institution in need and in so doing run short of liquidity themselves, the Reserve Bank would fully support those banks. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Bank-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Reserve Bank-</PARA>
<PARA>does not expect banks to provide support to others against their own commercial judgments-</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress this next part-</PARA>
<PARA>it does expect them-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the trading banks-</PARA>
<PARA>to respond sympathetically to requests for liquidity assistance from otherwise soundly based institutions; this has been longstanding policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the last paragraph, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank has reminded banks of this position in recent months when some building societies in Victoria came under pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Senate is entitled to ask-and I believe the Reserve Bank and the Government should answer-whether or not that is bank language for the Reserve Bank in fact having asked trading banks to help Pyramid out of a mess in the run-up to the Federal election. That is the inference in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that the Reserve Bank did not know how deep the problem was at Pyramid. It may be that the Victorian Government's capacity to provide any kind of effective supervision of non-bank financial intermediaries is so slight that it had no knowledge of the fact that it was a sinking ship. But there is real concern here, I believe, that the Reserve Bank may well have encouraged banks-if one interprets its particular form of language-to tide over Pyramid, whether or not Pyramid was headed for the rocks. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be all in favour of the Reserve Bank and the banking system seeking to protect the interests of the 200,000-odd depositors in Pyramid. Had they been capable of being rescued, I believe that everything should have been done to try to rescue them. However, there is a clear dividing line, I believe, between trying to rescue and making efforts to protect the interests of 220,000 depositors on the one hand and trying to paper over a crack for political purposes on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot tell what was in fact going on at the time. All that is clearly evident is that this Government or its officers knew that, at the time the statement was made on 13 February, people's deposits with the Pyramid Building Society were secure. At that time Federal authorities of one kind or another knew there were problems at Pyramid. The Government and the Reserve Bank had better tell us how much they knew of those problems because, if they have stood by and allowed a false statement to be made by Victorian Labor politicians, then they are culpable. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises some other interesting questions about the extent to which the Treasurer himself either was advised or should have been advised at an official level about the nature of this problem. I remind the Senate that the Secretary to the Treasury is in fact on the Reserve Bank board. I do not know to what extent he would report to the Treasurer any knowledge, if he had it, of this situation. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer in his answers in the other place did indicate some knowledge of Pyramid's problems prior to 13 February-I repeat, the time the statement came out saying that deposits were safe. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the statements of the Treasurer and Senator Button were in conflict because once again the Treasurer did not speak to John Button. There is nothing new about that. Perhaps in this case Senator Button could feel a bit aggrieved because, had the Treasurer told Senator Button, maybe Senator Button would not have been in the situation of losing his money in Pyramid. Looking at the statement of pecuniary interests of Ministers, I note that Senator Button was unfortunately a depositor in the Pyramid Building Society. I hope his political judgment is better than his financial judgment. He has not shown much evidence of that, but I still retain that hope. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me extraordinary that if there were problems emerging the Treasurer would not have known about them and would not have drawn them to the attention of his Government. After all, this has been a major disaster, not in terms of a huge failure of some big entrepreneur but because it affected 220,000 depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to turn to another matter that relates to the nature of the economic comment in this report. I hope that Senator Short, who has a great interest in this matter, will be following my remarks in this area. I find it quite remarkable that this annual report manages to be objective about the mess this Government has got us into in a way which looks like beating Mr Keating with a feather duster. </PARA>
<PARA> Following last year's report, which I must say was a revelation in terms of the freedom that the Reserve Bank felt it had to comment on the wrong direction, the lack of action, the failures of the Keating economic policy to do the fundamental things that are required for this nation, all we get this year is that the Reserve Bank is disappointed. Actually, it is disappointed twice. It is disappointed on page 13 because it found `the balance of payments outcome in 1989-90 was disappointing'. In other words, it was a major muck-up by the Treasurer, a huge mistake, a clear collapse of policy, an absolute failure. The Reserve Bank, under its new direction, rouses itself to a frenzy of disappointment. In the context of its preparedness to criticise the very thrust of Government policy last year, this frenzy of disappointment is a pathetic and sanitised response-sanitised by an inappropriate appointment to the leadership of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, I understand that the Button who is on the list of investors in Pyramid is Senator Button's wife rather than Senator Button. To that extent, I apologise to Senator Button. I certainly hope that our wives' activities are not matters for which senators are automatically responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of payments outcome in 1989-90 was disappointing, according to the Reserve Bank. It then sets out in the report this year to undermine the very sound point last year that the Reserve Bank had made about the balance of payments and how having a high interest rate policy was exactly the wrong thing to do to resolve the balance of payments problem. I remind the Senate of what the Reserve Bank said last year. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>In fact . . . there may be perverse effects on the balance of payments if higher interest rates produce an exchange rate appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA>It then went on:</PARA>
<PARA>On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond a point, it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us take the way this report seeks to undermine those very clear and sensible comments last year. The Reserve Bank report this year, in another point about `following another little bit of a disappointment', found:</PARA>
<PARA>The rates of increase in prices and wages remained disappointingly high in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Disappointingly high? The previous report, by the way, said it was absolutely vital, that it was imperative that there be a return to progress in reducing both the rate of inflation and the current account deficit in the current year. What was imperative last year was not met. The Government failed, and what has the Reserve Bank found? This year it is a bit disappointing. This wimpish, sanitised report is a disgrace. Let us go on to see how it in fact seeks to undermine conclusions in last years report. The Reserve Bank goes on in this year's report:</PARA>
<PARA>After the initial tightening of monetary policy to counter these inflationary pressures, the exchange rate rose and this may have increased imports somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA>Darn right it did! Now get this:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the increase in imports . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In last year's report it was shown as a perverse impact and meant we did not achieve objectives. This year it is described as . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . an important safety value during this time increasing supply and limiting domestic inflationary pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, because the Government so mishandled the economy, it was a useful device, according to the Reserve Bank, this year that that demand could flow out into imports and so worsen our balance of payments, the very thing-reduction of the balance of payments-which was supposed to be crucial in our economic survival. It is a useful safety valve this year. What an extraordinary change in atmosphere and in tone. </PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued to note that the Treasurer says he expects a fall in inflation from 7.5 per cent or so this year. I notice that the Reserve Bank of Australia says that last year's figure was overstated-that in fact it was not 7 per cent but less than that-because of a few influences. The Reserve Bank states:</PARA>
<PARA>In broad terms the rate of inflation in Australia in 1989/90 was about 7 per cent or a little lower. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Treasurer expects inflation to be a little lower than 7 per cent, it will be just about the same as last year's figure, allowing for Reserve Bank adjustments. It does not look to me as though the Treasurer will achieve what he claims he is going to achieve in his Budget Speech, and the Reserve Bank seems to imply that quite clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to delay the Senate. There are many other points I would like to make about this matter. Senator Short has a real concern about the nature of this report. He has a remarkable background in this area as a former Treasury officer, and is our shadow Minister for Finance. He is here and I would rather he pursued this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just expressing my concern that all the problems that we on this side of the chamber pointed to last year when what we thought was an inappropriate appointment to the Reserve Bank took place appear to have been confirmed. I regret that and I hope that next year the Reserve Bank once again discovers its independence and rediscovers its internal fortitude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for too long this evening on this matter, but there are some points about the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia released today that I feel I must comment on. In doing so, I would first of all fully underline, endorse and support the comments already made by my colleague Senator Michael Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank annual report is always an important document. Indeed, it is one of the most important economic documents tabled in this Parliament in the course of any year. It comes a couple of days after the presentation to the Parliament of the Budget documents and, taken together, the Budget Papers and the Reserve Bank annual report constitute the economic thinking and policy views of the Government and the public sector. By and large they are more important than any other documents that we receive in this place each year. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to a point that I would like to make at the outset. It relates to the very first page of the Reserve Bank report. It is a page that is there every year. It has been there every year in every annual report since the Reserve Bank was founded in 1959. It is a quotation from the Reserve Bank Act 1959 concerning duties of the Board of the Reserve Bank. Of course, it is the Board's report that we are considering tonight. The Act states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its powers, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank under this Act, the Banking Act 1959 and the regulations under that Act are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to the stability of the currency of Australia; the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that those facets of the duties of the bank are going to subjected to increasing debate and scrutiny in the period ahead. We have already seen the start of that debate in recent months and I think that is going to continue. The coalition is on record as saying that we believe that the independence of the Reserve Bank of Australia has to be greatly strengthened. With that increasing independence for the bank will come debate on several major issues. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many inconsistencies in the quotation from the Reserve Bank that I have just alluded to. For example, is it always consistent for the bank to act in a manner that will best contribute on the one hand to the stability of the currency of Australia-and that means keeping inflation down, keeping value in the dollar-and on the other hand to the maintenance of full employment in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The Act was proclaimed and produced in an era when very different views from those held today were expressed on the whole question of economic policy and economic management. In those years we were still very much steeped in the precepts of Keynesian economics. Today, Keynes would be largely discredited as the source of thinking for economic policy. I think Senator McMullan would agree that that would be the view on both sides of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern that I have and that the coalition has about the trend in economic policy thinking and debate over recent years is reflected, I think, in the schizophrenia that has been exhibited in recent times in some of the statements by bank spokesmen, and certainly spokesman for the Government, about the significance that ought to be attached to the control of inflation rather than the other issues of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, in my opinion and in the coalition's opinion, devoted far less attention than we should have to the significance of inflation in this country, particularly in recent years. In a very notable writing earlier this year it was pointed out by a former research director of the Reserve Bank, Dr Peter Johnson, who left some time ago, that inflation is a theft on the people. Unless government and the community recognise that and concentrate more on the insidious nature of inflation and the damaging effects it has on the whole structure not only of our economy but of our society, then we will not be performing our duties adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank annual report, as I said, complements the Budget documents in terms of coming together at the same time. It does not always support them. Honourable senators who were here last year will well recall, as my friend and colleague Senator Michael Baume pointed out in his remarks, the extraordinarily damaging criticism that the Reserve Bank annual report of 1989 made of the Government's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember it because Senator Baume and I, along with our former colleague Senator Stone, were so moved by the strength of criticism in that report about the Government's policies that the day after it was tabled we submitted a very important matter of public importance for discussion in this chamber in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The repudiation by the Reserve Bank of the Hawke-Keating Government's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Never, I think, have we seen a public document so lambasted, so critically analysed and destroyed-the whole underpinning of a government's economic strategy-as we saw in last year's annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia, and, as Senator Michael Baume said, the criticism turned out to be absolutely right. It was spot-on. All the things that the Reserve Bank criticised the Government for last year have come home to roost. The chickens, as a result, have come home to roost and, as a result of that, we are now facing, as a nation, the greatest economic crisis that we have faced at least since the 1930s. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator Michael Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And it turned out to be right.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two very different conditions applying today from the 1930s. Indeed, if one looks at the degree of crisis in this country, one has to look not only at the 1930s, but at the former Great Depression, the other great depression we had in this country, in the 1890s. The common characteristic between the 1890s, the 1930s and today is that we have, in each of those three periods, a level of foreign debt as a proportion of our total economy that has got to a level which has become almost unsustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difference between the 1890 and 1930 situation from today is that those situations occurred at a time when the whole world was in great trouble. Today, our situation of crisis in Australia-an unsustainable situation in terms of our debt-has occurred after a period of almost a decade of unbridled growth in the world economy and in world trade which has never been more conducive to producing a better, prosperous, faster growing Australia than one could imagine. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis that we have today is a home-grown crisis. In the 1930s and the 1890s, they were crises that were arguably imposed on us from outside-not only arguably; I think quite certainly they were imposed from outside. The crisis we have today is absolutely a home-grown crisis that the Reserve Bank pointed to in its annual report last year and about which, as we have said and seen, the Reserve Bank was absolutely right. It is a mark of the greatest indictment of this Government that it did not listen to its Reserve Bank, its monetary authority, last year; that it has continued, instead, to ignore the warnings about the problem of debt and inflation in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that, we face a situation today, 12 months later, in which that debt is at a far greater level than it was last year, both in absolute and in relative terms; in which inflation has barely improved, despite the fact that the economic situation on an international basis has been conducive to an improvement; where we have interest rates still at the highest level in the Western world; where we have productivity that is lagging below virtually every other Western country, and certainly most of the major competitors in our region of the world; and where nothing at all that this Government is doing in its economic policies will lead to a solution to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is doing today is strangling the economy in terms of squashing demand, trying to kill demand, but it is not doing anything at all about the real thing that has to be done to get this country going in a sustainable way, and that is to enhance the opportunity for an increase in the supply of goods and services produced in this country. The only way we shall do that is to improve our productivity and improve our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> That can often sound a little bit like dry economics, but it really comes to the bottom line as to the sort of society we are going to have in this country over the decade and beyond into the next century. If we do not introduce the necessary policies and pursue a culture of improved competitiveness, productivity, and greater supply of goods and services, we shall never be the society that can care, as we want to, and provide, as we want to, for all the people of our society, regardless of their economic circumstances or their station in life within our nation-and we have a responsibility as a nation to all of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank report, as I said, was very strong last year on many of these points of criticism of what the Government is doing. I agree with my friend and colleague Senator Michael Baume that this year we have a very sanitised report. It has obviously been worked over very carefully by the new Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser. Last year's report, I think, was produced in the hiatus between the retirement of Bob Johnston, the former governor, and the taking up of the reins by Mr Fraser. John Phillips was the acting governor of the Bank in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> I part company a little from my colleague in terms of the degree of sanitisation that has occurred in the Bank's report this year. In many respects, it has returned to the very cautious wording of Reserve Bank annual reports preceding 1989. In many ways, the 1989 report was a one-off report. Reserve Bank annual reports are always written in a fairly elliptical, delphic sort of manner, and one normally has to read between the lines to really get at what they are about. Last year one did not have to read between the lines because it hit one right in the eyeballs. This year one has to go back to reading the report a little along the lines of the pre-1989 reports. If one does that, one finds that there is a large degree of criticism-it might be a little more gentle than Senator Baume and I like-but, nevertheless, a lack of full agreement with the approach that the Government has been adopting to economic management over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just have a look at some of those. I do not want to speak at great length, because many of the points that I would raise will really be the subject of debate on the Budget, which we will be kicking off here tomorrow, but there are a couple of points that I would like to mention in so far as the Bank's contribution is concerned. The report's second paragraph is important in itself. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The combination of sustained monetary tightness and economic slowdown has squeezed profit margins for many businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not hear the Treasurer (Mr Keating) saying too much about that. I hear the Treasurer running around the countryside saying, `The profit margin and the proportion of profits in GDP is now back at record-ever levels, and what on earth are businesses about in complaining about the state of the economic environment in which they are working'. The Reserve Bank says very clearly that profit margins are being squeezed for many businesses. That, in Reserve Bank language, means that many businesses are suffering appallingly as a result of the high sustained monetary tightness that the Government, through the Reserve Bank, has been pursuing. It is a policy that the Reserve Bank has been pursuing on behalf of the Government because of the pressure that the Government has been putting on the Bank to pursue this monetary tightness because the Government has not had the wit or the ability, given its divisions and factionalism, to take the necessary measures of a complementary nature in fiscal, wages or any other forms of policy, particularly in the areas of micro-economic reform, that would enable it to take the running away from monetary policy a little, and to get interest rates down to levels that will not squeeze businesses out of existence. We have seen a 43 per cent growth in bankruptcies in my State, Victoria, in the last 12 months alone. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen an increase of 26 per cent in bankruptcies nationwide in the last 12 months. Why has that happened? That has happened fairly and squarely because this Government has not had the guts or the ability to take the measures in areas other than monetary policy which would allow that easing of monetary policy which would, in turn, allow those businesses to be competitive and profitable again, and to stay in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason why there has been in this country in the last 12 months-in fact, less than the last 12 months-an increase in unemployment of 100,000 people. And the Treasurer had the gall the other night on television after the Budget-and, indeed, he was reflecting on what was in the Budget-to say that there could be a further increase in unemployment this year. What is he budgeting for in terms of an unemployment increase this year? He is budgeting for an increase of 26 per cent in unemployment beneficiaries this year, and he says that that is really not something that ought to concern us. The Reserve Bank is pointing to that very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> It also points, in many other comments in these pages, to the fact that monetary policy is not only far too restrictive-because of the lack of ability to adopt a proper balance of policies-but also came fairly late upon the scene. The screws were really turned on, it says here, only in April 1988. Why were they turned on only in April 1988, when they should have been progressively and more gently applied from the latter part of 1987? Everyone-even blind Freddy-knew that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard of the stock market crash, Senator McMullan, but I have also heard of something else. There was a far more important thing in the eyes of Senator McMullan's Party, and the far more important thing was the desperate attempt by the Hawke-Keating Government to save that ravaged Unsworth Government when it was facing an election in March 1988. The only reason why monetary policy was not applied earlier than April 1988 was the desperate attempt to salvage an unsalvageable New South Wales Government in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many other points of an economic policy nature that one could make about the report itself. I will not go into those tonight; I will pursue them on other occasions, including the Budget debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I finally turn to support the comments that my friend Senator Michael Baume made in his remarks about the role of the Reserve Bank but, more particularly, the role of the Government and, within that, the Treasurer in the Pyramid Building Society debacle in my State. </PARA>
<PARA> Those here who do not come from Victoria do not really appreciate the significance of Pyramid. Pyramid was far and away the largest building society in Victoria. I think it had 54 per cent of total building society deposits in Victoria. It was very largely based around the major city of Geelong. Most families in Geelong had, and still have, a connection with Pyramid in the sense that they had money in it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the comments that were made today by the Treasurer and by Senator Button demonstrate a degree of callousness, confusion and just sheer hopelessness, in terms of their understanding of the problems of the collapse of Pyramid-and all the events leading to that collapse-for a major provincial city of Victoria and, indeed, for Victoria as a whole. Victoria is a very depressed State. My new Senate confrere Senator Spindler-whom I see here tonight-is nodding his head; he would agree. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria is a very depressed State indeed. It is a depressed State, not just because of Pyramid, but for two fundamental reasons. The first one is that we have had a hopelessly incompetent Labor government in Victoria for 8 years now-a government which has literally bankrupted the public finances of my State. Secondly, the State has had superimposed on it the abject failure and incompetence of a Federal Labor Government, led by Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, compounding all the problems that have been home grown. </PARA>

It is a problem of profound significance for my State. I have lived in Victoria for many years. I have never, in my lifetime, seen a State as depressed as the State of Victoria is at the moment, and that is due wholly and solely to the incompetence of a totally incompetent State Government and a more incompetent Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one reads the lines carefully, and reads between them, one sees that the Reserve Bank's annual report points to the reasons for many of those problems. I am sorry that this report is as sanitised as it is. I guess that is understandable, to some extent, when one sees the vitriol that this Treasurer poured on one of the most respected members of the financial community in Australia, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, John Phillips, who had the courage to say it as it really was, in terms of inflation, in a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia on 19 June, only to be vilified publicly in a statement by the Treasurer a few days later in a way that I find quite unacceptable and unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the sorts of things that are the hallmarks of this Government. They are the things that this Government is going to be remembered for-the vitriol, the bile and the lack of decency in its approach, not only to the whole question of government, but also to appointed officials of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank, despite its sanitisation of its annual report, has a fundamental role to play. I want to see the Reserve Bank become a much more independent institution. We have got to look very closely at the whole structure of the Reserve Bank Act. I am sure it is not going to happen under this Government, but I would hope, and very confidently expect, that one of the very early acts of an incoming coalition government will be to give the Reserve Bank the independence that it needs if it is to undertake the very important duties that a central bank has in any nation. </PARA>

<PARA> That Senator Short could say that this is an attack on decency and that vilification of public figures is entirely inappropriate, while endorsing the most scurrilous and unreasonable attack on Bernie Fraser or on any senior public figure that I have heard in the 2 years I have been in this chamber, amazes me. The absolutely tawdry innuendos and attacks upon a very senior and responsible public servant who has been serving the public interest of Australians for many years were entirely unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume's concern is that on this occasion the people did not pour a bucket on the Government in the way he hoped they would. He wished we all had short memories. Last year he came in here whooping with delight because in all the history of the Reserve Bank a unique event had taken place.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short, to his great credit, said that last year's report was very typical for the Reserve Bank and this year's was back in the normal tradition of Reserve Bank reports. That is absolutely correct. I congratulate Senator Short on his integrity and honesty to comment on that, and to implicitly say that criticising Mr Fraser because this report does not follow the unprecedented report of last year is entirely unwarranted-and it is. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Senator Baume's background is as a journalist. We know that he is prone to sensationalism, in the always thwarted hope that he might get a headline. I happily report that he has never succeeded yet and he will not today. It was entirely unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not correct to say that because a public servant does not agree with Senator Baume's fond hope that he will be able to massage a sensational headline out of the Reserve Bank report, as he rather imaginatively did last year, he is not entitled to attack that public servant. But let us not get into that debate. We had it at great length last year and nobody enjoyed it then; we do not want to hear it again. Even if last year he was right-I did not agree then and do not now-it is wrong to say that because this Reserve Bank report is in the great tradition of 39 of the last 40 Reserve Bank reports, while he is entitled to be disappointed, he is not entitled to attack a responsible senior public servant. </PARA>
<PARA> I will ignore the tawdry electoral innuendo that he dragged across and the conspiracy theory that he dredged up. If other people wish to respond to them, they will not have much difficulty. I choose to ignore them and simply say--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General Audit Report No. 1 of 1990-91 particularly deals with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) administration to self-government day, which was 11 May 1989. The report is worth looking at from several points of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Before doing so, it is worth looking back at some of the statements made by the Australian Labor Party prior to self-government coming into existence. When I read this Auditor-General's report today, I was particularly reminded of the statements of the then Minister, Mr Gary Punch. I will quote some parts of a press release put out by Gary Punch on 13= April 1988. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The ACT is well and truly ready for self government. In organisational terms we have an ACT Administration with its own budget and fiscus that is ready to hand over to the elected representatives of the people of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>That being his view, one can only surmise that he was not aware of a great deal going on in his Department. In the same press release he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why self government should cost ACT citizens more than the current system. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Transitional financial arrangements that will apply over a number of years will be introduced to ensure an orderly and smooth transition of power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Grants Commission will decide the Commonwealth's grant to the ACT after that in the same way as it does for the States and the Northern Territory, taking into account the additional costs that arise from Canberra being the nation's capital. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that many of us believe that that was the Commonwealth's view. We believe that it had been running the financial arrangements of the ACT well and was handing over a satisfactory financial situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times it has become far too apparent that that was not the case. The ACT people are bearing the brunt of the Commonwealth's failure to manage the Territory properly during the six years that it was responsible for the Territory prior to self-government day on 11 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Only as recently as the Premiers Conference of 1990 did we learn exactly what others think of the ACT and the way they treat us. It was then reported that the ACT would be the hardest hit of all States and Territories, except perhaps the Northern Territory, as a result of new funding formulas which had been proposed by the Commonwealth at the Premiers Conference. The report said that the ACT faced a real cut and that all others, except the Northern Territory, would receive an increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra Times reported that to compound the real decline in the ACT's funds, the Commonwealth proposed to withhold $32.6m, to be placed in an ACT trust account established after last year's Premiers Conference. You, Madam Acting Deputy President, will not have forgotten that last year the same thing was done. The Commonwealth took money which it had previously promised and put it into a trust account and withheld it from the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> This report before us sets out some of the occurrences during the Labor Party's administration of the ACT. I shall refer just to the key points and not go into the report in detail, but anyone who reads it will get the full detail of the matters that I am referring to. It talks about the ACT Housing Assistance Fund. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the accounts were unqualified, but the ANAO-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australian National Audit Office-</PARA>
<PARA>found high levels of home loan mortgage debts and arrears of rent on government housing, also in the number of vacant houses. </PARA>
<PARA>All of those three areas within the housing area indicate that less money was coming in and more owed to the Government than one would have expected as being reasonable, if one believes the Minister's statement that all was well and in order in the financial affairs of the ACT when self-government was handed over. Clearly it was not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's Report says of the ACT Transport Trust:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the accounts were qualified for over-award payments, and the ANAO also noted inadequacies in the inventory recording system. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also talks about the ACT Forestry Trust, the City of Canberra Municipal Accounts, the ACT Electricity and Water Authority and the Gaming and Liquor Authority. There, there were no problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Documents</PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to deal with the ACT Department of Community Health and Services and states:</PARA>
<PARA> * the accounts were qualified on the mixing of trust and operations moneys and the ANAO found significant inadequacies in accounting for payments to visiting medical officers, assets, salaries, liability for 3% superannuation, and acquittal of Commonwealth grants</PARA>
<PARA> * action to recover overpayments of redundancy payments to staff of the former National Capital Development Commission is being taken by the ACT Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Within the report the ANAO refers to overpayments of $56,432. Honourable senators might say that that is not a particularly large sum of money; but the way things are in the ACT, every cent counts. </PARA>
<PARA> The report refers to the Office of the Public Trustee and states:</PARA>
<PARA>No accounts or annual reports have been prepared by the office since the requirement to do so was introduced in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>Although I draw no conclusions from that, it is just an interesting fact which has been added to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these matters, we have found out exactly how much maintenance had not been done on the Canberra Hospital and the extent to which it had been run down and exactly the amount of money needed were it to be retained as a first-class hospital. The same Minister, Mr Punch, indicated that money would be made available to refurbish it. That money now does not seem to be available and a great deal more than he was led to believe is necessary were the hospital to be refurbished. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government of the ACT set up an inquiry into the assets and public debt of the Australian Capital Territory, but I will not take the time of the Senate tonight to go through all the matters that were raised. Some of them are interesting. The report in part states:</PARA>
<PARA>These figures confirm that the ACT has a greater than normal volume of outstanding repairs and maintenance. Consequently the committee is of the view that the Commonwealth should accept responsibility for that backlog and provide appropriate financial assistance as an establishment grant. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators can go through that report and find other instances where the Commonwealth has clearly reneged on its responsibilities to the ACT over the 6 years prior to self-government. It is now becoming apparent that the citizens of the ACT are bearing the responsibility of making up for that mismanagement over time. There can be no doubt that the ACT was misled by the Commonwealth when it believed that the administration of the ACT and the financial arrangements which were set in place by the Commonwealth were as stated by Mr Punch in the statement that I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also deals with the review of the ACT assets register. The report states that the ACT has already made moves towards addressing the over-funding gap. It refers to areas where the ACT has been significantly let down in the way that the finances were put together prior to being handed over. Honourable senators who have taken an interest in the ACT cannot fail to realise what is happening as a consequence as the Government struggles to try to put the financial situation on a satisfactory footing. I thought it was worth recalling tonight some of the things that had been said and to refer to the Auditor-General's report which deals with some, perhaps quite small, items compared with, for example, the Canberra Hospital. But the report deals with a series of areas where we did not get a fair deal from the Commonwealth in the handover of finances to the ACT Government. </PARA>

<PARA>EXAMINATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1988-89 OF THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY</PARA>
<PARA>Tabling Statement</PARA>
<PARA> In tabling the Committee's report on its examination of the 1988-89 Annual Report of the National Crime Authority, I wish to take the opportunity to speak about the activities of the Committee in this the 36th Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is created by Part 111 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 and consists of ten members; namely five members of the Senate appointed by the Senate and five members of the House of Representatives appointed by the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was re-appointed by resolution of the two Houses on 16 May 1990, and since the new Senators took up their places last 1 July the Committee has seven of its ten members new to its membership. I was honoured to be elected unopposed as Chairman of the Committee, and Senator Amanda Vanstone, Senator for South Australia, is the Deputy Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has reviewed the past activities of its predecessor Committees and it proposes to build on their substantial achievements. However, the Committee noted an apparent desire by the Committee in the last Parliament to extend its role beyond that intended by Parliament, especially in its proposed inquiry into the capacity of the police to combat organised crime. The current Committee has resolved to discontinue this inquiry because, while the Committee recognised that the quality of Australia's police forces is a matter of major importance, the subject matter is essentially one for State Governments, and is only peripherally relevant to the Committee's duties as prescribed in section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The report I am tabling today is indicative of the Committee's desire to comply with these statutory duties. While the 1988-89 report of the National Crime Authority is its fifth annual report, the Parliamentary Joint Committee has not in the past reported to Parliament its examination of annual reports except in a cursory manner in its ad hoc omnibus reports. This is despite paragraph 55 (1) (c) of the Act making it an express duty of the Committee, and I quote, `to examine each annual report of the Authority and report to the Parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of, any such annual report.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's principal statutory function is to monitor and review the performance of the National Crime Authority on behalf of the Parliament and, through it, the citizens of Australia. This it proposes to do. </PARA>
<PARA> As its major task for this 36th Parliament, the Committee has announced that it will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Authority. Such a task had been recommended for commencement after June 1991 by the Committee's predecessor in its May 1988 Initial Evaluation report, a recommendation which was not opposed by the Government in its response in November 1988. The Committee has resolved to launch the evaluation inquiry immediately, after it had received a number of concerns, not least from the Authority itself, that such a review was necessary following the removal of the sunset clause in June 1988. The Committee proposes to review all aspects of the Authority's operations: its constitution, role, functions and powers; its efficiency and effectiveness; the issue of accountability and parliamentary supervision; and the need for amendment of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 that will arise from the review. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference have been advertised nationally and submissions requested, with a closing date of Friday, 14= September l990. The Committee has indicated that it proposes to report its findings to Parliament by August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also intends to conduct smaller inquiries simultaneously, but with the emphasis on its statutory duty to inquire into matters relating to the activities of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The report now presented is the first report of the Committee as newly constituted in the 36th Parliament. It is also the first report of the apparent duty of the Committee in paragraph 55 (1) (c) of the Act to do so. In the past, the Committee has met this statutory duty by passing only brief comment on the contents of NCA Annual Reports in its general reports to the Parliament; comments which have generally endorsed the quality of the reports and commended the NCA for increasing provision of information about its investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> The correspondence reproduced in the Committee's report includes details of the Senate's examination of annual reports, which had adjudged the NCA report as satisfactory except in relation to one of the guidelines which apply to reporting by statutory authorities. However, as indicated in the NCA's letter to the Committee dated 20 July 1990, the NCA has, since its inception, followed the guidelines for reporting applying to departmental annual reports, rather than statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet wrote to the Secretaries of all departments in April 1990 to indicate that it may be appropriate for statutory authorities to follow departmental guidelines wholly or in part because of the absence of up-to-date guidelines for statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Senate will need to examine the implications of this advice for its future system of scrutiny of annual reports or alternatively to cease the approach adopted in May 1990 of routinely comparing reports against guidelines and instead adopt a more targeted approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee had suggested to the NCA that it consider copying the ICAC precedent and present its annual reports direct to the Presiding Officers as evidence of its independence from executive influence. The NCA defended the current system of reporting to the Inter-Governmental Committee as `appropriate for a national body with a Commonwealth/State role'. As term of reference No. 3 of the Committee's Evaluation of the National Crime Authority inquiry is directed at `accountability and parliamentary supervision of the Authority', the method of reporting by the NCA will be closely examined by the Committee in the context of its foreshadowed inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Within this report there are five recommendations and I wish to refer to them. With the introduction of self-government in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) the Federal Government saw the need to establish proper planning arrangements which would recognise that this Territory, while being the national capital of Australia, is also home to almost 300,000 residents. One of the Acts passed by this Parliament which makes up the self-government package was the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 which established the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) and required the Authority to prepare a national capital plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of this plan was to ensure that Canberra and the ACT are planned and developed in accordance with their national significance. The NCPA was required to have the plan prepared by 1990 but, with the election ensuing, it was not surprising that that was not met in the way that it had been intended. Last year volumes of the draft plan were released for public comment and were referred by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in the previous Parliament virtually completed its inquiry but because of the election was not able to present the report prior to that time. At about the time of the election this plan was certified by the Minister. The new Committee then presented its report in May 1990. That report contained about 20 recommendations, many of which have been significantly adopted by the NCPA in its revised draft plan. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory comments on the revised draft plan in the report that I have tabled today. The plan has identified areas of the ACT and recommended that they be classified into particular categories referred to as: designated areas; areas to which special requirements apply; and areas which are in neither category. </PARA>
<PARA>National Crime Authority</PARA>
<PARA>Joint Committee on ACT</PARA>
<PARA> The significance of these three categories can be summarised in this way: The designated areas are those with some special characteristic of the national capital, such as the Parliamentary Triangle and the areas where the planning is within the authority of the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA). In most of the areas where special requirements apply, the NCPA will also be involved in planning, as will the Australian Capital Territory Planning Authority. Special conditions may be laid down concerning planning and development in these areas. In those areas which are not designated and which are not subject to special requirements, the Territory Planning Authority is the responsible planning body. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the recommendations of the Joint Committee and make some comments about them. The first recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA>the National Capital Plan provide that Special Requirements be applied in the Lanyon area either by including the area in the Murrumbidgee Corridor or by separately identifying the Lanyon area; and the River Corridors, where Special Requirements are to be applied, be defined in the National Capital Plan with more precision than the map of the General Policy Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter of the Lanyon and Murrumbidgee area has been debated in the Senate on previous occasions and the same Committee has reported to the Senate after an inquiry into that area. The Lanyon area also came before the Joint Committee and the Parliament when the development of land was being considered in the area leading towards the Lanyon property. There was some discussion with the then Minister for Territories and Local Government, Mr Uren, about how far south the urban development should go. It is very disappointing to me that the development there has been proceeded with in the same close urban settlement as exists in the rest of Canberra when it ought, in my view, to have been somewhat more sparse, as is fitting to the entrance of a town or city where there are larger blocks on the edge of town with a different type of settlement leading into the more closely settled areas nearer the city centres. That is perhaps not a matter for discussion tonight, but it is certainly a matter which I regard as very disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Murrumbidgee is a very important part of the inland river system of Australia. It is part of the Murray-Darling system and approximately 60 kilometres of the river are within the ACT. The significance of its being so close to a large population centre is very apparent when one thinks of the pressures on the river and its environs. It was designated an area of special national concern by the Commonwealth Government in 1964, meaning that it was given special attention as an area playing an important part in establishing the character of the city of Canberra. It is appropriate that that characteristic continue to be recognised, and I commend that recommendation to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA>the Department of Defence urgently consider ways of making as much of the land as possible occupied by the Belconnen and Bonshaw naval communications stations available for housing development. </PARA>
<PARA>We heard evidence also-and I will refer to the third recommendation-that the National Capital Planning Authority and the Territory planners should consider alternatives to standard housing development on the western edge of Belconnen. Both of those recommendations relate to the need to make the best use of the land available in Canberra; to make the best use of the costly infrastructure and see that the areas which can be satisfactorily built up but have not been so far can be built up. This will cut down costs considerably for the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The residents from the west Belconnen area who gave evidence to the Committee expressed concern at the prospective loss of open space and bushland if intense housing development occurred in that particular area which is very close to the New South Wales border. We also heard evidence from the Territory Planning Authority that, while the Belconnen area was originally planned for a population of 120,000 people, at present the population is only about 85,000 people. So the need to make the best use of the Belconnen land is, of course, apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that all Committee members were concerned that, in the event of development in the west Belconnen area, there should be adequate open space left, as well as access to the open space areas for the people in that area. Again, I refer to what I have just said about urban development at the southern extremity near Lanyon. If there is to be development in this area of west Belconnen it, too, should be much sparser than the normal urban development, with larger blocks that some people might like to buy in order to live on the edge of town. It is not an appropriate area for close urban development. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this recommendation, the Committee felt that, while we concede that there is perhaps some benefit in developing there, there needs to be a closer examination before development proceeds. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the second recommendation concerning building in the Belconnen and Bonshaw naval station areas. The land occupied there by the Department of Defence is indeed very valuable. One wonders whether, this long after they were first established, they could do the same thing with less land if the technology were updated. I do not know the answer to that question but it is certainly worth inquiring about. I do not want us to lose people from the ACT as a consequence of shifting the naval stations out of the ACT. We have enough problems with the economy in Canberra already without losing population. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I can divert from this matter to say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is present in the chamber, that we cannot afford to lose the people that he would move to Newcastle by shifting the Federal Sea Safety Centre from Canberra to Newcastle. The Labor Government has been shifting people out of Canberra at will for the whole of the time that it has been in government. It has to stop if the economy of the Australian Capital Territory is not to be seriously affected. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford to lose the Service personnel who would be lost to Canberra if the Belconnen and Bonshaw naval stations were just packed up and moved to some other place. While the land is very valuable for housing development, we have to be quite certain that we are not creating other problems by moving people out. It is an area where investigation is required. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are talking about the Belconnen area, I wish to remind the Senate that it is an ecologically unique area. The grasslands around the Belconnen Naval Station have not been used for any agricultural purpose and they are, apparently, in their natural state. Within the Belconnen Naval Station there lives a species of moth, now regarded as an endangered species, which feeds on the native grasslands which are within the station's boundaries. If that area were to be developed and if the normal things were placed upon it, as would occur if gardens were established and other developments took place, it would, I understand, mean the end of that species of moth. That may or may not be a matter of concern, but I do not think that it is something that should be embarked upon without further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth recommendation of the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that all gazetted National Land should be identified in the National Capital Plan as either Designated Areas or areas where Special Requirements will apply; and an area of gazetted National Land will only be identified as a Designated Area where that land displays some special characteristic of the National Capital. </PARA>
<PARA>On this point I refer to the matters raised by the Department of Administrative Services. A representative of the Department's Australian Property Group expressed concern to the Committee about the Department being required to comply with the Territory plan. On the one hand, the Parliament is indicating through legislation which it has passed that there is to be a National Capital Planning Authority which will determine certain things about the way the ACT will develop in the future, and on the other hand a department of the Commonwealth is querying whether it should be required to abide by these rules. It seems to me to be an extraordinary proposition which must be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee endorsed the previous Committee's recommendation that the NCPA should develop procedures in relation to the plan and that the Commonwealth should make the appropriate decisions to see that the Department of Administrative Services is not excluded from the plan. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak on the adjournment tonight, but I want to refer to the function that was held this afternoon. I was very angry this afternoon. I am less angry now but just as determined to see that this matter is referred to. When I received the invitation from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to attend the reception on the occasion of the presentation by Sir Geoffrey Howe of the United Kingdom Public Records Office of the vellum copy of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of 1990 I felt quite excited indeed. I thought that this was a splendid event and it was one I was looking forward to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard the centenary of Federation as a more important event than the Bicentenary and something that should be celebrated. I saw the handing over of this copy of the Constitution as an important step in the political and constitutional development of this country and I went along to the function feeling very good about it and feeling it was an important occasion. I was astonished and amazed to find that when the official party took its place on the podium the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was not amongst those who were taking part. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my view that it was a bipartisan occasion which all Australians should have celebrated and which all Australians felt was something of significance. I was indeed surprised to find it turned into a partisan affair where the members of the Australian Labor Party only were the ones who took part. I would have expected that the Leader of the Opposition would have been asked to briefly speak on such an occasion to indicate that this was a function for the people of Australia, not merely for grandstanding by the Prime Minister of this country. He perhaps may not have been asked to speak but at least he should have been on the podium. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a case could be made out on an occasion such as this for suggesting that the leaders of the major parties ought to have been acknowledged and at least seated on the podium. One cannot say that it was because there was not enough space. The Members Hall is a large area which was not crowded. There is no justifiable reason whatsoever for turning this affair into a partisan function where the Prime Minister was the only one who took part, and the rest of the population was totally ignored in the way that it was by the Leader of the Opposition not being invited. The plan of the podium shows, from the names written upon the plan that was sent out, that it was never intended that he should be there and I think there will be many Australians who feel that the occasion was denigrated indeed by its being conducted in the way that it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition should have been on the podium. I believe he should have been asked to speak. Also, I would have liked the leaders of the other parties represented in this Parliament to have been acknowledged. I think it is a matter for deep regret that this function was conducted in the fashion that it was. </PARA>

By letter dated that day, the Company put Sherlock on notice that he and Isherwood had no right to advertise the business of the Company for sale or to purport to sell the business to any person. </PARA>
<PARA> On March 28 1988 Mr Taylor re-entered the premises of the Company and took control of the business. A partner of Coopers and Lybrand, one Martin Brown, caused Mr Taylor to be removed from the premises with conduct described by The Shoalhaven and Nowra News as `Gestapo Tactics'. </PARA>
<PARA> During the early afternoon of that day, Brown came onto the premises of the Company. Brown became hostile and ripped a newspaper from Mr Taylor's hands and said, `I should throw you out the door'. Taylor said, `If you lay one finger on me I will charge you with assault.' Brown became increasingly hostile and said to Taylor, `I should pull that chair from under you'. Taylor replied, `Come and try it'. Brown then said, `No, you may have a heart attack and I could be charged'. Brown then left the premises. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Brown's employees said to Taylor, `He (Brown) has instructed me to put chains and padlocks on the office doors leading to the factory area. You'll be locked in'. Taylor replied `How will I be able to get to the toilet?' The employee replied: `You can use the gutter. There will be a security guard coming, when you go outside to relieve yourself, you will be locked out.'</PARA>
<PARA> Workmen drilled holes in the doors and walls to affix the chains. A locksmith arrived on the premises and put new locks on the front door and the inner office. Shortly after, a security guard arrived armed with a revolver in a hip holster. The conduct of Brown was that of an impetulant child. Brown acted in a high-handed manner with total disregard for Mr Taylor's rights. Brown acted on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Bank that has advertised itself Australia wide as `BIG, SAFE AND FRIENDLY'. </PARA>
<PARA> On April 20 1988, the solicitor for the Company advised Coopers and Lybrand that Mr Kerry Packer wanted to include the Company in a joint venture with one of his Companies, United Systems, and other Companies and to float a consolidated Company on the First Board of the Stock Exchange. By letter that day, the Company advised Brown of the proposed joint venture and asked Brown not to instigate any action which could jeopardise the fruition of the proposed joint venture. Brown ignored the letter. </PARA>
<PARA> On April 22 1988, Sherlock and Isherwood purported to sell the business of the Company to Kambrook Distributing Pty Limited of Melbourne for $402,000. At that time, the Company's plant and equipment was valued on a replacement value basis at over $2 million and the assets were valued on a going concern basis at over $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA> On May 2 1988, the Managing Director of United Systems advised Kambrook that the position appeared to be that the purported sale of the plant and equipment was null and void. By letter dated May 6 1988 the Managing Director of Kambrook advised United Systems that it purchased the assets `without notice of any alleged defect in the Vendor's title to the assets'. </PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of Sherlock and Isherwood, in failing to disclose the Deed terminating their appointment and purporting to sell the assets for a fraction of their true value, was blatant fraud. That fraud was perpetrated by Sherlock and Isherwood as the appointees of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Sherlock and Isherwood were appointed by the Bank without any Order of the Court and proceeded to strip the Company of its assets. This must never be allowed happen again. I call for urgent legislative reforms to require Receivers to be appointed by the Court and to be answerable to the Court for their misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs for NSW to initiate an investigation into these matters with a view to laying criminal charges. </PARA>
<PARA>CASE HISTORY-HUON VALLEY SPRINGS</PARA>
<PARA> Miss Donna Batiste was the proprietor of Huon Valley Springs Pty Limited, a company developing a mineral water processing plant in Tasmania. The quality of the product was recognised as equal to that of Perrier and able to compete on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Batiste's Company borrowed funds from the Commonwealth Development Bank and operated a working overdraft account with the Commonwealth Trading Bank as it then was. The Development Bank held security over the assets of the business. The Trading Bank held first mortgage security over Miss Batiste's penthouse at the Regent Hotel in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> On January 14 1986, Mr K. M. Simington, Senior Manager, NSW Branches Administration of the Trading Bank, instructed that cheques `will be dishonoured today unless cash funds are provided . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>The following day Mr J. J. Vanner, Deputy Chief Manager of the Trading Bank, issued a memorandum stating: `The hard line is to be taken. Cheques drawn on HVS (that is, Huon Valley Springs) account are to be dishonoured . . . Batiste cannot expect otherwise and she is not worthy of some special treatment . . .'</PARA>
<PARA> On February 6 1986, the Development Bank served on Huon Valley Springs a Notice of Demand purporting to require payment of $525,020.10 within one hour.</PARA>
<PARA> Huon Valley Springs was in default to the Development Bank for interest not exceeding $10,000. The reason the Company was in default and could not pay that interest was because funds totalling $350,000 advanced by the Development Bank to Huon Valley Springs as start up capital had been deposited by Mr Simington of the Trading Bank on interest bearing deposit for a period of l8l days. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Simington declined to release those funds to Huon Valley Springs to pay the interest. Mr Simington illegally transferred those funds in reduction of Huon Valley Spring's operating overdraft account, thereby depriving the company of its capacity to service the interest payment to the Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> On February 6 1986, the Development Bank purported to appoint receivers to the assets and undertakings of Huon Valley Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> On May 30 1986, Mr W. Christey, of the Trading Bank's NSW Southern Division, in an internal memorandum, said: `If as claimed Batiste is in dire financial difficulties and has no assets obviously the CBA is not going to gain any benefit from bankrupting Batiste except satisfaction.'</PARA>
<PARA> On June 2 1986, the Trading Bank undertook in writing `. . . not to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against you in respect to your indebtedness to it . . .' The undertaking was signed by Mr Vanner and conferred upon Miss Batiste the right to sell the penthouse in accordance with the Trading Bank's independent valuation and pay the proceeds of sale in discharge of her indebtedness to the Trading Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> By letter dated August 5 1986, the solicitor for the Trading Bank, Mr L. C. Hollis, wrote to Miss Batiste's solicitors alleging: . . . She is refusing the bank further access to the property and thereby preventing a second valuation from being carried out. She is, accordingly, in breach of the agreement. Should she not vacate the premises then the bank will consider taking immediate ejectment proceedings against her.'</PARA>
<PARA> In a judgement handed down in the Federal Court on April 27 1989, Mr Justice Burchett said of the letter: `. . . The letter ignores entirely the rights the bank had agreed to give Miss Batiste to re-finance the property or sell it herself at `the bank's independent valuation'. The proposition that the agreement cannot diminish the bank's rights is, on the face of it, extraordinary. The letter evinces an attitude of total and high-handed disregard of the rights the Bank had granted to Miss Batiste . . .'</PARA>
<PARA> In an internal memorandum dated September 9 1986, Mr W. Christey (referring to a valuation of the penthouse provided on behalf of Miss Batiste) stated: `. . . past experience with Batiste shows that we cannot rely on any dealings she has been involved in and it would not surprise if it came to our notice that the valuation . . . was not above board. We would always go `under the table' ourselves and obtain a valuation to our liking but . . . there is the possibility that our actions could become known'. In his judgement, Mr Justice Burchett described this proposition as `a remarkable suggestion'. </PARA>
<PARA> The memorandum has the following handwritten comments by an officer of the Trading Bank: `Batiste has shown quite clearly that she lacks principle completely . . . We have the cards and should play them in the strongest possible manner. Batiste deserves no compassion whatsoever. Throughout the whole saga with her my attitude has been that the Bank pursue her to the ultimate and that includes to bankruptcy . . . I believe the CBA has a social responsibility to take her there with the undertaking of 2.6.86 being revoked immediately . . . for once it appears that the CBA holds the upper hand and in this regard Batiste most definitely does not want the bank to pursue her to bankruptcy'. </PARA>
<PARA> To this, Mr Justice Burchett said: `The comments endorsed on the memorandum indicate a very considerable (even personal) animus against Miss Batiste . . .'</PARA>
<PARA> On September 26 1986, Mr R. N. Sim, General Manager to the Trading Bank, wrote in an internal memorandum: `In the last few days we have received an offer of $1.1 million (in respect of the sale of the penthouse) which we have refused believing it could well be an arrangement engineered by Miss Batiste . . . we also intend to put in train a summons to obtain judgement as a prelude to bankruptcy proceedings, the fear of which might generate from Miss Batiste a level of co-operation.'</PARA>
<PARA> By letter dated October 20 1986, the bank's solicitors wrote to Miss Batiste's solicitors purporting to revoke the undertaking not to bankrupt her, denying that Miss Batiste had co-operated with the bank in the exercise of its power of sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Batiste proceeded to sell the penthouse for $1.5 million. To quote Mr Justice Burchett: `The bank consented to sale at that price, and in due course received the net proceeds.'</PARA>
<PARA> Miss Batiste had given the bank everything they had bargained for when executing the undertaking not to bankrupt her. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Bank that advertises Australia wide, ad nauseam, describing itself as `Australia's Leading Bank', filed a petition in the Federal Court to bankrupt Miss Batiste. In his judgment dismissing the petition, Mr Justice Burchett said: `The circumstances alleged by Miss Batiste are of some complexity. Her version of them has not been challenged by any evidence on behalf of the bank; nor, although she was cross-examined, did anything emerge to cast any shadow on the credit of her account. This is remarkable, since documents from the Bank's file make it plain the entire dispute had its genesis in a diametrically opposed view of the facts entertained at the time by officers of the Bank, never since unequivocally withdrawn, which there was no attempt at the hearing to justify.'</PARA>
<PARA> This conduct by management of the Commonwealth Bank at the most senior level must stand as one of the most disgraceful exhibitions by servants of the Commonwealth of Australia. This conduct casts a dark shadow over the honour and integrity of the Commonwealth Bank. It places in question whether that bank stands above the law or whether the bank and its customers are equal before the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend Mr Justice Burchett for his courage in confirming to the Australian people that our society is not based on rank and privilege but on justice and equality for all. I call upon the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, to initiate an investigation into these matters with a view to laying criminal charges. </PARA>
<PARA>CASE HISTORY-TONY RIGG</PARA>
<PARA> In June 1985, the Commonwealth Bank's Nowra Branch approved a Bills Discount facility to Mr &amp;Mrs Tony and Dorothy Rigg of Nowra. On 34 separate occasions between August 1985 and November 1987 the Bill roll-over transactions were credited and debited by the Bank to the overdraft account of the Rigg's trading company, Tony Rigg Welding &amp;Manufacturing Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank's records show that on each occasion officers of the Bank authorised the crediting and debiting of those transactions to the overdraft account of the Company. The aforementioned amounts should have been debited to the account of Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg from the outset. Debiting the rollover costs to the overdraft account of the Company had the effect of absorbing the profits of the Company and crippled the business. </PARA>
<PARA> The last Bill, with a face value of $750,000, matured on 22 December 1987. The following day that amount of $750,000 was debited to the overdraft account of the Company as a miscellaneous debit. (Table bank statement.)</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 March 1988, the debit balance to the overdraft account was over $1 million representing the amount of $750,000 aforementioned, the Bill rollover costs and overdraft interest. On that date, the Bank wrote to the Company demanding payment of $1,032,398.67 and on the same day wrote to Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg demanding payment of that sum as guarantors of the Company's overdraft account. (Table letters.)</PARA>
<PARA> The Company was unable to meet its debts and the Directors were obliged by law to freeze the account. That was done by instruction to the Bank dated August 10 1988, under the Seal of the Company. By letter dated August 16 1988, the bank wrote to the Company confirming that the instruction would be adhered to. (Instruction and reply to be tabled.)</PARA>
<PARA> By letter and notice dated December 21 1988, solicitors for the Company denied liability for the sum claimed and denied that Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg were liable as guarantors. (To be tabled.)</PARA>
<PARA> By letter dated February 3 1989, the Senior Manager, Nowra Branch, Mr Don Alston, wrote to the Company claiming that the debiting of the $750,000 to the overdraft account was an error and purported to reverse the entry. On the same day, Mr Alston wrote to Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg claiming they were personally liable for the $750,000 as the drawers of the Bill that matured on December 22 1987. (Letters tabled.)</PARA>
<PARA> The bank illegally manipulated the account of the Company for the sole purpose of making a claim against Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg personally. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter dated March 1 1989, the Managing Director of the Bank, Mr Don Sanders, alleged to me that the debiting of the $750,000 to the overdraft account was a `mistake' and had been `rectified'. (Letter tabled.)</PARA>
<PARA> That was a palpable falsehood. If, as Mr Sanders alleged, there was a `mistake', then all the previous debits were `mistakes' also. No attempt was made to reverse the previous entries. Further, no attempt was made to reverse any of the debits of Rollover costs, including the costs relating to the last bill. Indeed, the Bank continued to make a claim against the Company for those amounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sanders' letter was an attempt to cover-up the manipulation of the Company's overdraft account. </PARA>
<PARA> On April 5 1989, Mr Sanders letter was tabled in the Senate by the then Senator John Stone and incorporated into Hansard. Senator Stone relied on Mr Sanders letter to oppose my motion for a Senate Inquiry into Banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sanders letter goes on to state: `On every occasion on which a Bill was drawn down or rolled over on maturity, Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg were written to and informed in detail of the amount of the Bill, its maturity date, its duration, the amount of fees and the nett amount credited, or debited, and specifying the account to which the credit or debit had been made.'</PARA>
<PARA> The allegation was a palpable falsehood. An examination of the Banks files shows that on the draw-down of the last Bill, the Riggs were not written to at all. The Riggs did not know of the maturity date of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, on the day before that Bill matured, Mr Rigg met the regional manager of the Bank, Mr Geoffrey Kyngdon, at Wollongong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank's files show that Mr Kyngdon made no mention of the maturity date of the Bill or that the Bank held no intention of rolling the Bill over the following day. Indeed, the Bank's files show that Mr Kyngdon gave Mr Rigg until January 15 1988 to come up with plans for clearance or reduction of the debts. </PARA>
<PARA> On March 16 1989 the Bank issued proceedings against Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg, by way of cross-claim, claiming the face value of the Bill namely $750,000, and interest thereon. </PARA>
<PARA> The cross-claim alleges ``On December 22 1987, the Bill was duly presented for payment and dishonoured'' and . . . that the Bill was presented for payment to the cross defendants (that is, Mr and Mrs Rigg) as drawers thereof . . . .'' The cross-claim further alleges ``. . . that presentation for payment was dispensed with . . .'' (Table cross-claim.)</PARA>
<PARA> These mutually exclusive statements of fact, namely that the Bill was presented to Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg, and at one and the same time, was not presented to Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg, were verified on oath by the regional manager, Wollongong, Mr Geoffrey Kyngdon. </PARA>
<PARA> In those proceedings, Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg denied on oath, that the Bill was presented to them for payment. The Bank's files failed to disclose any evidence that the Bill was presented to Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg. Judgement was entered against Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg on the Cross-Claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is the Bill was not presented to Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg at all! The face value of the Bill was debited to the overdraft account of the Company and demand for that amount was made on the Company. The fact is that the regional manager of the bank, Mr Geoffrey Kyngdon, committed wilful and corrupt perjury. </PARA>
<PARA> The Riggs appealed against the Judgement to the NSW Court of Appeal. In his written judgment, dismissing the appeal, His Honour the Chief Justice, Mr Justice Gleeson, relied upon the letter from Mr Sanders and said: `That letter includes the following information: On every occasion on which a bill was drawn down or rolled over on maturity Mr &amp;Mrs Rigg were written to and informed in detail of the amount of the bill, its maturity date, its duration, the amount of the fees and the nett amount credited or debited and specifying the account to which the credit or debit had been made.'' (Judgment to be tabled.)</PARA>
<PARA> I say again that the allegation by Mr Sanders, quoted and relied upon by the Chief Justice, contained a palpable falsehood. That falsehood was not disclosed to the Chief Justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Riggs applied to the High Court of Australia for Special Leave To Appeal against the judgement of the Court of Appeal. The Riggs ran out of funds to prosecute the Appeal and were obliged to enter into a commercial settlement with the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the settlement was that the Riggs and the Company would make a public apology. On December 20 1989 an apology appeared in the South Coast Register &amp;The Shoalhaven &amp;Nowra News. The apology included the following: Mr and Mrs Rigg and their Company now unreservedly withdraw all and any allegations of fraud and deceit previously made against the Bank and its officers and unreservedly apologise for the hurt, distress and offence caused by the allegations. (Table apologies). </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, through Officers, manipulated the Company's account, committed perjury, published palpable falsehoods and perverted the course of Justice. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, through Officers, misled the Court, misled the Parliament and misled the People. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the Attorney General for NSW to initiate an investigation into these matters with a view to laying criminal charges. </PARA>
