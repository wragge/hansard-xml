<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I congratulate you on your re-election yet again as President of the Senate. Having experienced your three years as President of the Senate, I am sure that your re-election reflects merit rather than numbers or anything else. When we last met in this chamber a number of speeches were made about your merits and the fairness which you showed as President of the Senate, and I believe that those speeches came with equal force from both sides of the chamber. We congratulate you on your re-election and, on behalf of all senators, I express the wish that you preside as well as you have done in the past.

As one who does not travel much, I also acknowledge the international work you do, particularly with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which enhances the standing of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two incidental matters I wish to briefly mention. We on this side of the chamber recognise that on some occasions Government Ministers are unhelpful to you. I would simply like you to know that if you need to deal with disrespectful Ministers, you have our full support. The second matter is that, of course, some outside this place may not realise that your office is also one of high administrative function. Some concerns have been expressed on this side of the chamber about some administrative matters, which we intend to pursue, but I assure you that that will be done in a constructive way. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr President, you have displayed a fairness and a degree of discernment which is befitting the high office you hold. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, I am confident that the matters to which the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) referred will continue to be considered by you in the best interests of this institution, rather than otherwise. I note that in the press a number of pressures are being applied for substantial changes to procedures of the other place to be made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to those senators who have spoken-Senator Button, Senator Hill, Senator Powell, Senator Boswell, Senator Harradine and Senator Vallentine-for the remarks that they have made on this occasion. In reflecting on these remarks, I am conscious of the responsibilities of the office of President in this chamber and in the wider context in which a presiding officer is required to carry out these responsibilities. I also appreciate the standards of fairness which were set by my predecessors, and I shall strive to maintain these high standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the last Parliament there were a number of procedural highlights, which included the first revision of the Standing Orders since 1903; the third joint sitting of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament to fill a casual vacancy; the passing of the Parliamentary Privileges Act; the disqualification of a senator; consideration of electronic voting; the conduct of Question Time; and the televising of the Senate and its committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are making history with the first television coverage of these proceedings. There will undoubtedly be many more challenges and changes facing the Parliament. For example, during this session you will be involved in the most significant development in the role of the Senate committee system since it was established 20 years ago. The Senate has adopted new procedures for the reference of Bills to legislative and general purpose standing committees. It is envisaged that this will ease the pressures of the legislative program on the chamber's time and enable a closer examination of detailed provisions of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The past year has seen significant developments in the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. A major project to computerise Hansard operations has been undertaken. This project comes to fruition today when, for the first time, material for the Daily Hansard will be transmitted electronically to the Government Printer after having being processed within Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) about the administration of the Parliament. I can assure him that I will always consult with Opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of the unusually high number of new senators, I have made clear throughout my time as President that my door is always open and I welcome the opportunity to discuss matters of concern with all senators. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I again thank you for placing your trust in me. I will tackle the task with enthusiasm and in a way of which I trust honourable senators will approve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Colston on his election as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. As Senator Colston pointed out in his remarks, he has had 12 years service as Temporary Chairman of Committees, so in the Senate we are used to having him in the chair.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on behalf of Opposition senators, I also would like to congratulate Senator Colston on his election as Deputy President. We recognise his commitment to the committee system. We recognise that he has been a dedicated chairman, albeit one with whom we have disagreed on some occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to remind Senator Colston that he has a hard act to follow. David Hamer left a legacy of reforms as well as a record of dedication to the job. He also left a reputation of having been totally fair to all sides of the chamber, no matter what the circumstances. We wish Senator Colston well. The Opposition, of course, will seek to be constructive and helpful to him in the exercise of his duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I sit down, and without any disrespect to Senator Colston, I have to say that I am disappointed that the practice that has been adopted in recent years and that has worked so well is not to be continued. The way in which you, Mr President, and Senator Hamer were able to work together over the years, representing the two major parties in this chamber, demonstrated a responsibility to the Senate and to the institution of the Parliament that went beyond partisan politics. The way in which you worked together demonstrated that it could be done and helped you, Mr President, in what was spoken of this morning-that is, the somewhat difficult circumstance of managing the Senate with the numbers as they are at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I am disappointed that under their new leadership, the Australian Democrats have obviously decided to depart from the practice that they had previously followed. In some ways I guess it gives some credence to those who see them as simply slipping towards becoming yet another faction of the Australian Labor Party, perhaps replacing the somewhat discredited socialist left that has been corrupted by the spoils of office. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to say that this is not a one-sided expression of disappointment. I would have thought that the Australian Labor Party, as the party in government, would also recognise the value of having somebody from the Opposition as Deputy President, particularly in view of the experiences of recent years. Its members may be somewhat short-sighted in having reached the conclusion they reached in the last couple of days, but that was clearly a decision for them to make. Having expressed those sentiments of disappointment that the Senate will now be a different place, I would not like to be misunderstood. Senator Colston has our total support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on behalf of the Australian Democrats I congratulate Senator Colston on his election as Chairman of Committees and, indeed, as your Deputy in this place. Senator Colston remarked on his long term of office as a Temporary Chairman of Committees. In one respect, at least, we share something in common in that I lead a party whose presence here was for many years seen rather wishfully-on both sides-as possibly temporary. We have made it clear that we are not temporary any more. I must say, Senator Colston, that after your long years of experience as a Temporary Chairman, I congratulate you on not being temporary any longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have served as a Temporary Chairman of Committees on the same panel as Senator Colston and have benefited from his advice from time to time as, I believe, have many other temporary chairmen. I certainly wish him well in his term of office and wish you well, Mr President, in your relationship with Senator Colston in his role in the new Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In reply to Senator Hill's comment, I point out that times do change. The Senate does change. There are many changes here today-new faces and new appointments of many kinds. I think we can all choose to make those changes positive or negative. Certainly my colleagues and myself are determined that all of the changes today will be positives for this chamber, this Parliament and this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Colston on his election as Deputy President of the Senate. Senator Colston has, of course, a great deal of experience which will stand him in good stead in his new office. Apart from being a Temporary Chairman of Committees, he has been a chairman of an Estimates committee, a very difficult Estimates committee at that. I found him most fair and, indeed, not so much an embarrassment to the Government as a champion of the rights of senators to exercise their function of audit and control over executive government decisions and executive government expenditure. As such, I feel that that will stand him in good stead in his position as Deputy President. He is a fair man, and I expect that that fairness will carry on to his position as Deputy President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mention has been made about former Senator David Hamer, his predecessor. David Hamer made a number of proposals, but those proposals did not quite get up until it was time for him to depart this chamber. Senator Colston's job is not going to be easy because the new committee system, whereby Bills are to be referred to standing committees of the Senate, will be a real test for the Chairman of Committees-that is to say Senator Colston, the Deputy President. He will need the support of all honourable senators, including government senators, to ensure that that committee system works and that there is money to ensure that it works. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to commiserate with Senator Crichton-Browne. Of all of us, Senator Crichton-Browne has been the defender of this institution. He has spent a great deal of time and effort on that, for which we are very grateful. I personally hope that he will continue to maintain his very vigorous stance, a proper one I might add, in the defence of this institution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 19 August 1990, of the Honourable James Luke Cavanagh, a senator for the State of South Australia from 1962 to 1981, Minister for Works from 1972 to 1973, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1973 to 1975 and Minister for Police and Customs in 1975 places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, Jim Cavanagh was born on 21 June 1913 in Paddington, South Australia, and educated at the Dominican Sisters School in Adelaide. From 1945 to 1962 he was Secretary of the Plasterers Society of South Australia, and from 1960 to 1962 was Commissioner of the Board of Industry of South Australia. He was elected to the Federal Parliament as senator for South Australia in 1962 and served in that position until 1981. During his time in Federal Parliament he held a number of portfolios. He was Minister for Works from 1972 to 1973, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1973 to 1975, and Minister for Police and Customs in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> If I might just indulge in a very brief personal reminiscence of Jim Cavanagh, I must say that all those who were senators during his time, or during part of the time in which he was a senator and Minister, will recall him as a keen and vigorous debater in this place, a zealous student of the Standing Orders, and a man of considerable intelligence who, as a Minister and debater in the Senate, was always a very cool person, not easily rattled. I think his contribution to the Senate in terms of being a vigorous debater will be characterised for all of us by his gravelly voice, which remains memorable, I think, to everyone who was here at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think most senators who were here in his day will share those reminiscences of him and share reminiscences of him as a man of considerable integrity. He certainly made a distinguished contribution to Australia during his time in office and, on behalf of the Government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA> I, of course, did not know him personally, as I came into the Senate at the same time as he retired. But it is interesting that a number of my colleagues in the years during which I have been here have said to me that his skills as a debater and his use of the Standing Orders, which have been mentioned, would be a good training ground for anyone who wishes to practice the art of politics in this place effectively. There are many who have said to me that if Jim Cavanagh had had the opportunity of education that so many of us who have come in here in more recent times have had, he could have achieved practically anything in politics. But, even having said that, I acknowledge that his record was one of great credit to him. </PARA>
<PARA> He obviously also was clearly a man of compassion. Not only do I know that from the work he did in relation to Aboriginal Affairs, of which I have read, but it can be seen simply by reference to his final speech in this place, when he quoted from the words of Henry Lawson. I remind the Senate of it, because it certainly demonstrates the style of the man. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate the Australian Democrats, also, with the offering of condolences to former Senator Cavanagh's family, and also to note his contribution to the welfare and progress of Australia. Like Senator Hill, I never knew Senator Cavanagh personally, but, as a South Australian, I certainly knew of him. It has already been noted that he came from a working class background, but certainly rose to the very high office of holding a number of very important portfolios in the Senate of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Button said, he was born in 1913 and he had a long career as a plasterer and also in the Plasterers' Union and in the Australian Labor Party before being elected to the Senate in 1961. He took his seat in 1962. I note also that he was a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Whitlam Government, when considerable improvements were begun in the welfare of the original Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who have not been in parliament themselves or closely associated with someone in the Australian Parliament have very little idea, I believe, of the sacrifices made, both at the personal level and at the level of the family, in order to advance those matters of principle in which many of us believe and which many of us hold very important. Senator Cavanagh and his family clearly made very significant sacrifices over a very extended period of time-as we have already heard, 19 years. We are the inheritors and beneficiaries of the work of those who have gone before-people such as Senator Cavanagh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as a South Australian representative of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber and as a friend of Jim Cavanagh's for over 20 years, it is my sad duty to associate myself with this motion of condolence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jim Cavanagh left school at the age of 14 and worked as a plasterer throughout the Depression. He first became involved in politics through the League against War and Fascism, a prominent prewar pacifist group. He actively supported the campaign against Franco during the Spanish Civil War, as far as his pacifism would allow. During the Second World War he continued working as a plasterer, becoming Secretary of his union the year the war ended. Like his father before him, he became a leader of the progressive forces within the South Australian Trades Hall and, at the same time, gained the reputation as an excellent debater and a fearsome advocate before the industrial court. This training held him in good stead during his time as a senator, and he was proud of his ability to match and often master those he referred to as the `legal eagles'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has canvassed the many achievements of Jim Cavanagh in public life and I do not intend to repeat them. I would like, however, to make some brief comments about his career. From the very outset he demonstrated a deep and genuine concern for the needy and underprivileged, and a streak of radicalism which often disturbed the more conservative in this chamber. In his maiden speech he condemned the McCarthyist-style campaign which had been directed against him in the 1961 election and he also defended the right of workers at a Port Pirie smelter to a decent standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> His principles showed themselves in a number of different ways. For example, he attended an anti-Vietnam rally instead of a parliamentary lunch in honour of Lyndon Johnson. It was as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that he was in his element-a job where he could directly assist one of our society's most underprivileged groups. He was always a quiet man, but no person who ever came into contact with him could question his deep commitment to the Labor movement and to those people it was created to protect. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim represented one of the finest traditions of the Labor Party: a tough, uncompromising and unashamedly progressive trade unionist who spent a lifetime in the Labor movement fighting for the rights of workers and for any who needed to have their rights defended-fighting often hard and bloody battles with all the money and power ranged on the other side. On his retirement he was described as one of the last old style Labor warriors of the Left. It was a war of sorts and Jim Cavanagh, for all his pacifism, was well-known as one of the heartiest fighters it produced. He will be missed. My condolences and those of former senators Reg Bishop, Arnold Drury, Jim Toohey, Don Cameron and Geoff McLaren, go to Jim's family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to associate myself with this condolence motion. Those of us who were in this chamber when Jim Cavanagh was also here will realise that in fact his forte in the chamber was his contributions during the committee stages of the debate, when, often to the annoyance of his own side, he would constantly pressurise and question Ministers about particular clauses of legislation. I do hope, incidentally, that when this new committee system commences to operate full consideration will be given to the rights of individual senators to continue to do that in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that regard he was a very independent minded person and he was able, on a number of occasions which we recall, not to trip up but to have Ministers rather flabbergasted and searching for words to explain the meanings of particular clauses in legislation. He was certainly missed when he left this chamber-there is no doubt about that. I would like also to convey my condolences, through you, Mr President, and through the Senate, to the family of Jim Cavanagh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President I wish to be associated with the motion of Senator Button in relation to the death of former Senator Cavanagh. He was a person whom I held in high regard and for whom I had a great deal of respect. His association with me developed on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I draw to the attention of the Senate the final two paragraphs of my report as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in June of 1981, when I was the Chairman and he was the retiring Deputy Chairman. I said then:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 30 June 1981, Senator the Hon. J. L. Cavanagh will retire from the Senate and consequently from his position as Deputy Chairman of this Committee. Senator Cavanagh has been a member of the Committee for 12 of his 19 years as a Senator for South Australia. The Committee wishes to place on record its appreciation of the inestimable services of Senator Cavanagh to the Committee and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> His clear understanding of the operation and principles of the Committee, his profound knowledge of the principles of statutory interpretation, and his concern to ensure that there is no derogation of the law-making responsibilities of the Parliament have, in the Committee's view, been among the major features of his contribution to the Parliament as a whole, and through it to the people whom he has so ably represented for almost twenty years. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage I would like to confirm that since then those views that I expressed then have not changed in my mind. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee and this Parliament certainly have missed his wisdom, common sense and experiences. I recall that one of the first things he pointed out to me was the difficulties that I, as a government member of the Committee, would face in dealing with the members of my Executive because, as those who have served on that Committee would be well aware, the Government members are in an extremely difficult position in that they are going to their own Ministers and telling their Ministers to change the regulations that they made. He well appreciated the difficulties which Government members of that Committee had and then when we went into opposition I think I made it clear to Australian Labor Party members of that Committee that they would have similar difficulties and I am pleased to see that they have overcome them so well while in office. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that he was, as my friend Senator Archer said a few moments ago, a formidable foe, especially in this chamber; as Senator Harradine has mentioned, in committee stages of Bills he was likely to trip a Minister at any tick of the clock and especially Ministers who in the Senate were only representing a colleague in the other chamber. It was not uncommon for the debate on a Bill to be adjourned while that Minister went back and discussed with the Minister in the House of Representatives what changes should be made to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> He also, I might mention-and this is something that I think all new senators should be aware of-would regularly draw our attention to the need to ensure that laws were made by legislation rather than by regulation whenever it was possible because, as he pointed out to me when I first asked, `Why do you say that?', the problem is that we can only disallow a regulation whereas we can amend legislation. Let us say that someone came up with a schedule for, as an example, compensation for an injury and let us say it was $20,000 but the Government wanted to increase it to $30,000. But we wanted it to be $40,000. If the Government brought in a regulation increasing that amount to $30,000 all we could do would be to disallow it. We could never disallow an increase from $20,000 to $30,000 so we would be stuck with the regulation. Whereas if the Government did it by way of a schedule to the Bill then when it brought in the amendment to the schedule we could propose that it be $40,000 or some such thing. It is something that, unfortunately, far too often we overlook. </PARA>
<PARA> People used to ask, `How good would he have been if he had had legal training?'. Let me say that so far as statutory interpretation was concerned he could never have been better than he was. He was absolutely brilliant at understanding the meanings of words and notwithstanding the fact that he--</PARA>

In any event he was certainly brilliant, and if he had done a law course he may very well have been wealthier but he certainly would not have been any better at statutory interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might mention one personal matter and that is that I came into this place in December 1976 when both Houses were still suffering from the conflict between the then Government side and the Opposition side arising out of the events of 1975. There was some considerable anger expressed on the part of Labor members of parliament about the events of 1975, as honourable senators will recall and, as I discovered 12 months later, that conflict was still going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I arrived here in December 1976 and I ended up at some sort of Christmas function in the old Senate club room, with my wife. I walked in and I met a fellow who turned out to be Georgie Georges. I was talking to Georgie Georges and he said, `Sit here', and I sat there. After a while-and I did not appreciate it, but with hindsight I now realise I was sitting in a faction of the left wing of the Labor Party-this fellow, whom I later came to know was Jim Cavanagh, started to talk to me. Then I saw him turn to someone and he said, `Who is this bloke?'. After all, I had only been there about two days. Someone then told him, and Jim said, `Bloody Liberal', and he turned his back on me and we did not have another word that night. But later, after serving with him for many years and admiring and respecting him, we counted each other as friends at the end. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support this condolence motion for Jim Cavanagh. As a former secretary of the Australian Labor Party in South Australia and assistant secretary and official for nearly 15 years, I knew Jim Cavanagh through the Labor Party. I never, of course, had the opportunity to serve in the Senate with him, but I knew him through the Labor Party and through his contributions to the Party and the community in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jim Cavanagh could be described very clearly within South Australian Labor Party terms as a working-class hero; or, to use that other phrase that has occasionally been used, Jim Cavanagh deserved the description of being the cream of the working class-certainly as I would describe it.</PARA>
<PARA> The remarkable thing about Jim Cavanagh, which other members have alluded to, is that he had a very poor formal education, and yet I have never seen a person debate better in the forums of the Labor Party in South Australia. Once one got used to the gravelly voice and the slow delivery, one realised that the substance of what he was saying was usually compelling and overwhelming. Though I occasionally disagreed with Jim Cavanagh, as we all disagree from time to time in politics, in debate within the Party I respected absolutely his view and his integrity. I remember one occasion when I was the minute secretary for a State convention. Someone had moved the gag resolution and I had missed who it was, so I looked round and saw Jim Cavanagh sitting there and I just wrote his name in the minutes. At the beginning of the next session he stood up and very simply said, `I see the minutes have said I moved the gag motion. It is wrong. I have never moved a gag motion in my life and I never will. I do not believe in gagging debate in the Labor Party'. It was a salient point to me, to my own embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that should be remembered about Jim is that in the late forties and early fifties, when he was secretary of the Plasterers Union in South Australia, he represented workers at Woomera. He was refused entry to Woomera because he was considered a security risk by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I always think it is one of the great ironies of democracy in Australia that in the Whitlam Government he became Minister for the Federal Police and in charge of the security arrangements of such places as Woomera. It is an absolute insult to Jim Cavanagh's integrity that anybody could believe that he could be a security risk for Australia. It was a marvellous outcome that in the end he became a Minister of the Crown and a Minister in charge of security at Woomera. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim had an utter commitment, an absolute commitment, to the underdog. That took him at times into strange alliances. Though Jim was a very committed trade union official in South Australia, within the Labor Party in South Australia we had a system of voting called the `card vote', which gave a preponderance of voting strength to the trade unions of which Jim was a part, yet for 30 years in the Labor Party he consistently argued against the system of the card vote because he believed it gave too much power to too few people, including himself. He did not believe that that was the best way the Party should run. It was interesting that when he made those points many of his union colleagues never heckled, never argued with him, and that was because of their respect for his view and his standing. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pass on my sympathy to Jim's family. It is with regret that I will not be able to attend his funeral on Thursday because of commitments I have as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, but I certainly will take the opportunity to express personally to his family the fact that in my view Jim Cavanagh was one of the half-dozen great Labor members South Australia has produced in 100 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very sad to learn of the death of Jim Cavanagh. Jim was a veteran in the Parliament when I arrived in this chamber following the 1975 Federal election. In those days the Liberal-Country Party coalition had a majority in the Senate. It was therefore quite valuable for Labor members to be able to fall back on the experience of people like Jim Cavanagh. I was always impressed with his detailed knowledge of Bills which came before this chamber. Had he been given the educational opportunities now available to many young people, he would have been one of our leading lawyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can remember vividly one occasion on which I was speaking to what I thought was an unacceptable piece of government legislation-and I hasten to add that it was of the Fraser Government. A note suddenly appeared before me telling me to `wind up', and dutifully I did so. Jim leaned back from his seat in front of me and said, `You'll get lots of notes like that in this place. My advice is to ignore them'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleagues by expressing my condolences. Jim Cavanagh was one of the old school of the Labor Party. My greatest memories of him were of a continual sparring between him and Reg Wright. Jim was a bush lawyer, as he called himself, but he was certainly equal to Reg, who had all the qualifications under the sun-and equal to him on so many occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We could always be sure, when a Bill came before the Senate, that both Jim and Reg had done their homework on it well. As Senator Harradine said, they both excelled at the committee stages, and when they both left we missed them very much. We found that many Bills were never dealt with as thoroughly as had been done by them previously.</PARA>
<PARA> For some reason or other, Jim and I became quite friendly, and I recall one amusing incident. One night very late, after a prolonged debate, Wally Lee, our old transport officer, said to Jim and me, `Come on, get in that car, you're both going in the same direction'. It happened to be a Mercedes, and Jim said, `I'm not getting in any capitalist car'. The next car was a Holden, and I said, `Oh, come on, just try it for once'. Anyway, I persuaded Jim to try the Merc. Half-way home we had an accident which swirled the car right round. Jim got off scot-free and I had a couple of fractured ribs. Jim always blamed me for the accident and I assured him that if we had been in the Holden we would have both been written off.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would simply like to add my remarks to those of my colleagues on the death of a South Australian senator, Jim Cavanagh. When I came into Parliament in 1983, Jim Cavanagh had been retired for two years and he featured, along with a number of other retired senators, in many of the stories that were then told about that time and particularly about times past. Indeed, it is probably a line I can offer to many senators today: it is the role of new senators to listen to the stories told and retold, often quite differently, about the events and the particular heroes or villains from times past. So I would have to say that when I came into the Senate Jim Cavanagh, in his own lifetime, had become the stuff of myth and legend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In reading about the man, I am particularly struck about his closing comments in the Senate when he referred to his own lack of formal education. There are two things I would like to say about that: firstly, many Australians of Jim Cavanagh's age did not have access to a formal education and were never able to develop their full potential. As has been said many times already, Jim Cavanagh was one of those people who argued passionately for the rights of the poor and the workers in Australia, not only from his own experience but also from his lifelong commitment to establishing those rights for people. Secondly, notwithstanding his lack of formal education, Jim Cavanagh succeeded splendidly. His lack of formal education did not, in the end, restrict him-at least in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think we can say fairly that the challenge of lack of formal education, coupled with considerable intelligence, did mean restricted opportunities for many people. I am pleased that the Australian Labor Party provided one path of opportunity for Jim Cavanagh to make his considerable contribution in this place on behalf of ordinary Australians. I join in messages of sympathy to his family. </PARA>

I admit that he did have a great knowledge, but I must say that I think it was his interpretation of the Standing Orders that at times kept the Senate tied up for long periods, which is a very good tactic when in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will just recall a personal story: I had been a member of the Senate for approximately six months. I went to Jim Cavanagh and said, `Jim, I would like some advice. I find the time in the chamber when you are in opposition pretty boring, and I find the committee work very stimulating. What should I do about that?'. He said, `Well, you should put forward a notice of motion to change the Standing Orders so that can take place'. So I did that. When it came up for debate, of course, the first person on his feet to completely demolish my argument was Senator Jim Cavanagh. He then went on to lecture me about how the voters sent me here to sit in the chamber and not to sit down in committee meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim Cavanagh did have a very strong belief that he should spend as much time as possible in the chamber. I think that is one of the reasons why he became such a formidable debater in this chamber. He will be sadly missed, particularly by the Australian Labor Party in South Australia.

Those who remember the history of Federal politics of 1975 would be aware of the way in which I was involved in the Queensland Parliament's selection of a replacement for Senator Bert Milliner, who died on 30 June of that year. That casual vacancy was filled by Mr Albert Patrick Field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to speak in any detail today about the controversy of Mr Field's appointment. Enough has been said and written about that particular event. Nor do I intend to comment today on any aspect of Pat Field's acceptance of the Queensland Parliament's nomination. I have decided on that course of action for two reasons. Firstly, I believe in the old dictum de mortuis nil nisi bonum: Do not speak ill of the dead. In saying that, I do not imply that under other circumstances I would speak ill of Mr Field. That would not be my style. Secondly, if there were a villain in Pat Field's appointment, it was not Mr Field himself but a group which had no care for the political conventions of the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall, however, make some remarks about the consequences of Mr Field's appointment. To some extent the consequences were also the result of Mr Bunton's replacement of the retired Senator Murphy. Whichever appointment was the principal catalyst, however, less than two years after Mr Field came to this place by way of the Queensland Parliament, the people of Australia approved three changes to the Australian Constitution. The aim of one of these changes was to alter section 15 to ensure that Senate casual vacancies are filled by persons of the same political party as that represented by the deceased or resigned senator. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the changes made to section 15 of the Constitution did not go far enough. This became quite evident after Senator Grimes resigned and our colleague Senator Devereux, then Mr Devereux, was nominated by the Australian Labor Party to take his place. Stalling tactics in the Tasmanian Parliament delayed Senator Devereux's entry into this chamber until the election following the double dissolution of 1987. Preventing a situation like that occurring again is a matter which must be addressed if Australia makes further changes to its Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, for some, death is mercifully swift. For others, death occurs only after a long period of suffering. Mr Field did, in fact, have an enduring illness and we can only be saddened at the tragic way in which he died. Although his name will feature in future histories of the Federal Parliament, particularly in relation to the controversial circumstances of his appointment, Mr Field, the man, is now at peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly to associate the Australian Democrats with the condolence motion for Albert Patrick Field. The particular circumstances to which reference has already been made occurred before all of us were in the Senate and certainly before even the Australian Democrats were thought of as a party, so we cannot comment on that. It is indeed sad that a person who has been elevated to the high office of senator should pass on. As Senator Colston has pointed out, and from my understanding of newspaper accounts, former Senator Field suffered a considerable disability for quite some time before he died and that is, indeed, very sad.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the following petition, from 170 citizens, which is not in conformity with Standing Orders as it is not in the correct form:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We the undersigned concerned citizens, wish to bring to your notice our dissatisfaction with the present legislation pertaining to the Family Law Act. Whilst the Act, as it stands might make divorce easier, child custody has become another `possession', along with property settlement on the matrimonial battleground.</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act concerns all citizens, and society as a whole has a responsibility to ensure that children caught between this conflict are not socially deprived of equal access to both parents wherever possible, a human right necessary for normal childhood development.</PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that the Family Law Act as it stands, frustrates and antagonises many people into violence. Research suggests that as high as one quarter of all murder victims in Australia are killed by a family member. This fact alone is a telling sign of the inadequacies of the present enactment. Further to this, it is all too easy for one partner to make allegations that a child of the marriage has been sexually abused by the estranged partner. American studies have shown that a high percentage of these alleged abuses do not occur.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we request that representations be made on our behalf to bring to the notice of the legislature our dissatisfaction of the Family Law legislation and further request urgent action be taken to address a totally unacceptable situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I reiterate for Senator Harradine that this motion is necessary because we are suspending the sitting for dinner half an hour earlier and then going to the Budget at 7.30 p.m. The normal practice in the Senate is to adjourn after the Budget. We have been tied up with so many formalities today, and I have had an indication that there will be eight speakers in the debate on the motion that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, will move on the Iraqi and the Gulf situation in a couple of minutes time. That leads me to believe that we will finish at about 10 o'clock. The Government has no desire to go past 10.30 tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I seek leave for the speech on the Gulf crisis to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker</PARA>
<PARA> In moving this resolution today I want to take this first opportunity available to me to inform the House of the view the Government has taken of the situation which has arisen in the Middle East over the past three weeks, and of the measures which we have adopted to meet that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 August Iraq invaded Kuwait. That action has provoked one of the gravest international crises since the Second World War; and it has challenged us to define the way in which the world community will cooperate in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few years the frightening rigidities of the cold war have dissolved, and the threat of global war between the superpowers has receded. The task for all of us has been to construct a new world order which will guarantee that the end of the cold war will bring an era of peace. That cannot be taken for granted. In the cold war, regional conflicts were contained by the care that each superpower took to avoid confrontation with the other. But now, as the threat of global war recedes, the risk of major regional wars may, paradoxically, have increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is a tragically clear proof of the new dangers which exist, just as those of the cold war thankfully fade into history. And those dangers are not unique to the Middle East. Wherever we find big armies, national rivalries and reckless leaders, we will find a risk of major war. It is not inconceivable that those conditions could emerge in the Asia-Pacific region in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA> We need therefore to work out how to manage these dangers wherever they may arise. In doing so we are casting back to the era before the cold war began; those twilight years of optimism between the end of the Second World War and the fall of the Iron Curtain. </PARA>
<PARA> We find ourselves looking again to the United Nations to uphold the rule of law as the principle of international relations, over the rule of force. The cold war often made the UN look impotent and irrelevant; but as the cold war fades, the UN has moved back to the position its founders intended for it. </PARA>
<PARA> In drafting the UN charter, the founders of the UN drew on their vivid and bitter experience of a world sliding into chaos: the failure of the League of Nations in Manchuria and Abyssinia; the appeasement of fascism in Europe; and the catastrophe that followed. </PARA>
<PARA> The world has changed a lot since 1945, but I think the lessons of the 1930s, which underpin the UN charter, still hold true today: that international disputes must not be settled by force; that national borders must be respected; and that those who use force must not be permitted to prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> Those lessons establish principles that engage our real, tangible interests, not just our sense of right and wrong. The security and prosperity of the world, and the security and prosperity of Australia, will depend in the years ahead on the strength of those principles. And the strength of those principles in the years ahead depends absolutely on the support we give them today. This is the broad framework within which the Government has considered Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and Australia's response. </PARA>
<PARA> Within that framework, Mr Speaker, Iraq's actions are cause for very deep concern. That concern arises from the nature of Iraq's leadership, from the capabilities of its armed forces, and from the nature of the Gulf region itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's Government has, over many years, proved that it is willing and even eager to use armed force to achieve its national goals; and that those goals encompass nothing less than the domination of all its neighbours-Iranian as well as Arab-and the accumulation of greater and greater power at the expense of them. Any who doubt that analysis of Iraqi intentions should ask Iraq's neighbours themselves, in the Gulf and in the Middle East generally. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Iraqi Government's ambition has been matched by its ruthlessness-including to its own citizens. In the war with Iran it inflicted years of suffering and hundreds of thousands of casualties on the people of Iraq, for a few miles of ground that it has now surrendered. And in Kurdistan the Iraqi Government gassed its own people. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government of Iraq is not only very ruthless and very ambitious; it is also very powerful. It has one of the largest armies in the world, well-equipped and battle-hardened, and a large airforce. It has a large force of ballistic missiles, a massive chemical arsenal, and a program to develop nuclear weapons within a few years. That power is based on oil. The Gulf remains the hub of the world oil market. Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia alone hold nearly half of the world's oil reserves. That is a very important aspect of this situation, for two reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is that Iraq's power would increase dramatically if it could control Kuwait's oil assets, and even more if it controlled Saudi Arabia's. With increasing power would come increasing ambition, making Iraq even more dangerous than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is that any nation which controlled the oil industries of Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia would be able to dictate oil prices. There can be no doubt what Iraq's pricing policy would be; and there can be no doubt what that would mean for the world's economy-and for Australia's. We may be a net energy exporter, but we import oil, and the markets for our exports depend absolutely critically on the economies of our customers. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to go into the merits of Iraq's grievances against Kuwait, nor of its claims to Kuwait's territory. They are irrelevant to the current case; because no matter how strong those claims might be, there can be no justification for asserting them by armed force. As I emphasised to the Iraqi Ambassador when he called on me yesterday, if Iraq does have grievances they should be addressed through proper, internationally recognised and peaceful procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I want to turn now to review the steps taken by Australia and by the world community to meet the challenge posed by Iraq's actions. The Government has condemned the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in the most direct terms. The Opposition has done the same, and I welcome that. I hope that the Parliament, speaking as it does in a very special way for all Australians, will express its condemnation through the resolution we are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the vast majority of Australians agree in condemning Iraq's invasion is important. But how much more important is it that governments and people all over the world have felt the same concern, and expressed the same condemnation?</PARA>
<PARA> That vital consensus has been reflected in the UN, where the Security Council has not only been able, promptly and unanimously, to pass resolutions condemning the invasion. It has also been able, for the first time, to go beyond that to adopt mandatory and comprehensive economic sanctions designed to compel an Iraqi withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is committed to implementing those sanctions with full rigour. That will not be without cost; Iraq has been a major export market for Australia. But we have no choice; economic sanctions are an essential element of the international effort to restore peace and stability to the Middle East. The economic and security costs of shirking that responsibility are much greater than the costs of the sanctions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> But the sanctions will not do the job by themselves. They will act, slowly but surely, to force Iraq to give up Kuwait. In the short term, however, there has been an urgent need to deter Iraq from taking even more territory. In the days after its invasion of Kuwait, Iraq built up huge forces on the border with Saudi Arabia. All the evidence pointed to a plan to invade Saudi Arabia and seize the Saudi oilfields which lie close to Kuwait on the shores of the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> To respond to that very rapidly emerging threat, it was necessary to act quickly. At the request of Saudi Arabia, the US deployed forces swiftly to deter further Iraqi aggression. After an historic meeting of the Arab summit other Arab states quickly followed, providing forces of their own to help defend Saudi Arabia from Iraq, and endorsing the US contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> This operation appears to have succeeded in deterring an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia, and those involved deserve credit for it. I want to be absolutely clear about this-in the absence of such action I believe it highly likely that we would be faced now not with a military stand-off, deeply worrying and dangerous though that is, but with actual hostilities; not to mince words-war. </PARA>
<PARA> And this action has therefore provided a framework in which sanctions can do their work. But to be effective the sanctions also need to be enforced. It is at this point that I want now to describe the decisions the Government has taken in deploying ships of the RAN to the Gulf region. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this has been a very serious decision. I have left it up till this point in my statement today because I have wanted to place our decisions in the context in which we made them; that is, in the light of our assessments of the broader international framework, of the particular characteristics of the Iraqi regime and of the Gulf region, and of the significance of all of these for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia values its alliances, but we recognise that increasingly we will have to look to our own security. As a self-reliant country, we may need to depend more and more in the years ahead on the principles of the UN charter to protect our interests. So we are not sending ships to the Gulf region to serve our allies; we are going to protect the international rule of law which will be vital to our security, however our alliances may develop in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> After carefully assessing Australia's interests, the nature of the job to be done, and our ability to do it, the Government decided to deploy two guided missile frigates and one replenishment oiler to participate in the enforcement of the UN embargo against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other nations have reached or are considering the same decision. So far the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada and the Netherlands have announced that they will deploy ships to act in support of the embargo against Iraq: while Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Spain, Belgium and Portugal are considering what role they can play. </PARA>
<PARA> In joining this group, Australia is acting within the UN charter to assist Kuwait-at its specific request-to exercise its right of selfdefence, under article 51, through implementation of the UN economic sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> Like most members of the group, Australia believes that the establishment of a UN force acting under the UN flag as provided for explicitly by article 42 of the UN charter would be the best framework for enforcement of the UN's economic sanctions, and we are working hard to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is as well a number of alternative mechanisms available under the UN umbrella to enhance direct UN involvement in the operation of the force. These are being explored. But we believe that the interests of the UN itself, as well as the dynamics of the situation in the Gulf, require that we work within the very clear legal framework provided by article 51 until these issues have been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that to refuse to participate unless a fully-fledged UN force was established would make it less likely that such a force would be established, and more likely that the economic sanctions, and the UN itself, would fail in meeting Iraq's aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> Our ships are being sent to the Gulf region with a clear mission to assist in enforcing economic sanctions. The Government has defined the way in which our ships will operate in fulfilling that mission-identification, contact, interrogation and warning-and discussions are now under way with other participants to establish coordination procedures and areas of operations. The operational roles of our ships will be reviewed if necessary to ensure that they meet the aim of the deployment, but our discussions so far have confirmed that their current roles will allow them to fulfil their mission with a sensible minimum of force. Any change to the role proposed for the Australian ships would necessarily involve the widest possible consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it quite clear here that our ships are not being sent to the Gulf region to attack Iraq. They will engage Iraqi armed forces only in self-defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Our ships are well-suited to the role we are asking them to fulfil. They are the most modern ships in our fleet, equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and sensor systems, and manned by crews that are as good as any in the world. The same type of ships are serving with the US Navy in the Gulf region at the moment, on similar tasks to those our ships will perform. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, we must acknowledge that the deployment of ships is not without danger, and this has been reflected in the conditions of service for personnel on the deployment which were approved by Cabinet last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from this deployment in support of the UN sanctions, the Government will continue to pursue diplomatic approaches to the problems in the Gulf. We do not seek conflict-absolutely the opposite. We will support any constructive diplomatic effort to resolve the crisis. But that cannot be through turning a blind eye to aggression, and it cannot succeed without the maintenance of pressure on Iraq. Our Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, will leave tomorrow for Europe where he will consult the Chairman of the Economic Community before visiting Cairo, New York and Washington for discussions on the crisis, returning to brief Cabinet before the end of next week. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, it is of course difficult to say how the crisis in the Gulf will develop from here. Logic should dictate that the Iraqi regime-recognising that it has aroused the anger of the whole world, that it will not be allowed to succeed, and that it will pay a high penalty for its adventurism-should withdraw from Kuwait and allow the restoration of the legitimate government there. The Government earnestly hopes that that might happen, and happen soon. But the behaviour of Iraq's Government gives no ground for optimism. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we are all appalled by the actions of Iraq's Government in detaining foreign nationals-including Australians-against their will, and in particular the contemptible practice of placing them as human shields around Iraq's arsenal of offensive weapons. In the language of the resolution, this is an outrage against all the norms of international law, international conduct and human decency. Any mistreatment of these people will be a stain on Iraq's Government for ever. </PARA>
<PARA> About 150 Australians are among those being held in Iraq and Kuwait against their will. The Government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in cooperation with our friends, is doing all it can to help and advise these people. We cannot simply, by some action of our own, restore their freedom. But we can and will take every action open to us-consistent with our principles-to persuade the Government of Iraq to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The only solution to the crisis created by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and to release all foreign nationals. We hope that will happen, but we cannot assume that it will happen soon. The embargo will take time to work. It would be wrong of me to hold out hope of an early breakthrough. What we need is clarity of purpose, and firm resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, before concluding I want to make it plain that the Government does not condemn the people of Iraq. We condemn the actions of their Government. The peoples of Australia and Iraq are not inherently hostile to each other. There remains at this fundamental level the basis for cooperation once the present crisis is satisfactorily resolved. The responsibility for resolving the crisis lies totally in the hands of those who brought it about-the Government of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The language of the resolution which the Government proposes be adopted by the Parliament is crystal clear. It embodies in plain terms all the elements of attitude and approach to the crisis which I have described as being appropriate for Australia. It reflects our convictions as a people and our interests as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is geographically distant from the crisis. But our interests are real and they are important. We have a real stake in supporting proper norms of international behaviour between nations in the post cold war world which is emerging. We have a real stake in doing what we can to prevent the Middle East from being engulfed in a widening conflict. We have a real stake in the affairs of a region which provides the vast bulk of one of the commodities most vital to the health of the international economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy must continue to be governed by a clear-headed recognition of those interests and by careful and responsible consideration of the means open to us to protect them. The adoption by the Parliament of this resolution will send a valuable signal-a signal of clarity and of firmness in Australia's attitude and approach to this extremely important issue. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in Senate (Senator Button). We have agreed that the speech be incorporated because of time constraints and because it has already been read in full in the other place by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter we are debating is of grave concern. There is probably no matter more serious for the Parliament to be considering than that of the decision of the Australian Government to send naval vessels into a hostile environment in support of interests that are vital to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What occurred earlier this month was an inexcusable invasion of Kuwait. There is no possible justification for what happened. There is no doubt that Iraq felt that it had suffered economically because of a lowering of oil prices by Kuwait and others and that there were disagreements over certain underground oil reserves. But in no way could that justify the invasion that occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, Iraq immediately became a threat to Saudi Arabia. There was a threat simply by the positioning of forces on the Saudi Arabia border. But there was also the very real chance that Saddam Hussein was going to go across the border into Saudi Arabia. As honourable senators will be well aware, the principal oil wells of Saudi Arabia are in the north-eastern region of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> If that had occurred-and it could have happened within a very short period-it would have put under Iraq's control half of the world's oil capacity. It would have given Iraq and Saddam Hussein the capacity to hold the industrialised world to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA> Even worse consequences would have been possible. Without wanting to be too speculative, one would have to wonder what would have been the reaction of Israel with so much of the Arab world coming under the control of the President of Iraq. If Israel had become involved, the chances are that others would also have been involved and the consequences would have been absolutely awful. In other words, what may have been seen in the first instance as a localised dispute could have very quickly got out of control, become a regional conflict and then perhaps an even wider conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The action which was taken by the United States of America, Britain and others, and then by the Australian Government has to be put in the context of Saddam Hussein's record. For months he had been making clear his goal of becoming the undisputed leader of the Arab world. The only language he knows is that of force. He demonstrated that in the invasion of Iran, in gassing his own people and in the summary execution of his opponents. A situation has developed in which a person with that record not only invaded Kuwait but potentially could invade the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia, with real economic and strategic consequences, we believe, for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In such circumstances we expected the Australian Government to act. We recognised the urgency and stressed that urgency to the Australian Government. We were pleased, therefore, that the Security Council acted as quickly as it did. A moment ago I mentioned the United States and Britain. We were pleased that they were so quickly willing to take action to enforce the embargo determined by the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances we said on 9 August that Australia and the Australian Government should not stand passively by but that we should look for ways in which we could constructively help our allies in what we believed was not only in their best interests but in ours as well. It might be remembered that we suggested to the Australian Government that it consider putting a proposal to the United States by which we could perhaps relieve United States ships on patrol in the Indian Ocean, to allow them in turn to be deployed in the Gulf area. In other words, without wanting to dictate-because that would not be proper with our sources of knowledge and intelligence-what Australia should do, we nevertheless said that our Government should be looking actively at a way in which we can assist. </PARA>
<PARA>Sittings of the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Middle East</PARA>
<PARA> The following day, 10 August, the Prime Minister made the statement of his determination to send three naval vessels to the Gulf. We said that we supported that decision and in supporting this motion today we are again demonstrating that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, from the outset we said of his statement that there was a lack of clarity in what he was seeking of the Australian naval involvement. Senators might remember that in his statement he said that there were a number of goals, a number of missions, for the Australian naval vessels. He said that, firstly, they were being sent to enforce the blockade. Secondly, he said that they would act as a deterrent and, thirdly, as I recall it, he said that they would have a role in helping to keep the sea lanes open. Our concern was the ambiguity of that. We immediately asked whether that meant that in some way the vessels would be linked with the forces that were already being formed in Saudi Arabia-the United States forces that were already taking up positions-because they in turn were there to help deter further aggression by Saddam into Saudi Arabia. Were we in fact sending our forces to play a part in that deterrent? That was unclear. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister was questioned on this at a press conference, he said that any further decision would be made in Australia at a subsequent time. But it seemed to us, on the information that was then available, that there would simply be one operation, that there would be one operational command and it was difficult for us to understand how, in circumstances that could deteriorate very rapidly, there would be the options open for an Australian captain of a vessel, who was under a unified operational command, to seek further instructions from Australia as to what he should do. This confusion caused us some concern and we asked the Government for further clarity. We did that, not in an effort in any way to undermine what the Government was doing, but because, as I said at the outset, the decision to send ships into a possible engagement of this kind is a grave one-one that we would want to support, but one which the Australian people have the right to understand in full and clear detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The position was of course not helped in one way in that a few days later, after a Cabinet meeting, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, went on to say that the role of the Australian vessels was not to enforce the boycott, as had been said by the Prime Minister, but rather to warn. This was not the function that had been clearly made apparent to the Australian people by the Prime Minister. We find that uncomfortable because clearly the Prime Minister had been liaising with President Bush. They had been on the telephone together, and it was immediately after the understandings had been reached and communicated by telephone that the Prime Minister had made his statement to the Australian public. As honourable senators will remember, he made it without Cabinet consultation. He has since told us he made it with the feeling of his Cabinet colleagues and yet, after a Cabinet meeting, Senator Evans announced a very much revised and reduced mission for these vessels. Presumably then Mr Hawke had to go back to President Bush and say that in fact what he had previously offered and undertaken had been subsequently revised. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that uncomfortable. We do not think that that is the way in which Australia should be operating its foreign policy, particularly when dealing with such grave matters as this. Of course there have been further instances since of some confusion in the Government's position and regrettably some undermining from within the Labor Party when different factions have advanced different views on whether or not Australia should be involved in this operation and, if so, what should be the limitations. As of yesterday we were even being told through the press that Caucus was of a view that any further engagement should first go to a Caucus resolution. We find that an astonishing concept in these circumstances of great danger-that the Prime Minister should in some way be restricted by having to call together Caucus and gain its consent before he can take any further action. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that this morning Caucus finally decided after faction meetings last night, led by Senator Evans, who I am pleased to hear will participate in this debate, that perhaps there was not wisdom in that idea and the Prime Minister was given due authority to act. We do not think that that process has been helpful because all it has done is encourage the Australian community to believe that what the Government has done is in fact questionable. We do not think it is questionable; we believe that its decision was correct. We do think it would have been much helped if the Prime Minister had called a Cabinet meeting first, determined the details of the commitment and put out a statement that did not have to be contradicted subsequently by Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> We further suggest, with respect, that it would have been constructively helpful in these circumstances if the Prime Minister had also consulted the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). This is not something that we often seek but, as I said earlier, in these grave circumstances that were being considered, it would have been more than a courtesy, it would have helped to engender the type of bipartisan attitude that is necessary to give confidence to those men whom we are sending off on this dangerous assignment. But the Prime Minister failed to do that and, interestingly, even right up until today he did not take any occasion to discuss any aspect with the Leader of the Opposition. I find that disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the motion that we will support today limits the Government's ability in some ways to act decisively in response to any future development. It restricts the role of our ships to that of identification, contact, interrogation and warning. In some ways this implies that there is parliamentary approval only for the actions specified in the resolution and if that implication is to be accepted we do believe that it is arguably unduly restrictive. We have supported the Government in good faith; we supported it in its original announcement of sanctions when it obviously accepted the mandatory sanctions that were then imposed by the United Nations Security Council; and we supported it when Mr Hawke made his announcement that naval vessels would be sent. We supported that even though we would have preferred to have had much more detail on such issues as the command structure, rules of engagement and operational control, the extent to which our vessels would be involved in the blockade, exactly what their role would be vis-a-vis American ships or other vessels and whether they would be in the Persian Gulf or outside it. In fact, as I understand it, today Mr Hawke has said that the ships will be stationed outside the Persian Gulf, which is the first time that I have heard of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has asked a lot of the Opposition in these circumstances and, despite the ambiguities, we have been prepared to support it. In other words, we would have preferred that the Government had not handled the matter in quite as muddled and confused a way and that the Labor Party had seen the urgency in fully supporting the Labor Government instead of coming out with its heavy ideological baggage of anti-United States, anti-Vietnam War type analogies, thereby sowing doubts, uncertainties and bewilderment in the community at the time when unity of purpose is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy President, there has, I guess, been one good thing that has come out of this crisis and that has been the extent to which the international community has been prepared to act as one to deter aggression-further aggression in this case. The reasonable unity of purpose of the super powers in some ways gives us hope for the future. The fact that the Security Council has been prepared to pass in a short timeframe two resolutions of a mandatory nature also gives us hope. We hope that the Australian Government will encourage a Security Council resolution to enforce the boycott. Perhaps Senator Evans will clarify that matter in his contribution, and tell us exactly what Australia's role is in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>We would prefer this force to be under United Nations auspices, even though we recognise that in the urgency I have outlined it was not possible. There was not time to wait for that resolution. Had we waited for that resolution we would still be waiting. The deterrent would not be in place, certainly as it is applied by the United States, and the consequences could have been horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, there is that hopeful sign that with the end of the Cold War perhaps the world is now moving into a new era of international cooperation if it can get past this immediate crisis. Our hope is that the concerted and speedy action by the international community has, in fact, put a hold on the developing crisis and has allowed time for a settlement to be negotiated. It seems to me that holding the line was what the international community was seeking to do. Now particularly it seems to me that Arab nations must play a part in looking for an Arab solution within the Arab world that can provide a long term settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst aspect of the whole tragedy is that of the hostages and the horrible way in which they are being used as pawns in this conflict. We feel great sympathy for the families of Australians and other hostages who must be existing currently in Iraq and Kuwait in circumstances of great fear. We trust that the Australian Government is doing everything within its capacity, both bilaterally through our powerful allies and through our friends in Arab countries who still have reasonable lines of communication with Saddam Hussein, to indicate that it is not too late to end what is becoming one of the worst experiences in international relations since the last war, that is, the using of innocent people as human shields in a conflict of this nature. I would appreciate hearing from Senator Evans in a definitive way what the Australian Government is doing to get Australians out of that predicament. I would also like Senator Evans to indicate that his Department is receiving the calls of the families and friends of these people and responding to them with the sympathy and sensitivity that they deserve, because there has been some suggestion from families to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not speak any further, because there are a number who wish to contribute to this debate. In conclusion, I repeat that we support the motion and the decisions that the Government has made. We regret that it has been developed as something of a muddle on its part and we hope that there will be greater clarity in purpose and application in the future in relation to this matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(5.14)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, the Australian Democrats welcome the opportunity that this motion provides for a parliamentary debate on the international crisis in the Gulf and, in particular, on the commitment of Australian troops in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion before us is a long one and encompasses the widest range of issues involved in the crisis in the Gulf. It begins by condemning the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and I wish to strongly associate the Australian Democrats with that condemnation and make it clear that anything further that I might have to say should not be construed in any other way other than in the context of a condemnation of that invasion. Indeed, that has been a starting point for us as it has been, I think, for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As the next part of the motion points out, there has been concern about threats to the territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia which have led to further actions. I have not seen evidence that such a threat was indeed as immediate or could be taken as given in the way that has been put both by our Government and by other governments around the world and used as a reason for a massive build-up of troops of an offensive nature. Certainly, the kind of invasion that has occurred in Kuwait is as strongly condemned by us as by the Government in the terms of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point in the motion calls upon Iraq to withdraw its forces unconditionally from Kuwait-again we would support such a call-and to facilitate the restoration of the legal government of Kuwait. I wish to point out that that government which was usurped in the invasion has itself a poor record when it comes to democracy. Indeed, it has a record of suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Kuwait itself. The Australian Democrats concur, of course, with calls upon Iraq, as set out in this second part of the motion, to respect the rights of foreign nationals. We must remember that it is not just Australians who are in that area, but also nationals of many other nations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point in the motion affirms the fundamental importance of the United Nations (UN) Charter as the basis for the conduct of international relations and the preservation of peace, an affirmation with which again we would want to strongly associate ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion also speaks of the vital principle of the sanctity of international borders. At this point, while not disagreeing with the point as stated, I believe that some questions do need to be asked, and I believe that this is one of the important aspects of being in a position to debate this issue here. The sanctity of international borders has not always been adhered to and we do not have to look very far into the past or very distant in global terms to see that. We were not faced with a similar motion in this place when, for instance, the United States-I quote here from Professor Fred Halladay from the London School of Economics-`engaged in an equally illegal invasion of Panama earlier this year'. There was no such call in this place for the sanctity of international borders on that occasion. We have to ask: what action did Australia take against the United States for subverting the independent state of Nicaragua for some eight years? We really need not ask what action this Government has taken against the illegal Indonesian invasion and the annexation of East Timor. We in this chamber have been party to the corollary of that action, or lack of action, again motivated by oil, where not only has this country not acted against that illegal invasion, but has actually colluded to the extent of signing a treaty with the perpetrators of that action in the interests of access by ourselves and Indonesia to the oil which rightfully belongs to the Timorese people. So the sanctity of international borders has not always been questioned when it has been violated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area in question, too, we need to look at Israel's occupation of Arab lands since 1967 and Turkey's occupation of northern Cyprus since 1974. Indeed, what action did the West take when in 1980 Iraq invaded Iran, another of its immediate neighbours? It is claimed that in fact that action was approved by many in the West. These double standards should not be allowed to occur again. The sanctity of those international borders should not be violated in this way. We simply want to put on the record the fact that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in that particular stance. Nevertheless, we do not oppose a call for that sanctity to be inviolate. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion moves on to welcome the unprecedented action of the United Nations in its condemnation of the invasion and in adopting mandatory and comprehensive sanctions against Iraq to force it to comply with the UN decision. Indeed, this has been the swiftest and strongest action taken, in terms of the economic sanctions applied extremely quickly and very broadly against Iraq following the invasion, and it is a measure of the way the situation in international relations has changed. Because there is now no longer an automatic use of the veto by the Soviet Union against proposed actions by the West, because there is cooperation, because there is glasnost, the UN has been able to act-a United Nations which many times in the past has suffered from the criticism that it had its hands tied behind its back. That is no longer the case. Things have changed and it is regrettable that one thing that has not changed has been the sort of response, the militaristic approach, which has been adopted again by the United States and, subsequently, by this nation upon a call from the United States rather than a willingness to allow the non-military option of sanctions and continuing diplomatic negotiations to have an effect in the Middle East. So, certainly, with those comments the Australian Democrats will support the fourth point in the motion.</PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the motion supports the Australian Government's prompt action to implement UN sanctions. To become involved in these tough economic sanctions against Iraq, following the invasion, was a strong action particularly by a country with such massive exports into that area. Indeed, I think we demonstrated by our immediate action as part of that United Nations sanction that we are committed to all of those points which precede this one in the Prime Minister's motion. It is regrettable, as I have said, that, having committed ourselves to a military course of action, in addition we have not permitted those non-military options an opportunity to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is at the next point that I diverge, on behalf of my Party, substantially from the motion and, indeed, I will move, as an amendment, to delete the next point from the motion. That point is:</PARA>
<PARA> ... the Senate ... supports ...</PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>the Government's decision to send ships of the RAN ... in enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq ... </PARA>
<PARA>As I have made clear, I think already, while agreeing with the other points so far in the motion, we cannot agree that this sort of action should have been taken. It is interesting to look at the Prime Minister's speech on this motion because right at the beginning of his speech he points out that he believes that this invasion of Kuwait by Iraq has challenged us-we, in the international community-to, `...define the way in which the world community will cooperate in the years ahead'. All I can say is that if this is a measure of world cooperation to come in the years ahead, then there is more a sense of deja vu, and that indeed we are not looking ahead. We have plenty of examples behind us, from the past. Indeed, there are many examples in history; there are bitter examples where the word cooperation has been used to mask what has indeed been confrontation and that is clearly what is happening here. The proposition that what we are doing now in the Middle East is defining the way that we will operate in the future and that for some reason because the Cold War is over there is now no deterrent on smaller nations from doing the sort of thing that Iraq has done, is quite a fraudulent approach in this particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, there are plenty of examples of the violation of territorial borders during the time in which the Cold War was still in operation and it is clear that that prospect that there was for some reason an urgent need in a military sense to deter Iraq from taking over more territory has not been proven. The motivation here is very much an economic motivation on behalf of a set of Western economies still very heavily dependent on oil. </PARA>
<PARA> The international rule of law is also referred to by the Prime Minister in his speech. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>We are going to protect the international rule of law . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The question is: who makes that international rule of law? The Australian Democrats believe that as with the economic sanctions, so in the event of any military intervention the United Nations is the appropriate body to enforce that sort of action and to implement, that sort of action. We place on record the fact that, should that have been the case, then we would see it appropriate for Australia to fulfil its international obligation under the flag of the United Nations. It is not accurate to say that there has been no action by the United Nations. A monitoring committee has been established under the same resolution which established the sanctions themselves, and that monitoring goes on. Again, to reiterate, should the United Nations feel that further action is needed, there is no impediment any more to that being a majority decision without a veto necessarily occurring in the Security Council. So that sending off of Australian troops is not supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, in his speech, points first to the fact that the vast majority of Australians agree to the condemning of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and, again I repeat, the Democrats share that view. But the Australian community is indeed divided on this very question-the question of a deployment of Australian forces. It is in that context that I think it is extremely unfortunate that the Prime Minister chose to make this decision without due process. It is a matter of wide concern in the community that the Prime Minister's decision was made in response to a call from the United States and without recourse even to the Cabinet, but with individual discussions with a small number of individual Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we get the processes right in this sort of situation. Should we be sending troops overseas? It is a matter of policy for the Australian Democrats and, indeed, for many years we have been putting forward a private member's Bill to require that the sending of troops overseas is only done by a decision of this Parliament, with an exception for a direct attack on our shores. This is important because of the very point that Senator Hill made when he said he regretted that there had been no direct prior consultation with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Senator Hill made the point that it is important when there is to be deployment of Australian forces overseas that there is a measure of community support for that. Indeed, we have a whole group of Australian service personnel who still suffer because that was not achieved-the Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Democrats oppose the deployment of troops in this situation at this time, and in this way, we certainly do not, in any way, condemn any of the individual members of the Australian armed forces whose duty it is to heed the call when it is made. We certainly hope that the Government will see that its action is wrong and will not finally send them to the Middle East. I am encouraged by the comment that perhaps they will not go right to the Gulf. I encourage the Government to keep them in Fremantle. But should they go, we certainly wish them a speedy return and no condemnation whatsoever for their actions as members of the Australian armed forces. The decision is the Government's decision. It is the Prime Minister's decision. We are saying that the process is wrong and that it is very important that due consultation as far as is possible, and as widely as possible, is undertaken and that the Parliament, as a representative of the people, should be involved in these sorts of situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion supports the continuing diplomatic efforts at the UN and elsewhere. I would stress that the militaristic action which has taken place, and of which we are a part, is an impediment to that continuing diplomatic effort. Quite obviously-this is perhaps the saddest part of what we are facing as a nation now-it is an impediment because the amassing of Western forces, of which we are now a part, creates additional tensions which make the job much more difficult. Of course, now we find that people have been placed in very direct danger in a quite scandalous and outrageous manner. We certainly support a call for a speedy resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> We very strongly support the sixth point, which expresses concern for Australians and, indeed, other innocent people, including the people of the Middle East, who will definitely suffer unless by some miracle there can be a very speedy and peaceful resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time that I have had to look at the Prime Minister's statement, I note that he made the point that Iraq is an extremely strong force in the Middle East and that, therefore, the sort of action that Australia is involved in is an appropriate response. I simply put the points that Iraq is certainly a very strong nation and that that strength, that military might, is a product of arms sales from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and from France, most of which occurred during the Cold War period as the East and the West competed for influence; and that this invasion provides compelling evidence of the urgent need for conventional force reduction and a great reduction in arms sales, particularly to repressive and aggressive regimes. The fact that Iraq has had easy access to arms supplies, given its appalling record in the human rights area and its military adventurism of the past, is really an outrage. It is now rebounding on the world at large. </PARA>
<PARA> From Australia's point of view, it is particularly shocking that our Government was in the middle of an $850,000 sale of engine components to the Iraqi air force, whose most notorious action was to kill 5,000 Kurds with chemical weapons in 1988. The export licence has since been revoked as part of the sanctions. But the questions remain: How was the sale authorised in the first place, and does the Government's professed policy of not selling arms to countries with poor human rights records mean anything at all?</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned by the appeal to nationalism that has been put forward in an attempt to win majority support for the sending of troops into this disturbed area, particularly by the Prime Minister. At the send off for the frigates in Sydney the Prime Minister accused those opposed to the deployment of forces of supporting appeasement. I consider that to be an extremely serious charge and I reject it outright. </PARA>
<PARA> The name of Adolf Hitler has been invoked in this debate. There is at least one fundamental difference between Hitler and Saddam Hussein, and that is the imposition of those sanctions. Unlike Hitler, Saddam has suffered the strongest and the toughest sanctions. There has been a cut-off of supplies of war materiels as well, an example of which I have just given. Saddam Hussein has very little domestic industry or resources from which he can compensate for the loss and yet, in that context, this non-military option has not been given an opportunity to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis in the Middle East has not been this Government's finest hour. The decision has been rash and unwarranted and does not measure up to the earlier speedy and honourable decision to be involved in the economic sanctions. The Government needs to change that decision. It was never a decision that came before the Australian people. It is a backward move in a time in the world's history when we have a chance to advance, given what has happened with regard to relations between the East and the West. It is a move which the Democrats deeply regret. Nevertheless, we support the terms of the motion, with the exception of the second point in the fifth section. Therefore I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out subparagraph (e)(xi). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In understanding why the world has reacted as it has to the events in the Middle East, in understanding why Australia has reacted as it has, and in understanding why it is that this Parliament should, hopefully unanimously, pass this motion today, I think it is very important to appreciate the very particular and very acute nature of the threat that Iraq's actions represent, not just to Australian interests but to the interests of this entire world. It is not an appeal to nationalism that I am about to make, Senator Powell; it is an appeal to internationalism, because the nature of the threat, and the nature of the challenge to the world order that has been posed by Iraq's behaviour, is of a very special and acute kind and one that really demands the international reaction that we have so far seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point can be very simply made. Iraq is not just any old power, any old regional power. Iraq is a country, although not with a large population, with an absolutely formidable military capability. There are over a million men under arms; another 800,000 people are part of a reservist legion; five and a half thousand tanks are at its ready disposal, and a significant air strike capability; there is a massive chemicals weapons capacity combined with a very significant ballistic missile capability; and, worse, a demonstrated willingness to use them. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has demonstrated a willingness to acquire nuclear capability just as fast as it possibly can. It has a military record of not only using chemical weapons against its external enemies and internal opponents, but also waging aggressive war-war against Iran that has cost already, on the best estimates, one million lives. It is a country that has demonstrated by its assault on Kuwait and by its threatened assault on Saudi Arabia that it simply does not begin to understand what international law or international morality is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell and some others have doubted the reality of that threat against Saudi Arabia. All I can say is that, on the best information available to me and to the Government and on the best information available to every other government, not only in the Western world but in the Arab world as well, that has reacted to these events, there was very little doubt in anyone's mind but that that willingness to act was there. The rapidity and size of the deployment of men and tanks against the Saudi border in the immediate aftermath of the Kuwaiti invasion and annexation were proof in themselves of that. </PARA>
<PARA> So, too, were the realities of oil in the Middle East. Senator Powell and others seem to regard it as just a little unprincipled, somehow, to even refer to this. But one has to refer to it to understand the nature of the temptation to which Iraq has been exposed and the nature of the havoc to and the devastation of the world order that would be posed were Iraq to succeed in its manifest ambition to gain a stranglehold on the kinds of oil supplies that we are talking about. Iraq itself sits on 10 per cent of the world's reserves. Kuwait sits on another 9.2 per cent. Saudi Arabia has fully 25.1 per cent of the world's reserves. Nearly half of all the oil reserves of the world, 45.3 per cent, is tied up in those three countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the three countries together have present production capability amounting to something like 20 per cent of the oil being pumped, or able to be pumped, out of the wells of the world. The capacity that that kind of control would create to manipulate prices and thereby the entire world economy is not something for passing or quizzical reference as just another demonstration of how greed or the enthusiasm for money or profiteering will move nations to behave in unacceptable ways. What we are talking about is a fundamental capacity and a demonstrated willingness to use that capacity, to hold the rest of the world to ransom. So it was crucially important that the world responded as it has. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the world has responded has reflected very much the nature of the interests that have been perceived to be at stake. As far as the world as a whole is concerned, what we are faced with here is, for all the reasons that I have described, a fundamental challenge to the world order-the kind of challenge that was mounted by Japan in invading Manchuria in 1931; the kind of challenge to the world order that was mounted by Italy in invading Abyssinia in the middle of the 1930s; the kind of challenge to the world order that was mounted by Hitler in his invasions and annexations in the latter 1930s in the immediate years before the Second World War-challenges which in each case were not responded to, challenges which in each case the League of Nations and all the rest of the apparatus at the time of the collective security conspicuously failed to be able to address, and challenges which, unmet as they were, produced the slide into chaos and world war that we saw. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not an exaggeration, for reasons that I have already outlined, to say that, unless the challenge is met on this occasion, we have the potential for that to happen all over again. Not least do we have the challenge of the precedent that it will represent as far as other significant regional powers are concerned worldwide. This is something we cannot afford to ignore-not just the particular situation in the Middle East and the exercise of regional power and authority there with worldwide significance, but the capability that already exists, that will continue to exist and that will have even greater capacity for exercise in a non-bipolar world of the future of existing regional powers with great relative regional strength. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we respond to this first example, as I have described it, of crisis management in the post-Cold War world by a demonstration of international reaction of a formidable and formidably effective kind, we are establishing a precedent of inaction that will be marked all too well by many other regional powers as circumstances, conditions and situations change in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is a direct and immediate Australian interest involved here-not just in Australia's capacity as a citizen of the world, not just in our capacity as a country in a region which we are concerned to keep inviolable, but as a nation in our own right with interests of our own, including economic interests. We have a very obvious economic interest, not only in being able to quickly restore our very large trade with this part of the world but also, of course, in avoiding the kind of devastating impact that manipulation of the world oil market will mean for us. People say that Australia is a net energy exporter, and therefore it will not hurt us. That is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of our dependence on a full range of resource commodities and the reality that, if there is a massive inflation and change in the world oil pricing scene, that will inevitably result in a slowdown of growth which will impact quite dramatically upon our economic capability and performance. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got interests, but the appeal that the Australian Government is making, the appeal internationally that the Australian Government is responding to, is not an appeal of immediate self-interest in that narrow sense; it is an appeal to principles of world order which it is crucially important that we apply. Senator Powell has drawn attention to some examples in the past when the world has not responded with similar unanimity to examples of aggression or annexations. Not all are examples which by any means fall remotely into the category in which she sought to put them, but maybe some of them did. Even if they did, surely the point is that failure to respond in the past cannot in itself be any kind of a credible reason for failing to respond now-not least in the particular circumstances which I have already described. </PARA>
<PARA> What is unique about this situation, and what is really unprecedented, is a naked example of a state attacking another state in circumstances where the great powers of the day have agreed on the guilt of the attacking state and agreed, moreover, on the kinds of measures that are needed to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia and many other countries have responded with criticism, with resolutions, and with expressions of outrage when some things like this have happened in the past. We have not been able to respond credibly or successfully because the great powers of the world have in the past been divided on these issues. On an occasion, in an atmosphere, and in an environment where the great powers of the world are united in their response, and where the cause is as manifestly just as this one is, for us not to respond would be, I believe, the Government believes, and, I am glad to hear, the Opposition believes, an abdication of our responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the response that has been mounted should be appreciated for the wide-ranging one that it has been. Not only have we had a series of United Nations resolutions of a fundamental and far-reaching kind, but we have also had a rapid, quick and far-reaching response from many countries of the world-not just simply to apply the UN sanctions in the way that they are required to do under the charter, but also to supply resources and materiel to put, in effect, their respective money where their mouths are. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had Canada, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and at least seven other European nations at the moment already responding with a supply of ships to the region. We have had, in the Arab world, the extraordinary, unprecedented and unexpected response of 12 out of the 20 Arab League nations voting to send a combined Arab force to the Gulf region to join with the Gulf Cooperation Council states and to join with the Saudis. The Egyptians have sent forces, the Moroccans have sent forces and the Syrians have sent forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Only three entities actually voted against that resolution: Iraq itself, Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The truth of the matter is that there has been an extraordinary degree of unanimity, not only in the Western world but in the Arab world itself. The most obvious way that that unanimity has expressed itself has, of course, been in the application of sanctions-the unanimous acceptance by the UN of the sanctions resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we have Senator Powell saying, `Why don't we just sit and wait for that sanctions resolution to take effect, to work itself out? Why don't we take note of the difference which exists now from the 1930s and the situation confronting Hitler when there was no such sanctions exercise of a kind which commanded anything like the unanimity that this one does?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that sanctions were tried in the 1930s and were conspicuously unsuccessful. The reason they were conspicuously unsuccessful was that there simply was not any commitment to back them up with effective enforcement. The truth of the matter is that these sanctions will be unsuccessful unless there is an effective backup of enforcement to demonstrate that. One can say that ships are not going to go into the Gulf region in breach and defiance of sanctions. That is absolute nonsense. They will unless and until there is some very good reason, in the case of ships from many nations, to stop them. </PARA>
<PARA> The insurers, to some extent, are stopping trade at the moment, but the insurance premiums are not flowing from the UN resolution as such. They are flowing from the fact that the region has been identified as a war zone as a result of the military presence that is already there. But we have already seen the reality that Iraqi tankers are not going to be stopped by a shot across the bows. In fact, I am advised that there are four Iraqi tankers now steaming towards the Port of Aden in the Yemen which, unless intercepted by the exercise of some appropriate military response, are going to off-load those cargoes and create in the process a precedent that will be well observed by many other countries that have only too many motivations to break the sanctions embargo in question. The truth of the matter is that sanctions will not work. Due to the nature of the dynamics of the real world we live in, they cannot work-unless there is an effective iron fist in that sanctions glove. That is what the exercise is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the UN has not specifically mandated, through resolutions of the United Nations Security Council or anything else, the exercise of military force. That is, nonetheless, justified by the principles of the United Nations. I have absolutely no doubt-and most international lawyers, certainly in the United States and other countries that are participating in the exercise, have no doubt-that the exercise of military force is mandated by article 51, the collective self-defence provision, of chapter 7 of the United Nations charter. This collective self-defence takes the form, under existing practice, principle and precedent, of allowing nations which are subject to attack-as Kuwait was in this instance-to call upon friendly countries to assist them in any way that is appropriate to deal with the consequences of that attack, to assist them by way of military retaliation; to assist them by way of economic retaliation; or, by extension, to assist them by way of military support for an exercise of economic retaliation. That is a separate, independent, acknowledged and freestanding justification for the exercise of the kind of force that is proposed to be exercised in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government acknowledges that it would be desirable were there to be a more explicit and direct UN Security Council mandate for this. We would prefer the whole military sanctions enforcement operation in the Gulf to be a blue flag, blue helmet United Nations operation. We have made that clear. We are being extraordinarily diplomatically active not only in New York but also in capitals of the major Security Council players to try to secure that result. That kind of pressure from Australia and other countries is, I hope and believe, beginning to bear fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that right now in the Security Council in New York a motion is being debated which would in fact give explicit Security Council endorsement for the kind of military enforcement of sanctions that I and the other participating nations in this naval exercise believe to be necessary. I hope that that will bear fruit. A great number of difficulties of a practical, political kind-not a principled kind-confront that. We can only wait and see what the outcome will be, but, certainly, Australia will be very actively pursuing that course. It is something that will be very much in the forefront of my preoccupations as I travel around the world in the next week discussing this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the Australian role needs to be specifically addressed. It was the subject of quite a substantial discussion by Senator Hill in his contribution. I simply make the point in reply that there is no confusion or ambiguity about the Australian response. The initial response to the proposal that we contribute our own resources to this exercise was necessarily of a rather generalised kind. It certainly had not been the subject of any detailed evaluation of the particular operational deployment role that we might be able to play, in particular the role that we might appropriately play in conjunction with other participating nations. The nature of the initial response and the initial announcement was simply in terms of Australian ships going to the area in support of a sanctions enforcement exercise. The nature of that support was left inexplicit. </PARA>
<PARA> Cabinet took a major step forward in making the nature of that involvement more explicit last Tuesday in saying that the role of the Australian ships, subject to further review in the light of still further consultations, would be one of identification, contact, interrogation, warning, plus, of course, the role of acting in self-defence were we to be subject to attack. That role has been the subject of further discussion and consideration, as one would expect, in subsequent days. It is becoming even clearer than it was last Tuesday at the Cabinet meeting, following those further discussions, that this role fits perfectly within the kind of operational concepts that are being devised by those who are working out a layered response to deal with this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is inappropriate for me to go into very great detail about this, but, in short, an interception role is required, a discouragement role is required-which broadly corresponds to that which I have just identified as the Australian position-and there is a lesser role again of simply monitoring. Broadly speaking, those three naval roles coincide with particular areas of operation: a highest level of intensity operation, by way of interception, being required in the Persian Gulf and in the northern reaches of the Red Sea; a lesser degree of `discouragement' type operation being required in the Gulf of Oman and the further out reaches; and the monitoring role being most appropriately contemplated in the context of the outer reaches of the Indian Ocean approaches to the whole Gulf area. </PARA>
<PARA> As presently advised, as the Prime Minister has said, the thinking is that this will be a role that Australia can sensibly play, in that second level of activity, in that second order geographical area. That will be the subject of further, more precise refinement between now and when the ships arrive on station. It will be the subject of an extensive technical conference that will be held in the next few days, in which Australia will, of course, be participating. These things will then be able to be articulated much more clearly. But as presently advised, there is no particular reason to believe that our role will significantly change. If it does change, it will be the subject of a Cabinet decision following the widest possible consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> Our hope is that in all of this there will be not war but peace in the Middle East: a just peace-not a capitulating peace and not a peace that acknowledges that might can be right and that might can win and reap unjust, wildly inappropriate rewards. That is our hope for our sailors and, above all else, for our Australian nationals that are caught up, as are those from so many other countries, in this horrible crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say in response to Senator Hill's invitation that we are doing everything we possibly can diplomatically to maintain contact with our own people and to make representations to the Iraqis about the iniquity, the enormity and the illegality of the position they are taking in relation to Australian nationals. At the moment we have a consul from Baghdad in Kuwait trying to make that contact. We are giving the clearest possible advice that we can to our citizens through the Radio Australia channel that has been opened up. It is just a situation which, regrettably, we are going to have to continue to monitor and which is unlikely to be able to be resolved, I fear, other than in the larger context of the resolution of this whole question. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us participating in this Gulf crisis response hope against hope that there can and will be an honourable, peaceful resolution. There cannot be peace at any price. It must not be peace by way of appeasement. It must be a peace of which we in Australia and in the rest of the world can be proud and which will not create unhappy precedents for the future. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1990-91.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has negotiated a difficult transition over the past 12 months-from an economy where spending and growth were overblown to an economy with lower activity and fewer imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I am able to report that we are emerging from this phase in fundamentally better shape having succeeded in this transition. </PARA>
<PARA> National Accounts data released tonight with the Budget show that the economy has slowed. The trends are clear-exports are up and imports are down. </PARA>
<PARA> The current account deficit is falling and inflation is abating. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic policy has worked and is working. </PARA>
<PARA> The faith the Australian people exhibited in the Government at the election is now being repaid as the economy adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth without a catastrophic collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA> An outcome delivered by a Government which kept its nerve in the face of sustained sectional criticism, so as to produce a better result for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> A community which faced these difficulties with a great degree of understanding and forbearance. </PARA>
<PARA> An understanding that the reformation of the economy is a continuing and at times difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA> And forbearance that has allowed the necessary policies time to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's task now is to build on that trust towards a more balanced and independent economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight's Budget is about just that. </PARA>
<PARA> It builds on the fiscal achievements secured to date and maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon in the fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> With a surplus of over $8 billion-the fourth successive surplus-it provides Australia with a period of sustained budgetary discipline unprecedented in its history. </PARA>
<PARA> It adds this further $8 billion to national savings to cut the call on overseas savings and hence overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> But not only does its rectitude provide an advantageous bottom line, it also underpins the fairest array of Commonwealth spending policies in the history of the Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in these are the personal tax cuts announced during the election to be paid from January 1 next year costing the Budget $1 billion, as is the fulfilment of the Government's election commitments on childcare, improved services for outer suburbs, and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet these outcomes are provided in the context of a slower economy which has placed additional pressure on outlays and dampened revenue growth. </PARA>
<PARA> With a similar surplus as last year, which was a year of high activity, the Budget is set to have a more substantial impact upon Australia and its economy this year. </PARA>
<PARA> This is particularly appropriate as the Government has now wound back official interest rates by four percentage points as the economy has slowed. </PARA>
<PARA> But we cannot let up on the restructuring of the economy made necessary by the high Government spending of the 1970s and early 1980s and the broken investment of that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Like many worthwhile contests, the fight with our economic problems will not be won in one championship round. </PARA>
<PARA> It will need to be fought over a number of bouts. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget keeps us in the right financial shape to carry that fight into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET OUTCOME</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Budget will deliver in precise terms, a surplus of $8.107 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> This surplus-larger than last year's outcome-has been achieved with outlays and revenue to GDP falling. </PARA>
<PARA> This year revenue will fall to only 25 per cent of GDP, well below the last Budget of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been brought about by the fact that over the Hawke Government's seven years in office we have more than fully indexed the tax scales for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Commonwealth surplus will ensure that Australia's public sector as a whole is in balance. </PARA>
<PARA> The net public sector borrowing requirement for 1990-91 will therefore be zero as once again the Commonwealth Budget surplus offsets the combined borrowing of all Commonwealth, State and local government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that the whole public sector of Australia will borrow no new money and that total Commonwealth debt as a share of the economy will be cut further to be only a third of what it was five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLAYS</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now detail the outlays side of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> This year outlays will be cut again to only 23 per cent of GDP, a reduction of 6 percentage points in six years. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures underline the enormous task undertaken by this Government to cut back public spending so that the Budget of the Commonwealth of Australia is today as tight and as fair as any in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a proud claim for a country which only seven years ago had a runaway public sector brought into disrepute by over spending and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> So great is the transformation, Commonwealth spending is now at its lowest level as a proportion of GDP since 1974, and in three years will be down to the level of the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet this has been achieved while funding services that either did not exist 20 or 30 years ago, or if they did exist, were much less comprehensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Areas such as child care, aged care, the family allowance supplement, schools, universities and environmental programs, are being supported and generously funded today from a Budget of early 1970s size. </PARA>
<PARA> It has made Australia a fairer and better place to live while meeting the requirements of broad economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The discretionary savings undertaken by the Government in this Budget round net to over $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I now detail the major decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> SAVINGS MEASURES AND NEW POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, last year the Government announced its Retirement Incomes Policy-a sweeping package of reforms to provide security for all Australians in their retirement years. </PARA>
<PARA> To do this, we have totally excluded full-rate pensioners from the tax system, making it more worthwhile for them to sensibly invest their savings to generate extra income. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet many pensioners still disadvantage themselves by holding their savings in accounts that pay little or no interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, to encourage sensible savings practice, from March 1 next year the Department of Social Security will assess cash and deposits of pensioners and beneficiaries amounting to more than $2000 as earning an interest rate of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the rate of return is greater than 10 per cent, the actual rate will apply as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Because many pensioners retain some savings in a low interest account for day-to-day convenience-running a cheque account for instance-the first $2000 of such deposits will be assessable at the actual rate of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes mean a pensioner couple with $50,000 in a bank account earning 4 per cent could be $40 per week better off by being encouraged to put their savings in a higher earning account. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to appreciate that a single pensioner with no other income would need at least $20,800 deposited, and a married couple $36,400, before losing one cent of pension under these new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> To accompany these reforms the Government will expand the Financial Information Service for Pensioners so they can take advantage of these changes to improve their disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has restored the integrity of the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security is tonight releasing a number of statements detailing further measures to tighten the administration of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> These include a six-week amnesty during which people who have not notified the Department of Social Security of changes in their circumstances may do so without having to refund any overpayments or face prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the amnesty the Government will implement measures to further tighten administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing tax file number system will be extended by the Department of Social Security to cover virtually all incometested payments. </PARA>
<PARA> This will occur under the strict supervision of the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures will save $120 million this year and $318 million next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Minister for Community Services and Health is announcing tonight the most far-reaching restructuring of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since it was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1948 this scheme has enabled all Australians to get the pharmaceutical drugs they need at an affordable price. </PARA>
<PARA> But today, scientific advances have resulted in a massive increase in the number and variety of health care drugs available. </PARA>
<PARA> It took almost 40 years-from 1948 to 1985-for the costs of that scheme to grow to half a billion dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> It took only another 4 years for the costs to grow by another half a billion dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> And in another three years those costs would have reached over $2 billion were we not to have acted now. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternatives are stark: reconstruct the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether, so that access to complete health care would only be available to the wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures we are announcing tonight will cut the growth in spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by about $1 billion in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Those measures include an increase in the general pharmaceutical charge from $11 to $15 per prescription, with a safety net of $300 after which the price will fall to $2.50, to a maximum of $50. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be a new standard charge of $2.50 per prescription applying to all social security recipients and to all families who receive the Family Allowance Supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> This charge will be offset by a $2.50 increase to weekly pensions and a safety net to protect chronically ill pensioners or beneficiaries who require a large number of prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements mean that for all those facing the $2.50 charge for the first time the charge will be at worst income neutral. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners will be protected by this change, and many will be better off. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, it will discourage the indiscriminate consumption of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Government has already implemented landmark income support schemes to help lower income families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we believe that in the current economic circumstances the community endorses the view that those who can afford to pay their own way should do so.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> This will mean that the Family Allowance will be withdrawn only if net assets, excluding the family home and debt, exceed $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the income test taper on the Family Allowance is to be abolished so that payments cut out for family incomes in excess of the income limit, currently $57,620 a year for families with one child. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the assets test applicable to the more generous Family Allowance Supplement will be reduced from January 1 1991 from $322,000 to $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, through the past seven years we have seen record levels of job growth and we have dismantled the barriers that have prevented many Australians from getting into work. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, opportunities were closed to women for many reasons, not the least of which was the lack of decent and affordable childcare places. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the pledge we made in the election campaign, we will double spending on childcare over the next three years with a first instalment of $75 million this year. </PARA>
<PARA> And over the next 5 years we will create another 50,000 childcare places. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, another election commitment honoured by the Government tonight is the abolition of the old unemployment benefit structure. </PARA>
<PARA> As from July 1991 unemployment benefits will cease to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In its place will be a short-term Job Search allowance and a Newstart allowance for those unemployed for 12 months or longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will provide the opportunities people need to get back to work-and we will insist that they take advantage of these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this reform the rate of payment to jobless 18 to 20-year-olds living at home and without children will be reduced from the full adult rate. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar strategy of positively encouraging the disadvantaged into self-fulfilling work will be applied by replacing the Sickness Benefit and Invalid Pension with a Sickness Allowance and a Disability Support Pension-a new structure of income support complemented by training and rehabilitation opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be a more rapid cost recovery of tertiary education charges by increasing the rate of repayment by higher income graduates through the taxation system-the assets test on Austudy will also be tightened. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, given increasing disparities in home prices between cities, the First Home Owners Scheme is no longer proving an equitable way of assisting home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be abolished from tonight. The Commonwealth will be providing funds for additional deposit assistance for low income earners to be administered by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing commitments under the First Home Owners Scheme will continue to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the standard of behaviour of some individuals in Australia's corporate sector has fallen short of what should be expected by the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government will ensure that corporate activity will be regulated and supervised in the interests of ordinary shareholders and investors. </PARA>
<PARA> From January 1 next year Australia will for the first time have a single corporate regulatory authority-the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> An extra $210 million will be provided over the next four years-resources for corporate regulation will increase by nearly 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Commonwealth believes that the States should carry full responsibility for managing their debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, tonight's Budget incorporates the proposal put at the Loan Council meeting for the States to refinance all maturing debt presently held on their behalf by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>REVENUE</PARA>
<PARA> Revenue as a share of the economy is more than two percentage points lower than its peak of four years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In world terms Australia is now a low tax country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last week announced that we are the third lowest taxed country in the developed world. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been achieved by making the size of government in Australia much smaller, thereby requiring a lower tax share to finance it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Capital Gains Tax, the Fringe Benefits Tax, the abolition of entertainment as a deduction, the taxation of foreign source income and the abolition of rorts have made the Australian taxation system one of the fairest and most secure in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, we have been able to cut personal and company tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA> And as I indicated at the outset, further personal income tax cuts, equivalent to $7.75 a week for a worker on average earnings are included in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>CRUDE OIL</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as recent events in the Middle East have emphasised, Australia's oil reserves are a scarce resource that must be carefully husbanded in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to maximise production and revenue from the Bass Strait field over its remaining life, the arbitrary excise and royalty system is to be replaced with the Resource Rent Tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This will result in a substantial cost to revenue in the initial years but will subsequently provide a positive taxation flow. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also provide a substantial boost to exploration activity by allowing exploration costs to become deductible on a company-wide basis for RRT purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>TAX AND THE ENVIRONMENT</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in the Environment Statement last year, the Prime Minister undertook to review aspects of the interaction of the tax system and the environment. In the past, mine site rehabilitation and the dismantling of oil production platforms have been regarded as capital costs and thereby not a deductible expense. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I announce that mine site rehabilitation and platform removal expenditures incurred from July 1 1991 will be deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> Full tax deductibility to combat land degradation will also be extended to all rural businesses earning income from the land, and will also cover the erection of fences for the prevention of such degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I announce that the Treasury will undertake a review of the taxation treatment of other environment-related capital expenditures incurred by business. </PARA>
<PARA>SMALL BUSINESS</PARA>
<PARA> This Budget also includes measures to help small business. </PARA>
<PARA> From August next year companies with sales tax liabilities of less than $50,000 a year will be able to remit payments quarterly rather than monthly. </PARA>
<PARA> And from April 1 next year the threshold for annual instead of quarterly payment of Fringe Benefits Tax will be lifted from $1000 to $3000. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxes on business inputs generally will be reduced by exempting from sales tax computers used in manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA>PROVISIONAL TAX</PARA>
<PARA> To keep the tax system fair, provisional tax arrangements will be extended to remove scope for high income earners deferring tax payments on wage and salary income at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> This practice has been particularly prevalent in relation to directors' fees, commissions and bonuses, and short-term, contract employees and will raise $370 million this year. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND</PARA>
<PARA>PROSPECTS</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated at the outset, Australia is now emerging from a period of very high but unsustainable economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> One consequence of that phase was a sharp reduction in Australia's unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that the economy has paused for breath, unemployment is expected to rise a little. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, the number of people in work is expected to increase over 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we will succeed in doing what we set out to do-to slow the economy without impairing longer-run growth prospects or jeopardising the economic and social advances of recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The commendable incomes restraint of the Australian community is acting to ensure that workers do not price themselves out of jobs during this period of slower economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the historically high rate of business investment of the past two years is finally providing us with the capacity to trade our way out of our troubles. </PARA>
<PARA> Fresh statistics released tonight show that as last year progressed a growing proportion of Australia's economic growth was generated by the export and import replacement sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> In this financial year, that trend will be even more dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this year's expected GDP growth of 2 per cent will be provided by these net export sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> This will in large measure be generated by growth in export volumes of 7 1/2 per cent-the largest since 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time our imports are forecast to fall by 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect will be a reduction in Australia's current account deficit of around $3 billion, with the current account to GDP ratio falling by over 1 percentage point. </PARA>
<PARA> And just as the economic slowdown helps our trade accounts, it will also help to reduce inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> By June next year the rate of increase in the consumer price index will have fallen from around 8 per cent today to 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That forecast is consistent with an inflation rate for the financial year on average of 6 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the present Middle East situation is a source of some uncertainty-for both the domestic and world economies-and our forecasts have had to assume a higher world price for crude oil. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is important to keep this matter in perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> Oil is not nearly as large a factor in the world economy as it used to be and, to date, price changes have been much more moderate than experienced at the time of earlier price shocks. </PARA>
<PARA> This is important because the inflation outcome relates to our wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year we negotiated a wage arrangement which should see wages grow at 7 per cent in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> This was premised on inflation falling to 6 per cent, as we are now forecasting. </PARA>
<PARA> If oil prices were to rise dramatically we should of course need to reconsider matters. </PARA>
<PARA> But any reconsideration would need to be in the context of reducing inflation while seeking to maintain disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA> These are all matters that would be put to the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>MONETARY POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> The economic developments of the past year have established a platform for sustainably lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Official interest rates have been reduced four times this year, moderating the stance of monetary policy as activity and spending have slowed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the year ahead we will ensure that monetary policy maintains the right balance so as to prevent a needless falling away in activity and employment and to create the environment where growth and employment can steadily strengthen. </PARA>
<PARA> However, our approach to interest rates will be tempered by our on-going concern not to rekindle demand pressures that could threaten progress in cutting inflation and the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> While prime attention is focused on broad goals to do with the current account, inflation, unemployment and interest rates, it is also important to improve the way our economy functions on a day to day basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has already been achieved from the floating of the dollar in 1983 to the fundamental modernisation of industrial awards and union structures that is going on today. </PARA>
<PARA> Our taxation system now no longer penalises those who invest to produce income rather than speculative profits. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariffs have been reduced, encouraging our industries to become more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Far-reaching reforms are already taking place on the waterfront and in aviation and shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to extend these reforms to other areas where the public sector is involved with industry and business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The guiding light will be to make government business enterprises innovative, efficient and competitive to ensure that they are not holding back our industries and are delivering a proper level of services to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> This must involve all levels of Government. But make no mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments can only do so much. </PARA>
<PARA> Private business must also be part of this process. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot over emphasise the commitment required of both the Government and the nation if we are to overcome the deep-rooted structural weaknesses of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Our problems developed as a result of decades of economic neglect and we will not resolve them quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is not part of any trading bloc. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no easy market waiting to comfort us. </PARA>
<PARA> The intransigence in the current GATT trade round is evidence of that. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have to make it by ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising, following the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in this debate this evening, on the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), I am deeply conscious of the great importance of this debate. I think it is probably the most important debate in which I have taken part during my term in the Senate. In doing so, I reaffirm the Opposition's strong support for the motion that has been proposed for the actions that have been taken by the Government. I certainly agree with them, and the reasons for those decisions, which were eloquently expressed by Senator Evans in his speech before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. However, I do so with a particularly heavy heart, not because I have any difficulty at all with the decisions which have been made and the reasons for them, but because of the fact that they had to be made at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circumstances which have occurred-the international scene in the Middle East since 2 August-are of such gravity that the actions of the Government, with the support of the Opposition, were clearly necessary. It is pleasing, of course, to see that the international community, as expressed through the United Nations resolutions, as expressed by the support which is coming in various ways from so many countries bear clear witness to the enormity of the threat and challenge to the peace of the world which has been presented by the actions of Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason, however, for the deep concern that one feels is exacerbated by the fact that until 2 August it appeared as though the world may have been on a new threshold of peace and stability of a much greater order, and with much greater hope for the future, than had occurred at any time in our deeply troubled twentieth century. Indeed, it looked as though one could look forward to an era of peace more like that which prevailed throughout the nineteenth century. </PARA>
<PARA> The extraordinary events of the past 12 months culminated in some major developments during the northern summer this year, such as the end of the Cold War; the dissolution of the Eastern bloc; the moves, at great pace and with affirmative discussion towards new security arrangements in and for Europe, resulting not only in a new collective security system for the Western alliance but one probably extending to the whole of Europe itself; and the clear rapprochement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the Soviet Union and what was the Eastern bloc-because it has now dissolved-all portended this new era. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the actions of virtually one man-Saddam Hussein-but no doubt supported by people around him, have thrown all those prospects into dis- array and doubt, and have thrown the world back into a state of great uncertainty which is of great concern to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in the context of that sad and deeply worrying situation that, fortunately, President Bush of the United States took the lead by the actions which he announced on 9 August. In the meantime, of course, the United Nations Security Council, on 6 August, passed an historic resolution to impose the mandatory sanctions, of an extensive character, as its effort to arrest the aggressive actions of Iraq under the leadership of its President. </PARA>
<PARA> The world community has responded to that decision of the United Nations Security Council in a very impressive way. The response to the call for sanctions has been widely accepted in a positive way. Clearly, there is an opportunity, in this case, for a much more effective sanctions regime than probably has been established before. However, as Senator Evans so clearly stated, sanctions in the past have failed, despite their support by the United Nations because, for one reason or another, there has not been adequate enforcement of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the leadership of President Bush, in giving support to the enforcement of those sanctions-by his statement and then giving, of course, separately, support and a guarantee to the defence of Saudi Arabia-which lead to the situation in which the Australian Government, indeed the Australian Opposition, was faced with that momentous development. Following President Bush's announcement on 9 August, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, not only supported what had been done-and he had already supported the decisions of the United Nations and of President Bush-but also called for something more than simply verbal support for these decisions and said that there was action that would be and should be required. </PARA>
<PARA> To the credit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and those whom he consulted-we now know, of course, that it was not the full Cabinet; nevertheless, he conducted consultations with some of his Ministers-the decision was taken on the next day, 10 August, to send the naval force; that is, the two frigates and the supply ship to the Middle East. This is referred to in the motion. As the Prime Minister said at the time, they will go there to enforce the blockade. That is the reference by the Prime Minister to the United Nations sanctions. The Opposition responded immediately-naturally it is not something that we had not considered, and we were fortunately in a position to respond immediately-and supported that decision announced by the Prime Minister to send Australian Navy ships to deploy in the Gulf region for the purposes of enforcing sanctions. The Prime Minister used the word `blockade'. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, our vessels are going to the Gulf region to protect these most important principles of international behaviour and international law. They are going there to operate with other countries in an act of collective opposition to the naked aggression of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and, of course, they are going there because our trade and political interests require a response to the Iraqi aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to emphasise those features. They are clearly decisions which Australia has taken under the best judgment of its Government and of its Opposition. They are the very solid and independent reasons which we have exercised in our own right and not because we are making some knee-jerk reaction to the fact that President Bush had promptly taken the decision-as notable as it was-giving leadership to the world in this regard. Nevertheless, our own decisions have been taken for those very good and clear reasons which I have mentioned and which Senator Gareth Evans also clearly enunciated in his speech before the dinner adjournment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few comments on the fifth arm of the Government's motion. It is the one which, from the speech made by their Leader, Senator Powell, before dinner, has apparently caused trouble for the Australian Democrats. I understand that an amendment is to be moved by the Democrats to delete the support for the limb which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision to send ships of the RAN to the Middle East to assist by means of identification, contact, interrogation and warning in enforcing United Nation's sanctions against Iraq under Article 51 of the United Nations charter. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the way the Government is now expressing the decision which, as I have said, the Prime Minister himself referred to as a decision to enforce the sanctions of the United Nations. There does seem to have been some further reflection by the Government following that announcement of the Prime Minister. Senator Gareth Evans, last week, was the first to refer to this more limited role of the Australian ships in the Gulf region, whereas it now has been summarised in this motion as one of `identification, contact, interrogation and warning'. It is not at all clear to me why that change was introduced into the reasons given for the deployment of the ships during last week, but that apparently is now the Government's firm decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few matters arising from that which I want to mention. However, before doing so, I want to refer to a couple of other matters that seem to have developed following the Government's decision. Firstly, of course, there were clearly pressures brought to bear on the Government by a number of its own supporters in opposition to the Prime Minister's decision. We witnessed a fairly lengthy debate within the factions yesterday and into last night and at a Caucus meeting today which fortunately has not hidebound the Prime Minister and the Government in having to make further decisions in this very difficult, fluid and dangerous situation which may well arise. It clearly is a benefit that it has not done that, but nevertheless there has clearly been some influence to weaken the resolve so firmly stated by the Prime Minister in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> There have, of course, been other influences brought to bear. No doubt we shall hear one of them in this debate tonight from Senator Vallentine, who is just dying to attack this decision. Without even waiting to hear her, I can say that we will not agree with anything she says. The Democrats, perhaps somewhat sadly, have also taken up the position of critics of this decision. It is most important for Australia, and certainly most important for those 600 servicemen who are proceeding in the three ships to the Middle East, that there should be a widespread support in the Australian community for the dangerous and difficult task they have been asked to undertake and which they have undertaken in accordance with their duty. I have no doubt that they will perform in accordance with their duty and with their great capabilities. It is important for them to know that as widely as possible the Australian community are behind what is being done. I would think that they would take some heart from this debate tonight, in which the Government has put down this very firm motion which has, as I said, been so eloquently supported by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, in his speech before dinner, and has been supported from the word go in a full-blooded way by the Opposition. We are firm in that commitment. We are not under the pressures that seem to be bearing a little bit on the Government. Nevertheless, the situation is that the Government and the Opposition are united in the support of this move which the Prime Minister first announced over a week ago. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very important factor indeed. It is very important also because it clearly indicates a widespread agreement in this community in denunciation of the sort of aggression to which this response is being made and to the threats that are being made to world peace by these actions. That is a very widespread Australian response to those challenges to world peace. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also some doubts cast last week about the suitability of the ships for their task. I am pleased that the Prime Minister in his statement today has made clear the capability of the ships, the quality of training that the servicemen have had, and their ability to undertake this task. There have also been doubts cast about the legality of this exercise. I am pleased to be able to support the views that have been expressed by Senator Gareth Evans and the Government and the reference to article 51 of the United Nations Charter in this motion to support the legality of our being present in helping to enforce the sanctions and in doing so as part of a collective security force in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that the Security Council's resolution of 6 August 1990, in calling for the widespread sanctions, includes the following term, amongst many others:</PARA>
<PARA>Affirming the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence, in response to the armed attack by Iraq against Kuwait, in accordance with article 51 of the Charter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Security Council's own resolution imposing the sanctions has acknowledged the right of `collective self-defence'; and that is what this operation is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Deputy Prime Minister and a former Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Geoffrey Howe, who is in Australia, was reported in this morning's newspapers as saying that he had also come to the same conclusion in firm acknowledgment of the legality of this exercise. Let us put that aside as one of the other objections that have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I would like to make one or two further remarks. Senator Hill, on behalf of the Opposition, has flagged most of them. We have some concern about the fact that there are not yet any rules of engagement and that there still seem to be a number of doubts about the manner in which the warships are to be deployed. For instance, it does not seem to be established yet under whose operational control and command these ships will be operating. They, of course, will be under the command of their captains. They will also be acting under the rules of engagement, which are yet to be laid down and which are taking far too long, in our view, to determine. There seems to be no reason why they should be taking so long. We will certainly be pressing the Government for an early resolution of that. The rules of engagement will lead to the ships' crews doing some exercises; they have to learn how to operate them before they are thrown into a dangerous situation. There is also the question of the geographic limits under which they will be operating; that has also not been established. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing that the Prime Minister's statement does not give us any more information about these matters. In fact, it raises a few more concerns because, apart from leaving open the extent of the role of identification, interrogation and warning and clearing up what doubts there may be about the limits of effectiveness that these will place upon the ships and the crew, the Prime Minister goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The operational roles of our ships will be reviewed if necessary to ensure that they meet the aim of the deployment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There still seem to be doubts in the mind of the Government as to whether this operational role which it has laid down will be satisfactory for Australia and for the other ships in the multinational force, and whether all of them will be able to operate under the limitations that have been stated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister still seems to be in doubt as to whose operational control they will come under. At his press conference on 10 August 1990, the Prime Minister said that the Australian naval vessels would remain under Australian command but that, once on station, they may operate under United States or some other form of operational control. That very serious question still seems to be unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that the vessels have some time before they get there. They are in HMAS Stirling in Cockburn Sound today and they are leaving tomorrow for the Gulf region. It is most unsatisfactory that these matters have not yet been resolved. The Opposition hopes that they will be resolved soon and will be pressing that they should be resolved before the vessels get to the Gulf and not left until they get there. </PARA>
<PARA> The question also arises of an adequate defence position and posture for these ships if they are not operating under what Vice-Admiral Beaumont said at the Prime Minister's press conference: that the ships would be operating as part of a task group and that there would be a layered defence process. That is very important for their defence and safety in the dangerous situation in which they will clearly be. There will be more danger for them if they are not participating under a layered defence process and under a properly structured operational control. These are all matters that are of concern to us in opposition. We are disappointed only on this one point in the statement: the Prime Minister has not cleared those matters up and we sincerely hope that they will be clarified as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may surprise Senator Durack, and even disappoint him, to know that I actually agree with a lot of what he has just said. For example, I agree with most of the motion of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) on this subject, including sections one, two, three, four and six. I have a great deal of difficulty with section five, especially the second part of it, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Government's decision to send ships of the RAN to the Middle East to assist-by means of identification, contact, interrogation and warning-in enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq under Article 51 of the UN Charter. </PARA>
<PARA>I have great difficulty with that section; in fact, I totally oppose that section of the resolution, so I will not be supporting the whole. As for the rest of it, I can agree with the sentiments expressed, particularly the support for the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> There has already been a great deal of national and international opposition not only to the decision of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to send Australian frigates to the Gulf region but also to the other military responses. I have been part of an international grouping which has called for an alternative to the present approach of the West, which is leading to a deepening and increasingly dangerous crisis in the Gulf region. In terms of the international approach, I wish to advise the Senate that the opposition has come from France, Germany, Britain, the United States (US) and New Zealand, as well as from many groups in Australia. I want to speak to the resolution which has been put forward by this international grouping, but I will not be reading directly from it. </PARA>
<PARA> In framing our alternative approach, we first of all extend our sympathies to the people of the region, whose lives are directly affected by the present crisis. We wish to cooperate with them to bring about a quick, just and peaceful resolution to this crisis. Secondly, we strongly condemn the use of force by Iraq in invading and annexing Kuwait. It is clear that any just solution must involve the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Thirdly, we are deeply concerned by the militaristic statements and actions in response to the Iraqi invasion led by the Bush Administration and supported by a number of Western governments. The military intervention by the United States and other forces has inflamed the region and revealed the ultimate ineffectiveness of military solutions to this international conflict. Our goal must be the non-violent resolution of such conflict. We call on Western governments to reverse their decision to deploy military forces in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Schacht had listened, he would have heard that I had already said that any just solution must involve the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. The United Nations issue has been mentioned by several speakers in this debate already and I want to clarify the situation. The United Nations sanctions have been enthusiastically endorsed almost unanimously and there has been greater support for this United Nations initiative than for any other United Nations initiative. That is commendable and I am glad that the Australian Government is also supporting those economic sanctions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I object to is the United States and other Western governments, including our own, taking it upon themselves to try to enforce these economic sanctions by military force and then having the gall to try to get United Nations (UN) approval for that. This action which Senator Durack has said is legal and that we must have no more debate about is not legal under the terms of the United Nations charter. It is quite clear in the terms of the United Nations charter that if this were a United Nations peacekeeping force under a United Nations flag then, yes, it could be supported. But that is not the case at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Retrospective permission is being sought from the United Nations to do what President Bush and his advisers, such as Henry Kissinger, who is just saying, `Go in there and bomb them', want to do. It is retrospective permission that is now being sought from the Security Council, and that is not good enough: it is an undermining of the United Nations institution. It is not good enough to say that we are going to send in the troops and then seek the endorsement of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> If the United Nations had decided on a peacekeeping force under a United Nations flag, then there would be great support for that. That is not the case. The Bush Administration could not wait to get in there to use its military might. It has thousands of troops already on the ground in Saudi Arabia and the Australian Government has been silly enough to jump on the bandwagon far too fast without adequate thought or consultation about this matter. It has been very embarrassing for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to have to back-pedal and to try to say, `Oh well, the Prime Minister did not really mean what he said when he said that once the Australian ships got to the Gulf they would be under United States command'. That is another point on which I would agree with Senator Durack. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crucial that these matters be cleared up. Of course, I think the ships should not go. But it is not good enough for the Prime Minister to say one thing, for example, `We will fight or be under the United States flag' and for the Foreign Minister to have to backtrack from that and say that we need to get the endorsement of the United Nations. Talk about closing the stable door after the horse has bolted! It is an undermining of the position of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> We know very well that the United States does not care a jot for the United Nations. For years it did not even pay its dues to this body-the best international body that there is-which may have some role to play in peacekeeping and in finding a non-violent and non-military solution to this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I am appalled by the Prime Minister's speech this afternoon. He had the cheek and the temerity to talk about the hostages and to criticise the Iraqi Government for using foreign nationals as hostages in this situation. There are 150 Australian nationals whose lives are at risk because of the Prime Minister's rash decision to send three Australian ships to the region. If the Australian Government had not said that it would send its ships to the Gulf, then the Australian nationals, along with nationals of other countries who have been given exit visas, would by now be out of Iraq and out of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Australians' lives are at risk right now because of the action of our Prime Minister in following President Bush's request for Australian military involvement and backup for the United States' military posturing. If Australia had not agreed to send a military force, then the Australians would not be being rounded up into the hotels and being used as virtual hostages. Other nationals from other countries have been given exit visas. They are out of the countries of Iraq and Kuwait already. So Australian lives have been put directly at risk by the Prime Minister's unwise decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Australian lives put at risk are the ones who are on board the ship. My great sympathies go to the families who tomorrow will farewell these young men who have been given orders and who, in some cases at least-there are a few absent without leave, I gather, who are not accounted for as yet-are reluctantly following orders to go into this very dangerous war zone. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only four months since the Prime Minister, with tears in his eyes at the Gallipoli seventy-fifth anniversary, said that never again shall young Australians' lives be under a foreign flag on foreign fields. They were the Prime Minister's words on 25 April at Gallipoli. But here we are again: Australians sent off to a very dangerous war zone where they may well find themselves engaged in the most devastating war that humanity has ever known. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sam Nunn of the United States Armed Forces Congressional Committee has said that there is a very real possibility of the use of tactical nuclear weapons in this conflict. We have had Kissinger saying, `Go in there and bomb them'. We have had the Iraqis threatening to use chemical weapons. What kind of situation is our Prime Minister sending these young Australian men into?</PARA>
<PARA> It is not our war; indeed, it need not be anybody's war if the United Nations' sanctions were allowed to take effect. I beg the Australian Government to reconsider its decision and to allow the United Nations' sanctions to take effect. For the first time in history the global community had the opportunity for a peaceful and non-violent resolution of this conflict. It is being escalated by the military posturing on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> We had unprecedented support for the United Nations and it is being blown before there has been the opportunity for us to see whether it could be effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also appalled to see in the Prime Minister's statement no reference whatsoever to the historical background to this region. Nobody else in the other chamber or here has mentioned it yet. There is a huge problem in the whole of the Middle East and in the Gulf region in particular. Foreign powers have to take some responsibility for the tensions and the deep hatred that there is in some Arab nations for the West. It is not without foundation. It is not without reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate a short summary up to 1930 when oil was discovered in the region: In 1899, to exclude growing German interest in the area and to suppress piracy which threatened the Suez to India route, Kuwait was detached from the Ottoman Empire and became a British protectorate. The local ruler had responsibility for internal affairs, and Britain took responsibility for foreign policy and defence. That was nearly 100 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1915, the secret Sykes Picot agreement carved up the Turkish Empire between Britain and France in the event of a Turkish defeat in World War I. At the same time Britain had been promising the Arabs independence if Feisal, the Sherif of Mecca, would support it against the Turks. After the First World War the Arabs found that they were grossly deceived when Britain took Iraq and Palestine and France took Lebanon and Syria. Iraq was under the Anglo-Indian administration of a British civil commissioner. There was an anti-British revolt in Iraq in 1920. Two thousand British lives were lost and millions of pounds were expended to put the revolt down. This is the kind of background that we actually need to know about this area. </PARA>

<PARA> In 1921, Britain installed Feisal as a puppet king in Iraq. That was imposed without consulting the Iraqis. In 1930 the Anglo-Iraq Treaty was meant to grant independence to Iraq. It is with this kind of background that we must try to understand the Middle East crisis. Of course, matters got much worse when oil was discovered. Since the 1930s, and particularly since 1950, we have been increasingly dependent on a petroleum economy and foreign powers have deliberately had a divide and rule policy. They set out, for example, in 1953 to prevent the growing friendship between the democratically elected Government of Iran and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Central Intelligence Agency organised a coup to install the Shah as dictator of Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the kind of background that has not been mentioned by anybody yet; but it must be understood. It organised the anti-Soviet Baghdad pact, setting up the CENTO group to be a Middle Eastern version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation alliance. The pro-Western Government maintained itself by setting Kurd against Arab and Sunni against Shia, working a policy of divide and rule which has been extremely successful. </PARA>
<PARA> We then had the Iraqi revolution. We have had eight coups in Iraq from 1934 to 1958. There has been tremendous tension and turmoil in the region. There have been three Kurdish wars, and there have been several attempts by the Iraqis to claim Kuwait, which they do not acknowledge as being independent. </PARA>

<PARA> We have to understand that this crisis is about the West's dependency on oil. We are living in a petroleum dominated economy. In the first oil crisis in 1973 we had the opportunity to rethink that dependence on Middle East oil, given the turmoil in the region, given the history of colonialism and outside intervention and given the deep-seated distrust of the West by the Arab nations which, as I have tried to point out, is not unfounded. We should have looked then for other sources, as Australia wisely did. But also we should have looked at other sources rather than fossil fuels. We should have looked to renewable energy sources; we should have looked to conserving our very wasteful use of energy. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States uses 50 per cent of the world's petroleum-50 per cent! Military engagement in the Middle East, which is getting closer and closer day by day, is to protect the United States glutt- onous habits in its overuse of oil resources. Why did the global community not take stock of the situation in 1973? We have had almost 20 years to turn away from dependence on Middle Eastern oil and we have not taken the opportunity. It is important that we learn the lessons from what has happened in the Middle East and that we not be so dependent on Middle East oil and on the petroleum economy. We must look to alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I totally dispute what Senator Evans says about Australia's involvement in the Middle East situation being necessary from our national point of view. Australia is 70 per cent self-sufficient in oil. We should be more self-sufficient than that. One of our other oil sources is disputable because it is located in the Timor Gap. It is stolen oil from the East Timorese people. I will get onto that later. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not in our interests to jeopardise the lives of Australians who are in the Gulf and the servicemen who are on the ships going there. It is not in our interests to jeopardise future Australian trade by being engaged in the military posturing. To be engaged in the United Nation's economic boycott, which is supported by most nations in the world, I believe is a very different thing from sending our warships to the region. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now considered an enemy country by many of the Arab nations. I do not think that that is very helpful in terms of our future trade opportunities. We have to look at the very devastating accident potential in this region that the Prime Minister is blithely sending our young men into. The Iraqis have already engaged in the use of chemical weapons. They have a huge stockpile of these weapons and they are not afraid to use them. They have already demonstrated that. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to acknowledge that a huge armada of warships is sitting in the Gulf at the moment carrying nuclear weapons. If the missiles start to fly-I hope they never do-there is a huge potential for accidents because of those nuclear weapons. Also we have people in the United States Administration threatening to use their short-range tactical nuclear weapons. The Government is sending young Australians into the most devastating situation possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia could take a very creative role similar to the role the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade took in the Cambodian crisis. The Government could engage in a bit of lateral thinking, for goodness sake, instead of just rushing in where angels fear to tread. I do not support people who engage in name calling of either of the parties in this dispute. But, whatever one thinks of Saddam Hussein, it is very unwise to threaten somebody who is so heavily armed, who has shown that he is not afraid to use his worst weapons and who is feeling extremely threatened. The worst thing one can do is threaten him further with the use of military force. It is just a stupid response to make-absolutely stupid. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should be suggesting demilitarisation of the whole region. That is what the international response should be. The United Nations must be looked to as the main body capable of determining the appropriate responses to this situation. We support the United Nation's attempts to resolve the conflict by non-military means, including economic sanctions, and we call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the region. The Arab nations, amongst themselves, have huge problems to work out. We should not be interfering in the military sense. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that with the intervention of US ground troops in Saudi Arabia and the presence of US, British and French naval forces in the Gulf the three nations which have acted as the main colonial powers in the Middle East in modern times have been brought together. Of course, this is like a red rag to a bull. Why inflame the situation by going in there with weapons systems when that is exactly the kind of excuse that Saddam Hussein might use to attempt to justify the further use of force in this situation. It is just giving him the excuse that he does not really need but might take advantage of. As a result, the stage has been set for a military conflict to develop between the nations of the north and south to replace the old Cold War between the East and West of which, thankfully, we have seen the demise in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation has been worsened by the profiteering of Western nations, which have exported large volumes of modern arms to countries like Iraq. These same Western nations are now crying foul because these weapons are being used in ways which threaten their access to cheap and abundant oil. In my notice of motion this afternoon, I said that the Soviet Union was one of the chief nations involved in arms sales. I absolutely acknowledge that. I want to quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Tuesday, 14 August which is headed `Exporting double standards'. This article is about Australia's involvement in sending arms to the region. We are not exempt from that criticism of those who support the Iraqi regime's huge militarisation program. Before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the situation was as follows-these are not my words; I am quoting from this article; I would not use this terminology myself:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The Defence Department thought highly enough of the Butcher of Baghdad to give approval to Hawker de Havilland to sell $850,000 worth of aircraft parts to the Iraqi Air Force. Last week, the Government cancelled the sale. </PARA>
<PARA>Last week! So this is Australia's involvement-selling armaments to the Iraqi forces. Then we cry foul and say, `Oh, we must go there, and we must use our forces to stop this man'. We have helped him with his armaments. What a double standard that is? It is so hypocritical. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Iraq was one of the small group of countries, including Iran, South Africa and members of the Eastern bloc, to which sales were banned. This was before the relaxing of the defence export guidelines, which the former Minister for Defence was so proud to introduce into the Parliament in 1988. Before that, sales to countries such as Iraq, Iran, South Africa and members of the Eastern bloc were banned. But that was before the end of the Iraq-Iran war. Obviously, we decided then that Iraq was smelling much more sweetly, the odd bout of chemical warfare notwithstanding. Once the war between Iran and Iraq actually stopped, it was okay for the Australian Department of Defence to sell military parts to Iraq. That has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1988, the Defence Department has had the authority to give export licences to arms manufacturers in Australia. That has been happening since the end of the Iraq-Iran conflict and since the guidelines of Minister for Defence were gently softened to make it possible for Australia to sell armaments to almost anybody. I repeat: until last week, we were selling parts to the Iraqi Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to note that, according to this article, the Washington correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald wrote last Friday that George Bush rang Bob Hawke to thank him for offering Australian Navy ships. This is not something that we have heard very much about in the Australian media. We have heard that Bush rang around and was trying to get support. But we did not know that Hawke had actually offered the support until George rang him and put the hard word on him. It was not very difficult for him to get the consent, of course. Our Prime Minister insists that the Americans asked us first. It may be mere semantics, but the perspective from Washington is quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that we have advanced little as a nation in the past 20 or 30 years. Sir Alan Watt, Head of the External Affairs Department in the early 1950s, wrote in 1967, `Many nations must depend on others for their ultimate security, but in most cases they try to maximise their own independence within a relationship of dependency'. Australia has seemed intent on doing the very opposite, maximising its dependence, first on Britain and lately on the US. I think that that is a great shame. It is a national shame. </PARA>
<PARA> There are parallels between this and the Vietnam situation. However, the great difference between the two, which needs to be pointed out, is that in the Vietnam situation it was a Liberal-Country Party government which sent Australians off to join the United States in a foreign field and thus to their deaths. The Australian Labor Party was great in opposition. The Labor Party was out there and it would be interesting to know how many of the Labor Party people now sitting in these two chambers were involved in the anti-Vietnam marches. I have no doubt that there were many of them who were proud to be so, as Senator McMullan is only too pleased to recognise. I am glad that they were there, but they are not there now because this time it is the Labor Party that is sending Australians off, despite the Prime Minister's glib and tearful promise at Gallipoli only a few months ago that Australians would not be sent off to fight under a foreign flag. That is exactly what has happened and we still have no clear idea from the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister-who is madly backtracking and trying to undo Bob Hawke's promises-of whose command those Australians will be under when they get there. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do not think that that is the most important issue at all. The important thing is that the global community has missed a great opportunity to ensure that the United Nations sanctions work. It must be stated that there is no point in confronting violence with violence. All one gets is more violence. All we are going to get out of the Middle East from a military response in this situation is more violence. There is nothing surer. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to reaffirm the Western Australian Greens' total commitment to non-violence and we will ensure that opposition to the Prime Minister's decision is heard in this country. I am very pleased to be working in an alliance with the Australian Democrats, the Rainbow Alliance and other groups around the country. There are many groups involved in an alliance in Western Australia at the moment. It was interesting that at the Young Labor Party's conference over the weekend there was huge dissension over this issue, too. I know that although Labor people here will not be able to say how they feel about this issue, already many Australian Labor Party branches in various States have put forward motions to their State executives condemning this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The opposition will be there. It will be seen; it will be heard. Great shame will be heaped upon Mr Hawke, as our Prime Minister, for making this very unwise decision. It is not too late to stop the ships from leaving Garden Island tomorrow, but I doubt that that will happen. It is very interesting that even Gough Whitlam has criticised the Prime Minister's decision. I thought that the Prime Minister's response to Gough Whitlam's criticism was very interesting. He said, `Oh well, his Prime Ministership wasn't perfect either. Everyone makes mistakes'. I wondered whether the Prime Minister was beginning to think that maybe he had made a mistake. He has made a gross error of judgment and it would take quite some courage to admit it and to stop those ships leaving Garden Island tomorrow. How much better it would be for the Prime Minister to admit that he had made a gross error of judgment; to do something which will relieve the situation for the 170 Australians stuck in Kuwait and Iran right now. They could be out of there in a flash if Australia were not part of that military blockade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister could stop even the prospect of Australian lives being lost in the Gulf if he had the guts to admit that he had made a mistake and if he reversed that decision. That is what I and many others in the country are calling on him to do-to acknowledge the error of that decision that he made without much consultation. That issue has been covered by other people. I know that the Westminster system gives him the ability to make that decision in that way. I do not like it, but that is the system. But to admit that he has made a mistake would be a courageous thing to do, and how much better for him to admit that now and to stop this insanity before it goes any further. </PARA>
<PARA> Why cannot the Australian Government make the kind of response that the New Zealand Government had the courage to make-that it would abide by the United Nations declaration, that it would be involved in a peacekeeping force only under a United Nations flag, and that it would send a Red Cross team to the area? I think that that is a plausible response and I commend the New Zealand Government for having the wisdom to think carefully about this decision and to listen to the voice of sanity of its own people and this plea from the international community not to engage in a military conflict which could have more devastating consequences than people sitting around this chamber could ever imagine in their enthusiastic endorsement of the military response. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it quite sickening that there is this kind of enthusiastic support for the troops going off to a dangerous war zone. I think that that is a great shame. The voice of the Australian people will be raised on this issue and I think it must be heard. We have a couple of weeks before those ships are actually due to arrive in the Gulf and my plea is that the Prime Minister will see reason; that he will reverse his decision to engage in military posturing in the Middle East. </PARA>

I have known the President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, for some 15 years. I am well acquainted with both his qualities and his capacities. I am certain that both of you will continue to acquit yourselves well in this chamber and I look forward to your counsel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I begin my maiden speech, may I say how pleased I am that my wife, Lynne, is in the gallery tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I rise to support the motion as moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button. There is no doubt that at certain times in human affairs the two elements most required are those of courage and resolution. So it is with the current circumstances in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle East generally. We have seen an act of unprovoked aggression by the state of Iraq against its neighbour, Kuwait. At a time when relations between East and West have seldom if ever been better, we are obliged to confront a conflict in which the norms of both international law and civilised behaviour have been cast aside. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, no-one should be in any doubt about the motivation of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in seizing Kuwait. By itself, Iraq currently controls some 9 to 9 1/2 per cent of the world's proven oil supplies. Kuwait holds approximately 10 per cent of the world's known oil supplies. At one stroke, Iraqi aggression has given it a capacity to become not simply a major oil supplier but a primary oil supplier to the entire world. The dangers in that for the international economy and the world community are self-evident. Moreover, what is not commonly realised is that prior to the intervention of the United States, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was in very real jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me state openly that I hold no particular brief for the feudal monarchies that dominate this part of the globe, but two points ought to be made. First, we must deal with political realities; and secondly, these monarchies are broadly preferable to the awful regime that exists in Baghdad. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, prior to the arrival of the forward elements of the 82nd Airborne Division and the United States Air Force, the Iraqis could have easily overrun a strip of territory some 400 miles by 50 miles in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which would have given Saddam Hussein some 15 to 20 per cent more of the world's known petroleum reserves and the consequences of that aggression would have been staggering. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances what should the Australian response have been? First, let us deal with a couple of myths. Some have likened this conflict to the war in Indo-China of the 1960s and 1970s. Some have drawn a parallel with Australian intervention in Vietnam. We should dismiss this canard immediately. There is no analogy with the Vietnamese civil war. The two conflicts stand in contrast, rather than in comparison. And I speak, like Senator McMullan, as one who opposed our Vietnam involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The second myth: the telephone call from President Bush to the Prime Minister of Australia represented an end to the process by which consultations had occurred between Australia and the United States. The Australian position had already been drafted in the national interests of our country. When the formal request was made to Australia to contribute significantly to the multinational naval force in the Gulf, Australia was in a position to respond immediately. Let me add that it stands to the credit of the Opposition that it has not been suggested on the other side of the chamber that the decision of the Government was anything other than in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, this brings me to a point about the formulation of foreign affairs and defence policy in Australia generally. I have long held the view that there should be a greater degree of bipartisanship in the field of foreign affairs, defence policy and on matters of trade. Taken together, these policy positions constitute our international perspective and our international profile. Certainly there should always be a vigorous debate within Australia's political parties and between our political parties. It should involve the broader community, and this body has an important role to fulfil in terms of this debate and in terms of Senate committee procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the United States Senate, this body has the opportunity to stand back from time to time and form a considered view and take a deliberate position. It is very pleasing that we have achieved a bipartisan position on the Gulf crisis in Australia's national interest. There should be more bipartisanship in shaping Australia's international political direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, the feature of the Gulf crisis which is quite extraordinary in terms of international relations is the degree of cooperation between the United States, the Western powers generally and the Soviet Union on the issue. It is reflected not only in the votes taken at the United Nations Security Council but in the practical decisions taken by the Soviet Union itself: first, in the dispatch of its naval vessels to the area to monitor developments; second, in Defence Minister Yasov telling the Iraqis that their logistical support has evaporated; and, finally, in the words of Mikhail Gorbachev, who two days ago told his military chiefs in Odessa that the Soviet Union had supplied Iraq with weaponry for its own defence and not for use in a war of aggression against smaller neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, not since the Potsdam Conference in 1945 has there been a better climate between the major powers on which efforts to find a solution might be based. This brings us to the situation of the United Nations. There is no doubt that the multinational response is within the terms of article 51 of the charter of the United Nations on collective defence. It is legal and it is justifiable. There is no doubt either that a formal resolution of the Security Council to underline the embargo and to reinforce the sanctions would be a welcome step, but as the Prime Minister said this morning, in the absence of that, decisive action was required. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote the Prime Minister in the Caucus of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party this morning: `There is no use of sanctions simply existing on paper in New York'. The sanctions against Iraq in the face of this aggression had to be enforced. In this, the analogy is not with Vietnam, but with Korea in the 1950s. As the great British socialist Mr Nye Bevan once remarked, `We all need to be aware that there are some men who think with the blood'. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to people who think with the blood, let us look at the record of Iraq over the last decade. It is true that circumstances change rapidly in the Middle East; it is also true that until recently Iraq may have been regarded in some quarters as preferable to the fundamentalism of Iran-that the Iraqi military would act as a bulwark against potential Iranian aggression in the Gulf. Indeed, even in the early part of 1989 the US National Security Council's advice to the President was that the USSR and Iran posed a greater threat to the Gulf than did Iraq. So, there are lessons for Western policy makers in what has occurred. But one element is always consistent in Iraqi foreign policy, and that is the use of force-maximum and most brutal force, accompanied by recourse to dreadful technologies such as chemical weapons, which were used indiscriminately against the Kurds-Hussein's own people-and against Iran in the province of Khuzestan in the war, and we now see their threatened use against the world community and against Western hostages. Should I say, Mr Deputy President, that the taking of hostages fills all civilised men and women in this chamber, in Australia and in the world community with horror. It is a return to the practices of the Dark Ages. Sometimes, civilisation has to confront a manifest evil. This is such an occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the terms of the resolution before the Senate-it is both comprehensive and clear, and, most importantly, it offers leadership both in domestic terms and within the international framework. The international framework has altered for the better. In the Middle East, Saddam Hussein's period, like that of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi before him, as pretender to the role of leader of the Arab world is now at an end. The leadership of the Arab world has returned to the Egyptians. Not since 1967 has Egypt's role in world affairs been more significant or more decisive. </PARA>
<PARA> On that score, it is interesting to note that Egypt, Morocco and Syria have all intervened militarily in support of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and most of the rest of the Arab world is at variance with Iraq and has said so. Iraq is isolated; it is already discredited and in international terms it is, in effect, a pariah nation. However, it is now imperative that Saddam Hussein be seen to lose as a consequence of his aggression, for if Iraq is not seen to lose decisively, then it may be anticipated that Hussein will return to fresh adventurism-emboldened, stronger and more aggressive-and in a few years time Iraq is likely to have a stronger economic base, improved chemical weapons capacity, delivery systems for ballistic missiles and artillery for long-range bombardments, and potentially, even, a nuclear weapons capacity. Iraq so armed would be far more formidable and far more dangerous than it is currently. Hence, the reaction of the world community needed to be utterly decisive and so it has been. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, the following countries have intervened: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, Syria, Egypt and Morocco. Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Japan have offered support, as has Turkey. The international community has responded with determination. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, Mr Deputy President, the analogy ought to be drawn with the Korean War, which began in 1950. In Korea we had an act of naked aggression. We had military adventurism on a grand scale. We had policy being made on the basis of force of arms and President Truman, like his predecessor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was equal to the challenge of aggression. So was Australia in 1941, so was John Curtin, and so was the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> To continue the process of drawing analogies-what are we to say about the despot Saddam Hussein? Mr Deputy President, in my view the comparison ought not to be drawn with Hitler, with the monumental evil on that scale-though some do. It is perhaps more apt to compare Saddam Hussein with Haile Mengistu, the dictator of Ethiopia, who also murders his military commanders and his Cabinet ministers at the table, who persecutes his own people, who uses force of arms against his neighbours, and who wages war against the Eritreans and the Tigreans. The two are very similar. But there is one element in Hussein's make-up that justifies comparison with the fascist dictatorships of the thirties and the forties. I quote from someone far more eloquent than I-Bertolt Brecht in the Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui-on the defeat of fascism in the forties. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore learn how to see and not to gape</PARA>
<PARA> To act instead of talking all day long</PARA>
<PARA> The nations put him where his kind belong</PARA>
<PARA> But don't rejoice too soon at your escape</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, I come to this chamber elected as a Labor senator, as an internationalist who believes that Australia should act in her own self-interest, in consultation with her friends and her allies as part of the Western democratic group of nations. My great Party, the Australian Labor Party, takes an international perspective. We are committed to the Socialist International and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. We are committed to the United Nations and to its agencies, particularly to the International Labour Organisation. And, like all Australians, we are committed to essential democratic values, to constitutional government and to parliamentary representation, as I am sure are all within this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, Australians do not seek to impose our democratic views upon others. We may argue in support of them but we resist the appeal of imposition-the appeal that is inherent in imposition. But we are determined to respond when these values are threatened, and these values are threatened in the Gulf crisis. We are not defending the Emirates or the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in isolation. We are responding on the basis of a principle that international law and civilised behaviour ought to prevail in world affairs and that Saddam Hussein, Iraq and their allies ought not to be permitted to dictate the course of events either to this country or to our friends and allies or to any other nation on the globe. </PARA>
<PARA> The analogy with Korea is appropriate. Other analogies might also be drawn from the period of the 1930s-from the Rhineland, Czechoslovakia, or from the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The world then failed in its obligations; the democracies failed; and the League of Nations failed. On this occasion we ought not to fail. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the international community will not fail this challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> In finalising the analogy, the United Nations did not fail in Korea; it did not fail in Zimbabwe; and it is not failing in South Africa. International opinion does prevail if it is supported by resolution and determination, the kind of determination that Australia has demonstrated over the previous few days. Australia's role may not be decisive, but it is significant in the successful outcome of the process of ensuring that international opinion does prevail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I congratulate the preceding speaker, Senator Loosley, on his maiden speech which was an excellent and responsible speech to the motion which is before the chair tonight. I rise in support of the motion moved by the Government and supported in speeches made by my Leader, Senator Hill, and by Senator Durack and Senator Gareth Evans. I propose to be quite brief tonight because I think most of the essential material has been covered. I just want to raise some slightly different points. We are dealing in the international arena with an armed invasion without any warning or provocation of one country by another, the overrunning of that country, and the removal of a legitimate government going about its lawful occasions. Within 48 hours of that invasion the country was annexed by its invader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is quite irrelevant to say that it was a large country invading a small country, although the comparison that springs to mind is that between Australia invading New Zealand because the populations of Iraq and Australia are about the same, and Kuwait is about the same size as New Zealand. But the bald fact is that, irrespective of the ratios of the size of the countries, it is a conquest by armed force of one country by another and, as such, it is a breach of international law and it cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to live by a rule of law within countries, within societies and internationally. We cannot live in free societies. If there is no rule of law, there simply is anarchy-the strength of somebody's right arm where might is right, and that is not the way societies have chosen to live. Any grouping and aggregation of people to have stability has always had some form of law. It might not be a perfect law; in fact, we have had legislation and rules ever since man banded together in the caves, and those rules are still improving and changing. That is why we are here as legislators trying to improve the system, but the system is the important thing. It was perfectly correct for the Government to recognise that Australia had a national interest to defend with respect to an international rule of law, to speak up and to make a commitment to see that that rule of law internationally is supported and enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very strange that in a century where we have seen the greatest feats of arms in history, where the dangers of not controlling international relationships and an international rule of law have cost so many hundreds of millions of lives, people such as members of the Australian Democrats, Senator Vallentine and the appeasers have not learned from the terrible lessons of history. We have learned that if we do not stand up and be counted when the law is broken and seek to impose that rule of law, then the situation will get very much worse. That is why the United Nations was set up in the aftermath of the Second World War; that is why Australia played such a signal part in setting up the United Nations-to create some peace, stability and predictability in international relations. In the 45 years that the United Nations has been in existence it has unfortunately been hamstrung because of the great polarisation that has occurred between the Western democratic nations and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> On only one occasion has there been a similar situation and that was in relation to Korea, when the Soviets boycotted the Security Council. The Soviets, the British, the Americans, the Chinese and the French were the five permanent members of the Security Council. They all had the right of veto of the 11 members of the Council. It was in the early 1950s, while the Soviets were boycotting the Security Council, that the United Nations could resolve to take action against the lawlessness of the North Koreans when they invaded South Korea. But since that time the power of the veto of either the Soviet bloc or of the Western democratic nations has prevented the United Nations fulfilling the ideals which led to its inception. But now, in the Gorbachev era, we see a very welcome rapprochement between the Western democratic nations and the Soviet Union. For the first time in 45 years we see the opportunity for the United Nations to demand that the rule of law internationally be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more to it than that because, welcome though it is that the rapprochement has taken place between the Soviets and the Western democratic nations, the facts of life are that where we had two superpowers in existence up till the present, we are moving into a situation where we will have at least six superpowers in the immediate future-in the next 20 years, a very short time in international affairs-the United States, the European Community, Russia, Japan, China and India. Arguably within 30 or 40 years we might well have Indonesia joining that group. </PARA>
<PARA> A world where we have so many superpowers and power blocs is a very different world to where we have two superpowers and a stabilising influence that comes between a choice of either/or. Potentially, unless there is a very effective United Nations enforcing a rule of law we are moving into a very unstable and unpredictable world. It is inevitable that frictions and competition will arise between nations as they pursue their goals as they see them. Competition by itself is not dangerous, but one never knows when that competition exceeds acceptable bounds and when a person such as Saddam Hussein will come along. The defence of all the nations of the world is in the establishment of an international body which will maintain an international rule of law. The actions that the Government and the United Nations have taken are absolutely beyond dispute in this matter. They have acted with proper motives and for proper goals. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn briefly to some problems we have in the Middle East area. One problem is that in all the Arab countries there is a very marked degree of social instability, not only in places such as Iraq where a dictatorship is running, but in other countries societies do not follow the democratic forms of government that we support. While that may have been quite tenable in those societies up to 30 years ago, the last 30 years have seen the growth of an educated middle class in those countries, technically educated people with liberal ideas, who do not wish to live under the restricted administrations that exist in so many of those Arab countries. So we have a basic instability in all those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the particular case of Iraq, we have what can only be described as an archetypal Third World dictatorship. Iraq has a leader who has murdered his opponents and competitors, who has shown a consistent belligerent and warlike approach to his neighbours, and who embarked on a war with his neighbour Iran, in September 1980, which led to at least a million dead. While no wars are pleasant-they are distinctly unpleasant-the war fought and prosecuted by Iran and Iraq was a particularly barbaric one. While I would not wish to draw distinctions between them, I think one has to say that the actions of Iraq really were far worse than those of Iran, because we saw the use of chemical weapons for the first time since the First World War. </PARA>
<PARA> Chemical weapons were introduced in the First World War, and the weapons principally used were chlorine and mustard gas. While those chemical weapons were lethal and toxic agents, their use then was so dramatic on the troops on both sides that they were subsequently shunned in the great conflict of the Second World War. The major combatants were prepared for chemical warfare, but they never used them; they refrained from using them, knowing the horrors that existed. We now have chemical and biological agents which are, in their lethality, several magnitudes beyond anything that existed in the First World War, and the Iraqis have shown a great readiness to use them. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the potentiality for chemical and particularly biological weapons, I think there is very little to choose between them and nuclear weapons. In fact, some of the arguments that can be advanced about biological weapons are that they are more dangerous to the world as we know it and to human life than nuclear weapons. They are simple and easy to produce, and they are things that countries with low technology can get into. The intelligence reports are that Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya and possibly Egypt all possess chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq first started using chemical weapons-basically chlorine and mustard gas-in December 1982, and it used them in 1983. In 1984 it used nerve gas. There was a break for a while, and then in 1986 Iraq went back to large scale use of chemical weapons. In 1988, of course, Iraq used chemical weapons against its own defenceless nomadic tribe in the north-the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised the use of chemical weapons many years ago in the Senate, as the Hansards show. The point I drew attention to at that time was that the peace movement, with its antinuclear obsession-people like Senator Vallentine and the Australian Democrats, of course-showed not the slightest concern about the use of these quite horrifying weapons. It was only much later in the day after I had brought the matter up that they turned their attention to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It happens to be factually correct, and it probably embarrasses Senator Coulter. We now have the certainty that the Iraqis are moving down the path of acquiring nuclear weapons. Any form of weapon seems to be fair grist to the mill for Saddam Hussein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reference has already been made tonight to the way that Saddam Hussein has rounded up foreign nationals in his country and is using them as hostages and as a human shield. By any standards, the way the internal or international affairs of Iraq have been conducted shows that it is not a fit and proper member of the community of nations. </PARA>
<PARA> What should we do? We must respond to this challenge. It is always a great temptation when difficulties and dangers exist to pretend that there are reasons why nations do these things. It is always very easy to find an excuse as to why nothing should be done. It is always very attractive for the Senator Vallentines and the Democrats of this world to believe that if they feed the crocodile they will never be eaten. But that is not the fact of life. He who feeds the crocodile ends up inside the crocodile. </PARA>
<PARA> The first avenue in our approach must be to take a political solution to the problem-and that is why the Government has raised the matter within the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council, to its credit, reacted very rapidly. It condemned the invasion by Iraq and imposed sanctions. We are now at the stage of enforcing those sanctions. It is really quite fatuous for the Democrats to say that there is no legal right for the enforcement of sanctions by running a blockade against goods entering and leaving Iraq. When the members of the Security Council passed that motion applying sanctions, they thought through and were conscious of the implications of their decision. They knew that words were not enough. They knew very well at the time that the motion had to be backed up and that the only way it could be backed up was by having a presence on the seas to stop ships coming and going. As Senator Durack and Senator Gareth Evans have said, the legality of what the Security Council did is fully mandated by Article 51 of the United Nations charter. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very crucial time for the United Nations. I believe that if the United Nations does not respond to the challenge here and does not remain consistent in enforcing sanctions against the Iraqis in order to re-establish the independence of Kuwait, we will see the end of the United Nations, in the same way we saw the end of the League of Nations before the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot foresee where this is going to end and how long it will take before Kuwait is re-established as an independent country. We must maintain the sanctions. We must be prepared to take, after a reasonable period, further steps to re- establish the independence of Kuwait, even if it means following the example of Korea, where the United Nations in the end had to resort to military force to re-establish the rule of law in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I saw Dr Kissinger taking part in what I thought was a very responsible and moderate interview on television. At the end of the interview Dr Kissinger in effect said that if Saddam Hussein was not brought to respect the international rule of law we face the certainty in the short term of a massive conflagration in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to support the actions of the United Nations here and what the Government has done to see that the international rule of law is preserved and enforced. We cannot tolerate a system where one nation invades and conquers another with impunity. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by the Government. I have chosen to speak in this debate as a result of hearing a number of the remarks made by Senator Vallentine in particular. Some would say that one should not rise to the bait of some of the points she made, but for the record I think that some of her remarks should be responded to, because they leave an unfortunate emphasis that can be misinterpreted, not just in this chamber but elsewhere in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine made great emotional play about the Australian sailors on the three ships that are being dispatched to the Middle East as part of the Australian commitment to help solve the crisis there. She left the impression that these sailors had no choice; that they were being sent against their will and were very unhappy. I accept the fact that any people serving in the armed forces may be unhappy, concerned, and fearful of being put in a situation where quite clearly their lives could be at risk. I do not dispute that. But it should be remembered that these people are all volunteers who joined the armed forces of their own free will. When they joined the armed forces they accepted the obligations that went with it. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no parallel drawn with the sending of conscripts to Vietnam. This is totally different. These people are not conscripts and they are not being sent to the Middle East against their will with no choice. They are people who, of their own free will, have chosen to join the armed services of Australia and, in doing so, accept the obligations that go with that. Unfortunately, from time to time it may mean their having to serve in a theatre of war or potential war. I think that Senator Vallentine does the armed forces and the volunteers in it a great disservice by implying that they are being sent anywhere against their will. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine then tried to give some historical background to the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait, in particular, and the other Gulf states. I do not dispute that the history lesson she gave us was by and large probably correct. I do not dispute the fact that for a long time Iraq has disputed the boundaries with Kuwait. It could be argued that the imposition of colonial powers in the earlier part of this century created boundaries that were not agreeable to the indigenous people of the Gulf. That is certainly no different from the position in many other areas of the world which suffered the colonial experience. But we must remember that Kuwait has been recognised as a sovereign state by the United Nations (UN). </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine made great play of the fact that we should do everything according to the United Nations. By and large, I do not disagree; but I point out to her that Kuwait is a sovereign nation that is represented in the United Nations, that it is recognised as such and that its boundaries are recognised by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to Senator Vallentine that, for example, the boundaries of Africa were basically drawn up by the colonial powers during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and in the earlier part of the twentieth century. Many of those boundaries are illogical under any definition of demography, geography and ethnic composition. But the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which is made up of the independent countries of Africa, takes the view that, although those boundaries may not be the best, they are the only ones they have got, they have to live with those boundaries and they will not move away from them unless there is agreement between the countries themselves. The OAU makes it quite clear that the boundaries drawn up by the colonial powers are the ones it accepts and the ones which the United Nations has accepted in Africa. I believe that a similar situation applies with regard to the boundaries of Kuwait and its recognition as a sovereign nation. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Loosley, in an excellent maiden speech, made the point that in no circumstances would he support the undemocratic features of a number of the Gulf states with their monarchical or even semi-feudal systems of government, which are the antithesis of the systems in which we in Australia believe and which from time to time we all criticise, but that one does not overcome the problems posed by lack of democracy in those countries by allowing a country such as Iraq to invade Kuwait. On balance, Kuwait, despite its monarchical structure, probably has a better tradition of allowing some form of dissent than Iraq has had in the past 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also spoke about the role of the United Nations, and took the view that nothing should be done unless it was sanctioned by that body. However, she skated over the impact of the decisions which the United Nations has already made in putting in place trade sanctions against Iraq. Those trade sanctions are the most severe that have been imposed by the United Nations in recent times, and we hope that those sanctions will be very effective. But let us remember that the only way to ensure that they will be very effective is by backing them with actions by the Western democracies to ensure that there is no sanction busting. I believe that the quickest way to bring this matter to a conclusion is to show the Iraq Government, particularly Saddam Hussein, that we will not give in to a military invasion, that we will ensure that the trade sanctions are effective, and that, unless Saddam negotiates a political settlement which includes the withdrawal of troops from Kuwait, the trade sanctions will have a strong effect on his country. </PARA>
<PARA> During the past 20 years, I suppose, Senator Vallentine and others would have wished that there had been more effective sanctions against Rhodesia, which declared unilateral independence in 1965. If they had been enforced, a long and bloody guerilla war would not have been necessary for the majority of the population of what is now Zimbabwe to achieve their proper independence. The trade sanctions against Zimbabwe were clearly broken because they were not effectively imposed. I believe that the trade sanctions are absolutely necessary. I believe that the decision of the Australian Government to send ships to the Gulf area is covered in an international legal sense by article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Senator Vallentine did not seek to dispute that point in logic, though she tried to dispute it by assertion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine, and indeed all of us, should take note of the fact that the United Nations will now play a much more positive role in world affairs. We are now in what is called the post-postwar era when the superpower tensions between the United Nations and the Soviet Union have basically diminished to a level which now gives us a new opportunity and when the United Nations can play a role in sorting out regional disputes such as the present Gulf matter without having to deal with the superpower rivalry which in many cases over the last 20 or 30 years made the United Nations ineffective because one superpower or the other vetoed actions within the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us who have supported the concept of the United Nations will welcome this development. We are already seeing this new post-postwar era in operation when the Soviet Union has not used its veto in the United Nations Security Council but has supported the resolutions so far carried in that body and has condemned the invasion, even though only a few years ago many people would have accused Iraq of being almost a client state of the Soviet Union, which supplied Iraq with much of its weaponry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine then got quite warmed up, saying that this is `all the politics of oil'. Naturally oil plays a major part in the way countries are going to react. It is not just the United States which consumes oil from the Persian Gulf; it is all of western Europe and it is Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Japanese economy is drastically affected because of the impact of its oil imports having a rapid price increase, or Japan's having to make arrangements with such people as Saddam Hussein in Iraq to get adequate oil supplies, that affects the Japanese economy. Japan is Australia's major trading partner. Can anyone deny that that will not have an impact on Australia's economy? An adverse impact on our economy means a loss of jobs in Australia, a loss of production and the real threat of a recession which will affect ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not deny, and I make no apology for the fact, that Australia has a self-interest in the outcome of the events in the Gulf. I believe that therefore we are justified in being involved in the Gulf by sending the ships as we have announced under the arrangements that we have announced. I believe it would not be acting in Australia's best interests if we had not taken this action. I would point out to Senator Vallentine and others that on the very day the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made his announcement about our involvement in sending the ships I was interviewed and publicly went on the record in support of that decision, and I have seen nothing since to make me change my mind. I believe that the decision was correct in its concept and in its implementation. I accept that in any matter of international affairs with a situation such as exists in the Gulf events will change daily, hourly and weekly, which means that by the time the ships get to the area there may be a different situation which the Australian Government will have to weigh up at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to also hit on the head the assertion by Senator Vallentine that Australian ships will be under the direct command of the Americans and under American flag control. That is not the decision that the Australian Government has made. The Australian Government has made it quite clear that the security and the safety of the ships will be the responsibility of the Australian commanders and the Royal Australian Navy. That has been the long term policy of this Government, not just in this particular crisis but in two world wars. We always argued that Australians should be under the command of Australians and should not be put at risk by being under the command of any other nation's authority. I think that Senator Vallentine has put a very exaggerated view about the risk to Australian ships by claiming that they will be under the direct command of the Americans or somebody else. That is clearly not the case in the decisions announced by the Australian Government in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Vallentine claimed that all the Arab countries were against Australia. A number of Arab countries have indicated that they support the Americans in one form or another. They include Egypt, Turkey-which is less an Arab country but is a Moslem country-Syria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and I think also Amman. Again, I admit that none of those countries is a practising democracy as we would like to be the case, but I point out that the Arab world is not united behind Hussein. I think it is quite remarkable in view of the history of the region that a number of Arab countries have indicated in one form or another their support for the Western democracies and the action that they have taken so far. </PARA>
<PARA> I say also to Senator Vallentine that I know it is difficult for her to argue her point without it appearing that at times she could be supporting the Iraqi Government. I accept the fact that she under no circumstance supports the Iraqi Government in its activities. She is, as I am, a member of the parliamentary branch of Amnesty International, which has condemned and is horrified by the political oppression that has gone on in Iraq. But the difficulty she has-and I think she has to take note of it-is that in her emotional way of putting her case she could easily be misconstrued by others outside this chamber as supporting in some form or another the activities of the Iraqi Government. I think that she ought to be very careful about that. As I say, I am not going to accuse her of supporting the Iraqi Government because that is preposterous, but if one is arguing her position it has to be very carefully put. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing I want to comment on concerning this issue is the question of perception versus reality. There is one area in the Australian community where I think perception has taken over from reality in this public debate. It is the question of consultation between Australia and the United States of America. I have no doubt that the major criticism made against the Government over this decision is the perception that we made the decision only after we received a phone call from the President of the United States. I am aware of the background to this decision. Before there was any consultation in telephone conversations between the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of America, the Australian Government was already well under way internally in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence and amongst Cabinet Ministers in making the decision that was finally made public I think last Thursday week. </PARA>
<PARA> But of course because there was consultation and a conversation between our Prime Minister and the President of America this was a very easy way for people in this country who basically have a cynical or critical view of the United States to portray the situation as though this decision was made only because the Americans wanted us to make it and we jumped when they rang us. It is clear that that is not correct. It indicates that it is very easy for people to promote a view based on a perception which is emotional and very difficult to counter. In a sense in the Australian community at the moment it may not do rational decision making much good if people are willing to believe this sort of perception. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my colleagues said to me today that perhaps Bob Hawke should have said to George Bush, `Ring back tomorrow', rather than have the discussion. Clearly that would have been preposterous. That is a flippant suggestion but it is raised because of the perception that some people are willing to promote, that we in Australia do things only when America makes that phone call. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look back over the record of this Government in the past seven years we see that there have been many occasions when Australia has indicated its opposition to American foreign policy. In fact, I could probably think of half a dozen right now-among them the MX missile; the American policy in Central America; the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty; Cambodia. There is a whole list of areas where Australia under this Government has had a different foreign policy view from the Americans and has stated it publicly. But it seems that when we do agree with the Americans people forget that we have had differences of opinion and claim that we act only as a clone of America. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine and others do not promote a decent debate in Australia by creating an emotional perception rather than debating the reality. I think Australia is part of the Western alliance, not just the American alliance. It is the Western alliance of like-minded countries with a commitment to democracy, pluralism and all the freedoms that are written in the UN Charter. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that when we have a situation in which one military dictatorship decides of its own volition for its own good to invade and take over another country for its own self-interest, the democracies of the world have no alternative but to be very tough and say, `The line is drawn. We are going to take all action necessary to resolve the situation'. If peaceful mediation is not able to resolve it, then in the end, I hope with UN support, we may have to take even more direct positive action involving some force. We just cannot conduct international diplomacy when we allow an individual-in my view a madman-to ride over all reasonable, rational approaches to diplomacy by using the power of the gun. In the end we have to stand up to that and I think Australia has done the correct thing. I support the motion and hope it can be carried unanimously in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The state of crisis in Kuwait understandably leads us to this being the priority item for our first day of the resumption of Senate sittings. Indeed, weighty contributions have been made from both sides of this chamber and the other place. The motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) received unanimous and overwhelming support today not only in the House of Representatives but also in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have indeed a grave situation in the Gulf. A highly militaristic dictator has, against all international law, invaded a smaller neighbour. That total invasion has been followed by a further gathering of tanks and scores of thousands of troops on the border of Saudi Arabia. This is a time, then, for resolution and decisiveness and this is at the heart of the motion moved by Senator Button and supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill. I, too, support the motion. In the brief time that remains, I wish to underline that support with some remarks of my own and reference to some few matters that have not yet been touched upon in the contributions of other senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to congratulate Senator Loosley on his excellent maiden speech in this chamber. All of the intelligence, emotions, commitment, analysis that he put into that first contribution are entirely welcome in this place because they go to the issue of priority at this time-the determination by the nations of the world to stop, to rebuff, this invading dictator of Iraq. I welcome, as well, the contributions, that have been made by my colleagues, Senator Durack, Senator MacGibbon and others that have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this debate has only been spoiled by the contribution that was made by Senator Vallentine. None of us doubt her sincerity. We acknowledge that she has views entirely different from the rest of us, certainly supporters of the Government and the alternative government in this chamber. I know that all senators have an entitlement to express views and we listen to those views carefully. But I doubt whether one senator, apart perhaps from some of the Democrats, was moved by the contribution made by this lone voice. To me her speech displayed a simplistic, sincere naivety that people were made of sugar and spice and all things nice. At a time when there is such enormous risk to the world, to international law, the solution to this grave crisis in the Gulf, is to plant a bed of flowers along the Kuwait border and hope that this militaristic aggressor will somehow withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us recognise that Senator Vallentine gave assent to the proposition that Iraq should withdraw from Kuwait, but, nevertheless, in an appeasing way she sought to set out some case for Iraq's actual claims to Kuwait over the last 25 years. I am dumbfounded that there can be such a set of excuses can be given, even however sincere they may be, from one senator who, as a person, as many know, I respect. But I believe that this is the only detraction of significance that we have had in the debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate today. This totally contrary, and I believe unrepresentative, view in terms of the people of Australia has been put to us by one senator from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have a much more minor difference of view. In fact, the amendment that they put forward seeks to take out one subclause of the motion that is before us. The fifth point of the motion speaks of support for the Government's decision to send ships of the Royal Australian Navy to the Middle East to assist. Those are the words that the Democrats are seeking to withdraw from this motion. No doubt Senator Coulter, in speaking after me, will go to why those are the only words that the Democrats are seeking to withdraw. Otherwise they will be supporting the motion. I totally reject the amendment. I think it is entirely inappropriate. But I put their relatively mild opposition down to pragmatic politics. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, I believe, understood by us all that the Democrats would have supported ships going if the United Nations had adopted the next stage beyond the Security Council's unanimous acceptance of international sanctions against Iraq-the actual commitment of a military force under the United Nations auspices, such as the force that is there now at the invitation of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, if that force had been invited after a resolution of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are on the record as saying that they would have no difficulty in seeing an Australian military commitment, such as the three ships that we are sending-indeed more-being part of such a United Nations force. They only draw back that one step, I believe, for political, pragmatic reasons. I did not see the same oozing sincerity in the speech earlier today of the Leader, Senator Powell, of the Australian Democrats. So I despise that kind of minority pragmatism by a few who have not sustained their argument in this debate. But, as I say, Senator Vallentine's position is entirely another matter. I believe that she displayed no capacity to judge the kind of gravity in which the world is placed in facing up to Saddam Hussein and his brazen invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it entirely clear that there is no ambiguity in the Opposition's position of support for the serious decisions that have been taken by this Government and which are before us in the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Government. Right from the outset the Opposition has judged the gravity of this situation and has seen that the invasion of Kuwait must be checked and repelled and that sanctions must be so effective that in fact Iraq withdraws from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussions over the past week, some have drawn two lines in their consideration of the Gulf crisis: one, with regard to Iraq's coming to Kuwait and the other, with regard to the threat of a second stage of invasion into Saudi Arabia. Some speculate in those conversations that at least the prompt and effective action by the United States and other allies of Saudi Arabia, in moving on to Saudi soil and being in the Gulf with ships, has deterred what most likely would otherwise have been the further aggression of the Iraqi military into Saudi Arabia. But in this debate I have not heard that anyone is resiling from the goal of all of us as allies in this matter-to see an actual total withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. It is no satisfaction for those of us who have taken part in this debate in the Senate to see merely the stopping of a further invasion of Saudi Arabia, a further spreading of the Iraqi menace. So, we need to acknowledge clearly that Saddam Hussein's objective will have been achieved if he is enabled to sit tight in Kuwait. He must fully withdraw.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that there has been a minority point of view expressed here by Senator Vallentine and, it would appear, some of the Democrats and perhaps some of the socialist Left of the Labor Party. At least, that is what has been reported to me in informal conversation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, I acknowledge to Senator Collins, who is across the way and appearing to interject, that in the Caucus discussion of this matter there was reportedly unanimous approval of the Government's actions, the Government's announcement and, indeed, of the terms of the motion that has been moved in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister and in the Senate by the Leader of the Government, Senator Button. I therefore accept that whilst there was an appearance, a perception, put about yesterday that the Government was being hauled over some coals by the socialist Left, the persuasion of the Government has been total, at least for the time being.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a propensity in the Labor Party for that solidarity to be broken down. Let it be fully understood that there is such a bipartisan and genuine support for the proposition that is before us in this motion that there ought to be all the more decisiveness in this chamber to ensure that the objective of Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge as well that there has been some confusion, particularly in the period between 10 and 17 August, about the Prime Minister's announcement in his reference to a blockade and the subsequent contradiction of that by the Foreign Minister. Indeed, even now it is not entirely clear what the rules of engagement are or will be and it is still not clear what the structure of command is in the Gulf. All of us hope that there will be a clear resolution in the United Nations to see that command structure under the blue flag of the United Nations. We also hope there will be a clear and unequivocal resolution for making the sanctions decision effective by a military commitment on the part of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> But short of that, the Opposition acknowledges the prompt placement of a military deterrent by the United States; indeed with the full support of Australia and of so many other allies. Indeed, it is pathetic-and rightly pathetic-that the only opposition expressed even within the Arab League to this solidarity with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait has been by Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Two and a half countries against the world. Two and a half countries are prepared to be influenced by this militaristic dictator of Iraq. I hope that we will see such a United Nations decision as I and many others have expressed a desire to see in the coming days. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to conclude by making just a few references: the response of the Soviet Union under Gorbachev has been singularly positive, along the lines of international law and of enormous significance in its solidarity with the other allies seeking to contain and repel Iraq. This is the outcome, I am sure, of the super power dialogue that we have all not only observed but also encouraged over the last five years at the summit meetings and in disarmament conferences. Let us be absolutely sure in this Senate that it is peace through strength. It is through an ultimate military deterrent in the hands of the West-in particular the United States-that we have seen the success of that dialogue. That has been an essential reason why we have seen such unanimity in the Security Council and indeed in the deployment and cooperation of Soviet forces along with the West in this Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to make this brief observation about assessing Australia's military capacity. In all our debates that sometimes focus on Fortress Australia, there has been an underplaying by this Government of the need for a military capacity such as we now see is required in the Gulf. Too many members of the Government of all factions, have tried to assert that the only military capacity that we need is the littoral defence of the territory of Australia and clearly this is an inadequate assessment of our military capacity. We do need to deter aggression in the way that we are now committed in the Gulf. We do need to act in consort with allies from time to time, as we are now. We do need to keep open sea lanes and lines of communication. We do need to safeguard essential world resources for their access by the nations of the world. There are lessons too with regard to the need of a two-ocean navy and also lessons with regard to the need for immediate response by all three of Australia's Services. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not sufficient time for me to go on to my own assessment of the instruments-the mad, brutal and ruthless instruments-that are in the hands of the dictator of Iraq. I cannot refer to his military capacity or to Islam and his call for a jihad; to his calling up an anti-establishment socialist reaction against the sovereign sheikhs in the various Arab countries; or to his brutal intimidation of his own Cabinet colleagues-disagreeable generals or disagreeable minorities such as the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no time to refer to the instrument that he has now placed in his own hands of horrifically using foreigners as hostages, as human shields in his military pursuits. These instruments are unusual, but they are instruments in the hands of a ruthless man. That is why I welcome all those in this debate who have talked about a time for resolution, a time for decision, a time for action and a time for constraining such a person with these instruments that he is in fact using. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that from the beginning right through to this point and indeed in the days ahead, the Opposition stands ready to see not only in support of the motion as before us, but in a bipartisan and genuine way, a resolute action by Australia along with allies to gain the objectives that we all hope for. </PARA>

<PARA> Tonight there have been a number of speakers who opposed what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and this Government have done in sending our ships to the Middle East. They said, amongst other things, that it was something that the United Nations should do. But we have heard these same cries before. We heard them in 1928 when the League of Nations brought about the signing of the general treaty on the renunciation of war, the preamble to which said that the signatories were persuaded that the time has come when a frank renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy should be made, to the end that the peaceful and friendly relations then existing between their people may be perpetuated. Yet by the end of the next decade we had seen the invasion of Ethiopia and of Abyssinia, the annexation of the Sudetenland and Austria, and German tanks rolling remorselessly through Poland and France. So much for the appeasement of the 1920s and 1930s, and so much also for the appeasement of the 1990s!</PARA>
<PARA> From those people who have been very forthright in their apologies for Saddam Hussein there has been criticism that what we are doing is contrary to international law. That is not the case. The actions which we have taken and which other nations of the free world have taken are not only justified under article 51 of the United Nations Charter, but they are also justified under customary international law. In 1962, when the United States brought about a blockade of Cuba, on 23 October, the day after, the Council of the Organisation of American States resolved that member states take all measures, individually and collectively, including the use of armed force, to prevent the Government of Cuba becoming an active threat to the peace and security of the continent. Those same sentiments have been echoed by the Arab nations in their condemnation of the actions of Saddam Hussein and in their endorsement of the actions of the free world in opposing his brutality and his tyranny and in supporting and imposing a blockade upon Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The only thing that is achieved by the vacillation of the Australian Democrats and their friend Senator Vallentine is the wholesale ravaging by Iraq of Kuwait. I want to know how many Kuwaiti women have to be raped, how many innocent civilians have to die and how many more small nations must be ground under the heels of tyrants before the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine find some common sense, find a collective backbone and find the will, the courage and the commitment to stand up for free nations throughout the world and to recognise our responsibilities as international citizens. We do have responsibilities as international citizens, responsibilities that grow more and more important as we see the changing of the world, and as we see the end of the Cold War era. These are responsibilities which Australia as a nation and which Australians as responsible human beings must embrace wholeheartedly. These are responsibilities which I am very pleased to say the Government and the Opposition recognise, and I have great satisfaction in saying on behalf of the National Party that we willingly associate ourselves with this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I would add as a personal note that I had to think very long and hard on this matter because I have never come into this Parliament wanting to ask another Australian to go to war; I never wanted to ask any young Australian of my age to do anything that I was not willing to do myself. It would have brought me a great deal more personal satisfaction, Madam Acting Deputy President, if I had been one of the people going there rather than one of the people having to make the decision. But the decision has to be made and I believe that it is a time for resolution, a time for courage and a time for a commitment to a world order where peace can be brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> We are running very short on time this evening, so I will conclude with one thought, a thought that was written by Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery at the end of his book, History of Warfare in an epilogue on the ideal of peace. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA>The true soldier is the enemy of the beast in man and of none other, and it is a soldier's hope that one day will come, a golden sunset, when the last post will be sounded over enmity and strife and a glorious sunrise when reveille will waken the nations of the world to an era of goodwill and peace. </PARA>
<PARA>This can be achieved only if nations such as Australia have the courage of their convictions, have the willpower to back up the words with action to ensure a free world for all. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the National Party we welcome the Prime Minister's statement today; we wish the crews of Australia's ships a safe voyage and God speed, and I wish them to know, and we should recognise, that they are acting to bring about a new world, a new world order and a new security for all and that their contribution will be valued for many, many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just cannot help but reflect on the closing remarks of Senator O'Chee and suggest that perhaps when that sunrise and that sunset occur he may be looking in the other direction and may miss them altogether, because indeed the conditions of the recent past are quite unlike those conditions which have obtained previously, particularly in relation to the uniformity of United Nations agreement in relation to sanctions. We may indeed be at the dawn of that day, but unfortunately many people, as I have indicated, may be looking the other way. They are looking back in history instead of looking forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I begin let me just make one remark. I understand that in the early part of this evening several members of the Opposition were critical of the Australian Democrats for not being present at the beginning of this debate. I just want to put on record that we obtained our copies of the Budget Speech at 7 o'clock, unlike Opposition senators, who I believe obtained theirs at 5.30, and we were rather busy with that Budget material. </PARA>
<PARA> The present situation is indeed grave, and it is one in which it is extremely difficult to make black and white judgments. Throughout this debate one of the things I have found rather depressing is the attempt to gloss over many issues in which there are indeed shades of grey and to misrepresent the case which has been put by the Democrats and was also put by Senator Vallentine. For instance, it has often been claimed that the exhibition of nuclear capability by Western nations throughout the period since the Second World War has prevented the outbreak of a further world war, perhaps with the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed I think that was hinted at tonight when Senator Baden Teague used the line again: peace through strength. I merely observe as a person who has worked in science for most of my working life until I was elected to the Senate that it is very difficult to draw a judgment from an experiment in which there is only one observation. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been the exhibition of nuclear strength since the 1940s and we have avoided a major world conflagration using nuclear weapons. But that by no means indicates logically that had the trillions of dollars that have been spent on military preparedness for war been spent in addressing the serious problems which beset the world in terms of the differences between rich and poor, the differences in access to resources, and the problems which beset us because of lack of democracy-to which many honourable senators have drawn attention this evening in the debate-then it is at least arguable that the world may well have been a safer place now than had that money been spent as it has been on military preparedness. I do not think anybody can gainsay that argument. It is at least as plausible. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar situation obtains here. There is a case to be made-and it has been made by the Government and the Opposition-that following the imposition of the United Nations sanctions it was necessary to go in and insist that those sanctions were backed up by military force so that essentially a blockade was imposed on Iraq. The contrary view, which the Democrats and Senator Vallentine are putting, is that the United Nations, for the first time with almost uniformity, has imposed sanctions, and we believe it would have been wiser to wait and see whether those sanctions could operate, given the fact that this is the first time in history that there has been such agreement between the nations of the United Nations with respect to the imposition of sanctions. We will never know-as this was again an experiment of one-which course of action was objectively the correct action. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is a great pity, given that this is the first occasion on which the United Nations has imposed sanctions, that America, Australia and a number of other nations were not prepared to wait just a little longer to see whether those sanctions would not become effective. Should they become effective the sunset and the dawning to which Senator O'Chee was referring would have been visible. We would have had a demonstration of circumstances which in future would have been a very powerful object lesson. We could have turned around the trillions of dollars that have been spent on military preparedness to peaceful settlements and the imposition of sanctions imposed by the United Nations would indeed have been effective because they had been effective in this case.</PARA>
<PARA> In opposing the particular paragraph in the Government's motion we are not, and I believe Senator Vallentine was not, in any sense condoning the actions of Iraq or Iraq's dictator, nor are we excusing those actions. By pointing out the history which has led to this situation we are attempting to draw attention to the fact that it is extremely unwise to go into a situation like a bull in a china shop and be unaware of the longer term consequences which flow from that action. There is-for the reasons that have been mentioned, particularly by Senator Vallentine tonight-a long history of anti-Western feeling throughout the Arab nations. The imposition of sanctions by the United Nations, of which the Arab nations are a part, may well not have allayed the longer term objections or the augmentation of ill feeling towards Western nations which may well flow from the imposition of a military closure of Iraq at this time. Had we delayed a little longer, and had the United Nations decided to impose that military blockade, then I believe the possibility of a longer term Arab backlash to that action would have been very much muted. </PARA>
<PARA> I found that much of the argument, particularly that put by the Opposition and to some extent by the Government, somewhat hypocritical when several speakers who have spoken about the rule of law, and the rule of international law, are the same people who have been party to the sale of military equipment to other nations, nations which may provoke a situation similar to the one that we now have in the Middle East and, indeed, did not raise any serious objections when countries such as America invaded countries such as Panama and Granada, or when the Indonesian nation invaded East Timor. I think, as Senator Powell pointed out, that we have compounded the situation in East Timor because we have signed an agreement with the Indonesians to exploit oil which really should belong to the East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the final point that I want to make. We need to see this war in a somewhat longer context. We are seeing a run-down in the non-renewable resources of this planet. We are seeing the larger populations more voraciously devouring the last resources of the planet. We will, unless we are careful, see more and more of these conflicts arising. To be spending money on military preparedness without addressing the very serious problems of resource depletion, and the inequity of distribution and access to those resources, is simply to leave to our children a situation in which these types of conflicts which we see in the Middle East will become more general, more widespread and more frequent. In that context it was particularly distressing to see in the Budget brought down by the Government this evening, a decrease in the amount of money devoted to those environmental considerations which address these problems while at the same time spending substantial amounts on military preparedness. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Australia's SWF preparedness strategy has, since the early 1980s been based on four key elements:</PARA>
<PARA> - a substantial recurrent expenditure program to provide an emergency response capability using the sterile insect release method (SIRM) technology at a facility in Laloki, Papua New Guinea (PNG);</PARA>
<PARA> - monitoring and surveillance activities in the Torres Strait/Cape York area, at ports and off-shore by quarantine authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> - detection activities within Australia by animal health and abattoir inspection authorities; and</PARA>
<PARA> - development of nationally co-ordinated strategic and operational plans for responding to an actual incursion of SWF.</PARA>
<PARA> This strategy orientation has been largely influenced by the judgement that natural spread of the SWF population (Old World species) endemic in PNG, across the Torres Strait Islands and down the York Peninsula of northern Australia posed a very real entry threat. While this judgement was based on scientific evidence available in the late 1970s, it is now clear that the risk of SWF entry by natural spread from PNG is very low. Ten years of intensive monitoring of the Torres Strait region has shown no evidence of any SWF population movement from Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA> However, no scope is seen for terminating or winding back the Torres Strait/Cape York monitoring program.</PARA>
<PARA> Significant limitations have also been identified with the development work to achieve a SIRM based emergency response capability at Laloki. These problems relate to the lack of sovereign control over the Laloki site, throughput capacity of the irradiation equipment, difficulties in developing field release techniques and the possible need to use strains of SWF other than the PNG strain for SIRM in an outbreak.</PARA>
<PARA> In light of the revised assessment of the risk of a natural incursion of SWF and, given the limitations of the SIRM development work in PNG, the work at the Laloki facility will not be continued. However, SIRM is the only proven technology for eradication of SWF, having been used by the USA over a 30-year period to eliminate populations of the New World species from North and Central America, and a program of work has been developed for reconsidering the role which that technology will play in Australia's SWF strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> The national working group report sets out `blueprints' for three different SIRM capabilities for Australia's future SWF preparedness strategy and recommends that they be fully developed and costed over the next twelve months before a final decision is taken by Government and industry. Immediate action to address the lack of a short term SIRM capability for Australia has been taken up and satisfactorily resolved in discussions with the United States Department of Agriculture to develop a framework agreement for access to the expertise it has proven in field operations. In effect, this will involve topping up the considerable body of new technology that was developed at Laloki with relevant elements of the US SIRM capability so that Australia can mount a SIRM program.</PARA>
<PARA> The programs that have complemented the Laloki SIRM project will continue to play a crucial role in the future. Given that it is no longer realistic to assume that a SWF incursion could be quickly eradicated, it is extremely important to up-grade and give greater focus to monitoring, surveillance, detection and outbreak planning measures.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure is also recommended in a new area of preparedness, viz the development of a model taking into account the economic, climatic and biological variables relevant to predicting the likelihood of SWF establishment in Australia, its possible spread, production losses and control costs. The threat/consequence model will utilise objective assessments of the elements supporting SWF incursion threat judgements made in this report, but far more importantly, it will provide guidance to decision makers as to which long term SIRM option to pursue and for the management of any SWF incursion in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) received the final report of the New Zealand research project in December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The report's major conclusions were:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) A more sensitive test has been developed that can detect very low levels of the chalkbrood fungus.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Viable chalkbrood spores were detected in 12 of 15 samples tested from honey produced and packaged in both the North and South Islands of New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) A significant reduction in the number of viable chalkbrood spores occurred in honey held at 65 degrees C for 4 hours and at 70 degrees C for 1 hour. No viable chalkbrood spores were detected in honey held at 65 degrees C for 8 hours or at 70 degrees C for 2 hours.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Samples from the honeys tested as per 2 (ii) above were subjected to 70 degrees C for 2 hours and no viable chalkbrood spores were detected.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Following circulation of an AQIS position paper, AQIS's assessment was that the risk posed by importation of honey of introducing chalkbrood into Australia can be addressed by requiring that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) honey be certified as originating from a country known to be free of chalkbrood; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) honey be accompanied by certification stating that all parts of the product have been held at 70 degrees C for at least 2 hours. Representative samples of the treated honey would also be tested for presence of the chalkbrood fungus by a method approved by AQIS, to gauge the effectiveness of this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> AQIS has sought information from New Zealand authorities to gauge the practicality of the above heat processing, given concerns in Australia on whether adequate technology exists to process at the required level. Once a reply is received, AQIS will consult with the Honey Research Council and the beekeeping industry to finalise this issue. If the required level is technically acceptable AQIS will contact all chalkbrood affected countries to inform them of AQIS' new requirements.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) The specific purposes assigned to each are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmanian Forest Industry Package</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1988 the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments agreed on a package of measures to deal with a range of issues arising out of the Helsham inquiry into Tasmania's Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. As access for logging operations in certain State forests was withdrawn by World Heritage listing, a $50 million industry package over five years has been committed by the Commonwealth to assist the State in restructuring its forest industry. The measures currently being put in place include: an education and training program and facilities to improve the value-adding skill base; research and intensive management and development of native forests and plantations to augment the forest resource; development of value-adding processes that diversify the veneer and sawlog sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmanian Forests and Forest Industry Strategy</PARA>
<PARA>In December 1989 the Commonwealth agreed to provide $10 million to assist Tasmania in the development of a Forests and Forest Industry Strategy. The Council which is to undertake this task includes representatives of government, industry, unions, and conservation groups. The Strategy is to provide the framework for a long term resolution of forestry issues in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth funding has been committed for the following purposes: to provide for alternative timber harvest scheduling and roading until the Strategy has been developed; to provide additional research and co-ordination capacity to support the Strategy's development; to assist the establishment of a centre at Geeveston designed to demonstrate the importance of forests for both conservation and development; to provide for research trials to assist the veneer industry; to help small scale sawmillers improve efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>National Afforestation Program</PARA>
<PARA>This three year program was introduced across Australia by the Commonwealth in 1988 to help develop an additional resource base for the forest products industries. Tasmania will receive $2,788,900 to assist the establishment of 4,650 hectares of eucalypt plantation. A further $722,050 has been committed to Tasmania for plantation research.</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmanian Woodchip Research Fund</PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian Woodchip Research Program was established in 1989 with a commitment by the woodchip export companies to contribute $350,000 per annum for five years. The Commonwealth contributed $100,000 in 1988-89 to the Program. Fifteen research projects aimed at environmental matters relating to woodchipping operations have been approved for funding under the Program.</PARA>
<PARA>Dry Sclerophyll Forest Research</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth provided $87,440 to Tasmania to assist research into the adequacy of existing conservation measures for dry sclerophyll forest. This forest type is one of the major resources of the forest industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The great majority of the laws identified by the `Meat Regulations Study' commissioned by the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC) are enacted in State legislation and are therefore beyond the direct control of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The study found that there were actually very few restrictive provisions imposed on the meat industry and there were no conflicting or inconsistent provisions within a State or Territory, but it did identify some inconsistencies and overlaps between States and Territories. The study considered the main problem with the legislation was the amount impacting not only on the meat industry, but on retailing in general, rather than a restraint of trade or inefficiency and confusion caused by any inconsistencies.</PARA>
<PARA> The meat industry is following up the recommendations of the study and I understand the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia is planning to liaise with State Governments to determine whether the legislation involved can be rationalised. The Government will, of course, support any move to achieve rationalisation between State legislation or between that of the States and the Commonwealth. At this stage we are awaiting the outcome of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation initiatives before deciding whether it is necessary or desirable to have the matter considered by the Australian Agricultural Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The AMLRDC study identified 382 Acts, supporting Regulations and amending legislation as having an impact on the meat retailing industry. Of these, 42 Acts and Regulations give inspectors power to ensure compliance. The study also found 39 provisions defining meat. I have no information available to me that would contradict these figures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Melanesian Spearhead Group's recent decision to further seek observer status for the FLNKS at the South Pacific Forum is inconsistent with the consensus reached at the 1986 Forum meeting which limited observer status to Pacific island governments on the verge of achieving self-government or independence. Australia supported that consensus.</PARA>
<PARA> During my recent visit to Melanesia, I took the opportunity to discuss this question in each country.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) When I saw the allegations made by Melbourne academic, Ms. Barbara Smith, describing alleged tax avoidance schemes involving withholding tax on interest paid to non-residents, I immediately sought an explanation from the Commissioner of Taxation. In seeking this explanation, I was mindful that over recent years the Hawke Labor Government has taken action on a number of fronts to ensure that Australia's economy was not disadvantaged through the various taxation arrangements that existed with our international trading partners. The particular legislative changes I will deal with shortly. However we also recognise that quite legitimate family and commercial arrangements exist. Given the nature and composition of Australian society, it is not exceptional that income does flow overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Despite what amounts the press reports claim, the fact of the matter is that the Tax Office investigation into the alleged rort is still in progress and until it is completed, it is premature to give a figure involved. Notwithstanding that, preliminary enquiries reveal that Ms. Smith's estimate of $1 billion is hopelessly exaggerated. Her estimate is clearly flawed because it:</PARA>
<PARA> - ignores the effect of genuine arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> - fails to take into account changes in the level of foreign debt in recent years;</PARA>
<PARA> - disregards changes in interest rates over the period; and</PARA>
<PARA> - ignores the impact of the dividend imputation system.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This Government has over successive years taken decisive action to implement significant and strategic taxation initiatives in legislation to stamp out these and other practices in order to protect the revenue and to ensure that Australia's economy is not disadvantaged through the various taxation arrangements with our major international trading partners. For example:</PARA>
<PARA> - 1987: introduction of the Thin Capitalisation rules with effect from 1 July 1987, which deny deductibility of interest payments by companies, trusts and partnerships where certain debt : equity ratios are exceeded;</PARA>
<PARA> - 1988: introduction of the Debt Creation rules with effect from 1 July 1987 which deny deductibility of interest payments in certain capital restructuring arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> - 1989: release of draft Accruals Tax legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> - from 1 July 1990: proposed introduction of the Accruals Tax legislation which will bring to book unremitted income which had been accruing offshore in non-taxable forms; and</PARA>
<PARA> - from 1 July 1991: proposed introduction of the Passive Investment Fund rules which will supplement the Accruals Tax measures.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commissioner advised that the level of compliance with the laws in this area is a matter which the ATO has had under active investigation, as evidenced by some recent successes in court. As with all taxes, the ATO seeks a high level of voluntary compliance. But where that fails, the full force of the law will be used to assist. Investigations of cases in breach of the rules have been and are being vigorously pursued and contested with some notable successes. In the Melbourne Branch Office alone, the ATO has 210 such cases pending, involving $14 million tax in dispute. Income Tax Rulings have also been issued to confirm the Commissioner's attack on arrangements where non-resident beneficiaries were never intended to receive the benefit of purported distributions. The Taxation Office recognises that in this and other areas it has to remain vigilant to protect the revenue from schemes which seek to exploit the taxation laws. While the ATO is confident of success, the work is resource intensive and there are difficulties at times in obtaining evidence, particularly from overseas. With the proposed introduction of provisions relating to the admissibility of documents maintained in foreign jurisdictions, the ATO will be able to go a long way to redress the position and continue to ensure that the taxation laws are fully complied with.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Pending the outcome of the ATO's investigation, the Government considers that the existing legislation and the success of the ATO's attack are sufficient at this point in time to stem the alleged withholding tax rorts. As regards the withholding tax rate, the Commissioner said that the taxation law has for many years provided that distributions to non-resident beneficiaries of Australian resident trusts attract a withholding tax of 10. That income may also be taxed by the country of residence of the beneficiary. Any suggestion to increase the rate of interest withholding tax would be out of step with most other countries and international standards, would require revisiting all our double tax treaties and would impinge upon the normal commercial raising of funds from overseas. From a commercial standpoint we must be in step with our major trading partners and accordingly no change to the rate of withholding tax is anticipated at this time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Investigations by Austrade in response to an article in The Australian of 27 November 1989, which quotes Mr Tilbury's complaints about Austrade, regarding the 1989 Hanover Technology Fair, have been unable to establish any lack of interest let alone obstruction with respect to Mr Tilbury's inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This specific allegation was thoroughly investigated by Austrade following the article quote above. Whilst Austrade was unable to prove beyond doubt that no erroneous advice about Austrade's participation in the 1989 Hanover Technology Fair was given to Mr Tilbury, it was unable to identify any Austrade officer who had given Mr Tilbury any such erroneous advice, and I understand that Mr Tilbury, also, has been unable to identify any officer.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Austrade shares the cost with its clients for certain of its export facilitation services. Regarding the honourable senator's point about how long inquiries take, relative to direct channels, there is obviously no simple answer as this depends on the nature of the inquiry. However, the very large number of trade inquiries successfully processed by Austrade, the growth in demand for Austrade information, and the positive feedback received from many exporters, suggests that inquiries through Austrade are in general handled to the client's satisfaction with regard to timeliness and quality of response.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As already mentioned, Mr Tilbury's complaint was extensively investigated in late 1989. As the Hanover Technology Fair in question took place just one year ago, I consider that further investigations at this late date are unlikely to be of any benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) People with infectious diseases may be allowed to enter Australia depending on the disease and the purpose and duration of the applicant's proposed stay in Australia as well as the likely cost to the public health and welfare systems as determined by a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth. Applicants with active Tuberculosis (TB) cannot enter Australia until they are made medically non-infectious and those with a history of TB are placed on an undertaking to report to State or Territory health authorities. HIV/AIDS is a cause for rejection of applicants for permanent entry due to their potential cost.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All applicants for entry to Australia are required to meet the health requirements given effect by the Migration Regulations. Those seeking permanent or longterm temporary entry must undergo a thorough medical and radiological examination. Mandatory HIV/AIDS testing was introduced on 19 December 1989 for permanent entry and can be requested on clinical grounds for long term temporary entry. Applicants for short term entry may be required to undergo medical and radiological examination where their health is assessed to be of special significance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The health standards are determined on the advice of the Minister for Community Services and Health and are designed in Australia's interests to protect the community from public health risks, to contain public expenditure on health and welfare and to safeguard access by Australians to public health facilities and services. Countries design their health policies to meet their own particular situation and needs. Australia's policy is not dissimilar to that of the United States of America (USA), particularly in relation to permanent entry. A major difference, however, is that the USA's legislation does incorporate a detailed list of prescribed diseases which result in the rejection of applicants. Australia prescribes only TB in regulation and a case by case approach is used for assessing all other diseases and conditions against medical guidelines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (4) Australia was declared free of bovine brucellosis in July 1989. Freedom from brucellosis is declared once all cattle herds have been assessed, by laboratory examination of sera, and there is no known remaining brucellosis infection. Monitoring of cattle for that disease continues, particularly at slaughter.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Bovine brucellosis can be passed on to humans. The most effective method to prevent infection of humans is to eradicate the disease from cattle in Australia. Hygienic preparation, handling and treatment of foodstuffs, eg milk, meat and meat products, can minimise risk of infection where bovine brucellosis has not been eradicated. The disease is primarily of concern to occupationally exposed groups, in particular veterinarians, dairy farmers and abattoir workers. Consumers are not at risk if meat is handled and cooked by normal hygienic methods.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Cattle showing clinical signs of brucellosis are not slaughtered for human consumption.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Carcase parts (uteri, testicles etc) which may harbour Brucella bacteria may be hygienically separated from meat during the dressing process and condemned. Brucella bacteria may also be eliminated from meat by cooking.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The spread of brucellosis in cattle may be prevented by separation of herds which tests show are clear of brucellosis from other herds and, wherever appropriate, destruction of infected animals. Quarantine and destruction of infected cattle would be used to prevent spread should the disease recur in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, much of the information sought by the honourable senator is over ten years old, relates to repaid loans, and the relevant documentation is now dispersed through several Departments and is no longer readily available. In light of this, I am not willing to commit the time and resources to acquire and examine some thirty years of records to obtain the information requested.</PARA>
<PARA> The following information relates to those loans currently guaranteed by the Commonwealth which are still outstanding for Ansett, the only organisation other than Qantas and Australian Airlines for which loan guarantees have been given for the purchase of aircraft:</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Is experience of the special requirements for Antarctic expedition ships important in the process of seeking and arranging the charter of such ships.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does Anderson Hughes, the firm engaged as the Antarctic shipbroker, have experience in chartering Antarctic expedition ships.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is an individual named Chris Mercer employed by Anderson Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Does the company Beaufort receive payment for every visit of the Icebird to Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Given the acknowledged concerns over a possible conflict of interest situation, were any investigations made of the owners of Icebird; were any inquiries made prior to the awarding of the charter with a view to ascertaining if P&amp;, or any of its senior officers had any interest in the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Can a copy of the special purpose ship certificate in relation to the Icebird be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Was there any additional cost to the Antarctic Division through taking delivery of the Aurora Australis in Newcastle instead of Hobart; if so how much.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) What was the value of work done on Aurora Australis by P&amp; and the Carrington Shipyard in the 9 months between the signing of the letter of intent and the signing of the charter contract.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Who was responsible for formally accepting the Aurora Australis and certifying that it was in accordance with the Division's technical requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) When the Antarctic Division set out to construct the snow and ice runway at Casey was advice available from within the division that the concept might be fraught with problems and not practical.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) In view of the findings of the 1985 Review of Antarctic Air Transport Options that an airstrip in the Casey area was technically feasible but operationally impractical, why did the Antarctic Division spend at least $1.1 million on trials in 1989-90 to be told the same thing by the RAAF.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Was the RAAF provided with a copy of the 1985 report, and briefed on its findings, before becoming involved in the project.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) What was the Antarctic experience of the replacement captain and first officer on the Icebird on the last voyage of the 1989-90 season.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) Given that the requirements for Antarctic experience, as specified in the request for proposals for the replacement Antarctic vessel in 1986, was: captain-ice strategy experience for at least 4 years in Antarctica in a similar sized vessel; first officer-at least 2 years in Antarctica in a similar sized vessel and a good understanding of ice strategy, why did the Antarctic Division allow the crew change to Icebird.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) The Senate Estimates Committee was told on 17 May 1990 that the necessary requirements for Antarctic experience, specified in the invitation to submit final bids for the charter to replace the Nella Dan, were not included, in detail, in the contract for the Aurora Australis; why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Does the Icebird comply with the present requirements of the International Maritime Organisation Code of Safety for Special Purpose Ships when loaded with cargo fuel.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) In the Senate on 25 May 1990, Senator Richardson included cultural and social problems in a list of reasons why the substantially cheaper offer by the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Institute of their Antarctic marine research vessel, Akademik Federov, had been rejected, what specifically were these problems, bearing in mind that Australian expeditioners have worked very successfully with the crews of chartered ships from Denmark, Germany, Norway and Canada, and the Prime Minister has recently announced a special postage stamp to commemorate Soviet/Australian co-operation in Antarctic marine research.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1886" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The tender documentation issued by the Department of Administrative Services seeking offers for shipbrokers to the Antarctic Division contained the following:</PARA>
<PARA> ``the Division requires the service of a shipbroker experienced in Antarctic/Arctic shipping trade to assist in the location of a suitable vessel and preparation of charter documentation''.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In their submission for the brokerage contract, Anderson Hughes Australia provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Due to the large and diverse operations of our Australian activities we have, outside of our own overseas offices, an extensive list of broking/shipowning and agency contacts in every major shipping centre throughout the world''.</PARA>
<PARA> ``In London our own office is a long established member of the Baltic Exchange and we work closely, although not exclusively, with them. We are also in direct contact with other major brokers such as Clarksons, Galbraith, Thorntons, Braemar as well as many smaller companies. It is our experience that for Polar vessels, whilst London is a central location, the control of ships is primarily on the Continent or Scandinavia and we have more direct channels into these Owners/Operators. For example we have a direct dialogue with J Lauritzen (Owners of the ``Dan'' vessels), Reiber Shipping, Icebird Management, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> ``In 1983 the chartering operations of AHA were merged with the Ship agency operations of Beaufort Shipping Agency Company (BSAC) under one central management. Since that time they have both worked side by side as it is our belief that expertise in both these operations is essential for us to provide the best possible service to our Clients. All our Chartering Brokers have spent time in Agency to gain this much needed experience. Through this combination we have extensive experience in the operation of vessels for the Antarctic primarily through our Hobart office of BSAC where we have for many years been involved with the vessels operating out of that port to the Antarctic. The manager of our Brisbane Chartering office, Chris Mercer, has chartering experience of Polar vessels from his time in London''.</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Department of Administrative Services and the Antarctic Division were satisfied that Anderson Hughes was fully competent to provide the necessary broking services.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Refer to the advice from Anderson Hughes Australia in the answer to (2).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) This information is not available to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The tender documentation stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``It should be noted that to avoid the appearance of a `conflict of interest' the selected broker is to be precluded from offering a vessel owned or closely associated with itself''.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Purchasing and Sales group of the Department of Administrative Services was aware of the close relationship between Anderson Hughes Australia and Beauforts, and that Beauforts were the provisioning agents for the Icebird, it understood that there were no direct or indirect ownership or financial links between P&amp; Australia and the owners of the Icebird other than a normal commercial customer/client relationship.</PARA>
<PARA> P&amp; Australia Ltd have confirmed that they do not have any interest or involvement in MV Icebird or Icebird Management GmbH of Hamburg.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) A copy of the certificate has been provided to the Honourable Senator. Copies of certificate available Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Apart from some travel expenses for Antarctic Division officers involved in the acceptance of the vessel under the one voyage charter, there were no additional costs. These costs are not easily quantified as officers were required to be in Newcastle in the lead up to acceptance of the vessel, irrespective of whether delivery was in Hobart or Newcastle. The voyage from Newcastle to Hobart and several short voyages out of Hobart were used by Divisional personnel to check and commission equipment and for training and familiarisation with equipment installed on the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) P&amp; Polar Australia advise that this information is considered to be Commercial in Confidence between the Ship Owner and the Ship Builder.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Ship Project Manager of the Antarctic Division.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) &amp;(11) Advice from Antarctic Division personnel who had inspected the proposed site at S1 during the previous summer, was that the construction of a runway was feasible. This has since been confirmed as a result of the work carried out during the 1989/90 summer.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1985 report with respect to Casey was based on consideration of a site at Lanyon Junction, whereas the site used for runway construction in 1989/90 was near a location known as S1. The 1985 report found that the Lanyon Junction site was remote from Casey station and would, therefore, require substantial and costly self-contained support facilities and staff, and that it was subject to poor weather conditions. The S1 site, however, is relatively close to Casey station allowing operational support to be provided from Casey, and provides a greater margin for landing beneath any cloud ceiling than Lanyon Junction. The 1985 report estimated that up to 30% of flights might have to return due to deterioration of the weather after the flights commence. The Bureau of Meteorology advise that, based on the procedures which they now propose, the number of return flights due to a deterioration of the weather after a flight commences should be substantially less than 30%, and probably of the order of 10%.</PARA>
<PARA> During the 1988/89 summer a RAAF pilot and a facilities engineer visited Casey to examine the feasibility of using various sites for landing Hercules C130H aircraft. Their report concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> The concept of air operations from Hobart to Casey is not a new one and many studies have been conducted in the past. This study along with the previous ones has come to the same conclusion that air operations are feasible. At present there appears to be no real constraints to the commencement of scheduled operations in October/November 1990, provided upgrading of facilities and runway construction proceed without any significant problems.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the S1 location for the proposed runway the report noted that;</PARA>
<PARA> ``Overall no significant problems can be foreseen with this site''.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) No, the 1985 Report was not provided to the RAAF. As stated in answer to (11) above the report is not considered relevant to the 1989/90 exercise.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) The replacement Captain had previously undertaken one voyage during the 1988/89 season and two voyages during the 1989/90 season as First Officer on Icebird in the Antarctic.</PARA>
<PARA> The replacement First Officer had no previous Antarctic experience but had gained ice experience in the Baltic sea and on the Canadian East Coast.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) The Antarctic Division was satisfied with the experience of the proposed Captain and First Officer for the voyage to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) The requirements for crew had been developed at a time when it was expected that the vessel would be chartered from overseas. The Government subsequently indicated a preference for an Australian crewed vessel. A number of provisions were included in the ten season Charter for Aurora Australis to protect the Commonwealth's interests. The experience required for Navigation Officers under the Charter was provided in response to Senate Question on Notice No 1340 on 20 December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) The vessel is in possession of a current SPS Certificate valid until 11 October 1991. Icebird Management GmbH have confirmed that the SPS Code is not affected by carrying a cargo of fuel.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Department of Transport has advised that it is not aware of any reason why the carriage of bulk cargo fuel . . . would invalidate the Special Purpose Ship Safety Certificate issued to Icebird. The Department of Transport further advises that The SPS Code covers the safety aspects of construction, machinery and equipment and does not address cargo stowage except for the carriage of explosives.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) In the Senate on 25 May 1990, Senator Richardson advised the reasons for the decision by the Tender Evaluation Committee, which included a representative of the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Transport and Communications, to accept the Icebird instead of the Akademik Federov. Senator Richardson indicated that there were a number of major reasons for the decision and among the less significant concerns about the Akademik Federov was a concern about cultural and social problems. Given that there would be a large number of expedition personnel onboard the vessel from quite different cultural (particularly language) backgrounds, and for extended periods of time, this was a matter of some concern, but was certainly not the major consideration.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Given that the Antarctic Division's Strategic Transport Plan states that Icebird has `potential for environmental problems as fuel is carried in tanks against its outer hull', and that the Akademik Federov is built like the Aurora Australis, with fuel tanks inside the double skin: what importance was given to the protection of the Antarctic environment from oil spills, in the selection of the Icebird over the Akademik Federov for the 1990-91 season charter.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Advice received during the meeting of Senate Estimates Committee C was that the decision to decline the cheapest tender for Akademik Federov was made simply because the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute offered a voyage charter, not a time charter: I therefore ask why the Akademik Federov was even shortlisted if a voyage charter arrangement was unsuitable.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At a meeting with Anderson Hughes, did the agent for the Akademik Federov offer to provide a written quote in Australian dollars, as an alternative to the original quote in US dollars, and was this offer declined, with assurances that the Antarctic Division would be informed, and that the currency of the quote was not a deciding factor in the evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Can the Minister provide a table of the basic daily charter rate for Icebird, for each season from 1985-86 to 1989-90, in deutschmarks, plus the quoted daily charter rate in deutschmarks for the proposed 1990-91 season charter.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Given that the 1985-86 to 1989-90 charter contract for the Icebird, a German ship, was in deutschmarks, I ask the Minister why, in 1990-91, the owners will receive half the daily rate they received for all seasons of the previous 5 year contract, adjusted only to allow for inflation.</PARA>
