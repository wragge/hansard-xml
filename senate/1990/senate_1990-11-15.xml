<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I have the honour tonight of introducing legislation to finally establish a proper national framework for the regulation of the non-bank financial system in Australia. Following a series of crashes in the non-bank sector, the Bill is designed to restore investors' confidence in the Australian financial system by providing them with investment avenues which are supervised and secure. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-bank financial institutions (NBFI's) provide an important alternative to the dominant deposit taking institutions-the banks. Even though bank deposits are guaranteed by the Reserve Bank, market niches are filled by NBFI's. This arises from regional, social or even structural factors. Indeed there is an innovative proposal for a Building Society for women currently before the Victorian Government. Special conditions will apply to loans during pregnancy and maternity leave. Certainly the Australian Democrats support the choice and diversity which NBFI's provide. </PARA>
<PARA> However the non-bank deposit taking sector has lost market share since bank deregulation. The number of building societies has halved in the last four years. Many have converted to banks and many have been acquired by banks. Others have failed, losing hundreds of millions of investors' funds. The Farrow Group is a spectacular example of the result of inadequate supervision. Several Credit Unions and Friendly Societies have also run into trouble. Clearly strong supervision is necessary to protect investors' interests. </PARA>
<PARA> To many people it is absurd that Australia remains a collection of States as opposed to a Nation. Unfortunately some people still seek to divide our great country on the basis of some arbitrary lines ruled onto a (still incomplete) map of Australia in London during the l9th century. </PARA>
<PARA> Happily the heads of Australia's various Governments have finally sat down and commenced a process of efficiency, rationalisation and reconciliation and hopefully will embark on the setting of national priorities and national goals and actually achieving them. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in this area the result of the Premiers' Conference has been disappointing. The proposal emerging from the Conference seeks to set up a cumbersome bureaucratic structure with Boards in each State in turn reporting to yet another National Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no clear lines of accountability, no national scheme and no guarantee by the Reserve Bank. Yet the Reserve Bank in its charter has been given responsibility over the Australian financial system. </PARA>
<PARA> We should take a lesson from the long and weary process to achieve uniform companies legislation and put the ultimate responsibility for our financial system where it should rest: with the Reserve Bank and the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> To date Australia as a whole has been the loser because of the archaic division of responsibilities which were necessary to achieve the compromise of which the Australian Constitution is the result. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with respect to non-bank financial institutions the lack of efficient supervision and the consequent problems experienced by some sectors of industry cannot be blamed on the Constitution. There is specific power granted to this Parliament to make laws with respect to financial corporations. This Parliament has exercised that power. </PARA>
<PARA> The blame lies with successive Federal Governments who have failed to proclaim Part IV of the Financial Corporation Act. Presumably this inaction has been based on the notion of States' rights. This is a nebulous concept usually reserved for justifying reactionary positions by those seeking to maintain their particular sphere of influence. </PARA>
<PARA> The usual outcry which follows any attempt to introduce some reason into our society has been muted lately. No small credit for this should go to the increasingly statesmanlike actions of the New South Wales Premier. Whilst vehemently disagreeing with many of the policies of his Government I pay tribute to his efforts to bring conservative politics into the modern era. I hope his Federal colleagues support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Incredibly Mr Keating and Mr Fraser have rebuffed attempts by the States to transfer the responsibility for the regulation of NBFI's to the Commonwealth via the Reserve Bank. This is an amazing and ironic role reversal in inter-governmental relations!</PARA>
<PARA> Surely there is no greater national economic responsibility than the health of the financial system itself. If the financial system collapses so does our economy. Along with it goes personal and community prosperity. Eventually our society would disintegrate. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed the Reserve Bank has a responsibility for the stability of the financial system as a whole. How can it fulfil such a responsibility adequately when it only has an indirect role in the management of the nonbank financial sector?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill seeks to complete the national prudential supervision role of the Reserve Bank. In fact, in the case of Building Societies and to a lesser extent Credit Unions, the Reserve Bank does in fact indirectly support these institutions by supporting the banks who from time to time need to provide liquidity or other assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> This existing structure is obviously deficient because ultimately a bank (which operates in competition with NBFI's) will need to support an ailing NBFI. Commercial considerations will be at odds with the protection of the NBFI. Clearly such a system is untenable. This potentially severe problem will be remedied by this Bill and consequently an improved financial system will result. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to transfer to the Reserve Bank the responsibility for the prudential supervision of financial corporations. Currently the provisions contained in Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 have not commenced operation because the proclamation necessary under the legislation has never been made. While using the structure of that legislation the content has been expanded and brought up to date. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 of the Bill proposes to amend the Principal Act to ensure that the currently dormant Part IV will commence when this Bill commences, which Clause 2 of the Bill determines will occur at the time of Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> From that time onwards the Reserve Bank will have supervisory power with respect to the asset ratios, lending policies, interest rates and other matters concerning NBFI's as well as the powers over banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Prudential controls will be enacted by a proposed new Part IVA which will treat the deposit taking institutions that is building societies and credit unions in a similar manner to banks. Minimum risk weighted capital adequacy ratios will be imposed on all these institutions. Initially Building Societies and Credit Unions will be subjected to a minimum ratio of 8%, which is the rate that currently applies to banks. There is separate power in the Bill to vary the ratio for the different categories of NBFI's. This initial level is also the level chosen by the Victorian Government in a Bill which is currently before that Parliament concerning proposed prudential supervision measures for Building Societies. </PARA>
<PARA> These ratios will replace the various liquidity ratios which currently apply under State legislation. There is also a power to vary the capital adequacy requirements where it is expedient to do so in the interests of members or depositors of the institution. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition a prime assets ratio will be imposed on both building societies and credit unions at the initial rate or 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Further measures are also proposed to ensure the liquidity and the solvency of these deposit taking institutions and societies. A specific national liquidity and solvency fund for both building societies and credit unions. These funds will not be pooled between the different entities. Consequently the distinct industry structure of the various NBFI's will be maintained. These funds will commence six months after Royal Assent to allow time to arrange the matters with the States and to transfer existing funds. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further set of provisions which ensure the Reserve Bank may intervene in respect of significant asset acquisitions by building societies and credit unions. This power would only be exercised in extreme cases to safeguard the interest of depositors. One recent example of an NBFI putting too many eggs in one basket is the Dreamworld investment made by the OST Friendly Society. The investors have no say in the actual portfolio decisions made by trustees or fund managers and hence some broad prudential controls in this area are needed in some extreme circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> No action is proposed by this Bill in respect of merchant banks, finance companies, trustee companies or non-deposit taking societies including terminating building societies. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean no reform is necessary in respect of these entities. On the contrary the Australian Democrats see an urgent need for extending appropriate measures to these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> For example we support a consolidation of the various Trustee Acts to simplify and streamline trust, and especially estate, administration. The Companies and Securities Industry Legislation also needs reform in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, there is also an urgent need to obtain uniform consumer credit laws in this country. The States are considering the issue, however nothing substantial has yet been achieved. Hopefully the recent Premiers Conference will provide some momentum to this process. </PARA>
<PARA> Next we need to turn our attention to the national regulation of Friendly Societies. It is understood that the question of the supervision of Friendly Societies is being considered as part of the review of the Life Insurance industry being conducted by the Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. That office may well be a more appropriate regulatory body than the Reserve Bank. Nevertheless this Bill brings Friendly Societies under the registration and statistics provisions of the Financial Corporations Act for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes to delete the now redundant reference to Papua New Guinea in the Principal Act. The reference arose because of PNG's status (as an external territory) at the time of passage of the original legislation. All the penalty provisions of the Principal Act have been increased by 500% to restore their real value. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President this Bill represents merely the first stage of the Australian Democrats vision for the financial system in Australia. Uniform national prudential supervision will help to restore the confidence which is currently lacking in the NBFI sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The next stage would be a transition to a genuine national administration system. Such a system would embrace all financial corporations and investment vehicles such as unit trusts. Obviously extensive consultation and agreement with the States would be necessary to facilitate such a system. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we envisage a situation where after a sufficient period of active prudential supervision some or all of the various categories of deposit taking NBFI's will qualify for the deposit guarantee which is currently enjoyed by depositors in banks. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Following the question on my Bill for an Act to provide for voluntary answers to statistical surveys for all surveys save the census itself passing in the negative on a tied vote in the Senate, I now present a new Bill for an Act to amend the ABS Act 1975 to provide for parliamentary supervision of the collection of information for statistical purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to allow for parliamentary scrutiny and, if necessary, rejection of statistical proposals within five sitting days of its tabling in both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present arrangements if the Government Statistician wishes to make a compulsory survey then he is required to table his proposals in both Houses of Parliament. There is currently no provision to reject or vary the proposals. This fact makes me wonder why the Statistician did not table the present household expenditure survey which is a compulsory one and thus differs in a most significant way from previous surveys which were voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only surmise that the reason was to keep the increased size, inquisitiveness and expansion of the survey from the view of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The current household expenditure survey has caused great contention, concern and harassment in the community despite denials by the Statistician. </PARA>
<PARA> The Statistician is asking people to disclose intimate details of their household income and expenditure of a most personal nature. Information that could not possibly be of value for determining the CPI, average weekly earnings and pension increases. Information such as the size and nature of bank loans, the collateral offered for them, access to people's bank managers, and other such information up to and including production of their income tax returns. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for having a privacy Bill to protect your tax file in one area when in another area the Statistician can ask you for your tax return. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government Statistician has become far too aggressive and assertive and has savaged the parliamentary process and the Clerk of the Senate. For his own reasons and against competent advice from his officers he decided not to table the proposals for the household expenditure survey and yet wanted to compel answers from people on the grounds that the survey was no different from previous ones. This is patently ridiculous and has been admitted by officers of the Bureau in the Estimates committees because other surveys were voluntary and if this one is compulsory that is a significant difference. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will allow for parliamentary scrutiny of survey proposals and their acceptance or rejection. Acceptance will give proposals the authority of parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA>COMMONWEALTH AND STATE HOUSING AGREEMENT (SERVICE PERSONNEL) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill gives effect to the renegotiation with the States of existing agreements on the provision of housing for members of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>Under a series of agreements made between 1945 and 1979 the Commonwealth advanced funds to the States to construct houses to be used by Defence Force personnel. The Commonwealth was required to lease the dwellings at a rent which covered all State costs including the principal and interest payments on the Commonwealth loans, repairs and maintenance, insurance and administration. Ownership of the houses remained with the States, with a State acquiring possession once a house was no longer required for Defence purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>As at June 1987 some 14,000 Defence houses had been provided under these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>The agreements were unsatisfactory in many respects. With ownership remaining with the States, the Commonwealth was unable to trade in the houses with a view to improving the quality of the Defence housing stock. Additionally, the arrangements with the States could not provide the greater flexibility in Defence housing that became necessary as operational requirements led to changes in the location of Defence personnel. As far as the States were concerned, as the houses could not be returned until they were no longer required for Defence purposes, they had no certainty that a house would become available for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government established the Defence housing authority in 1988 as the single agency responsible for meeting Defence housing needs. With the commencement of the authority, it was opportune to approach the States to renegotiate these agreements, with the aim of having the authority assume control of all Defence housing. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the renegotiation terms offered to the States the Commonwealth assumes ownership of 50% (by value) of the agreed stock of Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) houses, with the other half handed back to the States. This handback is to be achieved over five years, with 60% of handbacks to occur within the first two years. The renegotiation agreement deems the handback period for most States to have commenced on 1 July 1989. The outstanding debt on the houses is to be shared equally between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA>All States, with the exception of South Australia, have agreed to the renegotiation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill enables the Commonwealth to enter into the necessary agreements, obtain title to houses, and to forego half of the outstanding debt owed to it by each State. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Agreement with the States will result in the transfer of housing assets valued in excess of $600 million from the States to the Commonwealth. It is planned that up to 4400 houses from the stock transferred from the States will be sold. </PARA>
<PARA>Houses of equivalent value will be returned to the States. Some 4200 houses will be handed back to the States over the first two years of the agreement, and around 7000 over the full five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Liability for debt totalling approximately $110 million will be transferred from the States to the Defence Housing Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The 7000 houses to be returned to the States will require replacement. The bulk of these will be funded from the existing Defence housing program. However, approval has been given for the Defence Housing Authority to borrow an additional $250 million for housing acquisitions. A further 2000 dwellings will be leased. </PARA>
<PARA>The improved quality of the 7000 replacement dwellings will result in the Department of Defence paying increased market rentals to the Defence Housing Authority. In the current financial year the part year effect is expected to be approximately $2.5 million. By the end of the handback program in 1995-96, rent payments will have increased by approximately $24 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA>The renegotiation will provide the Defence Housing Authority with title to a significant housing asset. Once it obtains title, the authority will be able to trade in those houses. Over the five year period of the agreement, 7000 houses will be made available to the States for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA>In all, this is a most satisfactory result. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill gives effect to the Government's undertakings to establish a new form of housing assistance for members of the Defence Force who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985, and puts in place arrangements for the sale of the franchise to provide loans under the new scheme to the National Australia Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the Government's desire to establish a form of housing assistance which would encourage home ownership for members of the Australian Defence Force and which would provide an incentive for individuals to remain in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises the need to ensure that Defence Force personnel do not suffer any detriment in relation to home ownership as a result of the nature of their employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The new form of housing assistance provided in this Bill is designed to meet these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme is available to all members of the Defence Force who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985. In general, those who enlisted prior to that date remain eligible for assistance under the Defence Service Homes Loan Scheme, although those in this category who are still serving and have not exercised a Defence Service Homes Loan entitlement may elect for assistance under the new scheme. Personnel in this position will be advised of the provisions of the new scheme and will be required to make their election by 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence Force personnel will generally need to have served for at least 6 years in order to become eligible for the new scheme. There are, however, special circumstances where this requirement will not apply, such as where an individual is involved in operational service in the Persian Gulf or is discharged as the result of a compensable medical condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme provides eligible personnel with a subsidised housing loan of up to $40,000. Interest on the loan is subsidised to the extent of 40% of the average interest that would ordinarily be payable over the term of the loan; the individual will be required to meet the remaining 60%. </PARA>
<PARA> With a view to retaining personnel in the Defence Force, the Government wished to ensure that the extent of assistance was linked to continuing service in the Defence Force. Thus, the subsidy will be available for the period of completed years which the individual continues to serve beyond the initial six year qualifying period. For example, a member of the Defence Force who has completed 14 years service is able to receive the subsidy for a period of 8 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The loan may be taken out either during service with the Defence Force or at any time up until two years after the individual has left the Defence Force. The subsidy is available for a maximum period of 20 years. In order to become eligible for the subsidy, the individual will be required to reside in the house for which the loan has been provided. The loan may be transferred from one house to another while the individual serves in the Defence Force, and once during the first two years after the individual leaves the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA> On 17 August 1990 the Government announced that the franchise to provide loans under the new scheme had been sold to the National Australia Bank. The bank will pay the Commonwealth $42 million for the franchise, plus an additional annual commission, the amount of which will be dependant on the number of loans taken out in the year. The commission will commence at $975 per loan, increasing to $2700 per loan by the year 2002. </PARA>
<PARA> Outlays on the new scheme will be dependant on the extent of take-up of subsidised loans. Assuming a take up rate of 8%, outlays in the 1990-91 financial year would amount to $135,000 rising to $1.779 million in 1991-92, $4.187 million in 1992-93 and $7.712 million in 1993-94. These figures do not take account of those personnel who elect to relinquish their entitlement to a Defence Service Homes Loan to take up assistance under the new scheme, a figure which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will provide the framework for a worthwhile and effective scheme of housing assistance for Defence Force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> There is, I think, no doubt that the closing years of this decade will be remembered as one of the bleakest chapters in Australia corporate history. It is a period which has witnessed the collapse of a number of major players on the Australian corporate stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Tragically, these collapses have brought with them some appalling losses of shareholders' and investors' funds. They have also brought to light evidence of outrageous irresponsibility and excesses on the part of the directors and management of some major corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> The damaging effects of this behaviour on Australia's reputation in the international marketplace has been all too obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> These events, Mr President, have indelibly underscored the Government's long held belief that corporate regulation and investor protection in this country has been inadequately served by the co-operative companies and securities scheme which had its genesis in a 1978 agreement between the then Commonwealth Government and the States. </PARA>
<PARA> A major flaw of the co-operative scheme has been the lack of a single, clearly defined line of Ministerial responsibility to a single Parliament for the operation of the scheme. No single Minister or Government has been able to be held properly accountable for the regulation of companies and securities in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome has been fragmented administration, ineffective use of resources and the lack of consistent, co-ordinated and coherent direction in regulation and enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> As Honourable Senators will recall, Mr President, the Government sought to redress the shortcomings of the cooperative scheme by the introduction in 1988 of an historic package of legislation designed to bring the administration of companies and securities law for the first time under a single and truly national regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The centrepiece of that legislation was the Corporations Act enacted by this Parliament in 1989 with strong business and investor support. That legislation brought together into a single legislative instrument the law regulating company law, company takeovers and the regulation of the securities and futures industries. In so doing it established a single line of ministerial and parliamentary responsibility for companies and securities regulation consistent with the fundamental principles of parliamentary democracy on which our society is founded. </PARA>
<PARA> Sole responsibility for the administration of those laws was conferred on a new national regulatory authority, the Australian Securities Commission, under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now a matter of history that the validity of the corporations legislation was challenged in the High Court by some States and that the High Court earlier this year decided, on the basis of a strict interpretation of section 51 (xx) of the Constitution, that the Commonwealth could not legislate with respect to the act of incorporation of trading and financial corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> That decision did not, however, reflect upon the capacity of the Commonwealth Parliament to exercise its plenary legislative power with respect to the governance and activities of such bodies after the formal act of incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the High Court did nothing, Mr President, to diminish the resolve of the Government to proceed on a national basis with the much needed reforms enshrined in the Corporations Act and the Australian Securities Commission Act. Events that had unfolded in corporate Australia between the introduction of that legislation in 1988 and the handing down of the High Court decision had provided further dramatic emphasis to the urgent need for the Government's proposed national regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accordingly sought urgent negotiations with the States and the Northern Territory with a view to gaining Australia-wide agreement for a scheme of national regulation which, while based on the Corporations Act 1989, would give due recognition to the constitutional role of the States in relation to the incorporation of trading and financial corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations in the months following the March general elections led to the conclusion at Alice Springs on 29 June 1990 of Heads of Agreement between Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Ministers on future corporate regulation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters agreed in those Heads of Agreement are translated into the scheme to which the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect. </PARA>
<PARA> At the heart of the agreement between Governments lies, on the one hand, a recognition by the States and the Northern Territory of the need for a national Corporations Law, administered by a single regulator responsible to a single Minister, Government and Parliament and, on the other hand, a recognition by the Commonwealth of the constitutional power of the States in relation to incorporation, and the interests of the States and the Northern Territory in the formulation of company law and the maintenance of satisfactory levels of regional service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Heads of Agreement and the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill strike a balance between those various interests in the following ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The need to take account of the decision of the High Court in the Corporations Case, and to avoid any possible future constitutional uncertainties in relation to the new national legislation, are taken account of by resort to an application of laws regime broadly similar to that underpinning the current co-operative scheme legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under that framework, the Bill converts the Corporations Act 1989 into a law under section 122 of the Constitution for the Government of the Australian Capital Territory to be known as the Corporations Law of the Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporations Law will then be applied by State and Northern Territory Application of Laws Acts as the Corporations Law of each of those jurisdictions. In this way a single national Corporations Law will be enacted throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Heads of Agreement, Governments are to seek the passage of the necessary legislation through their respective Parliaments in time to enable the new national scheme to commence on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> While the application of laws regime will ensure that the new scheme, like its predecessor, is based on State and Territory law, the way in which that regime addresses issues of regulation, investigation and enforcement is fundamentally different. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place the separate roles of the State and Territory Corporate Affairs Commissions as delegates of a central coordinating agency, currently the National Companies and Securities Commission, will be replaced by the conferment of sole administrative and regulatory authority on the Australian Securities Commission. The Commission in turn will be responsible to a Commonwealth Minister and the Commonwealth Parliament. This is to be achieved by amendments of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and the conferment of corresponding powers, functions and responsibilities on the Australian Securities Commission under State and Northern Territory law by the various State and Northern Territory Application of Laws Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative regime will also greatly streamline and simplify the investigation and enforcement of offences under the Corporations Law as in force in each jurisdiction. This will be achieved by the adoption of a novel legislative device whose effect will, in summary, be to `federalise' such offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The federalising technique will involve each State and the Northern Territory providing in its Application of Laws legislation for the application to the investigation, prosecution and enforcement of offences under its Corporations Law of the provisions of relevant Commonwealth laws to the exclusion of State and Territory laws. One effect will be to confer investigatory, prosecutorial and other associated powers on the relevant Commonwealth authorities and officers to the exclusion of the corresponding State authorities and officers. Provision will be made for such powers to continue to be exercised by State authorities and officers in circumstances where arrangements are put in place between the Commonwealth and the relevant State or Territory government to enable the most efficient and effective use to be made of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, for all practical purposes, offences under the Corporations Law of each jurisdiction will be treated as if they were offences under Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA> The same `federalising' technique will also be adopted by State and Northern Territory Application of Laws Acts to ensure that Commonwealth laws relating to freedom of information and judicial and administrative review of decisions of regulatory authorities under the Corporations Law apply to decisions under the Corporations Law to the exclusion of State administrative law regimes. Commonwealth judicial and other authorities and officers will exercise their powers under those laws to the exclusion of any corresponding powers conferred on State authorities and officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise of jurisdiction by the courts of the States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the Federal Court will similarly be the subject of a special legislative regime to give effect to the intention of Governments that the new scheme have, so far as is practicable, the characteristics of a single national law. </PARA>
<PARA> Parallel civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Law will be conferred on the Supreme Courts of each State, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This important outcome of the Agreement between Governments will ensure freedom of choice to litigants between a local Supreme Court and the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The national character of the jurisdictional arrangements will be achieved by the cross-vesting of civil jurisdiction between the several State and Territory Supreme Courts and the Federal Court.  In this way, the relevant State or Territory Supreme Court, or the Federal Court, Will be able to be seized of all litigation relating to a particular matter irrespective of the particular State or Territory jurisdictions in which the various associated causes of action arose. As part of the crossvesting mechanism, courts will have the discretion to transfer matters to other courts where it is in the interests of justice to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistently with the `federalising' of the investigation and prosecution of offences under the Corporations Laws, criminal law jurisdiction will be exercisable exclusively by the relevant State, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory courts in much the same way as offences under Commonwealth laws are, under the Judiciary Act, tried by State and Territory courts. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be achieved by the cross-vesting of the relevant State and Territory courts with jurisdiction to deal with offences under the Corporations Law of each other jurisdiction. No territorial limit will be placed on the jurisdiction of those courts to deal with indictable offences where those offences are alleged to have been committed either outside Australia or under the Corporations Law of the relevant State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> To avoid the legal and practical difficulties that would be involved in providing for the transfer between jurisdictions of criminal proceedings in relation to indictable offences in other circumstances, the legislation will place some territorial limits on the matters that may be dealt with by the criminal courts of each jurisdiction. Under these provisions the courts of each jurisdiction will be limited in such cases to dealing with indictable offences that are alleged to have been committed, begun or completed within that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions will, notwithstanding those necessary limitations, nevertheless provide considerable scope and convenience for a court in one jurisdiction to deal with associated offences that involve one or more other jurisdictions in addition to that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The courts of all States and the two mainland Territories will have full cross-vested criminal jurisdiction without limitation as to locality in respect of summary offences under the Corporations Law of each jurisdiction in the same way as those courts may exercise summary jurisdiction under the Judiciary Act in respect of summary offences under Commonwealth law wherever committed. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions of State and Territory courts exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the Federal Court exercising civil jurisdiction, under a Corporations Law will be subject to the same hierarchy of appeals as with other matters ordinarily dealt with by those courts. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other respects in which the Bill will introduce legislative mechanisms and requirements to ensure that the Corporations Laws of all jurisdictions together form a single national regime. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Bill and the State and Territory Application of Laws Acts will establish a regime for the citation of the Corporations Laws of each jurisdiction that will enable a simple reference in any instrument to the `Corporations Law', without more, to suffice, as a matter of law, as a reference to the Corporations Law of the relevant jurisdiction, or to two or more such laws, as the case requires. This will add simplicity and legal certainty to such things as documents filed with or issued by the Australian Securities Commission and indictments, pleadings and orders filed in or issued by courts exercising cross-vested jurisdiction under the national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Of special importance is the way in which the new regime will deal with the matter of incorporation. As a consequence of the decision of the High Court in the Corporations Case the incorporation of companies will continue, as a matter of constitutional necessity, to be rooted in the Corporations Law of a particular jurisdiction. That apart, the Corporations Law of each jurisdiction will, for most purposes of companies and securities regulation, treat companies incorporated in other Australian jurisdictions in the same way as companies incorporated in that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> At the practical level, incorporators will be able to seek incorporation under the Corporations Law of a nominated jurisdiction by filing the necessary documentation at any ASC office in Australia. Moreover, the legislation will enable filing and other obligations of an Australian incorporated company under any one or more Corporations Laws to be fully discharged under all of those laws by complying with the obligation in any one Australian jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> There will, however, be one area of regulation in which existing differences from jurisdiction to jurisdiction will be preserved for the time being. This is the area that can be broadly termed `fund- raising' by the Crown in right of a State or Territory, by State and Territory public authorities, by other local statutory bodies and by special classes of corporations such as building societies, cooperatives, credit unions and friendly societies. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there has been no suggestion amongst Governments that the incorporation or governance of such bodies should come within the new national scheme, there is a significant body of opinion, with which the Commonwealth is in agreement, that a single national fundraising regime should apply to most such bodies when they seek to raise funds outside their own jurisdictions of establishment or incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, the State and Northern Territory Governments also recognise the need for reforms in that direction. The limited time available for the negotiation of the Heads of Agreement has not, however, enabled the implications of any reform in this area to be fully worked through by the State and Northern Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It has accordingly been agreed, and this is reflected in the legislation, that the status quo of the provisions of the cooperative scheme legislation should be continued on in the Corporations Law in relation to such bodies. This agreement has been reached on the understanding that the extent to which the new law should apply to those bodies will be reviewed by Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Ministers as a matter of priority following the commencement of the new national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The respective roles of the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory in the future reform of companies and securities laws is a matter which has formed an important part in the negotiations between Governments leading to the introduction of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. Governments have agreed that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities established under the Formal Agreement relating to the cooperative scheme should continue in operation under the new national scheme, but with a redefined role and under the Chairmanship of the Commonwealth Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> To that end a new Formal Agreement for signature by Heads of Government is currently under preparation. When that Agreement has been signed, the Government will seek to have it annexed to the corporations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the future reform process, it has been agreed that the Ministerial Council will have a consultative role in respect of all legislative proposals and a deliberative role in relation to the reform of what can be broadly described as company law matters. Takeovers, securities, public fundraising and futures will be pre-eminently matters for the Commonwealth, subject to the general consultative role of the Ministerial Council. The Commonwealth will have four votes and a casting vote in the Ministerial Council; each State and the Northern Territory will have one vote.</PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the concurrence of the Commonwealth will be required for the introduction of any company law reform proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the importance to the States and Northern Territory of the maintenance by the Australian Securities Commission of regional levels of service. To this end, a number of commitments undertaken by the Commonwealth in the Heads of Agreement will be inscribed also in the new Formal Agreement. For its part, the Government believes that levels of service in each jurisdiction will be significantly enhanced, especially having regard to the establishment by the Australian Securities Commission of a national data base for companies and a state of the art document imaging system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also agreed that Regional Commissioners of the ASC should be appointed by contract outside the framework of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and that the State and Northern Territory Ministers should be consulted in respect of such appointments. The Bill amends the Australian Securities Commission Act to provide for such appointments by contract. The Commonwealth's obligation to consult with the State and Northern Territory Ministers on these appointments will be amongst the provisions of the new Formal Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters of considerable importance to State and Northern Territory Governments in agreeing to the new national scheme has been their desire to preserve their capacity to levy stamp duty on share transactions and charges. </PARA>
<PARA> To meet these concerns the Commonwealth has agreed to the inclusion in each Corporations Law of provisions that will ensure, in combination with local stamp duty laws, that State and Territory stamp duties are leviable on off-market transactions in the securities of companies incorporated in their respective jurisdictions and that charges wherever registered have been stamped in all jurisdictions in which property secured by them is located. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the agreement between Governments for the new national scheme, State and Northern Territory Governments will forego revenue currently received in respect of companies and securities regulation. Under the Heads of Agreement the Commonwealth has agreed to reimburse the States and the Northern Territory to the extent of $102m per annum indexed in line with the consumer price index from a 1989/1990 base. An interim formula has been agreed in respect of revenue foregone in 1990-91 and is reflected in the Budget presented to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The detailed arrangements for revenue reimbursement will be included in the new Formal Agreement currently under preparation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I have already emphasised this Government's grave concern at recent developments in the corporate sector. But our concerns will not end with the passage of this Bill and the associated State and Northern Territory Application of Laws Acts. The Government has a substantial and growing agenda of matters requiring urgent legislative reform-I mention loans to directors and the recently endorsed recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on insider trading, as but two examples. </PARA>
<PARA> These and other matters will be the subject of legislative proposals that the Government intends to bring forward to the Parliament next year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime the Government is taking the opportunity afforded by this Bill to introduce, in addition to amendments necessary to give effect to the matters recently agreed by Governments, reforms that will give effect to matters on which agreement has previously been reached in the context of the co-operative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Bill will include in the Corporations Law provisions on buy-backs that correspond to those included in the co-operative scheme legislation subsequent to the enactment of the Corporations Act, and various amendments necessary to take account of fast moving improvements in technology related to a national corporate information system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also deals with a range of transitional matters. These include provisions giving effect to the agreement of Ministers that, from the date of commencement of the new national scheme, the Commonwealth will assume responsibility for the investigation and enforcement of co-operative scheme offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is also being taken to make some technical revisions to provisions of the Corporations Act that are in need of correction or clarification. One such amendment will put beyond doubt the capacity of the Australian Securities Commission, in the course of an investigation or legal proceedings, to seek a court order for the protection, or the appointment of a receiver, of the property of a unit trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill and the State Application of Laws legislation will together usher in a new era of corporate regulation in this country. The national scheme embodied in that legislative package will offer for the first time in the nation's history a single and truly national regulatory regime that can guarantee a sound and well-regulated environment for corporate activity. Without such an environment, business in this country cannot prosper as it should and investors, both at home and abroad, will lack the security and confidence that is essential to our future economic growth and well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to implement the amendments to the Export Market Development Grant Scheme (EMDGS) announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce on 28 February 1990. In accordance with that announcement, these amendments will be made retrospective to 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The EMDGS was set up nearly twenty years ago to support the efforts of Australia's small to medium-sized companies in entering and developing export markets. The Scheme provides financial incentives in the form of taxable cash grants for eligible expenditure incurred on overseas market research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators will be well aware that the Government is concerned to ensure that public funds in all areas are used in a cost-effective manner. Further, as regards export incentives, the Government is committed to ensuring that the expenditure of such public funds results in an improvement in sustained export performance. It is mindful that the EMDG Scheme is an incentive scheme to encourage Australian exporters to seek out and develop overseas markets and not a subsidy for industry. </PARA>
<PARA>With this background and a scheduled termination date for the EMDG Scheme of 30 June 1990, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce decided to initiate a comprehensive review of the EMDG and related schemes. The purpose of this review was to assess the schemes' effectiveness against their original objectives and the Government's aim to encourage a more outward looking and internationally competitive Australian industry which can contribute to improving Australia's balance of payments position. </PARA>
<PARA>To undertake this review, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce appointed a Committee in December 1988, chaired by Professor Helen Hughes, to review Export Market Development Assistance. The Committee also included Mr John Carden, Executive Director of CRA Ltd; MrAndrew Gisham, Director of Vision Systems Ltd; and Mr Bill Mansfield, Assistant Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Committee Secretariat was provided by officers of the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE). </PARA>
<PARA>The Hughes Committee presented its report to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government appreciates the work undertaken by the Committee in comprehensively analysing the current system of Government support for exporters and its strengths and weaknesses. The Committee also addressed, in a constructive way, wider issues, including the economic environment and the pace of reform. I take this opportunity to thank Professor Hughes and the other members of the Committee for their thorough report. </PARA>
<PARA>There are, therefore, two distinct but interdependent themes to the Committee's Report. The first addresses export incentives, in particular the EMDGS and the new discretionary International Trade Enhancement Scheme (ITES). The second theme addresses the wider economic policy environment and overall trade competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommended the extension of a modified open access export grants scheme for a further five years and the introduction of a selective incentive scheme for firms or industry groups that have overcome the initial difficulties of exporting and are ready for a major export effort. </PARA>
<PARA>It is against this background that this Bill introduces legislation to continue the Export Market Development Grants Scheme (EMDGS) for a further five years to 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me now outline the major changes that are being introduced in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In February this year the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce jointly released the Government's decision on the Hughes Committee Report. The Government agreed with the Committee on most of its proposed refinements to the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, exporters will graduate from the Scheme after receiving eight incentive payments; the grant rate will be reduced from 70 to 50 per cent of the eligible expenditure; the maximum grant payment will increase from $200 000 to $250 000 with an export ceiling of $25 million; and there will be a new minimum expenditure threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>The expenditure threshold, however, has only been raised from $10 000 to $30 000 (with expenditure after the first $15 000 being eligible for reimbursement) as opposed to the $50 000 threshold recommended by the Review Committee. Such a large increase would have excluded too many promising smaller exporters.</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of some of these changes to the Scheme would be to deny access to a number of smaller exporters and also to those exporters who have used the Scheme for more than eight years. </PARA>
<PARA>Turning first to smaller exporters, the Government appreciated that, in some cases, further support will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Government has proposed changes to the EMDGS that are designed to benefit those small and medium-sized firms that are endeavouring to develop and expand export markets but lack the critical mass to be truly competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>The EMDGS has been specifically structured to encourage smaller firms to collaborate more either among themselves or with larger firms. Joint ventures and consortia will be able to claim grants in their own right, provided they meet certain criteria, and will not inherit any previous claims history of their individual members. In addition, a new category of claimants-approved trading bodies-has been created to encourage trading houses to export the products of smaller Australian firms which, whilst they have competitive products, do not have the resources and/or know-how to successfully export. Small exporters will therefore have a better chance of Government support where they are prepared to work with other firms. </PARA>
<PARA>Turning now to the firms excluded by the eight year cutoff, the Government's decision to limit claims to eight was based on the well documented evidence that EMDG recipients' efforts to develop new markets reach a plateau after eight years and that only a few firms continued to open new markets after the eight year cutoff. Furthermore, the majority of the firms excluded are large firms with considerable expertise in exporting. </PARA>
<PARA>In some cases, however, the Government appreciates that additional support may be required for those eight year exporters who are proposing to enter completely new markets or launch entirely new products. Partly with this in mind, the Government agreed with the Hughes Committee's recommendation to establish a new discretionary scheme-the International Trade Enhancement Scheme (ITES). I say `partly' because we anticipate the four year Scheme having a far broader impact. </PARA>
<PARA>For a start, the ITES will replace to some extent the International Business Development Scheme and the High Technology Exporters Scheme. In addition, it will support new and more innovative approaches by Australian exporters. The Government is particularly interested in seeing the Scheme used to encourage collaboration by smaller companies through consortia and industry associations. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from some streamlining, a broadening of the definition of eligible services to include inbound tourist operators and legal and health services, and giving access to trading houses, joint ventures and consortiums of small companies, the administrative guidelines of the EMDGS will not substantially change from those that now apply. The Scheme is estimated to cost $134 million dollars but given the one year delay in payments, the first budget year for the Scheme will be 1991/1992. </PARA>
<PARA>In the February announcement, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce foreshadowed that amendments to the EMDG Act arising out of the Government's adoption of the Hughes Committee's recommendations would operate from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The need to consult widely with interested bodies about the precise nature of the new provisions required in a revised EMDG Act to give effect to the Government's decision precluded the required substantive amendments to the EMDG Act being brought forward in the last Parliamentary Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government wanted to ensure that all possible views were taken into account so that the best possible framework, within the limits of the Government's decision, was implemented in respect of the revised Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Act 1990 was passed during the Autumn Sittings as an interim measure to preserve the continuity of the EMDG Act from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the announcement of February and to limit any confusion for EMDGS recipients, amendments to the EMDG Act will be made retrospective to 1 July 1990. Exporters have been fully appraised of the Government's intention to make such amendments retrospective. To do otherwise at this stage would create needless confusion and uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA>Turning to the other side of the Hughes Committee's equation-economic reform-much of what the Committee has recommended is consistent with the reform agenda of the Government. At the same time, it is always of value to have additional and informed comment on reform priorities and how these should be addressed in both macro economic and micro economic areas. The Committee's proposals are being considered in this broader picture. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the past year, two other major reports have examined aspects of Australia's competitiveness and export future-the Garnaut report ``Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy'' and the study of ``Australian Manufacturing in the 1990s'' for the Australian Manufacturing Council. While the differences between the reports-Hughes, Garnaut and the AMC-remain important, the three reports embody a large agreed agenda for reform, including an issue which goes to the core of the whole export question. It is one which this Government regards as critical to the trade related area. We have not in this country, at least not in the manufacturing and services sector, developed a true export culture. The Hughes Committee and the AMC report found that in the wider community and business alike there is a poor grasp of the drive, commitment and risk involved in succeeding on world markets; in being world competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government wants to take what action it can to inculcate such a culture. For the present, the revised EMDGS and the new International Trade Enhancement Scheme (ITES) will contribute to this process. Education in export management has been given specific encouragement under the EMDGS, as have industry associations under the ITES, while smaller exporters, as I have already highlighted, will now have a better chance of Government support where they are prepared to work with other firms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government appreciates that these measures will not change our national attitude to exporting overnight. The Government can do more and it will be looking for new ways to pursue this important objective. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Debate (on motion by Senator Reid) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA>WOOL TAX (NOS 1-5) FURTHER AMENDMENT BILLS 1990</PARA>
<PARA>These Bills will make a number of amendments to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5) 1964. </PARA>
<PARA>The maximum rate of wool tax that may be imposed under each Act is increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>An operational rate of wool tax lower than the maximum rate may be set by regulation. The existing operational rate at which wool tax is imposed is increased from 18 per cent to 25 per cent by these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>A third measure contained in the Bills is a reduction in the rate of tax on carpet wool from 18 per cent to 3.85 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes are effective from 4 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally the Bills make provision for the introduction of a wool tax surcharge. If it is necessary to impose the surcharge, the amendments provide for it to apply from a date to be prescribed by regulation and that it not exceed a rate of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>A more detailed explanation of the provisions of these Bills is also contained in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies this package of Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interrupted in mid-sentence last night on a question I was addressing to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) representing the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) in regard to the new Medicare item on in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). I raised with the Minister a question as to whether or not this item was to be solely for the purposes of assisting infertile couples to a pregnancy. The Minister had indicated that there was a provision in the principal Act which prima facie would exclude others benefiting from that Medicare item number and that a legal opinion had been sought from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). I had also asked on what grounds the estimates of something over $4m this financial year and something over $6m in a full financial year for the operation of the new Medicare items had been projected. The response was that it was on the grounds solely of its application to infertile couples seeking to achieve a pregnancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question therefore is: if the legal opinion from the Attorney-General is received and it indicates that these items could be utilised by others, including the type of processes which I mentioned yesterday, will the Government regard that as being inconsistent with its policy decision in respect of this item and consider taking some action to amend the regulations?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would raise a matter for consideration by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). I think the analogy that has been pressed so far in the Committee of the Whole debate, with the exclusion of surrogacy situations from the IVF program, indicates that, where one has complex moral, ethical, medical issues of some controversy in the community, it would be suitable, it is said, to exclude the provision of the IVF Medicare benefits. But I cannot say how the Minister would react to an opinion which indicated that IVF could be made available for genetic screening purposes as opposed to aiding infertile couples to have a child. I think Senator Harradine has made his point that that obviously would require such a policy decision by the Minister and I am sure he will take into account all the relevant factors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn now to the National Bioethics Consultative Committee (NBCC) and refer to a reservation that was made in the Committee's report in relation to, I think, program 6. I will be brief. The questions that I placed on notice have been answered by the Department. They were obviously answered subsequent to the Committee meeting. As the Minister is aware, the NBCC has considered the question of surrogacy. The majority of the Committee supported surrogacy and indicated that there should be legislation which permits surrogacy in certain circumstances. I am going to the question of why the NBCC was established. The Minister will recall that then Senator Ryan, in responding in 1987 to the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation, pointed to an alleged attitude of the States as a reason for not adopting the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The States are not inclined to support a uniform prohibitive approach. </PARA>
<PARA>When dealing with the question of the prohibition of the structure of non-therapeutic experimentation Senator Ryan is reported at page 3484 of Hansard to have said:</PARA>
<PARA>The matter will be kept under review and the Government will further consider it in the light of experience and any evidence received from the National Bioethics Consultative Committee which the Government proposes to establish and which I now turn to. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same page, she was reported to have said that the cooperation of the States and Territories with such a body was vital `in order to achieve a national uniform approach on bioethical issues'. In respect of human embryo experimentation, the response by Senator Ryan clearly meant that a uniform approach would be undertaken, but only if it allowed for destructive human embryo experimentation. There is really no other interpretation that one might be able to put on that. Senator Ryan said that the National Bioethics Consultative Committee would be established because the States were not inclined to support a uniform prohibitive approach. Exactly the opposite has happened with surrogacy-all of the States, without exception, were against it; all of them wanted a prohibitive approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The new National Bioethics Consultative Committee, established to get some sort of uniform approach to a particular bioethical question, is making its first recommendation about a major public policy, namely, surrogacy, and it takes a view that is absolutely contrary to the uniform approach already adopted by all the States-in fact, contrary to legislation in some of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me is that here we are voting money to this outfit-the National Bioethics Consultative Committee-which is currently going about the process of trying to impose its views on all the States so that surrogacy can be approved. That is clear from the fact that it has proceeded to propose certain uniform legislation. I know that the response will be that a working party will be established by the States over this matter. But who will service the working party? It will be the National Bioethics Consultative Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister: is that a proper means of going about things? I believe that it is entirely inappropriate to in effect have this outfit trying to dictate terms to State governments on this matter. Is this not ironic, in view of the fact that the Senate Select Committee came up with a recommendation that was supported by persons from all parties, with two dissentients from one? Members from the Liberal Party and the Australian Democrats, and the Chairman, Senator Tate, and I supported a recommendation that there be a prohibition against destructive human embryo experimentation. The then Minister said, `Because there is no uniform approach in the States, we will set up the Bioethics Commission to have a look at all of these matters'. And the first thing that the Bioethics Committee does is to come down with a recommendation contrary not only to the uniform approach adopted by every State but also to the findings of committee after committee, including the findings of the Family Law Council and the findings of the Victorian Waller Committee. The Waller Committee came to the following conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . surrogate mother arrangements where fees are paid are, in reality, arrangements for the purchase of a child and should not be countenanced. </PARA>
<PARA>That matter was dealt with by the National Bioethics Consultative Committee-I admit that-but, importantly, the Committee had grave doubts whether any altruistic arrangements could be in the best interests of the child. The whole point about it is `the best interests of the child'. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my concerns in regard to the question of the rights of the child is that the basic right of the child to knowledge of its own genetic identity is now being denied in many areas of reproductive technology by official deceit. That is a question that we, as a chamber, should be concerned about. Some of these children are going to grow up asking, `Who was my father? Where do I come from?'. `Oh', one replies, `Those records have been destroyed. I cannot tell you that'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course not. But it is a question that we need to address at some stage. My worry is that we are throwing money at the National Bioethics Consultative Committee when we, as a parliament, ought to be having a good look at what this body is doing and how, once it establishes its decision, it goes about trying to push these ideas onto the States, using the resources supplied by us to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note from the responses to my questions that the National Bioethics Committee is going into the question of selective embryo reduction. That is a euphemistic term for the abortion of some unborn children in a multi-pregnancy situation. Who has been chosen to do that bioethical study? It is to be done by Dr David Healy, a pro-abortionist. In fact, he is the one who wants to do the trials in Australia with the drug RU486. These are the types of people that we are paying money to through the National Bioethics Committee. We should be very concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the Department's response to questions that I had on notice. I asked whether Mr Russell Scott or his firm have consultancies which may raise issues of conflict of interest with his membership of the Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC). I do not think the Department's response to this was up to standard. However, I must place on record my appreciation of the responses from the Department. We might not like the answers that we get. But we are not here to argue that question; we are here just to get the answers. I would like a further response listing the consultancies of Russell Scott and his firm in relation to the areas which involve consideration of bioethics. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we have that because that person is still on the Medical Research Ethics Committee and his views on the question of destructive experimentation on human embryos are quite well known. It is fair to provide an answer which is a bit more than `The Department is unaware of any conflict of interest in this case'. The Department might be unaware: that might be a factual statement. But the Department should make itself aware as to what the consultancies are and it should obtain a list of them so that they are publicly on the record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the general points that Senator Harradine made concerning the National Bioethics Consultative Committee are not matters that I need to respond to specifically except to acknowledge that, in the end, it is for those who are elected by the people in the various jurisdictions, either nationwide or in the States or Territories, to take final responsibility for these major decisions. I certainly do not believe that they should be pre-empted, or thought to be pre-empted, by a consultative committee, however eminent it might be. There is a very necessary role for elected parliaments and governments to take the hard decisions and not constantly leave them to the consideration of committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the further question of Mr Russell Scott is concerned, I understand that an inquiry was made as to any consultancies and only one consultancy was noted which in any way had anything to do with the sorts of areas that are of concern. I understand from the officials that that consultancy did not lead them to consider that there was any conflict whatsoever. But I will take further the question of whether there is any possibility of that consultancy being publicly made known. I do not know whether there are any difficulties relating to legal professional privilege as to with whom he has a consultancy. All I can say at the moment is that I understand the consultancy was looked at and that conclusion was made on the basis of an examination of that consultancy rather than just accepting the word of Mr Russell Scott. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask about Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits information. I asked a large number of questions on notice regarding classes of records held by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) and the Department of Community Services and Health. I must put on record here my appreciation of the Department for answering those questions: there were a large number. I am not asking them just for the sake of being difficult; I have a specific purpose for doing so. Despite the fact that the Department did give me a large number of answers, there are some areas that I still have queries about. In fact, some of them were a bit shorthandish and I think they need expanding. The Health Insurance Commission in its answer to my 11 questions about each class of record stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of Questions 1 to 5, 7, 8, and 10, the answers are contained in the entry in the Personal Information Digest for each class of record. I refer the Honourable Senator to the individual entries in the Digest for each class of record. In respect of Questions 6, 9 and 11 the following answers are provided in respect of each class of record. </PARA>
<PARA>Included in the classes of records on which this restriction was placed were nine classes of pharmaceutical related records which did not appear in the personal information digest. Both the HIC and the Department were made well aware in the Estimates that these records were not included in the personal information digest. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Health Insurance Commission and/or the Department of Community Services and Health to answer my questions Nos 1 to 5, 7, 8 and 10 about these classes of records as soon as possible. I do not expect the answers now, but I want to put this on the record so that I obtain them in due course. I would appreciate an answer as soon as possible to satisfy the purposes for which I require this information. </PARA>
<PARA> I also ask the Health Insurance Commission and the Department to provide me with a reason for these classes of records not being included in the Personal Information Digest. Maybe it was because the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was being transferred across. I think there should be some explanation as to why that did not appear in the Personal Information Digest. In relation to all the classes of records about which I asked the eleven questions, I noted that the Personal Information Digest does not provide the information that the Health Insurance Commission and the Department claims that it does-and this is where I talk about the shorthanded nature of the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that further information be provided in regard to my questions. The answer to my first question-What information is held in this class of record?-does not coincide with the Digest's statement that `content may include'. The answer to my second question-What information would have to be removed from this class of record to ensure that no individual could be identified?-does not coincide with the information in the Digest, which says, `Sensitive content may include'. I am asking for specific answers to my questions and the Digest does not give me those answers. The answers in respect of my questions 3, 4 and 5, asking for all of the uses of the classes of the records, does not coincide with the Digest's statement that `the purpose of these records are'. Finally, my questions 7 and 8, asking whether any of the information is transferred within the agency or integrated with other classes of records held by the agency, were not answered by the Privacy Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to hold up the chamber and I appreciate that those answers will not be able to be provided for me on the spot. However, I ask the Minister to give me some assurance that those questions will be answered by the Department as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA> All this matter relates to is something which has grown up. The Department said to me that it was developing a data retention policy. It admitted at that Estimates Committee that it was developing a policy because I had asked the questions. Whatever happens will not be able to be claimed to be a Government initiative; it will be because the Opposition asked questions about the retention of data, and very rightly so. Very sensitive data is still stored concerning every single Australian who has had any medical treatment and has received any medical benefit for that treatment. That needs to be addressed. This is not some flippant request for information that will not be used. It is to enable me to get a handle, as much as I can, on exactly what information is stored. It is appropriate for me, as a representative of the citizens of Australia, to seek that information when there is such extensive and pervasive data on our health and health records. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We asked a number of questions about the difficulties that we believed disabled people were having in obtaining employment in the public sector. If one goes out into the community, as I do as a senator travelling around the State, one gets information that sometimes is not as easily obtained as when one is here in Canberra. As I have moved around the State talking to people who are trying to implement the Government's program of moving disabled people from sheltered workshops into open employment, I have seen the problem that has occurred, particularly in some of the larger regional centres of Victoria. They have found great difficulty in placing people in public sector employment. All of us agree that if the Government has a policy of moving people into open employment, it is important that that occur for those who are able to be employed in open employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I move around, these people tell me that it is very difficult. Because of the very few public sector jobs, particularly the Commonwealth public sector jobs available in the regional and rural areas of Victoria and I presume other States as well, if the Government is not keeping up its side of employing a percentage of disabled people, it falls back on the private sector to bear the brunt of the implementation of the Government's policy. I asked a number of questions about how the program was going, particularly in relation to the public sector. In reply, Dr Harmer from the Department said:</PARA>
<PARA>From the Department's perspective we have been looking for the public sector also to adopt what we would call enlightened policies in relation to the employment of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>When I asked about a study he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not aware of any specific study the Department has done to target either public sector or private sector employment. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have had no complaints or criticisms to us about the difficulty that service providers are having in terms of getting access to public sector employers as compared with private sector employers. </PARA>
<PARA>Maybe the Department in Canberra has not had complaints but, as soon as I move anywhere near a sheltered workshop or any program where people are trying to get disabled people into open employment, I hear the problems they are having.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Harmer then gave me an undertaking that he would look into the matter, although the additional information with which I was provided does not really constitute what I believe to be an adequate answer to our questions. On page 2,544 of the additional information it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>A recent equal employment opportunities survey found that 6,676 people in the Australian Public Service were self-identified as having a disability. Seventy one per cent of the Australian Public Service did the survey and 7 per cent of the survey respondents reported a disability. Additionally, 20 people in the Australian Capital Territory are employed in the Australian Public Service under the intellectual disability access program. This program has not yet been implemented in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, that was not adequate information. The sort of evidence that would allay my concerns about whether the public sector was achieving its goals would be if the Government had 30 per cent of public sector jobs and 70 per cent of private sector jobs in a regional centre-I am just plucking figures out of the air-we could expect 30 per cent of those disabled people in those regional areas to be in the public sector and 70 per cent in the private sector. We would be looking at a distribution that reflected the distribution of the sectors in that area. That is the kind of information that should be sought, even if it is only on a sample of some regional centres to see whether the policy is working. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that my concerns about the lack of access to public service for the disabled have been vindicated. I was not privy to information-no one leaked a document to me-but not long after I asked the question the Public Service Commission launched the new strategy for the employment, retention and promotion of people with disabilities. During the launch, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) criticised the Public Service for allowing the employment of disabled people at the base grade level to fall from 5.2 per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent at present. At the very time when the Government has a program of employing disabled people, we see a decrease from 5.2 per cent to 3 per cent of disabled people in the Public Service. This does not say much about how efficient and how good the public sector has been in carrying out the Government's policy of open employment for disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra Times quoted Mr Howe as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> He said there was a clear need for action. The Government could not afford to accept a situation in Public Service inconsistent with that happening elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the very concern that I was raising-that the private sector is being expected to bear the brunt of the Government's policy. There it is in the figures. The article, still quoting Mr Howe, continued:</PARA>
<PARA>More could and should be done by the service to redress it. </PARA>
<PARA> It was essential that people with disabilities had equal access to employment, to enable them to participate fully in their communities. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same article, the Acting Public Service Commissioner, Allan Kerr, was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The time had come for a turn-around: the legislative framework was quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . legislative framework and government initiatives could be only part of the answer. Attitude was the other part, and proper attitudes in managers would be picked up by staff and translated to informed recruitment practices. </PARA>
<PARA>When I move around Victoria, I find that that is not happening in some of our Commonwealth statutory authorities and that some of them could offer employment in our regional and rural areas. But I hear comments such as, `We couldn't have someone with a handicap because they might cause an accident'. As I move around sheltered workshops I hear those comments reported by people trying to implement Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the Department have a breakdown of the employment of people with disabilities for individual government agencies since 1986? I would appreciate seeing that. That is the sort of information I was looking for, not some veiled answer. I was pleased to have what I was saying vindicated only a few days later in Mr Howe's launch. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the Department concede, because it did not concede in the Estimates Committee hearing, the relevance of my concerns about the relative difficulty that disabled people have in obtaining public sector employment? The excuse that was given to me was, `We haven't had any complaints'. But the figures tell the story. What proportion of finances provided to the disability services program is used to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service? Was the Department aware of the dropping percentage of base grade employment places in the Public Service which were being filled by people with disabilities? Does the Department agree that there is a need for better communication between individual departments and the Public Service Commission and the Department in relation to what efforts are being made to ensure equal access to employment by people with disabilities?</PARA>

The group of people who are directly affected by this change are the old and the frail, and the daily contact offered by the PACS security alarm system is an important feature in ensuring that the old and the frail are able to remain in their homes with a sense of security.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Medical alarms are issued from the domiciliary services support unit at the Repatriation General Hospital (RGH), Heidelberg. Until recently they were obtained by the RGH from the Queen Elizabeth Geriatric Centre (QEGC). The QEGC recently increased its rates by 20 per cent per week and included an installation charge of $100. As the alarms could be supplied more cheaply by a private agency, Heidelberg is now getting the alarms from MSS Alarm Services. This decision to change the supply was made simply for economic reasons. Recipients of the alarms are now being supplied with the new alarms, which operate in the same way as the QEGC alarms. The change-over is due to be completed by 23 November 1990, and I understand that some 40 clients are involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand that one of the important differences is with regard to daily contact. I think there is an extra cost of $1.50 a week between the two services, but that is more than compensated for by the service which the more expensive one offers to the frail and elderly whom we are trying to keep safely in their own homes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> This issue has been discussed extensively with the domiciliary occupational therapist at the Repatriation General Hospital, and it is agreed that there are often too many complications with the system to make it viable; that is, clients going out shopping, et cetera, and forgetting to activate, going on holidays or just not remembering. It is considered that daily contact is not the crux of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to revise an earlier answer. I understand that the MSS service does not offer daily contact on an automatic basis but is technically able to be provided within the system. I am not sure of the steps that need to be taken if the daily contact process is undertaken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am further advised that it is not possible to determine accurately the costs of treating community patients inasmuch as these costs are at the margin. For example, a community patient may be the twenty-eighth patient in a 28-bed ward and major costs such as nursing, medical, electricity and cleaning, et cetera, have already been incurred. The only additional costs in many cases are for drugs, medical supplies and some specialist medical services. I guess that is one of the difficulties in actually apportioning the costs of a group of patients against another group of patients. All the moneys are provided by the Commonwealth taxpayer. The repatriation hospitals are available for use by community patients along with veterans and therefore it is not quite accurate to speak in terms of the veterans' affairs budget in some sense subsidising community patients or other medical services. It is all taxpayers money funding the provision of a medical service. Of course that provides for veterans and then community patients. It is the provision of a service rather than directed to particular categories.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. Perhaps it was a good try, but I do not think it is a very satisfactory answer. When we look at the appropriations for the Department of Veterans' Affairs, it is surely an entitlement of the Parliament to know how much of the hospital costs are going on veterans and how much on non-veterans. It is not so difficult, knowing the bed days, to try to do a calculation of the cost of the bed days. What is difficult is to try to find out how much of the budget is going on the additional items such as I listed-limbs, appliances, surgical footwear and subsequent repairs. I believe it is proper and necessary for the Department to be able to quantify that. After all, if it were a private hospital, it would know who to send the bill to and it would be able to quantify it for that purpose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have tried to explain that the motive driving this particular exercise from the Government's point of view, and what justifies the policy-which is something which the Government stands by-is the fact, as certainly I know from talking with Tasmanian veterans, that many veterans prefer to be treated closer to their homes. I believe that the ageing profile of the veteran population in the regions away from access to traditional repatriation hospitals is the major reason underlying the integration process. The policy decision has been taken on those grounds. The question of the costs to be borne will be consequential on that particular policy decision and will not drive the policy decision. That is point that I have been trying to emphasise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department in its explanatory notes for 1990-91 stated that expenditure decreased by 2.7 per cent to $79,451,383. This apparent decrease is due to an unavoidable delay by the Department in making the June 1990 payment. This explanation was based on finance ledger information and was the best information available to the Department at that time. Subsequent advice from the Department of Community Services and Health has shown that there was no delay in payments and that the payments for June had been processed on the last working day of May 1990. Advance payments by Department of Community Services and Health on behalf of Department of Veterans' Affairs are made prior to the fourth day of each month, with the exception of July. Due to this arrangement the advance is often recorded as expenditure in the previous month's finance ledger. The Department is working with Department of Community Services and Health to resolve the statistical problems with regard to nursing home payments made on behalf of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In future the Department will have access to a wider range of information, including patients and payment details. This will provide the Department with adequate control in this area of expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>

Could it be explained to me on what basis the individual nurses are chosen, and what percentage of work does each of those layers of nursing get?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, this is probably one of the most important discussions to come before the Senate this year. I note at this stage that we are addressing the second readings of only a partial number of the wool tax Bills that will surface at various stages today and be dealt with as a full package. But it is appropriate that we get on with the job and dedicate a fair amount of time to the consideration of this most important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As everyone in Australia knows, the wool debate has very historical, and economic effects and major development consequences for our country. Certainly, anyone who traces the history of wool throughout Australia will know that it is intricately linked to the economics, politics and community development in many areas. We need to recognise that our national economy is in dire straits and that to a large extent the contribution made by wool to our economy is a most important factor. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all well aware that we are at a time when confidence is needed in so many of our industries. We must accept that the wool industry is ailing; it is in crisis, like so many other aspects of the national economy. We must deal with these issues today. They must be given urgency. I was pleased this morning when the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) agreed to a change in the agenda to bring forward these important Bills for discussion today. We are all aware that they were guillotined through the House of Representatives only two nights ago under very unsatisfactory debating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives is where the Government faces the people and where the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) ought to be making their major contributions to this major and important debate. But that did not happen. The Bills were given a paltry two hours for consideration. The Opposition was denied the opportunity to put amendments that were most appropriate and, in effect, the Government has shown a very cavalier and irresponsible way of dealing with this particular program. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that when historians take the time to look back on the debates of 1990 and the very important issues that affect the agricultural and the pastoral industries of Australia, they are going to have a field day particularly when they consider the paucity and quality of debate and the issues as reported in the Hansards of last May and, of course, in this last month or so. We have seen in the media a lot of debate from industry groups with regard to so many areas that need attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, let me highlight the fact that on the speakers list for this debate that has been circulated in the Senate today there are nine senators listed, and the Minister is listed to give a usual reply. There is not one Labor Party senator listed to take part in the debate on this important issue relating to wool. Not one Labor senator is prepared to come in here today and take up the cudgels of this terribly important industry or of his constituency. When we look at the debate in the House of Representatives and at the Labor members who participated in the debate, who do we see participated? Mr Courtice, Dr Charlesworth and Mr Graeme Campbell. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I trust that Senator Richardson was being ironic. I would invite him to read the Hansard, because it was not a fantastic debate. In fact, the inadequacy of it was highlighted. I would invite members and senators and anyone who is interested to look very carefully at the contribution by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, because he spent his entire time giving the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) a very considerable serve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to note, in considering the legislation that is before us today, that the Australian Wool Corporation has finally acknowledged what the coalition has been saying for some time: marketing alone will not get the industry out of its problems and production must be dramatically reduced. We believe that the 20 million flock reduction, together with quotas and a 20 per cent surcharge from 1 July, will not bring the supply into line with the demand fast enough. There are major issues in this industry that have to be addressed. The Opposition still believes that a major slaughter scheme is the only realistic method of bringing supply down in the short time available to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry does not have the luxury of time to deal with its problem, and to date this urgency has been missing from the measures imposed. I note that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is to proceed overseas in the next few days on an important international mission. I only hope that he is carrying in his bags the briefs with regard to the promotion of wool that are so essential. The Minister needs to know that he can go from this Parliament with the confidence that this legislation has been passed. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to maintain the floor price at 700c a kilogram, there is certainly a need to increase the wool tax to 30 per cent for the market support fund to pay for the very necessary flock reduction scheme. However, the coalition is critical that the additional 20 per cent that is being proposed for a slaughter levy would destroy too many growers and is not particularly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> Other important aspects of this legislation need very serious and urgent consideration: for example, confirmation of the operative level of 25 per cent of the wool tax; assistance to the growers affected by last year's floods, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland; the exemption of carpet wools from the scheme; and the ability to use the wool tax for the slaughter scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> I took the opportunity to review the annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation that was tabled in this chamber only several days ago. In reviewing that report, I noted that the Corporation, in its annual operating plan for 1989-90, set the following objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> * Provide greater stability of wool prices at maximum sustainable levels, subject to the costs of the stockholding. </PARA>
<PARA> * Promote wool and develop markets for Australian wool and wool products. </PARA>
<PARA> * Initiate research and development leading to greater efficiency and reduced costs in wool production, marketing and manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> * Optimise long-term returns from commercial activities of the AWC. </PARA>
<PARA> * Liaise with the Wool Council of Australia to develop industry policy and provide information and services to Australia's woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> * Report to woolgrowers and Government on the state of the wool industry and on the effective administration of AWC assets and liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>In many respects the AWC failed to meet the objectives and the criteria that it set as its own challenge. With the concurrence of the Senate-and I have shown this to Senator Robert Ray, who was in the chamber earlier-I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary of the major AWC activities in 1989-90 that was included in its annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A review of the objectives that were set and not met, the issues and the lack of concern and consultation with growers will be of concern to many honourable senators and people in the industry. We note that the AWC's operating loss for the year was $336m, after allowing for abnormal losses totalling $613m. Some serious questions certainly have to be asked and addressed. The leaders of the industry organisations have a lot to be accountable for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not hard to look at where the industry is going when it is combined with other problems in the economy at the moment. The lack of leadership by government highlights the inadequate information that has been made available throughout the year. I wonder about the exchange of information that has passed between the Minister, his Department and industry leaders. Again, in reviewing the debates of last May and the issues as they have evolved in the last six months, it is frightening to talk about the deteriorating economy, the consequences and the responses that are needed for change. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout this year we have seen major changes in the markets of the Soviet Union, China and eastern Europe. We have also seen the dramatic impact and the consequences of the oil prices, attributed, of course, to Iraq. There is a need to call into question many of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In a debate in the House of Representatives earlier this week on a matter of public importance on the crisis in the rural sector, the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, made a most important contribution. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This rural economic crisis is not just a matter for provincial Australia or for small towns or large cities across Australia; it is a matter for all of Australia because the impact will be on the standard of living of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fischer has highlighted the fact that there is a need for urgent attention. It is a fact that Australian agriculture is shattered; investment is uncertain; the risk margins on farm loans will continue to increase; property values will fall; research will be interrupted; and the number of young and innovative people entering rural industries will fall away. The consequences of the rural crisis, such as heavy interest burdens, bank foreclosures, effects on land values, employment on the farm and employment in many associated industries, are being seen and felt. </PARA>

Dr Hewson has a grip on the economy of Australia far better than anybody in the Government. He knows exactly where the issues are and he has highlighted and knows the fundamental principles that underlie the economy. In his address to the wool conference, Dr Hewson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is a time to face reality, it is a time to force adjustments as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>On the Labor Party's view on the economy, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA>They slammed on the monetary policy brakes. They pushed interest rates higher and kept them there longer than we have experienced in this country. We have never had such a period of sustained high interest rates in both real and nominal terms and, of course, the result is what we have today. Collapses of asset prices across the board, a generalised bust in the entire private sector of our economy and of course a collapse in spending and demand. </PARA>
<PARA>Yes, the economy is on a substantial slide and it is going to get tougher because the international scene is hard and we have to recognise that. The consequences in the wool markets and the wool sector will affect many areas that need to be addressed urgently and now. Again, as I said in my opening remarks, not one Labor Party senator is prepared to come into the chamber today to contribute to this important debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the legislation, we note that the decisions which the Government took in October outline a number of initiatives that are long overdue and need to be addressed very carefully. The strategies that need to be put into place for the next three years also need urgent attention. What is the timetable? In his second reading speech, Minister Kerin has said that he hopes that a strategic plan will be tabled by 31 December. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that because of the problems with legislation in this place the Senate will sit until 21 December. It will be very interesting to see whether Minister Kerin is able to present to the Senate before we rise on 21 December the long term strategic plan that will affect the wool industry and so many areas that require attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems in the wool industry require very clear thinking and major attention at an early time. I will leave it to the other eight senators who will contribute to this debate and whose electorates are much closer to the industry area than my own to highlight the many issues that will require attention and the impacts on woolgrowers' incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me highlight the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, in the debate in the other place on 13 November:</PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that we are looking at the worst financial crisis this country has seen, certainly in recent times. I do not think that message has got through yet. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawker interjected to ask, `Just in wool?' and Mr Campbell replied:</PARA>
<PARA>No, in the entire economy. When we are dealing with wool, we are dealing with the biggest decentralised industry in Australia and one of the biggest overall employers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Campbell's address to the House of Representatives requires very careful and considered study, as do the contributions by the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd; the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, Mr Ian McLachlan; Mr Michael Cobb and Mr Ian Sinclair-people who know this industry so well. This is an important time to address the matters raised in those contributions. I am pleased to indicate that we will be supporting the legislation, but we will not be supporting the additional 20 per cent surcharge in respect of certain wool-clause 5-at the committee stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that I start by saying that what is being proposed here is in fact a maximum rate of wool tax. It is not true, as has been asserted by some, that a rate of 50 per cent will apply immediately-at the next wool sale. The operational rate will be increased from 18 per cent to 25 per cent. That is what was originally and consistently recommended by the Australian Democrats with the advice of the Australian Wool Corporation and producers. It is important to note carefully that if this rate had been applied over the past few months when some considerable amount of wool has been sold, the Corporation would have had more funds and therefore a reduced need for this surcharge. The fact is that the rate has not been available and the desperate need for funds is now causing these desperate measures to be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats have some difficulty with the surcharge. This is because it is too easy for the administrators of the scheme to simply buy and stockpile. Such actions will not resolve the problems. The actions we need are those which also address the other side of the equation-the demand side of our wool. Whatever else has happened to the wool industry, far too much attention has been given to bureaucratic means of simply reducing supply and far too little attention has been given to an imaginative means of expanding the demand for our markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I should expand on that. In some cases, the demand exists: it simply has not been expressed in hard currency. For example, there is a Soviet demand for our wool. It is pleasing to see that some alternative marketing strategies, such as credit sales, are being considered now-belatedly. These propositions would be more meaningful if some imagination were applied to developing methods of offsetting sales of Soviet Union products to Australia. The whole concept does not rely upon Zetor tractors and Lada cars, even though they may have some value in Australia. We need to look beyond what we might immediately think of when we think of trade with the Soviets. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to acknowledge Senator Calvert's efforts as he especially pointed out that a Soviet vessel could have been considered for use by our Antarctic Division. It might have been appropriate for those who were conducting our wool trade negotiations with Russia to encourage the Tasmanian Government to seriously consider purchasing a replacement Bass Strait ferry from the Soviet Union. It is an interesting irony that the likely purchase price of such a vessel is of the same order of cost as the amount recently owed by the Soviets for our most recent wool sales-that is, about $150m. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about big ticket items here-the sorts of expenses which play havoc with Australia's current accounts. Those who have been paying any attention to this whole situation would have observed that during the past several months Australia's current account deficit has suffered regularly from the burden of other big ticket items. What I am talking about here is the purchase of aircraft overseas. The problem is that now that Australia's publicly owned airlines have been given away, there is little capacity for the Government to direct purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be some capacity remaining to actively encourage purchasers of aircraft-whoever they may be-to consider some Soviet aircraft for particular applications within Australia, whether they be fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters or whatever. We seem to have our minds set that these are the sorts of things we should be buying from the United States of America or Europe. We have not seriously considered Soviet options. That is a pity because in aviation history probably one of the most notoriously unsafe aircraft has been the Douglas compilation which seemed to fall out of the sky quite regularly. We seem to have our minds set that Soviet aircraft might not be as good. The track record is that they are perfectly adequate. We just do not seem willing to consider them. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the sorts of alternative marketing strategies that should be supported when we are considering how we can expand the demand for our products overseas. I am amazed that we do not have enough initiative in these areas. Some of the things I have just suggested could and should be supported by other activities such as joint marketing ventures and direct Australian assistance in the establishment of apparel production for the domestic Soviet market. It is as though our minds are set against considering such options. It is to the peril of the Australian wool industry that there is not enough imagination and that alternative positions are not taken. Whether those schemes involve Australian participation in a domestic establishment with the capitalist system, or free market set-up-or whatever the Russians are exploring-Australian participation in offsets could be one of the options available. We could and should explore the options for different forms of equity in Soviet enterprises in return for their purchase of Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these options are not limited to trade with the Soviets. We have not seen enough evidence of imagination being applied to marketing strategies for China, Korea or, for that matter, African nations. We do not see any evidence that the people who are in charge of marketing Australian wool are addressing the problem with imagination. The requirement to apply the surcharge could be reduced if the industry itself could see the other side of the equation and not just consider reducing supply. The requirement to apply the surcharge could also be reduced if the industry could redirect its production to those segments of the market which are most likely to continue with strong sales. Of course, it is realised that such a redirection does not take place overnight. It should be recognised that it is part of a long term view which the industry should be taking. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures in this legislation are essentially short term, they are temporary and they do little to redirect the industry to a future which is sustainable. The foreshadowed quota system and the slaughter scheme do not promise long term solutions either. Anybody who understands the wool industry knows that the sheep population in Australia has fluctuated over the years. Even a proposition to slaughter about 50 million sheep this year could not have a permanent effect on the sheep population of Australia. Out of something short of 180 million sheep, 40 million a year can easily be bred each year. About that number was born this year. To propose to reorganise the industry simply by a slaughter scheme is not facing up to the direction, the balance and the profile of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Any proposal to reduce the size of the national flock should be discriminatory. By that I mean that it should not remove from our national flock any sheep from those market segments that are successfully selling all of their produce. From what I have heard of this proposed quota system so far it seems that it would be an overall non-discriminatory quota system which has the potential of removing from production those sheep which are producing the wool which we are able to sell at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In some areas it is not so much that we are producing too much wool but rather that we are producing too much of the wrong type of wool. There are market niches and wool production specialities which we should in the long term be expanding. We can immediately begin to expand those areas. Obvious areas are the fine wool and superfine wool segments. These segments should not suffer any suggestion of quotas or sheep disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I will return to one of my favourite topics-the carpet wool producers. The carpet wool producers of Australia are engaged in direct import replacement at the moment. While we have a situation where we import 85 per cent of the carpet wool which is processed in Australia, it is ridiculous to suggest that we should reduce its production by a single kilogram. From what I understand of this proposed quota system and slaughter scheme, there is no proposition to isolate any segment of the industry. We would be cutting off our nose to spite our face if we could not see the sense in identifying and discriminating in favour of those areas of the wool industry which are successfully selling the entire product at the moment. There are other regional and type specialities which we should be encouraging in any long term plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is not unified in either supporting or rejecting these proposals. It has come to my notice that there is as much dissent, confusion and discussion about this matter as there is about any number of other issues confronting Australia at this time. We have to be very careful and temperate in considering the advice we have received, whether it be from woolgrowers organisations or from so-called marketing experts. I have received a deluge of representations in my office. They have ranged from people who are involved in the industry to many people who believe they can solve the world's problems in half an hour. I understand that is fairly typical. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I have been willing to listen but, in listening, I have found that the only consensus which has been expressed is one that, for all its faults, the tax proposal has to go forward in principle. It has been suggested that the Australian Democrats should use this debate to abandon the reserve price scheme, to disband the Australian Wool Corporation and to move to a free market situation. Apparently, this is because all that is wrong in the industry can be directly attributed to the reserve price scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot accept that suggestion. It is quite obvious to me that there are many factors involved in this situation, including such things as the interest rates that we are currently suffering, the exchange rate that Australia has with the rest of the world, overseas events, climate factors and the domestic situation. There are any number of aspects and not one of them can be isolated and blamed for the faults. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned that it is my opinion that the long term picture should show an evaluation of the present production profile of the Australian wool industry. That is something that the industry itself needs to address as well as any measures that are taken here. We also have a vulnerability in certain aspects of the market where demand fluctuates. Due to circumstances beyond our control, certain countries to which certain styles and classes of wool are exported change either their capacity or willingness to buy. Our supply mix of wool is really not wide enough and our sales tactics, quite honestly, are in fact pedestrian, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> What is important to consider is a modification of our wool industry. We should do this rather than accept the suggestion that we throw the whole lot out. The wool industry has a basic soundness, a basic experience and a basic knowledge. We lead the world in terms of the industry's longstanding efficiency of production. But the administration of our industry and our policy leadership can be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford suddenly to compromise the industry and the basic experience and unification that we have by completely abandoning the established mechanisms. Such a simplistic measure would leave us with anarchy-some people describe this as free trade. Australia does not have the capacity to operate successfully in a wool market without rules and regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza interjects that we do not do too badly in the wheat industry. I can remember Senator Panizza addressing in this Senate our incapacity as a nation to meet the subsidisation that is being offered by the United States to its wheat growers, and that is the very point I am making. While I agree with Senator Panizza that we do rather well in producing and promoting Australian wheat, we do suffer in that jungle of competition which our Government has not been able to protect us from. Some people are suggesting that we abandon whatever protection and support as well as cooperation and experience that we have and let our producers operate in a free trade jungle. We hear complaints about the tactics that other governments use to support their producers. Those very things are the hazards to which we are being asked to subject our producers and I for one do not think that that is a sensible way to go about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some parts of the industry have, in fact, developed markets and established trading links outside the reserve price scheme. They can now justify their exemption from that scheme. We have successfully followed this model in the carpet wool industry and I suggest that other producers could well benefit from doing the same. It must be a question of evolution rather than revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry in Australia is far too large and far too significant a component of the world wool trade for us suddenly to abandon all of our capacity to control it. To send our producers into a free market without some reserve price, without some industry-wide recognition and without some sharing of responsibility, strength and experience would be very much a case of abandoning them as babes in the wood. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the tough guys who have contacted me have told me that they could survive in a free trade jungle. But as a nation we cannot afford to abandon the great bulk of our producers who would be eaten alive by the international trade manipulators. We need to preserve a system which allows wool producers to concentrate on what they know best-produce wool. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no argument that our present system is not working well; it is not working well in coordinating and directing the industry. But what should be done is that the system should be modified, not abandoned. These measures that we have before us, and those which have been telegraphed, in fact achieve that modification. </PARA>
<PARA> We have some serious concerns about the forthcoming suggestions regarding quotas and flock reduction proposals. Consequently, I intend to move an amendment to ensure that any proposal to put quotas on our production and limit the size of the wool industry is applied in a discriminating way and recognises those parts of the industry which are able to sell all of their product. Such a proposal should discriminate in favour of those parts of the industry so as to achieve in the long term what I have suggested-that is, to encourage our wool producers to move in the long term from producing the types of wool which are not supported in the international market to producing the types of wool which are in fact now, and in the future, recognised as being readily saleable. By doing that and not simply looking at short term measures, there will be a greater long term benefit to the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The short term measures include such proposals as slaughtering anything from 20 million to 50 million sheep. As I indicated initially, this will not achieve any long term benefit. We are talking about something short of 180 million sheep. But there is still the capacity, if we allow the due process of nature to take its course, to immediately reinstate those sorts of numbers of sheep. So, such a proposal would not have the sort of long term effects that we should be looking at. It may save us the production of one shearing but it certainly would not reorient the industry to the extent that needs to be done. So, such a proposal really can only be seen as a very short term panic measure. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation contains proposals which offer only short term solutions. Legislation in this area should be concerned with the development of the whole industry. We will support this legislation begrudgingly. We consider that at least the initial part to do with taxation is consistent with what has been the Democrats position all along. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to point out again that if the position which was suggested by us some months ago and supported by the Nationals had been recognised as containing the wisdom which it did-it was based on advice from the industry-there would be less need to panic at this point and introduce such a requirement for a surcharge. The funds would have been available months earlier for the Corporation to administer, as it needed to. But, regrettably, that suggestion was rejected. I will not say, `We told you so', but at least we should have the luxury of saying that our advice should have been taken. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that there is lack of concern altogether. Madam Acting Deputy President, as a woolgrower and a very interested person in the welfare of the industry, I am pleased to take part in the debate on the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 3) Further Amendment Bills 1990. When I was speaking last May on the same subject I certainly did not think we would be debating it again quite so soon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to speak about what has happened in the last couple of years. In May 1988 the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) decided that, because of the high price of the wool at the time-in fact, the indicator was 1,300c a kilogram and the floor was 670c a kilogram-the floor price should be increased to 870c a kilogram. The Corporation had the misguided belief that wool would always remain at that price or even go higher. Although I felt that wool had a great future, I did not believe that those high prices would remain for ever or that they would not go up and down. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Corporation implemented its decision to raise the floor price to 870c-and mind you, most decisions are implemented on 1 July of each year-it had a credit in the bank of $1.8 billion and virtually no stockpile. The indicator by then, however, had dropped to 1,000c a kilogram. So there was only 130c between the floor price and the indicator at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA> By October 1988 things had changed dramatically. The indicator had fallen back because of less demand for wool and the two levels met at 870c. That was the start of the disaster. From then to May 1990 the stockpile had reached two million bales. The industry approached us looking for a 25 per cent tax. The AWC told us that that would turn the situation around. This was one of the two times that I have believed the Corporation. We supported the 20 per cent tax that the Government brought in. I know the Australian Democrats wanted 25 per cent and Senator Bell referred to this a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government had made a decision and we certainly supported the idea on the basis of advice from Mr Beggs and the Wool Council of Australia that that would be sufficient. Of course, that 20 per cent was implemented on 1 July 1990. But at that time the Corporation was not prepared to bring down that ridiculous reserve price of 870c-a price which was already in trouble. It had the misguided idea that by having a heap of extra money available, demand would build up overseas. I do not understand the Commission's logic but it thought it would frighten buyers into the position of having to pay the 870c because they knew that they could not get wool any cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a few things happened around that time. We had Russia pulling out of the market. Then there were problems with China and Tiananmen Square. Still the Corporation would not agree. Mr Kerin then stepped in and brought the price down by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> At that stage the credibility of the Corporation and the Wool Council should have been questioned. I certainly questioned it. I believe that 54 per cent of Australians questioned it. But it was not questioned as much as it should have been. That decision was duly implemented on 1 July, and then we saw the results. At 1 July the Corporation had been purchasing around 38 per cent of the clip on the floor. By October of 1990 the panic had set in and it was purchasing 75 per cent. The stockpile has reached the unbelievable level of 4.2 million bales. Of course, other matters, such as increased production, contributed to that. The Government made an announcement on 4 October that there were 4.2 billion bales in the stockpile and the Corporation was $2.2 billion in debt. </PARA>
<PARA> We might ask why other people did not question the performance of the Corporation which turned around a $1.8 billion credit on 1 July 1988 to $2.2 billion debt by 4 October 1990. That is a turnaround of $4 billion. One high flying enterprise in this country recorded about a $1.3 bil</PARA>
<PARA> The mismanagement of the Corporation and the Wool Council has not been questioned anywhere near enough yet. We hear about peripheral matters such as why wool has not been sold, why there is too much wool, and slaughter schemes. But the actions of the Corporation and its chairman, backed by the Wool Council, have not been questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons we have reached such a position is increased production. In the 1980s, Australia sold an average of 3.7 million bales. We certainly were able to place that wool and we received good prices. But, unfortunately, two things happened: the Corporation did not achieve increased markets and production had increased by two million bales. On the assumption that the demand for wool remained static, the damage was done by increased production. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the problem is simple: we are producing 5.7 million bales and selling only 3.7 million. Together with a reserve price system, this is a recipe for disaster. What is more, the Corporation is still quoting Australia's production at around 5.2 million bales. The industry around the country tells me that the true position is vastly different. People in the industry have told me that that production is quite a bit higher. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ask ourselves why we have such a high production. Of course, one reason is the artificially high price that was set. We have had an artificially high price and no limit on production. There was a certain turnaround in the wheat market in 1988-89. Some wheatgrowers-not a great number-turned to wool-growing. If I may say so, the wool industry is a lot easier to work in. One can keep ones hands a bit cleaner. The arti- ficially high prices caused the overproduction. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that now we must look at how we are going to increase sales and how we are going to increase the price if we need to. As I have said before, you either increase your demand or you cut production. I am not advocating that we go one way or the other. I believe that demand and production can be brought closer together in the short term and then, hopefully, in the long term both can be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mooted by the Corporation and the industry that we can have a slaughter scheme. There are two sorts of slaughter scheme advocated: 50 million sheep, costing $400m and needing a levy of about 10 per cent; and 20 million sheep, costing $100m and needing 2 1/2 per cent levy. Before someone jumps up and says that those figures do not conform, we are talking about killing 20 million old sheep that have virtually no commercial value. These sheep would be bought off farmers at $5 a head roughly. </PARA>
<PARA> The other method that has been advocated is quotas. I am certainly well against and my party is well against-I think Senator Bell mentioned this in his speech-this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> If we think about it, this proposal advocated by the Wool Council is ridiculous. By applying quotas right across the board we will be cutting the sale of wool that has a market. Quotas will apply to top lines, which generally sell, and to oddments, which may not sell. Growers of fine wool and wool used for carpets will have the same problem. It is ridiculous even to suggest a quota. </PARA>
<PARA> But more ridiculous is the method by which the quota would be applied. I know that this Bill is not concerned with quotas but the Corporation is talking about them. If this Bill goes through untouched, quotas will be operating by next year if the Corporation has its way. It is ridiculous that the Corporation should propose quotas on a one-year basis only because of the variations that can occur across the country. There have been floods in New South Wales, droughts in certain spots of South Australia and other things happening in Western Australia. A production chart put out by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) shows that the position between States is inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of quotas that may come in, the Wool Council believes that we should get back to 752,000,000 kilos, which roughly equates to the 3.9 million bales that we used to sell quite easily. The ABARE chart shows that we last produced 752.7 million kilos in 1984-85. Since then we have had an overall 34 per cent increase in wool production in Australia and this has caused the present problems. I will read into Hansard how that has come about. Wool production in New South Wales has increased 48 per cent; Victoria, 34 per cent; Queensland, 23 per cent; Western Australia, 28 per cent; South Australia, 15.6 per cent-they had a few problems; and Tasmania, which does not rate very high in the wool stakes-in fact, it has gone backwards-13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have quotas, they should be imposed on a long term basis. A big advantage should not be given to New South Wales at the expense of someone else. So it is totally inequitable. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table showing Australian shorn wool production by State; a graph showing shorn wool production by State for 1981-82 to 1990-91; and a graph showing shorn wool production by State for 1982-83 to 1990-91. I have given these documents to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). </PARA>

It is something that moved me and that I will never forget. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context, therefore, of the fact that we take our political system, our political parties and our democracy too much for granted, I want to take the opportunity today to put on the public record, presuming that I am given leave, a speech that was given recently by the oldest of the living Federal Presidents of my Party, Sir Robert Southey. In his speech titled 1945-1990, A Brief Historical Perspective, given on 6 October this year, Sir Robert reflects on the history of the Liberal Party of Australia, particularly the common thread of political philosophy that has run through its life over the years that I have just mentioned. He looked at how the Party has had to adapt to a changing Australia, and he looked at some of those who played key roles during that period in moulding the Party. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Grant Tambling,</PARA>
<PARA>P O Box 4196</PARA>
<PARA>DARWIN NT 0801</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA>The Town Camp Aboriginal People of Katherine have requested that I write to you expressing their real concerns of what is going on amongst the Aboriginal Community of Katherine. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last two and a half months Kalano Community Association has been under continuous attack from a group of Urban Aboriginal people in Katherine. These attacks have been in the form of rallies, convergences, slander in the media, disruption to staff's work, etc. The ATSIC Regional Manager forced the Council into dissolving by not publicly supporting Council and threatening to cut funding to Kalano. The Council-the majority of whom are Traditional Aboriginal people have run Kalano. Constitutionally and Financially, it cannot be faulted. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the move on Kalano and in particular on the Traditional Aboriginal people from the Urban Aboriginal people is a power move. </PARA>
<PARA>During 1989 and `90 Kalano has been run largely by Traditional people and there has been a big increase in employment at Kalano by the Town Camp people.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Town Camp people are the primary users of Kalano Services it is common sense that these people play a large role in the decision making processes. It is also common sense that the Town Camp people are employed at Kalano so they are working for their own people and their own Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>The people in the Town Camps are quite correct when they say that the Urban Aboriginal people are jealous that Kalano is up and running well and is doing so by the Traditional Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>They are correct when they say that these people are jealous that Government has the trust in Kalano to put funds such as $4.5m T.C.H.I.P. directly to Kalano. Everywhere else it went through the Local Government Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>They are correct when they say that these people want to get their hands on the money that is going into Kalano. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fraud and previous financial mismanagements that went on in the past at Kalano were all done by Urban Aboriginal people. The Town Camp people know that and they are very very concerned that if these people do win their power struggle that Kalano will financially go down and that the Traditional people will be pushed out of their jobs. The Town Camp people were the victims for years and years of mismanagement at Kalano by these people. They have every right to be concerned now. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also a great concern in the role of the Northern Land Council in this power struggle and this concerns the Traditional people. They believed that the N.L.C. was set up to help Traditional people with Land Rights. What is happening in Katherine is that the N.L.C. Office, and the equipment is being used as a base for this Power Group. This has been going on for over two months. The Camp people are disgusted that the N.L.C. Office and some of their staff are involved in the undermining of Traditional Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>What chance have these Traditional Aboriginal people got?</PARA>
<PARA>1. They have been blackmailed, and not supported by their ATSIC Regional Director. </PARA>
<PARA>2. They have had access to Katherine Aboriginal Legal Aid cut off in seeking Legal Assistance against the slander because the Senior Solicitor there is the Legal Advisor for this power group. </PARA>
<PARA>3. They cannot use the Katherine N.L.C. as they are supporting the power group. </PARA>
<PARA>4. They cannot go to the N.T. Government as the Health Department have been implicated in this undermining by the involvement of Health Department Staff-use of Health Depart. Offices/Equipment etc. in the beginning of the power struggle. </PARA>
<PARA>Kalano Staff have brought their Union in, not just out of concern of what ATSIC did to their boss the Kalano Council but also because the staff have been totally disrupted in their work and placed under stress because of the actions of this power group. </PARA>
<PARA>The staff were going to do a mass walk out a couple of weeks ago, however, they decided against it because of concern for services to the Town Camp people and also to keep fighting for what the Council stood for. </PARA>
<PARA>However, if the Power Group do get control of the Kalano Council at the Annual General Meeting coming up in November there will be a mass walk out of staff. There will also be a withdrawal of Town Camp people in their use of Kalano Services. These people are already organising alternatives. Unfortunately they are not Aboriginal alternatives but European. However they have more trust in their money being looked after properly by the European services than they have of the Urban Aboriginal people controlling them. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a sad day for Aboriginal people when this sort of thing goes on. In a lot of ways Government has a lot to answer for because of their lack of understanding that Aboriginal people are different. Traditional Aboriginal people do have different needs yet-how many of these people are in decision making roles? how many are in identified Aboriginal Public Servant Positions? The questions could go on. </PARA>
<PARA>There seems to be a level of thinking that `just because you have some Aboriginal blood in you, you understand Aboriginal people'. Traditional Aboriginal people will say different. </PARA>
<PARA>I have enclosed a Copy of an open letter, that the Kalano Community Association's President wrote to the Aboriginal Community of Katherine. </PARA>
<PARA>The Town Camp people are calling for help and someone to listen to their concerns. They need this help urgently. They are calling for Traditional Aboriginal people in Government to help them now. </PARA>
<PARA>The Kalano Council and the Town Camp people have tried to get their voice heard by going through the right channels. They did not want to lower themselves to the slanderous actions of this power group. However, it seems that doing things the right way get them no where as no one seems interested in the voice of the Traditional Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA>I am requesting that you help these people now. </PARA>

<PARA>-President of Kalano Community Association</PARA>
<PARA>Me and My Council have done a lot over the last Two Years what I know from when we were Voted back in the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>All you Trouble Makers are just Jealous of us. I tell this because nothing never ever happened like what me and these Councillors are doing because those Part-Aboriginals want to take your Money from your Community's. I know that for sure because all you outside Community People got nothing to say then. </PARA>
<PARA>What I know my side and then you won't have any legs to stand on again. But what I know me and my Community Binjari will have a leg to stand on and thats for sure Countryman. And that's the time I'll just sit back in my Little Community and laugh my head off see yous crawling with your hands and knees begging to replace Kalano again. </PARA>
<PARA>I myself will say good job. Once again I'll say me myself as President and Five Members of the Community say to you People sorry yous wanted a Part Aboriginal to run the Show for you so that's all I have to say for myself and the Community. I mean Community that's Binjari where us Strong People live. </PARA>
<PARA>To all Community People I would like yous to know how us Binjari Mob think of those Health Workers. We know them but also we think they should be out of the Kalano Association. All together that's how we feel. When somebody walks out like that from my Community I'll just tell them keep going and don't come back because that's how we feel the People in this Binjari Community Association feel and that how all the Community People should think of and say we had enough of those Trouble Makers. We should kick them right out off the Kalano Association not having them back in any condition. That's how I feel myself as a President. </PARA>
<PARA>What I can tell you Mob over the past nothing like this happened before in my time in this Kalano Association. But one thing I can tell you People going to put those three Health Workers back More and More trouble will create because I won't be there to put up with all that again. </PARA>

<PARA>GPO Box 4396</PARA>
<PARA>DARWIN NT 0801</PARA>
<PARA>31 October 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Perron</PARA>
<PARA>This Community is experiencing very real difficulties in the administration of our CDEP program due to the interventionist and dictatorial practices of the local ATSIC office. </PARA>
<PARA>Some twelve months ago, Council identified areas which required attention in order for the program to fulfill its potential. Specifically, these were the employment of an experienced financial advisor and qualified coordinator, the expansion of office space available to CDEP staff, the changeover to a computerized accounting system and the establishment of storage facilities for CDEP plant/equipment. A great deal of effort and planning went into the implementation of this strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>It is to our dismay that these efforts have not been recognised by the local ATSIC office and in particular, the Regional Manager, Mr Theedom. Over the past six months we have been under sustained attack from this officer and yet he is still to visit our community. </PARA>
<PARA>On 6 September 1990, this officer through his local Project Officer, issued a number of directives concerning the operation of CDEP. Some of these represented a significant change of direction such as the prohibition on advance wages and allocating funds toward certain identified CDEP projects. Naturally, some members of the community were hostile toward this and our Council tried to explain that we were merely acting in compliance with Mr Theedoms' directions. On 5 October 1990, we sought confirmation in writing of these directions in order to verify with the community, the changes that had been enforced. Mr Theedom has yet to respond to this request and as a result, argument and disputation continue on the community. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that ATSIC have adopted a``pro-active'' role in CDEP. This is evidenced by their insistence that budget variations be at their instigation and their nomination of what activity can or cannot be classified as a CDEP project. </PARA>
<PARA>Almost every letter we receive from Mr Theedom, contains some sought of threat to withdraw funds should we not comply with his instructions. What concerns us so much, is that this treatment is dished out in an environment where we have dramatically improved our financial reporting to the extent where ATSIC are provided on a monthly basis, a full return comprising of bank reconciliation, list of unpresented cheques, debtors/creditors trial balance by function and bank statements. </PARA>
<PARA>We at Milikapiti are very proud of our achievements in the area of financial management as both our Council and CDEP functions are fully computerized for accounts and wages. We have also, at our own cost, initiated on-site computer skills training with local people. Achievements of this kind would have been unthinkable 12 months ago. We do accept that from time to time errors creep into the system and these need to be identified and rectified. To this extent we have no problem with the local ATSIC office, in consultation with the community, monitoring development within the CDEP project. The ADC and DAA used to conduct their business in this fashion, ATSIC do not. </PARA>
<PARA>The latest broadside hurled at this community is a letter signed by Mr Theedom requiring the preparation of 3 separate quarterly Financial Statements for the CDEP. This will effectively treble our workload and setback local training programs months, and possibly years. I draw your attention to earlier comments on the scope and detail of our financial reporting to ATSIC which provides all the information necessary for evaluation and acquittance of Grant Funds including a split-up of the various functions, ie. wages, on costs and support. Mr Theedom happily quotes Part 3 of the``Rules and Administrative Procedures Relating to Grants'' and yet our present financial reports comply with all of the provisions contained in Part 3. I am also advised that no such additional reporting requirements of this type were introduced into the Katherine region of ATSIC. There appears to be a rather obvious``local arrangement'' here, and one must ask the question, why us?</PARA>
<PARA>We understood that the Federal Government was supposed to be the pacesetter in Aboriginal Affairs. Concepts such as self determination and self management are often bandied about us at will by the politicians and bureaucrats. Why then are we returning to the dark ages? The type of consultation with Aboriginal people that we have been experiencing went out of fashion 25 years ago, we thought! ATSIC is characterised by overbearing, dictatorial, interventionist and paternalistic practices unrivalled by any other organisation involved in Aboriginal Affairs. Quite frankly, we get the impression that Mr Theedom is playing games with us, that he does not care about the community and is more interested in``scoring points'' than assisting in a meaningful and positive fashion. </PARA>
<PARA>This attitude is in stark contrast with the NT Office of Local Government who subsidize the operations of our Council here. Although we are disappointed at the reduction in funding allocations through the Grants Commission in 1990/91, we respect the manner in which these Officers deal with us. They treat us like adults and allow us to run our own affairs without the interference which has so characterized ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>The CDEP at Milikapiti belongs to the Milikapiti community. It is not the plaything of some over zealous and pedantic bureaucrat in Darwin. We accept in its entirety, the requirement for accountability and are doing our utmost to ensure that all the necessary information is provided so that grants can be properly accounted for and acquitted. We suspect that the Darwin Regional Office is so impoverished in the area of financial expertise that they cannot assess adequately the information provided to them. We urge you to bring these matters to the attention of the Minister, Mr Tickner before the situation gets completely out of hand. Already some staff have indicated that they may resign if the present process of harassment continues and we simply do not know what the future holds for us. </PARA>
<PARA>Any assistance on this most urgent matter would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs for that clarification. It had us somewhat confused. My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. Why did the Minister selectively quote from the front page of yesterday's West Australian newspaper the seventh paragraph instead of the first and the third paragraphs, which stated that the Western Australian Ombudsman had called for a Fitzgerald-style royal commission with extended powers to investigate the secret files of Robert Smith and other related matters? Why was the Minister briefed six times on the subject of one investigation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two different questions there. As to the quotation from the front page of the West Australian, I indicated that my only knowledge of what Mr Freeman had allegedly said about a royal commission was indeed from my reading of the West Australian and that I found the report somewhat confused. In fact, I thought that the Opposition should take several elements of it into account. I never denied that Mr Freeman had called for a royal commission; I simply put it to the Opposition that he had apparently also said that the investigation by the police ought to be allowed to proceed for some three months; that it would be under the surveillance or supervision, in a sense, of his successor as Ombudsman; and that some three months ought to be allowed for that to take place. I was simply pointing that out. There was no attempt on my part to say that Mr Freeman had not called for a royal commission; I was just pointing to that extra element in his statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of why I was briefed about a matter relating to telephone interceptions, I am quite often briefed by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in relation to such inquiries. The particular investigation into these sorts of matters of bugging and telephone intercepts took quite some time. So the AFP kept me well informed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It is on the subject of petrol taxation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Energy Agency statistics provide a good indication of Australia's comparative position amongst Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in terms of both taxes as a proportion of petrol prices and prices themselves. The latest published statistics of the International Energy Agency for the first quarter of 1990 indicate that in Australia the percentage of taxes representing revenue collected by both Commonwealth and State governments to petrol prices was 45.5 per cent. This was the third lowest level of taxation of the 23 countries surveyed by the Agency. Australia's taxation collection from petrol was significantly lower than most other OECD countries. Taxation collections in 14 countries were higher than 60 per cent, including Italy at 76.4 per cent, France at 76.2 per cent, Germany at 65.8 per cent, the United Kingdom at 63.1 per cent and Sweden at 61 per cent. Australia has maintained its relative position for the last decade in respect of those sorts of statistics. The relative position for Australia, as determined by taxation percentages on petrol in this period, broadly reflects the relative price position for petrol. Specifically, Australia's petrol prices have been and remained within the lowest four among OECD countries for the last decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the other implication in Senator Maguire's question, I point out that the October prices reflect this position, with average Australian prices at US0.64c per litre compared with the United States, 0.35c; Japan, 0.91c; Germany, 0.93c; the United Kingdom, 0.98c; France, 1.14c; and Italy, 1.37c.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, of course, of the decision by Essington Ltd, which was reported in the press as Senator Loosley points out. I appreciate the effort put in by that company in getting the project to its current status but I believe that the interests of the project will not be harmed by Essington's action in withdrawing. Indeed, about 10 companies, both local and international, have contacted the Australian Space Office since my press release to which Senator Loosley referred. The project managers, United States Boosters Inc. (USBI) of the United States of America, visited here last week and have confirmed the commercial viability of the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There appears to be a considerable level of interest in the project from the business community now that the US Government has given approval for the involvement of United Technologies as manager of the project. An Australian Government delegation is now travelling to Tokyo, Washington, Moscow and Paris for a series of meetings to progress a wide range of intergovernmental issues raised by the project. Congressman Robert Roe of the United States House Committee on Science and Technology is presently in Australia with a delegation and inspected the Cape York site, I think yesterday, and I shall meet with the congressman next week.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government is offering all the encouragement it can and doing what it can to facilitate the project, I again have to stress that it will not proceed without a satisfactory outcome of the environmental impact study currently under way, without agreement being reached with the Aboriginal community and without a firm belief that the parties undertaking the project have the financial strength to see it through.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the spaceport since the first feasibility studies were done has had to go through a few hoops. Some of those hoops have been gone through. The major hoop was getting the agreement of the United States Government to allow the participation of the American project manager. There were also considerable negotiations with the Soviet Government about the use of Soviet rockets, which are an integral part of the proposal. As I have indicated, there are still problems to be resolved in terms of the site.</PARA>
<PARA> The business involvement in the project at the present time is not finalised. The project is and will continue to be a private venture and I stress again that the Government's role is that of facilitator and it will not be taking an equity position in the project directly.</PARA>

There is a need to ensure that that Authority acts with the requisite degree of secrecy in order to secure victory in the fight against organised crime, particularly drug trafficking, and for that reason certain secrecy provisions of a strong kind were inserted into that Act by this Parliament, but at the same time Parliament has, quite rightly, given the extraordinary powers wielded by the National Crime Authority, given to one of its own joint parliamentary committees a supervisory role. In order to discharge that role it has to have access to certain information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, in trying to strike that balance the Parliament has set down certain provisions. The result of the application of those provisions may not always be satisfactory and I believe that, if one were to look at those provisions again, the sorts of matters which Senator Spindler adverted to would certainly be relevant factors such as not jeopardising the operations of the National Crime Authority in ensuring the safety of persons working for the National Crime Authority and of witnesses who might come before it. Of course, Senator Spindler would not want any action to be able to be taken by a parliamentary committee which might jeopardise criminal prosecutions instituted as a result of investigations undertaken by the Authority which hands over its brief, of course, to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand Senator Spindler's concern in these matters. I think he has raised very interesting criteria that might be used in looking at striking that balance. I am sure the Attorney-General would be extremely happy to discuss Senator Spindler's concerns with a view to ensuring that Parliament gets that balance right.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basic point is that if Opposition members want an answer I will give them one, but I am not going to try to shout over the rabble on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic and first point to make-one that the Opposition should understand but probably does not-is that there is a common approach to redundancies, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. If one wants to change the culture of an organisation or if one wants to change the direction of an organisation, whether it is in the private sector or the public sector, in terms of normal industrial processes-ones that have been adopted in terms of Comcar in this particular instance-the redundancy approach is very commonly used.</PARA>
<PARA> What Comcar has done here is nothing different from what any private sector organisation could do and, in effect, what similar private sector organisations are doing. There have been redundancies and people have left the organisation. As I say, it is similar to large public and private organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a common practice and a normal industrial practice. In this case there was a review of Comcar operations, one that Senator Parer, even with little knowledge of the area, would understand. As a consequence of that review, there was a proposal which is being adopted and is being implemented in order to rearrange both working hours and conditions of the organisation and, in the process, to ensure that redundant drivers are given a chance to get out with some dignity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Given that one of the options in the Gulf being considered by the United States (US) is an attack on Iraq, and that Australia would presumably support such a move, how would the multinational force obtain United Nations (UN) legitimacy for such an attack in terms of the United Nations charter, given that there would need to be an explicit resolution passed by the Security Council and that France and China would possibly not support it? Is it true that the United States, the United Kingdom and the French military staff commands are combining their resources into something approximating a de facto United Nations staff command or, at the very least, an informal `crisis' committee, and are attempts being made to activate the United Nations Military Staff Committee, which currently exists in name only? I further ask the Minister what the United Nations Security Council can do to prevent a military strike by the United States and other nations. Finally, will the Australian Government consider withdrawing its support from the multinational force, seeing that such a force has no legitimacy to wage war?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4253" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first question, Australia has of course consistently supported a peaceful resolution of the Gulf crisis. If, however, as the Prime Minister and I and the Minister for Defence have said, the sanctions strategy and associated diplomacy do not achieve the objectives to which the international community is committed, we have to be prepared to contemplate military action, if that is the only course left which will ensure Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to Australia's likely response in the event that military action does occur, which we all hope it will not, I have said many times that this is an issue which the Government will make considered decisions about on the basis of all the circumstances applicable at the time, and no assumptions either way should be made at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason for assuming that a further explicit United Nations Security Council resolution would be strictly necessary to confer legitimacy, as Senator Vallentine described it, for the conduct of military action against Iraq. Article 51 of the Charter, which, it will be recalled, was specifically affirmed by the original resolution 661, makes it very clear that the United Nations Charter does contemplate military action in response to such circumstances as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. If there were to be a further specific resolution of the Security Council, it would no doubt be to authorise the use of force against Iraq pursuant to Article 42 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. This would need nine affirmative votes in the Council and no veto by one of the permanent five. There are no such proposals before the Council at this moment, but that is not to say that there may not be. France and China, which Senator Vallentine specifically referred to, have supported all Security Council resolutions on the crisis to date, and I have no evidence to suggest that they would necessarily oppose a resolution authorising force were the Security Council to consider one.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second question, there is no joint command for the multinational naval force (MNF). There are well established procedures for coordination among the participants in the MNF, but I should stress again that Australian naval deployment in the Gulf is under Australian national command.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the forces on the ground in Saudi Arabia, I am not aware that the United States, the United Kingdom and France have established a joint command of the kind that Senator Vallentine refers to. I should say that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has expressed its interest in having the UN Military Staff Committee, comprising military representatives from the permanent five members of the Security Council, assume a greater role in this crisis. That Committee meets regularly but has not yet moved to play a role in resolving it.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the third question, from my discussions in Washington and in New York I know that the United States is acutely conscious of the need to maintain the international coalition against Iraq, particularly through the United Nations. This will be a factor the US will obviously be considering very seriously in any new move it might make to resolve the crisis. As was evident during the recent consultations of US Secretary of State, Mr Baker, in a number of Middle East and European capitals over the last few days, the United States still has under very active consideration the possibility of obtaining more specific UN Security Council authority if any military action does become necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Australian Government will not consider withdrawing its support for the multinational naval force. That operation and Australian involvement in it is in full conformity with the United Nations Charter. The MNF is acting legitimately and fully in accordance with binding resolutions of the Security Council.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is all right; I am not in a ruthless mode today. One has to be continually very kind to Senator Alston to keep him going. I get up each morning and thank God that I got him as my shadow. First off we are told that Mr Sciacca tapped his head and indicated to a group of pensioners at Sydney Town Hall that in some way they were stupid or whatever. The reality is that what occurred at the meeting is that one among the number at the back of the crowd had made a circular motion with his finger at the side of his head to Mr Sciacca and Mr Sciacca responded in a similar fashion. People in the front who could not see what happened at the back therefore were getting themselves aggrieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the way, I really wonder about the `near riot'. At the Sydney Town Hall on the Friday the week after the Budget, I attended a meeting where there were 2,000 to 3,000 very angry pensioners. They gave me a very hard time indeed. When Mr Sciacca attended this rally, as Senator Alston calls it, even though it was organised by the same people only 160 attended, because in the course of the two months I, other members of the Government, Mr Sciacca and a host of people had explained those policies-which I might say Senator Alston supported up until he was rolled by the National Party. Fortunately, because we were successful in getting that message over, only 160 people could attend. If we can get the number down from 3,000 to 160, it shows that we are doing our job.</PARA>
<PARA> So what action will I take? I will encourage Mr Sciacca to do more of what he has been doing because he is doing exactly what we want. Those opposite will see that, for all the efforts that they make, the sad thing is that their audience was down to a lousy 160. If I had a head like that, I would not tap it; I would not advertise. I just have to say that, as far as Mr Gayler's comments are concerned, I did actually make some comments yesterday. I do not seek to add to them except to say that I would prefer to take the view that the Premier of Queensland takes of Mr Sciacca than the view of Mr Gayler, and I think that is in accord with the wishes of 99 per cent of Australia.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4256" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Zakharov drew this matter to my attention because Australia's 1989 recovery rate for aluminium beverage cans was 62 per cent, and that is the highest in the Western world from voluntary or non-deposit legislated schemes. It is, of course, an incredible result and a credit to all concerned. It can be attributed to the comprehensive collection programs established by the industry itself which include continuing education and promotion, the intrinsic value of aluminium scrap, because it is worth something, and of course the increasing environmental awareness of Australians. The recovery and processing of aluminium cans has benefits in terms of conservation of natural resources and, of course, savings from reduced waste disposal. Energy savings are significant as only 5 per cent of the energy required to produce a can from raw material is needed to produce one by recycling. An indirect benefit of lower energy consumption is, of course, a lower rate of greenhouse gas emissions-and, of course, we are all trying to achieve that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's excellent record in this area of the collection of aluminium cans is, however, not matched by a record with overall waste because the volumes overall of waste are still rising. Some major waste materials are hardly recycled at all in this country as yet. I refer, of course, to plastics in particular and also to demolition waste. Fortunately, because of the activities of former Labor Senator and Minister Susan Ryan, who now heads the Plastics Institute of Australia Inc., we are now seeing a change in the attitude of the plastics industry and I am very confident that we will get some progress in that area very soon.</PARA>
<PARA> As a first step we have been having some round table meetings with industry and the States to discuss these issues to try to develop a national waste minimisation and recycling strategy. We will have to make sure that our collection systems around Australia from households in particular as well as from industry are improved dramatically if any strategy is to work. I am certain that a strengthened commitment to recycling will come out of the development of the strategy, and I hope that it can be adopted by the middle of next year and be agreed to by industry, conservation groups, State and Territory governments-and, most of all, by the public who in the end will have to contribute most of the work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say at the outset that it is good to get a question that is constructive and also based on fact. Senator Crowley is, in fact, right in the question that she asks. A team of scientists, trialling at the moment at the Roseworthy College in South Australia and working from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Soils, has isolated a naturally occurring strain of soil bacteria which may reduce the disease in wheat called `take-all'. This disease is a rather enormous one and may decrease yields by more than 50 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bacterium which has been isolated is from the pseudomonas group and was discovered by Dr Ryder's group in the soil around wheat roots in Australia. This is very important. It is a natural biological control. The main purpose of the continuing research is to track the bacterium in the soil so that the scientists can answer questions on its ecology, how far it moves, how quickly the bacteria multiply, their survival, and on which part of the plant root they act to curb `take-all'.</PARA>
<PARA> Tracking this strain of bacteria in the soil is difficult and that is why scientists have had to tag two artificial genetic tags onto the bacterium. The tags have been tested extensively in the United States of America. They are attached to the bacteria in order to distinguish them from other soil bacteria, which are also naturally occurring. The main reason for this is that there is a concern that the genetic tags on the bacteria may move into water systems or affect other soil processes.</PARA>
<PARA> Scientists from the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) have considered this particular concern and are confident from both laboratory and field tests in the USA that the modified bacterium does not, of its own accord, move more than a few centimetres and as a consequence will not cause problems. Given that the GMAC has approved the testing in South Australia, we are looking very closely at the testing and the trialling which is going on at the Roseworthy College with a view to ensuring that all assistance can be given to perfecting this particular bacterium which may reduce `take-all' disease levels in wheat crops.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the enormous impact of this development, when it is considered that it could save Australian wheat farmers in the vicinity of $500m per annum, it is quite obvious that the Government will take a close and continuing interest in the developments here.</PARA>

However, as the honourable senator knows, that decision was appealed to the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission by the Victorian and Tasmanian councils. The decision on that appeal has been reserved and it is not known when the decision might be handed down. Further, even if the Commission dismisses the appeal this would merely open the way for an award; it would not make an award. The process could therefore take a considerable time. There has been no setting aside of funds to cover the cost of an outcome which is still surrounded by so much uncertainty. However, the Government is very concerned that the uncertainty surrounding the decision should not be unfairly exploited by either the councils or the unions. The needs of parents, children and carers should be uppermost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has made it clear that it remains committed to family day care as a central component of its provision of child-care. The Government has written to all councils requesting them not to exploit the current uncertainty and informing them that the Government remains willing to work with them to guarantee the future of family day care. I understand that the Minister has also written to all carers in Tasmania and Victoria in similar terms. Significant improvements in the fee relief system announced during the Budget will also help lift the remuneration of carers without reducing affordability for parents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the crisis in our trade negotiations with Europe arising in the Uruguay Round. What degree of flexibility, in the Australian Government's assessment, is there in the negotiating position of the European Community now that the European Community has belatedly put forward a totally inadequate offer of a 30 per cent cut in subsidies-a cut which even the United States Agriculture Secretary, Clayton Yeutter, derisively has criticised as `almost a non-offer'? How close is the risk of a complete breakdown of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks? I am aware that there may well be rapid developments even in the last few hours before the meeting. Is there, in the words of Dr Blewett, `no chance of reaching a final conclusion' at the December meeting? Will the Prime Minister enter the process and attend the talks in Brussels next month or a summit meeting? What solutions will the Australian Government now offer to resolve this crisis in Australia's best interests?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regrettably, as a result of the intransigent position taken by the Europeans, the outlook for the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, at least by the scheduled conclusion date of 7 December, does look very gloomy indeed. It is at the point now of requiring not just six runs off every ball but about eight, which means that it can be done only with four runs plus four overthrows. Obviously that is not realistic in the time available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not to say that the Round is necessarily doomed to complete failure. There is the option of spilling over to next year, although, if negotiations run longer than the end of March next year, there is the necessity for the United States Congress to confer new negotiating authority upon the executive, which will create its own new series of difficulties and dilemmas.</PARA>
<PARA> As to what flexibility there may be in the European position, it is probably not helpful for me to speculate about that. To some extent it is being domestically driven obviously by the German elections in the first week of December, but there are some very intransigent positions that have been mapped out by other countries within the Community and it will be difficult to shift them.</PARA>
<PARA> The most important way in which we and other countries can contribute to shifting the Europeans is to do what we have been doing: that is, making very clear the total irrationality of the European position, given the relative insignificance of agriculture-certainly in their exports and even, to a significant extent, in their gross domestic product as compared with manufactures and services-and making it absolutely plain to the Europeans that they simply cannot expect any reasonable result in the Round in terms of general tariff reductions, intellectual property, trade and services or any of the other things the developed countries want, unless they are prepared to make some fundamental moves forward in the area of agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, there is not a great deal that I can say. As to whether the Prime Minister might attend some crisis meeting on this or the ministerial meeting itself, that is a matter to which he is giving some consideration in consultation with other relevant heads of government. It may be, I fear, too late, given the complexity of the negotiation and the difficulty of bringing a negotiation that extends across 15 subject areas to fruition by that time scale that we are talking about, and it may not be productive to have such a meeting. Then, again, it might be. That is a matter which is under active consideration at the moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will never be fully satisfied with the level of child-care available to working families in Australia, despite the very substantial progress made since 1983. When the Government came to office there were only 46,000 funded child-care places in Australia. That figure has now more than doubled to 122,000 such places. The system of affordable, quality, community based child-care that this Government has developed since 1983 is recognised as one of the best in the world. That record on child-care received a ringing endorsement during the election when the Opposition's regressive tax rebate policy was rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government recognises that more needs to be done. During the election the Government promised a further massive growth strategy of 78,000 places. By 1995-96 we estimate that a quarter of a million funded child-care places will be available in Australia-five times the number available when we came to office. It is estimated that more than one quarter of all children in funded services are from sole parent families. These parents in particular benefit from the generous fee relief system introduced by this Government. During the election the Government also announced sweeping changes to the fee relief system. An estimated 90,000 families with children in currently funded services will benefit from the new fee relief. A further 35,000 families with children in commercial centres also stand to benefit from 1 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not satisfied with the current availability of child-care. We are satisfied with the strategies we have in place to bring affordable quality care within the reach of many more Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am now in a position to answer the question asked earlier by Senator Colston. The National Health and Medical Research Council has issued a warning statement concerning suntanning parlours, solaria and home tanning equipment. It is an important statement which was prepared in consultation with the Australasian College of Dermatologists and the Australian Cancer Society as part of their respective campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Council recommended the following forms of sun protection; avoiding sunlight, in particular between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m; wearing clothing of tightly woven fabric and broad-brimmed hats; covering unprotected parts of the body with a broad spectrum sun screen of SPF 15 or SPF 15+; further, and relevantly to Senator Colston's question, avoiding artificial forms of ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B radiation as used in suntanning parlours, solaria and home tanning equipment. There is overwhelming evidence that intentional and unintentional exposure to sunlight is linked to the development of the more common types of skin cancer and most melanomas. Skin cancer causes the death of 1,000 Australians per year, with a further 150,000 people presenting annually for treatment.</PARA>
<PARA> Ultraviolet B, the burning rays, are the most carcinogenic; however, recent studies indicate that ultraviolet A, or lower energy rays, can augment the cancer producing effects of ultraviolet B. In addition ultraviolet A rays can penetrate the top layer of the skin and cause damage to the lower layer, leading to changes in the skin which were previously attributed to the effects of ageing. The Federal Government, under the national better health program, is targeting preventable cancers as an area of priority. I believe Senator Colston will welcome that.</PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives being taken indicate that there is no safe way to tan and there are associated risks. Therefore, I have requested the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to place the safety of solaria on the agenda of the Commonwealth-State Consumer Products Advisory Committee and will seek advice from that committee on any uniform action that should be taken by the Commonwealth to improve the safety standards of tanning centres.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, does this promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) remind you of any other promise that the Prime Minister has made publicly in recent times? To me, and to those on this side of the House, this is a great, resounding reminder of what the Prime Minister promised to the children of Australia, and this promise appears also to be inoperable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Humphreys, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, only recently-in fact, this year-told the veterans' community in Melbourne a totally different story. When he was addressing the veterans at the Returned Services League State Conference in July in Melbourne, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and don't, please, think that by burying your heads in the sand or writing furious articles this proposal will go away. It won't. It's the right way to go and the Government is committed to it</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the Prime Minister's promise of consultation and saying that the proposal will not go ahead until everybody is satisfied with it. We all know that the word is out that Concord Repatriation Hospital is due to be handed over to the State Government by the end of this financial year if the Federal Government can achieve it. It is hell-bent on it, regardless of the wishes of the veterans of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate that these veterans are old. They need stability. Change is worrying for this age group. These are the people to whom we owe a debt for compensation for war service. These are the men and women who fought for our country. They are very concerned about the Government's proposals. They have reasonable cause for concern. They have reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangements that the Prime Minister said that he would not go ahead with while they have reasonable concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The veterans' community-the combined organisations-wrote to the Government many months ago. They asked 25 questions and said that, depending upon the results of the answers to those questions, they would make up their position finally on integration of the hospitals. Yet, when finally they got their answer, it was very much along the lines that Senator Tate gave by way of a precis of an answer to Senator McLean in this chamber last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me raise some of the issues that they asked in their questions. They were concerned about the answer they got about the need for integration. They were told that 50 per cent of all veterans' and war widows' needs were now met by non- repatriation hospitals. The fact of the matter is that those repatriation hospitals may be coping with a smaller percentage of the whole, but the whole has grown. In fact, although the total number of veterans is starting to decline, the Government has a study which demonstrates quite clearly that we will not reach the peak usage of hospital care for veterans until 1995-96. In fact, it will not be until the year 2000 that we are back to the usage level that we are at right now. So much for the Government's statistics. It can use them any way it likes. The veterans know that there will be a growing need for beds, not a diminishing need, as the Government would make out. </PARA>
<PARA> The veterans are also concerned at what seems to be indecent haste. The Prime Minister promised that he would not proceed until they were happy, and yet all the Government does is quote the Prime Minister's promise. At the same time, behind the scenes-as was clearly evidenced in the answers given to the Committee of the Whole on the Estimates this morning-the Government is trying very hard, on a bureaucrat to bureaucrat basis, to negotiate a hand-over-or a sell-out, if you like. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the answers that the Government gave to the veterans community related to the question, `What if a State government refuses to integrate?'. The Government said that it believed this unlikely, but that if it did occur there would be no option but to close the hospital over time. If I were a veteran, I would be pretty dissatisfied seeing the repatriation hospitals closing because the State governments did not want to take them on board. That is another area of dissatisfaction. Again, in answer to another question, the veterans were told that they would have no representation of any kind on the boards of the hospitals where they would be treated in the future. That does not satisfy them either. </PARA>
<PARA> Then in answers to other questions it was clear that, for all the Government says that there will be priority of access, it is impossible for it to guarantee that priority of access. Let us remember that in very few country areas of Australia are there substantial quality private hospitals able to do major surgery. There are very few government hospitals in the bush that can do the sort of specialist surgery that these veterans have been entitled to and expect in their repatriation hospitals. Let us remember that in every State of this country there are enormous queues for elective surgery in the big public hospitals. All that is happening is that veterans will be expected to come in from the bush or from wherever they are if they want major surgery and they will have to join a queue along with every other citizen in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of medical judgment whether a patient gets priority in a hospital, and it is totally misleading for the Government to be suggesting that in some way it can achieve a miracle and give a veteran priority of access. I have said that the answer the Government gave about private hospitals is not satisfactory and State hospitals also cannot guarantee that priority. There will be no priority of access to the repatriation hospitals either. That became clear in the answers given by the Minister to the veterans' community. He made it quite clear that that cannot be guaranteed. There is no guarantee that Concord and Greenslopes in particular would not be closed. That came in the answers by the Minister to questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation regarding outpatients is very unclear. That has been an important part of the care provided by the repatriation general hospitals, and the importance that the outpatient system has given to support of veterans and war widows. Yet the answer that Senator Tate gave to Senator McLean last week-and no doubt we will get it again in his speech today-seems to canvass these same things over and over again without being able to give more detailed information which can and will satisfy the veterans. The Government has been found wanting by the veterans' community, and I believe rightly so. The Government has not really come clean. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is telling us that the Returned Services League (RSL) is out of touch. One wonders why the Prime Minister in his promise specifically referred to the RSL having reasonable cause for dissatisfaction. In that clause he did not mention the other veterans organisations. He said, `and no formal decision will be taken if the RSL has reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangement'. Well, the RSL does have reasonable cause for dissatisfaction, but it is not alone. So do the other organisations. The reality is, for example, that members of the Vietnam Veterans Association in Queensland collected a petition of 1,131 signatures which they tried to take to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Humphreys, in his Brisbane office only to find that he refused to see them if they came accompanied by the media. That was the younger generation of veterans making sure that the Minister understood that they, too, were concerned about the integration proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The questionnaire to which I have been referring and which the Minister has answered so inadequately was a matter of great concern not just to the RSL but also to the war widows, to the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Association, to the prisoner of war bodies, and to members of the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council-all are concerned, not just the RSL. It is right that they should be concerned. They are realists. They can see that the answers are not there; the Government does not have the answers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind you, Madam Deputy President, that only this week in the Senate, when I asked Senator Tate about the waiting lists at the Royal Hobart Hospital in our State, I was told they have doubled in this past year, and that the usage of that State Government hospital by veterans has also doubled. What are they going to do in the future as those waiting lists grow? Are they going to be able to give priority of access to our Tasmanian veterans in the Royal Hobart Hospital, our other major government hospital in Tasmania? They cannot give that guarantee, they will not give that guarantee and they would be very foolish if they did. Yet, they are trying to get the veterans' community to understand that they can give that priority of access. All Australians know and it is similar around this country because every State has this problem with waiting lists, yet these veterans are to be shunted off onto those public waiting lists for elective surgery. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last month in New South Wales, the Minister for Health, Mr Collins, told the veterans' organisations-and I am quoting from a paper that he put out for them:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the State does not and will not hold out any guarantee of priority for Veterans . . . must always be in accordance with medical need.</PARA>
<PARA>Now, we know that. Why does the Government fool itself or try to fool the veterans?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Humphreys himself is also one of the concerns that the veterans have because, under his responsibility, he is allowing the existing repatriation hospitals to not receive the capital that they need to maintain the quality of care. My colleague Senator Herron will be talking about quality of care in more detail. I draw attention to a couple of letters which relate to Western Australia, but similar situations have been occurring in other States. One is a letter from Mr Humphreys to the honourable member for Canning, Mr Gear. Mr Gear wrote about personal representations for the Returned Services League in Western Australia and about what was happening in Ward 17 in the Hollywood Repatriation General Hospital there. The Minister said he would point out to Mr Gear that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the case for refurbishing Ward 17 would be stronger if the Western Australian Government agreed at sometime in the future that the hospital must be transferred to the State. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what a gun at the head there. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, wrote to Mr Hall, the State President of the RSL in Western Australia, pointing out the same thing:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Humphreys has assured me that until a permanent solution is found his Department will continue to make every effort to maintain the Ward in a serviceable condition. </PARA>
<PARA>But that ward does not need servicing; that is one of the wards that have had rain coming in through the roof. I think they have managed to fix some of the rain coming in the roof, but it needs upgrading to give the veterans the quality of care to which they are entitled by their service to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just draw attention to what we discovered today in the Senate, and this is one of the most damning things of all. In the Committee of the Whole, I was trying to find out, from the Minister who represents the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in this place, just what the basis was on which the decision to integrate these hospitals was taken. What did the Minister tell me? It was quite clear from his statements and from the advice from the Department of Veterans' Affairs advisers that the Government had made that decision based on no projections at all as to the usage by veterans of the repatriation hospitals, of the public hospital system or of the private hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> Although they know what the numbers will be from now until 2000 and beyond and have detailed studies of projections, they could not or did not advise the Government as to what their projections would be for the usage of the different systems nor did they give the Government any advice at all on cost-whether there will be an increased cost of the proposals for the new arrangements, whether it will be a cost savings scheme, or what. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently, this Government makes such important and far-reaching decisions, which change a tradition that we have had in this country since the early years of this century, based on no hard evidence or information. I ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President: what sort of decision making is that? So that is where the Government stands in my opinion-totally condemned for its cynical treatment of the men and women who have fought for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's promises to our children and to our ex-servicemen and women seem to have been made to be broken. The Prime Minister may think that war widows and veterans are just little old ladies and silly old buggers. But Australia will judge this Government on the way it treats its children in poverty and its returned service men and women-in other words, the vulnerable in our community and the people who most have a claim on our care. So, after breaking his solemn promise to our children, the Prime Minister cannot afford to break his pledge to our veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will maintain the pledge of this Government, as has been the case with previous governments of both sides in Australia's history, to the veterans who have returned from service overseas, who have put themselves at the service of the country in the defence forces and, of course, those who depend on them, such as their widows. The fact is that the Prime Minister's assurances, which have been given in the quotation to be found in the matter of public importance, are taken extremely seriously by this Government and I am quite sure that the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) will find in the undertaking that all of its reasonable causes for dissatisfaction will be examined and remedied. The RSL will find that that undertaking will be fulfilled in its entirety. In fact, as shown in a letter from Ian Gollings, the National Secretary of the RSL, published in the Australian Financial Review quite recently, I think 7 November, the RSL recognises the inevitability of integration. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The RSL is not, as a general principle, against the integration proposal in its proper place and at its proper time . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that it does not think that proper time has arrived because it seeks further assurances from the Government. But the RSL recognises in principle that this particular proposal from the Federal Government is designed to assist those veterans who need hospital treatment to be provided with that treatment in a way that is more accessible to them, particularly in those areas away from the major repatriation hospitals in our major cities. </PARA>
<PARA> Many veterans look to receive the hospital care that they need in a location which is close to their family and friends; therefore, being able to be close to their family and friends and the doctors with whom they are familiar is more satisfactory from their point of view. I would have thought, given the ideological assumptions that underlie so much of the activities of the Opposition so far as choice is concerned, for example, that this element of the proposal that goes under the general title of integration would be extremely appealing to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that the RSL sees the benefits of this integration proposal and sees integration as inevitable but nevertheless seeks certain assurances. As I have said, the Prime Minister has given an undertaking that any reasonable cause for dissatisfaction will be examined, remedies will be found, the scheme will be modified and the proposals will be adjusted in order to deal with those reasonable concerns of the RSL. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, Sir William Keys, who is one of the most respected of ex-servicemen in Australia, has said in a letter dated 29 September 1990 that he believes that the Government's offer was most satisfactory in that it included private patient status to give veterans a wider choice of hospitals, including private hospitals and choice of doctor. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We all know that at the present time entitled veterans are seeking hospital treatment in a satisfactory institution closest to their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits are obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> It enables the family to keep in close touch with the veteran and it enables him, when he is feeling better, to make brief trips to home. </PARA>
<PARA> And it gives him the opportunity of being treated in his own community. </PARA>
<PARA>When a person of the status of Sir William Keys recognises the benefits of integration in those terms, one cannot--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman says that Sir William Keys is a stooge. I find that a remarkably offensive epithet to throw at a man who has had such a distinguished career both in the armed forces of this country and in service to the returned services community. That is the type of hysterical debating style which Senator Newman engages in, to the great unsettling of members of the veteran community. To call Sir William Keys a stooge of the Government I think is totally offensive, certainly to Sir William and, I am sure, to many members of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is typical of Senator Newman to go around the community making those sorts of comments. It is nice to get them on the public record instead of in the various visits that she makes to the repatriation hospitals around Australia and to meetings of veterans. I note that, when she did the round of State RSL conferences shortly after assuming responsibility for veterans' affairs, she distinguished herself by wearing a badge saying, `Hands Off Our Hospitals'. I wonder whether she told the same unionists of the coalition's policy to contract out hospital services, as indicated in the supplementary notes to the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan. Dr Hewson, who was then the shadow Treasurer, indicated that candidates for contracting out which could be identified included: security in hospitals, repairs and maintenance of hospitals, cleaning in hospitals, catering in hospitals, laundry services in hospitals, waste disposal in hospitals, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman might wear the badge of the union in order to give herself a little bit of an in with those at these rallies she tries to organise but, in fact, she does not admit to the fact that she would undertake actions, as part of the coalition, which would undermine the very union whose badge she professes to wear. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Federal Government will maintain its responsibility to veterans; it certainly will not pass to the States. It is a very real responsibility which is taken with due gravity by the Government. The whole idea is that veterans should receive treatment where they can perhaps be treated locally and have a choice of doctor and hospital. I know from Tasmanian experience that travelling down the Midlands Highway from the north or across the Bass Highway from the north-west to be treated in the repatriation hospital in Hobart means a lot of travel, inconvenience and difficulty for them and their relatives. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Newman" NAMEID="BE4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. We are saying there should be a reinforcement of that obvious desire by veterans in relation to the proposals, which, as I say, are entitled `integration'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the priority of access question is concerned, quite clearly one is in a situation where the repatriation services which will be available for veterans will be organised in a way which ensures that a veteran can receive the sort of hospital treatment that is assessed by his proper medical advisers as being required. Whether that is in a repatriation hospital, as a private patient in a public hospital, or as a private patient in a private hospital, the fact is that the Australian Government will honour its obligations to ensure that a veteran receives the treatment in hospital that is required. As I say, it can be by way of various places of treatment being provided. As there is some difficulty in some instances in getting access to a hospital bed, the private hospital sector can then be looked at and, as a private patient, the veteran would be treated within that private hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question which is put in the matter of public importance about the interests of hospital staff being adequately safeguarded, once again we have a process of consultation taking place, quite properly, by the Government in order to ensure that staff interests are, indeed, properly protected. Over recent months the Commonwealth officers have been discussing these matters with both the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the relevant unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that these negotiations-and Senator Newman must know this-have resulted in a very large measure of agreement. The few remaining issues will be discussed directly by the ACTU and the unions with Ministers. I believe that even next week it is hoped that particular meeting can be arranged so we can move to a final resolution of the staffing questions. These are very real concerns and they need to be dealt with in a proper and fair manner. I am confident that the ACTU, the unions and the Ministers will come to such a resolution next week. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the integration proposal can be made to work in a way which will derive a lot of support not only from the official organisations of the veterans' communities but also from those many veterans who do not belong to particular organisations but nevertheless need to have their voices heard and their concerns addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative use of the hospital system, which I believe Senator Newman speaks about, where more members of the general community go into the repatriation hospitals in order to keep those hospitals functioning, is something that I do not believe the Government nor, I would have thought, the Opposition should accept. There is no reason for this, particularly in light of the new federalism which is bringing an era of commonsense to the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States as to which government ought to undertake the provision of certain services. I would have thought the idea of having general community patients going into repatriation hospitals in any great numbers would go against the general policy, which is that the provision of public hospital services should be by the States concerned for their communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the final matter which Senator Newman raised, which was the question of the Government making decisions without proper costings-she claimed-being available to justify those decisions, reveals how driven the Opposition is by monetary and financial considerations. The fact is that this Government can come to a policy decision which it knows to be right, useful and beneficial for veterans. The consequential effects of that decision in relation to the costs and the financing are matters which can then be dealt with. But these decisions were not taken in order to achieve certain cost savings; they were taken in order to provide a better service. That is the order of the consideration of these matters by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The former shadow Minister, now Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Fischer, is reported in the Mercury of 17 March 1989 as saying that integration would be more valid when the number of veterans, nationally, dropped below 10,000. Unless we become involved in another war, we can expect to get below 10,000 veterans with theatre of war qualifying service some time around 2025 or 2030. I do not know whether Senator Newman would agree with that particular pronouncement by Mr Fischer-whether that is the coalition's timeframe for integration or whether she has some other timeframe in mind. But it is quite clear that that is an inordinately stupid timeframe for integration. </PARA>
<PARA> The timeframe set down by the Government is one that is being negotiated with the States. It is a matter for agreement with the States. Nobody can be bludgeoned into the particular series of agreements being negotiated in the various jurisdictions by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) together with the various health Ministers in the various States of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> As those agreements move closer to being negotiated to conclusion, there will be public statements from time to time, such as the one by Mr Collins, which can be interpreted in a negative fashion. I believe they are just part of the negotiating stance in these final crucial stages. I believe that Mr Collins, together with Mr Humphreys, will be able to reach a resolution of the matters which will enable veterans-for example in New South Wales-to receive the hospital care and treatment which they deserve given their history of service to the Australian community, even to the stage of putting themselves in great peril and jeopardy and being in a position where they could be killed in conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> That gives rise to certain obligations in the Australian community. The responsibility to meet those obligations is fairly and squarely on the Commonwealth Government. It will undertake those responsibilities; it will never shirk them. But it believes that it can, in a practical sense, discharge those responsibilities in a cooperative and collaborative agreement with the various State governments. That is what is being negotiated now. I believe that the reasonable assurances the RSL seeks in these matters can and will be given in a way which ensures that veterans are provided with the most beneficial range of hospital services to care for them in their health requirements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the proposition that Senator Newman has put before the Senate. She suggested in this proposition that it is a matter of public importance that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) honour a promise to a particular section of the community, a very special section -the veterans of this nation. It is a matter of public importance that such promises be honoured. But, of course, this promise stands among many.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Veterans in the Australian community have been promised and assured things by Prime Ministers from Billy Hughes onwards. The Prime Minister of today, in terms that would be understood by veterans, is carrying a baton that has been passed on from one government to another since the time of Billy Hughes. Those obligations have not been diminished one iota in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister made this particular promise in April 1989. Seven days ago in this place I asked Minister Tate representing Minister Humphreys whether the Government was prepared to honour promises-they were described as ironclad promises-that had been made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in October 1988. The responses I got from Senator Tate representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs were interesting. He alleged that I was rumour mongering, scaremongering, being irresponsible in raising these issues and putting fear among the veterans' community, suggesting that I would be creating distress among the veterans' community by asking whether the promises of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs were to be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in response to an interjection by Senator Newman, Senator Tate has suggested that the veterans' community would once again be distressed. I think the veterans are distressed. They are distressed not by today's interjection, not by my question of last week, but by the fact that they have been promised for decades that certain things would stay in place. Those things are changing. Despite the assurances offered here last week, or even today again by Senator Tate, or by Senator Reynolds in previous times when responding to my earlier questions-despite all the assurances-the veterans now find that with the integration of the two systems they are being let down. They are in queues for general hospitals whereas previously there were not in queues for their own specialised repatriation hospital. There is distress out there; there is uncertainty. It is our responsibility to bring that uncertainty in here and to place it squarely back where it should be-with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The assurances that we have had are that, if the Returned Services League (RSL) has concerns, those concerns will be resolved. Of course the RSL has concerns. I can quote from a letter which appeared in the Australian Financial Review which suggests that the National Secretary of the RSL, Ian Gollings, still has grave concerns that this system of integration will not deliver. In that letter he cites the assurances that began 70 years ago. He cites the fact that after 70 years veterans are being subjected to what many of them, and frankly I, see as a sell-out. </PARA>
<PARA> One can qualify it, as Senator Tate did the other day in responding to my question, by citing a survey that had been done among veterans. The survey showed that 70 per cent of the veterans favoured the change. But we know that it depends on what questions are asked of people. If they are asked whether they would find it more convenient to be hospitalised near their homes and near their loved ones, of course they would say yes. But they were not asked whether they have confidence that they will be delivered that hospitalisation in a satisfactory way. I am quite sure that far less than 70 per cent of the veterans would have expressed confidence in the system. Even if they had expressed confidence months ago when they were asked, if they were asked today whether they have that confidence they would certainly say that they do not have it because they are currently having a bad experience. That is what is happening in the hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the political administrative dimension of this. The other day in my question to Senator Tate I cited the fact that at least the New South Wales State health Minister said that he would not offer any assurances while a price tag of $150m was associated with the assurances. The same reservation was expressed by the Western Australian health Minister and the Tasmanian health Minister. Of course there is that reservation. The buck is being passed-literally. The responsibility is being passed but it remains to be seen whether the buck will be passed to the State governments to take up that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the question I asked of him the other day, Senator Tate said that I was not up to date with Mr Collins's position. I rang Mr Collins's office this morning and asked him what his position was. I could not get a position. Of course the Government will not get an assurance. Of course the State Ministers want to keep their options open. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why should they not? If they do not tell me, why can they not state their position to the veterans community? Perhaps they will not tell me, but let them tell the veterans. If this service depends upon the attitude and assurances of State Ministers, let them give those assurances, otherwise the Prime Minister cannot honour this promise. Unless he has the assurances, he cannot honour the promise he has made to veterans. No assurances are available. Therefore, this transition cannot occur in the manner that has been promised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the decision for this to occur has been taken irrespective of the consequences. Irrespective of the outcome, this transition will occur. Frankly, I believe there is an air of indifference about what the veterans feel or experience. I illustrate that indifference. When I first became spokesperson for this portfolio in 1987 I attended a meeting in Coolangatta. Three thousand veterans were there to express concern about things like that. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs did not turn up. In 1988 I attended a public rally in the Sydney Town Hall. It was an overflow crowd that spilled out into the streets. There were about 3,000 people. The Minister did not turn up. Do honourable senators know what he called it? He called it a rent-a-crowd. Yet, at that meeting were the leaders of the RSL movement and the leaders of the veterans' movement. They had convened the meeting. People came to express concern about this process, and their Minister, who was not there, called them a rent-a-crowd. A year later, in 1989, a similar rally was convened. The other shadow Minister and I were there; again, the Minister was not there. </PARA>
<PARA> After the last election I was staggered to find that this Minister retained that portfolio, so low was the confidence of the veterans' community as a result of these snubs, decisions and sell-outs. There is disillusionment and cynicism in the veterans' community. And rightly so, not only because State Ministers, irrespective of their political colour, cannot and will not give the assurances necessary for this transition to occur satisfactorily for veterans but also because the veterans can perceive the fact that there has been a dramatic erosion of their entitlements. Senator Newman and I have stood in this place and listed, on behalf of veterans, entitlement after entitlement that has been eroded over the last few years. This is but only another dimension of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently saw a copy of a letter-I do not have it here but the Minister will be aware of it-sent to the Prime Minister by the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. The letter said in part, `We are the next generation of veterans; we are in the present generation of veterans. But when the old and bold go we, in our late forties and fifties, will still be here for another 20 or 30 years.' Those obligations made by successive government after government are as real now as when they were first uttered 40 and 50 years ago and this is a dramatic real erosion of those obligations. So there are two quite real dimensions to it. Veterans are concerned that their entitlements, at large, are disappearing. Privileged hospitalisation is only one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other dimension to their concern is the fact that suddenly this responsibility has been passed elsewhere. It has been passed to those who do not have an historic obligation to it and who do not, cannot and will not have a commitment to the type of hospitalisation warranted for veterans and which will not now be available to them irrespective of how many promises the Prime Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs or Senator Tate make. It will not happen any more because the system is being dismantled. The veterans have the right to be concerned. By virtue of the history of this Government in addressing their needs in recent years, by virtue of this Minister's behaviour and by virtue of the erosion of their hospital system, they have the right to be cynical-and they are profoundly cynical about what is happening to their circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The repatriation hospital system has been built up over the last 50 years and now it will be destroyed in five. There are six repatriation general hospitals in Australia: one at Concord in New South Wales, one at Heidelberg in Victoria, one at Daw Park in South Australia, one at Hollywood in Western Australia, the repatriation general hospital in Hobart in Tasmania, and one at Greenslopes in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I attended a public meeting in March this year that was called as a result of a advertisement in the newspaper before the election. It was interesting that 400 people attended that meeting. There was standing room only. There was no rent-a-crowd. They were ordinary people who had been served by the repatriation hospital scheme. There were warders, cleaners, cooks, medical officers, nurses and veterans who attended as a result of that notice. </PARA>
<PARA> I learnt something at that meeting. I had thought, as a previous serving member of the 11th Field Ambulance, a former President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) in Queensland and surgeon to the Royal Australian Air Force in Queensland, that I knew a lot about the repatriation system; that I had seen it from the other side. I learnt from that meeting that the veterans and their dependants had been given an assurance that they were to have a superior system of quality care-not public hospital care or private hospital care, but a superior system that had been guaranteed to them as a result of their war service. They risked their lives and their families suffered and we, as a nation, owe them a superior quality of care, not an ordinary system. They have earned it and they deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Government is promising and proposing that they be dumped onto the public hospital system. What is the state of the public hospital system in Australia? Public hospitals are overcrowded and underfunded. As my colleague Senator Newman said, waiting lists for elective surgery, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, have lengthened dramatically. I draw the attention of the Senate to today's Sydney Morning Herald-so I am speaking about today. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Medical services at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney's largest teaching hospital, are so overloaded that patients booked to come in for medical treatment or tests rarely get in. They could be admitted only as emergencies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Last week Dr Jean Lennane was sacked for campaigning against the closure of wards and services at Rozelle Hospital and a few weeks ago the Medical Superintendent at Campbelltown Hospital was demoted for stating that the Hospital was underfunded and for saying that from the end of the year there would be no resident doctor on duty in intensive care. This is the State that has the best fiscal management in Australia. One can only guess at the problems which are today facing the public hospitals of Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, considering the enormous financial problems facing those States as a result of the mismanagement of the Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Common to all States, however, are the problems of an ageing population. In the next 10 years two in every 10 Australians will be over the age of 50 and accompanying this ageing will be a constant increase in chronic illness. There are, and will be, even greater strains on the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> Paradoxically, my State has further problems with a rapidly increasing population. Up to 800,000 people are expected to come to Queensland and increase the population to that extent in the next 10 years. Capital expenditure on the public hospitals in my State for the next financial year is $10m for the whole State. A survey of the Royal Brisbane Hospital has shown that $400m needs to be spent urgently to bring it up to the current southern standards. That is the system to which the repatriation people are supposed to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Hospitals are not just bricks and mortar. There is an ethos about hospitals. Each hospital has developed over many years. There are needs peculiar to the patients of those hospitals and the staff and already repatriation general hospitals are integrated with universities and university teaching hospitals, both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, for medical students and for students of nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics and other areas. This aspect is of enormous importance and it cannot possibly be absorbed by the existing public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter is the fact that the repatriation hospitals cater for non-veteran patients in order to maintain their standards as acute care institutions and to develop the opportunity of medical research into the particular conditions that are more common in veterans, such as hypertension. Some researchers at repatriation hospitals have developed units of world standing. For instance, in my State the unit at Greenslopes Hospital is headed by Professor Richard Gordon, who has achieved world renown because of his developments at that hospital. Similar units doing research exist in other States. Of course, there is some variation between the States as to the number of community patients that attend repatriation hospitals. At Concord Hospital this year it has reached 35 per cent-it is 20 per cent at Greenslopes Hospital. I believe that the original aim was to have a 20 per cent development of those numbers to allow the continuation of acute care. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note, as my colleague Senator Newman said, that 50 per cent of the needs of veterans and their dependants are met at this time by the repatriation hospitals. Half of those eligible actually use these hospitals and, of the remainder, two-thirds go to public hospitals and one-third go privately. Of course, this depends upon the percentage of people who have private hospital cover, the facilities available and the proportion of the population living in capital cities. Notwithstanding that, public non-veteran patients cost the Department of Veterans' Affairs approximately $88m last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> A further factor is the declining number of veterans with increasing age but, of course, coincident with this is the increase in treatment required because of their advancing age and the increasing incidence of chronic illness among those veterans. It is believed that this demand will not peak until 1995-96, as has already been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, firstly, veterans have been guaranteed superior quality care in the past-not public care or private care; secondly, the requirements of veterans will not peak for another five or six years; thirdly, the State public hospital systems are already overcrowded and underfunded; fourthly, the demands of a rapidly ageing population in Australia and the cost of pharmaceuticals and technology will exacerbate these problems; and, fifthly, the ethos of these fine institutions as training and research facilities will be destroyed. Is it any wonder that the Opposition considers these matters to be ones of public importance?</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot let this occasion pass without responding to Senator Tate's remarks about Sir William Keys. Senator Newman interjected that Sir William Keys was a stooge of the Government. Earlier this year, on 26 May, I attended the AMA National Conference held in Canberra. Sir William Keys spoke at that meeting as Chairman of the National Office of Overseas Skill Recognition. He came to that meeting and delivered a paper on the necessity of registering migrants with overseas medical qualifications without any consideration of the number of medical students that we are already graduating from the hospitals. His speech outraged the people who were listening to it. They could not believe that a person of his standing and calibre could deliver a speech of this nature. He was attacked from the floor by many speakers. He was spoken to afterwards and we discovered that he had arrived back in Australia from overseas that morning, had gone to the Conference and had delivered a speech that he had not actually read. It had been handed to him by the Government Department before he went to the Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the definition of a stooge is, but I think that that definition would fit somebody who would be capable of attending a meeting, delivering a paper handed to him by a government and then trying to defend it without having any idea what was in the paper. </PARA>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING ENTITLED `PRIORITIES FOR REFORM IN HIGHER EDUCATION'</PARA>
<PARA> For the information of honourable members, I present a statement containing the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Priorities for Reform in Higher Education. The report was released on 26 June 1990 and was tabled in the Senate on 22 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government finds the report disappointing in that, while the issues it discusses clearly are important for the future of higher education in Australia, the specific recommendations arising from this discussion are of limited usefulness. In some cases the recommendations are framed at too high a leve of generality to provide the basis for practical government policies. In others, there is a failure to take account of steps already taken by the Government. Overall, the report fails to acknowledge the substantial priority the Government has already given to addressing many of the concerns it raises.</PARA>
<PARA> In my response I have addressed the seven recommendations made by the Committee. In addition, I have responded to some of the more significant issues in the report which did not lead to particular recommendations. A number of these issues will be taken up when the Government responds to the policy paper of the Higher Education Council, Higher Education; The Challenges Ahead. This paper is due for public release shortly and the Government intends to respond early in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA>QUALITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA> The main theme of the report is its concern with the quality of higher education offerings. The Committee began its public hearings for this inquiry in May 1989 when the reforms arising from the Government's White Paper on higher education, which was released in July 1988, were in the early stages of implementation. In part, the Committee is critical of the Government's approach in the White Paper for concentrating on structural reform at the expense of quality, and it goes on to identify those dimensions of quality which it believes are open to criticism. At the same time, the Committee acknowledges the high standards of the Australian higher education system in the technical areas of the curriculum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee focuses on the narrowness of the academic curriculum, and the lack of importance accorded to languages and cultures other than English; lack of preparation for the process of lifelong learning; and failure to emphasise effective communication skills. It also raises questions about standards of teaching in higher education, citing submissions drawing attention to poor quality teaching and to the lack of reward for excellence in teaching. </PARA>
<PARA> Quality has been, and will continue to be, a major focus of the Government's initiatives in reforming the higher education system. At the outset of its White Paper, the Government stated its commitment to ``growth and quality enhancement across the whole of the education and training system'' and these have been the major objectives of the series of reforms to the higher education system since 1988. It is somewhat artificial to separate structural change from improvements to quality. In most cases the rationale for the structural change in higher education was to improve academic opportunities and to provide for a higher standard of education. The amalgamation of higher education institutions, for instance, a significant component of the structural change the Committee refers to, has as its major objective the improvement of educational effectiveness and efficiency by expanding the range and flexibility of studies available within each institution, increasing the strength of academic departments and support facilities and concentrating research and development effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the evidence put forward in individual submissions, the Committee relied heavily in this area on the findings of discipline reviews or committees of inquiry especially appointed by the Government to examine particular fields of study in higher education. Since 1985 the Government has supported a program of reviews of major discipline areas in higher education which, among other things, look at the adequacy of the curriculum. Each of these reviews and inquiries, which to date have covered the fields of law, engineering, teacher education in maths and science, accounting, agriculture, Australian Studies, Asian Studies and languages, was in effect an acknowledgement of the need to improve the quality of delivery of programs in these areas, and each led to reforms and action in the particular field of study affected. It is unfortunate that the Committee, while citing evidence from these studies, fails to go the further step and examine what reforms have been put in place as an outcome of these examinations. </PARA>
<PARA> The effectiveness of the discipline review program has recently been evaluated by a working party of the Higher Education Council which has suggested ways in which the process can be made more cost effective and the implementation of recommendations of reviews assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> While the discipline review program is funded by the Government as an external measure of quality assurance, as the Committee itself emphasises it is important to respect the autonomy of institutions in relation to curriculum matters and approaches to teaching. These matters have for long been removed from central control, although the Commonwealth expects a commitment from higher education institutions to maintaining high academic standards and is aware that most institutions regularly re-examine individual course content and focus. There is no intention on the part of the Government that this approach should change. </PARA>
<PARA> Five of the report's seven recommendations relate to quality and the standard of teaching, and I will respond to those now:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) sponsor an Australia-wide program to assist institutions to evaluate the purposes and structure of the undergraduate curriculum across all disciplines with a view to encouraging them to broaden the nature of the educational experiences provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government would have difficulty in accepting a recommendation as general as this. What the Committee appears to be proposing is an exercise of vast scope which would require the commitment of extensive resources. It is not at all clear what an Australia-wide program of the kind proposed could achieve, or whether it would be warranted. It is questionable whether the objective of broadening the curriculum that is laid down in the recommendation is appropriate across all institutions and disciplines. The structure and content of the undergraduate curriculum is essentially a matter for higher education institutions to determine. Some institutions have deliberately broadened their undergradate curriculum, as the Committee itself acknowledges, and options are always available to students, particularly in the larger, amalgamated institutions, to broaden their educational experiences. This then becomes a matter of individual choice, and is not an area where the Commonwealth ought to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is of course concerned that appropriate standards are maintained in the higher education system. The program of discipline reviews mentioned previously exist as an external quality control mechanism supported by the Commonwealth. The Register of Australian Tertiary Education (RATE), set up by the Australian Education Council, has a Register Advisory Committee which is concerned with national standards. The Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee has also established academic standards panels in selected disciplines to advise on standards in honours courses across institutions and there is scope for this work to be extended as a quality assurance measure. </PARA>
<PARA> With these systems in place, in addition to other Commonwealth initiatives directed at improvement in the quality of higher education programs, the Government considers it unnecessary to invite NDEET to institute a wide-ranging review. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that funds be made available from the Commonwealth's Reserve Fund to support and evaluate curriculum innovations and to disseminate information about them</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> In the two years that the Reserve Fund has been operating, funds have been provided for curriculum developments in areas of national priority in higher education. The rationale for the grants is to seed initiatives which will benefit not only the host institution but higher education generally. The 1990 Reserve fund program includes curriculum developments in environmental studies, multicultural education and Asian languages and studies. The priority areas for the 1991 program include Australian studies as well as those just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Australian Research Council (ARC) provide funds for a research project into the communication difficulties of students in Australian higher education institutions. The project should consider both oral and written communication and base its findings on a range of institutions and disciplines. The principal objectives should be to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) assess the proportion of students whose performance is adversely affected by communication difficulties;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) identify the kinds of difficulties commonly experienced; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) recommend appropriate remedial measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government questions the likely value of such a project on this scale, although it would draw attention to initiatives that are already being taken in this area which have a narrower focus. For example, a number of projects currently being funded by the ARC relate to learning and teaching problems in particular disciplines, as well as communication and other problems experienced by students. </PARA>
<PARA> Most higher education institutions have established support units for students with communication problems. These units are in the best position to appreciate the extent and nature of the problems experienced and to know what remedial measures are appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's Higher Education Equity Program, funds have been provided to institutions to assist the provision of programs designed to improve opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These programs have included learning assistance centres, study skills programs, and preparatory and supplementary support programs in literacy, numeracy and communication skills. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 4 and 5</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Committee recommends that the promotion of good teaching within higher education institutions be designated a national priority area and that, in the context of the development of profiles, institutions be requested to provide information on policies and programs which they have adopted to achieve this aim. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Committee recommends that funds be provided on a competitive basis through the Reserve Fund to support projects aimed at improving the quality of teaching. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges that traditionally in higher education, a high standard of research performance has been valued above excellence in teaching. It is however becoming increasingly common for institutions to evaluate teaching performance with a view to rewarding excellence. The Higher Education Council has addressed this issue in its policy paper, Higher Education: The Challenges Ahead and the Government has also taken steps to ensure that teaching skills are accorded the same value as research. In its negotiations on academic awards under the Structural Efficiency Principal, the Government has emphasised its commitment to improving the quality of teaching and to staff development. It has also funded the establishment of the Staff Development Fund to assist institutions to expand their staff development activity. Continued support for the Fund will depend on the development of institution-based staff development strategies consistent with nationally determined guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1991, ``improved academic teaching'' has been identified as a priority for applications for support from the Reserve Fund. This was included in the Guidelines for application which were distributed in April 1990. All proposals aimed at enhancing the quality of higher education, including the quality of teaching, will be assessed on a competitive basis with the aim of incorporating into the program the highest standard projects. </PARA>
<PARA>TEACHING AND ACADEMIC STAFF</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes a connection between its concern with the standard of teaching and academic staffing policies, drawing particular attention to a decline in the relative value of academic salaries, a lack of promotion opportunities and factors in the employment environment which affect the attractiveness of university teaching as a profession. It also expresses concern about likely shortages of academic staff, and considers it a priority to ensure that accurate information is available on the extent of that shortage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee acknowledges that the Government has taken action by appointing a working party to analyse the labour market for academic teaching staff. This leads to a further recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the NBEET consider the results of the study of the labour market for academics when they become available, form an assessment of the nature and extent of the problems of academic staff recruitment and retention which are likely to emerge, and make recommendations concerning the measures required to ensure that high quality staff continue to be attracted to academic teaching and research in sufficient numbers in all disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Through its involvement in the negotiations on academic staffing matters under the Structural Efficiency Principle, the Commonwealth has indicated its readiness to fund substantial salary increases and has actively sought improvements in a number of non salary matters relating to career structures which would improve the attractiveness of an academic carrer. These negotiations are still under way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has taken action also to address the potential shortage of academic staff. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has initiated a labour market analysis referred to in the recommendation to determine the extent and nature of existing recruitment and retention difficulties for academic staff and to prepare forecasts of supply and demand to the year 2000. A report is expected later in the year. A decision will be made at that time as to how its findings would be most appropriately dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also acted to increase the allocation of additional places in higher education to higher degree students (a significant proportion of the additional intakes to be funded in 1993 will be set aside for higher degree students), to increase the number of Australian Postgraduate Research Awards ( an additional 100 awards will be available from 1991), to improve the financial assistance available under postgraduate awards, including the provision of loadings for awards in high priority areas, and to liberalise the migrant and permanent resident entry provisions to facilitate the entry of overseas academic staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The labour market analysis referred to above will assist the Government in determining what further steps might be needed. </PARA>
<PARA>LIFELONG LEARNING</PARA>
<PARA>One of the other major areas of interest of the Committee is lifelong learning. This is indeed an issue which will assume increasing importance in Australia, as demographic trends and award restructuring create a climate where students will expect to enter and leave higher education at different stages of their working lives. In the light of its concern that adult and continuing education should not be a marginal activity within higher education, the Committee has made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth establish a permanent policy focus for adult and continuing education at the national level. This mechanism should be established within the structure of NBEET and should report in the first instance to either the Chair of NBEET or the Chair of the Higher Education Council. It should assume a leadership role for continuing education and develop policies appropriate to the emerging educational needs of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts that continuing education or lifelong learning will become a major priority for higher education in the future. The recommendation for a ``permanent policy focus'' does not seem particularly helpful at this stage. In its paper Higher Education: The Challenges Ahead, the Higher Education Council has taken into account the likelihood that the student body will become increasingly diverse as a result of award restructuring and other trends and has therefore proposed a number of strategies in relation to admissions policies, course design and accreditation and modes of delivery. The Government will respond to the Council's proposals in the policy paper to be released early next year, and will also be giving consideration to developing a reference to the Council on this issue. At this stage, the Government has not decided on the most appropriate administrative mechanism for advancing the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has acknowledged the importance of continuing and adult education through the establishment of new distance education arrangements, through the provision of significant additional funding for the development of new teaching technology and curricula focusing on adult learning and with the consistent emphasis being given to credit transfer and course articulation issues, and with its support for cooperative education programs which involve joint activity between higher education institutions and sponsoring companies.</PARA>
<PARA>ACCESS AND EQUITY</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has devoted a chapter of its report to the questions of access and equity, but acknowledges the comprehensiveness of the initiatives the Government has taken since the White Paper and the strategies set out in A Fair Chance for All, which sets out a national equity strategy and sets targets for increased participation for each of the identified groups. The Government certainly shares the Committee's view of the importance of equity in access to higher education. The Committee makes no specific recommendations on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It does however make the suggestion that close monitoring of institutional commitment to the achievement of equity objectives is required, a view shared by the Government which, in addition to monitoring institutional achievements through the profiles process, is also canvassing a range of options to establish a closer link between equity performance and Commonwealth funding. As a first step, equity program funds, from 1991, will be allocated to institutions on the basis of equity plans included in institutional profiles, rather than for specific projects as in previous years. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee strongly urges that the Tertiary Awareness Program (TAP), an initiative funded under the Commonwealth higher education program since 1985, should be extended to other regions. The effectiveness of TAP in encouraging post-school participation among the socioeconomically disadvantaged youth in Western Sydney has recently been evaluated. I am satisfied that the TAP strategies are effective and I am currently exploring options for the continuation of TAP initiatives with the support of the Commonwealth, relevant State authorities and higher education institutions, within the new equity funding arrangements. Institutions in other regions have been encouraged to incorporate, where appropriate, similar strategies into their equity plans. </PARA>
<PARA>OTHER ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has raised a range of other issues relating to the management of the higher education system. It does not however make further specific recommendations. In most cases, the concerns raised by the Committee have in fact been taken up by the Government in the process of implementing the White Paper reforms. </PARA>

I would like to congratulate the bureaucrat who wrote this because he or she seems to have unerringly tried to close the debate at a time when the community wants to see the whole issue of what we want to do with higher education opened. I guess that is the aim of bureaucracies everywhere, especially a bureaucracy as socially and intellectually isolated as some of the parts that service us in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will go into some of the details as to why I have come, reluctantly as I said, to that conclusion. The Government's response criticises the report for providing specific recommendations that are, to quote the Government's response, `of limited usefulness'. In response to that I need to remind the Government that the Committee is not an interdepartmental committee that sought to provide a bureaucratic model for future action. Our aim was to tease out the questions, to challenge assumptions and to suggest some courses of action. As a committee, we always assumed that the detailed mechanisms were a matter for government to decide. </PARA>
<PARA> Disappointing also is the Government's unwillingness to use the full powers and responsibilities of a national government to bring about reform. A number of statements are made throughout this paper in which the Government refuses to accept the challenge that the Committee's report placed before this Parliament. I will specifically indicate those at a later point. On page 3, for example, in relation to a review of disciplines or the curriculum, the Government again says:</PARA>
<PARA>These matters have for long been removed from central control, although the Commonwealth expects a commitment from higher education institutions to maintaining high academic standards and is aware that most institutions regularly re-examine individual course content and focus . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no intention on the part of the Government that this approach should change. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in many ways it is said through implication that the Government has no intention of interfering in any way in the situation in which the universities or institutions themselves make decisions about course content and focus. The Committee did not indicate in its report that the Government should be prescriptive or that it should step into this arena and force institutions to move in a particular direction in terms of broadening and analysing their curriculum; the Committee was saying that the Government should involve itself as a disseminator of information and should examine what goes on in institutions around Australia; it should then pick the best in terms of what is being done and disseminate those models through the system. In other words, the Government's role as a disseminator of information, ideas and models is what the Committee recommended. The Committee did not recommend a forced intervention in this area on the part of the Government, yet the clear implication in the Government's response is that it will not change its approach, which at this stage is basically an approach that leaves it up to the institutions themselves to decide. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly with the curriculum, the Committee indicated that it believes a broadening of curriculum in higher education institutions is very desirable. In discussions after the report came out, we talked about the phenomenon of the skilled barbarian-that is, the person who is technically very well equipped and well educated when he comes out of our higher institutions. At the same time, the Committee said that many young people who graduate from our institutions, although technically competent in their own field of activity or endeavour, or their own discipline, are fairly ignorant of the wider society into which they are going. They are fairly ignorant of the interrelationship between their own disciplines and the wider society around them. The Committee used the examples of doctors, lawyers and engineers, who knew their own disciplines very well but had very little idea of how those disciplines related to society at large. The Committee was pushing the notion that curriculums ought to be changed sufficiently and that models ought to be set up around Australia to encourage people to broaden their outlook. The Government does not seem to be interested in that particular proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended that the Commonwealth Government involve itself in a number of ways in research projects, either directly or through funding individual institutions, which would examine the curriculums and the type of activities and innovations that were being carried out in certain institutions. The Government indicated that it believes it is doing enough. On page 4 of its response it cites some of those activities:</PARA>
<PARA>The 1990 Reserve Fund program includes curriculum developments in environmental studies, multicultural education and Asian languages and studies. The priority areas for the 1991 program include Australian studies as well as those just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite laudable. It is interesting that even in the question of that vital area of lifting the percentage of people in Australian society who can speak a second language-after all, we are an exporting country-the response does not mention the need to continue the teaching of European languages. It does not mention the declining number of students in Australia who are learning European languages. It does not mention the need to examine this whole issue. There are 580 million people in Europe, a major market which in 1992 will become one unified market. A very significant number of people in that market speak German as a first or second language, particularly in eastern Europe. There is nothing to suggest that the Government under any circumstances has investigated the phenomenon of the declining percentage of students studying German in our higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Again we come back to the question that the bureaucrat who wrote this basically said, `Enough is what we can put on this paper. We don't need to broaden our horizons. We don't need to question the assumptions that underlie what we are doing. What we are doing is catalogued here and it should be sufficient'. That is a disappointing response to a report that took a year and a half to write, a report that went into depth in many areas and had a wonderful response from a significant number of major players in the game in higher education-from students, from teachers, from institutions themselves and from outside groups. It seems to me that much of that work will have been wasted if this is the sum total of the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is not whether or not the Government agrees with the specific recommendations suggested in this report. After all, as I said, we did not intend to act like an interdepartmental committee that was going to give specific recommendations for action. We wanted to raise the issues. We wanted to get people to think about higher education at a greater depth than is currently the case at government level. </PARA>
<PARA> The response is disappointing. It is defensive. It does not take into account one of the major underlying assumptions that we made-that the major improvements to the higher education system in Australia will come not through forced government intervention, and I do not think through the activities of the universities or the institutions themselves, but through assistance from a Commonwealth government which sees itself as an organisation in this area prepared to take ideas and find good models on which all reform can be based. We have said that the best way to reform the higher education system is to look at, analyse and then disseminate those good models of teaching, planning, curriculum development, funding operations and structuring which can be of use to other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the thing which struck me more than anything else as I looked at these institutions, as I looked at the submissions and as we read the literature associated with this area was that there is much good work being done in our higher education institutions, but that work often remains isolated and discrete in the institution where it is being done. The model is not being taken and disseminated throughout the academic community. Government's role ought to be to take those models and disseminate them; to encourage people in Melbourne, for example, to spread their ideas to other universities; to say to people in Sydney who are doing effective work there, `Have a look at this'. </PARA>
<PARA> This paper is basically a defensive, unimaginative response and it does not even take into account the notion of disseminating models. It seems to me that in many ways it falls into the same sort of trap that so many other responses of government have fallen into over the last 10 or 15 years, but this trend has got worse. The domination of the economic view of public issues-by economists, by bureaucrats who like nice, neat systems-has been the major problem in so many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> What we as a committee tried to do was to open up the debate, to say to Australians in this area, `Think about the possibilities; think about cooperation; think about sharing ideas; think about debating your major assumptions before you get into structural reform. Ask yourselves: What do you want out of your higher education institutions? When you have debated that, when you have come to some conclusions and you have asked the difficult, embarrassing questions, then you start bringing in structural reform'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply no point in amalgamating higher education institutions if at the end of the day we have not debated what we want to do with them, what we want to come out of them. All we end up with then is a bigger organisation which may have just the same lack of a sense of direction, and just the same lack of concern for quality teaching and learning, as the previous two institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply no point in a government setting up a funding research operation, centralising decisions about research funding in Australia, if at the end of the day it has not asked itself the basic question: What should be the balance between research and teaching? How do we reward good teaching? How do we promote good research in institutions without damaging the effectiveness of teaching in those institutions? How do we reward and promote good teachers in institutions but at the same time not lose those academics who are most skilled at research? When do we bring together a capacity for research and a capacity for good teaching? How do we set down regimes where rewards, financial and otherwise, are given to those people who say to themselves and to those around them, `I want to be a good teacher in a higher education institution, but I want the same rewards as someone who is an important researcher'?</PARA>
<PARA> Those basic questions have to be asked before we involve ourselves in structural reform. That has been the main criticism I have made for some time now of the approach taken by Minister Dawkins. I have said, `Get the debate going before you make the structural changes. If you don't like the debate, that is tough luck because in a debate people are going to say things about you which you don't like. They are going to criticise your assumptions; they are going to criticise your policies. But if you open your heart and your mind you will learn from what people put in'. </PARA>
<PARA> When we looked at the responses that came to our Committee we saw a great deal of goodwill from people in institutions. We saw a lot of defensiveness, but we saw many people-from students to academics to members of the general community-who wanted to reform our higher education system; to be able to stand up and say, `I am an academic. I am proud of it. The sector that I work in is a productive sector that is doing something for this country, and I get job satisfaction'. The Minister and the bureaucrats who wrote this response have to ask themselves: Is that happening? Can an academic stand up in public now and say, `I am proud of what I do. I am effective. My institution is effective. The Government is helping me in the best possible way. The Government is helping me learn from my colleagues around Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> Implicit in all of this is the need for us to have a truly national system of higher education. That does not mean, as I indicated before, that the Government has to get prescriptive in every detail about what that unified national system ought to be, but it does indicate quite clearly that the Government has to be that disseminator. It has to be that agent in the middle that can help institutions get together, that can promote debate, that can at the end of the day make our higher education system highly relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to remember that the percentage of people who have university degrees and the number of students who go on to find places at universities is only one part of the question. We can spend millions on achieving that goal. The second part of the question is: What is the quality of their education? What has their education done to make them better citizens, more civilised people with all-round knowledge and abilities, with an interest in their own society at large and a willingness to contribute to that society?</PARA>
<PARA> Have we turned out from some of our universities young people who are skilled in one area-the area of the particular narrow discipline that they have studied-and who do not want to know about, and have no interest in, other areas? Are we producing engineers, for example, who are aware that engineering affects a great deal of what we do; that engineers are in the middle of the great environmental debate; that it is not good enough for engineers to come out with a knowledge of the very narrow confines of their discipline; that what they do for the most part can have a very big influence on society around them?</PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania the Hydro-Electric Commission is basically a very big government or semi-government operation run by engineers. Technically it is a very competent organisation. Yet of all the semi-governmental and governmental organisations in Tasmania, it was the one that caused the most politically disastrous situations over the past decade. This happened primarily because its decisions were almost wholly and solely engineering decisions. The people who ran the Hydro-Electric Commission from top to bottom in many ways saw themselves only as engineers and dam builders. As a consequence Tasmania was thrown into political turmoil for a decade or more because of the narrowness of the people who were running that very important institution. That is just one example of what can happen when people are trained to be simply competent technicians, the skilled barbarians, the people who do not have a sense of the way their particular discipline impacts on the society around them. </PARA>
<PARA> The main aim behind this report was to get people thinking about higher education; to get them to question the assumptions that they had; to get them to talk about quality of learning and quality of teaching in our institutions. The aim was not to make specific recommendations about the structures that the Government should create. That is up to the Government. We wanted a questioning of this whole issue. What we have here is a document that narrows the debate and which defensively tries to tighten every knot, every loophole and works against debate. </PARA>
<PARA> More than anything else I want to give a message to the people behind this paper, and it is a simple message. I say: `Arise, Sir Humphrey, spread your wings and fly. This paper has got you grounded totally.' And the Minister should not have accepted this paper as a statement of what the Government's intentions are in higher education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to follow the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training with whom I participated in the inquiry on priorities for reform in higher education and in the writing of the report and recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with the Chairman's summary that this is a disappointing, defensive report. I go much further than that. I think that it is simply a disgrace. Not only has a bland bureaucrat put together some words to give an evasive Government response, but that bureaucrat has convinced the two Ministers-the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin)-to accept these words as fitting the prescription that I can only surmise Minister Dawkins put to those bureaucrats that he required those bureaucrats to write. I say Minister Dawkins because, although this is presented here today over the name of the Honourable Peter Baldwin, M.P., Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, the response has all the prescription of the senior Minister in his immediate remarks responding to the report when we published it. I regard it as a disgrace and I say, conscious of standing orders not to reflect upon persons in the other House, that the junior Minister, a person whom I respect, Peter Baldwin, has been duped by his senior Minister. He has allowed the Minister's prescription to be the one that the bureaucrats have written and that he has had to accept. Where is the conscientiousness, the imagination and the initiative of a Minister who ought to be a rising Minister in this Government and who ought to be applying every good idea to improve higher education because that is his responsibility? It is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at any Senate inquiry in which we not only invest our thought and our carefulness of report and recommendation but also do our best to summarise hundreds of submissions which come from the Australian public and which seek to improve an area of public life, and if we got this kind of response, we would experience the same emotion of regarding this as a disgrace. It is unbelievable to me that the Ministers of this Labor Government, Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin, have poisoned themselves to this Senate inquiry, as it would appear, from the beginning. I think that it can be for political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether that is because they do not like the eight personalities who made up the Senate report. I do not know whether it is because the agenda in education over the past three years has been that very limited agenda which Mr Dawkins dreamed up in the first month he was Minister-or it may have been in the first half day before the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) invited him to be the Minister. He certainly did have a strategy which was announced shortly after the 1987 election and precious little has been done in education, apart from that personal agenda of Mr Dawkins. He has driven that right through the Green Paper and the White Paper and in the implementation of so-called reforms in higher education against all the protests of this chamber and of representatives of higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The response the Minister now gives to this report is the same kind of poisonous response that he has given to all those protests in this chamber over the past three years and to the higher education public over that period. These Ministers have blinded themselves to any fresh idea coming from the public or from this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives-and I do not seek to reflect upon that House because to do so would be against the Standing Orders-when there have been education Bills and an opportunity to discuss education in that House during the past three years, the Government has brought in the guillotine and only one or two hours has been spent on bringing forward any new idea about higher education, schools, technical and further education or skill formation. It has been understandable, when there has been no opportunity in the other half of this Parliament for any debate on education, that the only debate in this Parliament occurred in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of those debates we have taken up a reference given by the Senate to look at questions of reform in higher education. What are the priorities for reform in higher education? That was the question we were addressing, and there were enormous responses from around the country. We analysed those responses. We had hearings in each capital city. We did a year and a half study of those matters. Frankly, whatever the criticisms expressed by any of us over the past two to three years at the drastic measures for just reforming quantities, where the resources are, which institutions are to be amalgamated, new requirements for defining profiles and so on, ad nauseam, and whatever criticisms we had of that Dawkins agenda, we nevertheless in good faith were wanting to look at priorities for reform and to address ourselves to quality in higher education, and to bring those genuinely to the attention of the Government and indeed of all members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate so that they could be acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we got in this response? I have been able to read it through only once in the 20 minutes that Senator Aulich was speaking, because the document was incorporated and I did not have any prior notice. I have made a number of underlinings, circles, exclamation marks and arrows on each page of this nine-page response. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's responses to the seven particular recommendations that are set out here are evasive, defensive, and not only disappointing but in a form of words which says: `No, no, no. We are not going to consider your recommendations. We are self-satisfied that this Dawkins-Baldwin Labor Government has got it all right, and we do not need a Senate report from persons that we do not seem to respect to bring any additional ideas to the attention of this self-satisfied Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe there is a cycle in these affairs in the life of a government of any country; after it has gone past five years-and certainly after seven-it gets a kind of self-satisfied smugness that is impenetrable, even by an important Senate report. It is disgraceful that there is not an ability in the Ministers of this Government to take on merit the findings of such an inquiry. On the first page of the response there is a put down of the whole report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the recommendations are framed at too high a level of generality to provide the basis for practical government policies. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that, as a debating technique, any government Minister at any time could argue subjectively that the findings of some group or the suggestions that are made are so general that they cannot be translated into a particular decision. I can test that absolutely. This is the second general accusation that is made:</PARA>
<PARA>In others, there is a failure to take account of steps already taken by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is self-satisfaction again-`The Government has got it all right; you have not taken full account of the achievements of the Dawkins-Baldwin-Hawke Labor Government and, because you have not, we will bring you up to date in a few pages of response that say that we are not going to implement any of your recommendations, and we will point out a little bibliography of reports and achievements of this self-satisfied Government to bring you innocent senators up to date with the great achievements of the Dawkins-Baldwin miracles'. That kind of put down is not accepted by me as a senator and ought not to be accepted by this Senate, and, as I said in some remarks on Minister Dawkins's initial response when we published the report, the Minister has gone very close to contempt of this Senate in his unfounded criticisms of senators, of the Senate committee process, and of this particular inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go through all of the seven responses to the particular recommendations. For instance, the response to recommendations four and five contains this sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>All proposals aimed at enhancing the quality of higher education, including the quality of teaching, will be assessed on a competitive basis with the aim of incorporating into the program the highest standard projects. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the kind of language of this response-put down, put down, and no, no, no. The Minister is saying, `We have got it all right. We are not receiving any new ideas. We will regard any suggestion, especially ones asking for money, only on a competitive basis, so that it can go through all the gauntlets'. That is the language right throughout this response. In contrast, let me just briefly refer to a meeting held less than a month ago that I addressed at the Queensland University of Technology. On 23 October, I was invited to go up to the Queensland University of Technology to meet with the Vice-Chancellor, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and, through the tertiary education unit, to speak to deans of faculties and other senior staff. There was also a representative from Griffith University and the University of Queensland. We had an afternoon in which I was to address this important Senate report, Priorities for Reform in Higher Education. I not only gave a short address but then had a discussion and answered questions of those who were present. Unanimously, that worthy body of education leaders in Queensland welcomed this report. They said that it was highly relevant, and asked when the Government of this country would do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me, as a sample, address our first recommendation. We did not actually enumerate them but in our recommendations we list six qualities that we believe any undergraduate ought to have on passing successfully from a higher education institution-not only the old established universities but also the new universities. All graduates in this country ought to have not only knowledge and skills-which by and large we acknowledge they are receiving-but also five additional skills or qualities. The Queensland University of Technology educators welcomed this description:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that Australia is producing graduates who, all too frequently, are not familiar in any disciplined sense with the society in which they are going to practise their chosen profession. </PARA>
<PARA>The educators say with us, `Yes, that is a second quality that we believe any undergraduate ought to achieve in a course'. The description continues with the third quality:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . who are not analytical, creative thinkers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was disappointed not to find a sufficient quality of outcome in undergraduates in this area. The educators, together with the Senate Committee, say, `Yes, any graduate ought to be an analytical and creative thinker'. The fourth quality we state is:</PARA>
<PARA>whose education does not provide the basis for adequate flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe a graduate ought to have an education which is flexible; which can adapt to the circumstances of that person's professional life; and which indeed increases knowledge. Fifthly, graduates should be attuned to the need for life-long learning. Sixthly, a graduate should be a good communicator. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked that group of 30 or 40 educators, as a sample of any of the universities of this country, `Would you regard anyone who did not have these six qualities as an adequate graduate of your university?'. Not one of them said that they would be happy if any of their graduates failed in any of these six areas. They were crying out, `Of course you are right, Senator Teague, and the Senate Committee is right. We are pretty good at number one but we are not very good at two, three, four, five and six because our courses do not actually address these additional qualities in a graduate', whether it be good communication, life-long learning, flexibility, analytical and creative thinking-which senators would fully understand-or the need to take a body of learning, a knowledge or skill and make it relate in a disciplined sense to the society in which that knowledge is going to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> They said, `Mea culpa. Woe is us. Higher education in Australia is lacking in these additional characteristics and, yes, we do need to address them'. I give that as just one example of one meeting of educators in relation to this report. That was very recently, only three weeks ago, and I believe I have fairly described that meeting. If that is the response of the educators, the response of the Ministers is totally contrary. Their response is the put down, the no-the defensive, dismissive, disappointing disgrace that we have had given to us here in the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the only way ahead, given the way that Ministers have soured this report to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, to the Higher Education Council, to their own Department and to themselves, is for a fresh response to these matters; I was going to say, `by a change of government' but, unfortunately, that is too many months away because the next election is still two years away. But there will be a refreshing approach and a return to a constructive response by Ministers to Senate reports when there is a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say as another consolation is that institutions can read the report, as they are doing all over the country, and make their responses to the findings set out therein. I refer to individual vice-chancellors, deans of faculties, lecturers, appointments committees-those responsible for encouraging teaching in institutions and those who want to remedy the shortfalls in the quality of undergraduate courses, the concentration on adult education, lifelong learning and the access and equity questions that we have addressed. All of these matters are perfectly able to be responded to by the higher education institutions themselves and by individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Committee, of which I have been a member for 12 years until a few months ago, we have always, and only, said that we want to be judged on the displayed evidence and argument in the report and we commend our conclusions to others-not with any sense of authority because we have some divine insight into education matters but rather, to the extent that we believe we have reached sound conclusions and that anyone independently looking at the evidence could, following our reasoning, come to similar conclusions. To that extent, let it be ad hominem persuasive directly in the institutions. Let the institutions bypass these inadequate Ministers, this self-satisfied Government, and let us see a response to the Senate report which is genuine in higher education institutions themselves and not the disgrace that has been brought to the Senate today by these Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on priorities for reform in higher education. As a member of the Committee, and now as Deputy Chairman, I have to say that the fact that this report was tabled this afternoon and that members of the Committee were not given the courtesy of seeing it beforehand makes it rather difficult for me to speak on it. I do not want to fall into the trap that many of the vice-chancellors and other senior academics fell into when they spoke out about the report in response to Mr Dawkins's response to it without having read it. We saw what happened. We saw the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee condemn the report. Then we saw a gradual turnaround after the vice-chancellors had read it. One of the examples of this was from the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Professor Brian Wilson, who was reported in the Australian of 1 August as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The president of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Professor Brian Wilson, has expressed sympathy with the Senate education committee report which attacked universities for turning out ``barbarians''. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Wilson described the report as ``much more sensible'' than it was portrayed and praised its emphasis on the need to liberalise the educational backgrounds of students. </PARA>
<PARA> His positive comments contrast with the official line taken by the AVCC and the academic unions which, he notes, ``derided the authors, saying basically that they didn't know what they were talking about''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, also castigated his parliamentary colleagues,'' Professor Wilson says . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We know all about that because we read about it, and I will refer to it in a moment. The article continued</PARA>
<PARA> ``But it would be stupid for us to simply write off the report's conclusions because of what may well have been an inadequately organised study relying solely on written and oral submissions and anecdotal recollections of the past.''</PARA>
<PARA>What he is talking about was that there has been criticism of it. We do not claim that we set out to do a comprehensive research project on higher education. What the Committee was doing was inviting the academic community, the people who receive the services of the academic community-the students, employers and the community-to respond to us as to what they thought were issues and needs in higher education. That is what we were doing to set up the debate. From what Senator Aulich and Senator Teague have said, and from my brief and cursory look at this response, what has happened in the Government's response is exactly what a number of people were asking not to happen. Minister Baldwin, let me say, has been left holding the baby, so to speak, as Minister Dawkins has done his dash in higher education and has run out of the door, leaving a fairly tired and beaten around the head sector for Minister Baldwin to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just give some examples of responses to the report when it first came out. For example, one was a letter from a person in politics at Flinders University to the Australian, headed `Let us open up the economic debate-not close our minds'. That is what was being said. People who were responding to the report were saying, `This is the beginning of a debate'. </PARA>
<PARA> As we moved around the universities as a committee, when we first started off there was tremendous disquiet and a sense, I suppose, of depression amongst academics as they had been responding to the forced mergers and writing out profiles. Let me say that I was part of this. Before I came into this chamber I was an academic. The institution that I came from merged voluntarily because we knew that mergers were on the boil. That was not an easy experience. It is tiring; it is exhausting. Those in smaller institutions especially spend hours and hours in committees. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things that concerned me was that those in colleges placed an enormous emphasis on their teaching and were rewarded for it in those institutions. As they moved across into the universities I believed they would find it difficult to have their teaching recognised for promotion. That was another issue that came up. But, as we moved around the institutions, we found that people were tired. I do not think that some of the submissions and some of the questioning that we had at the beginning was as productive as later on when people started to come out of the depression that they were in and began being creative about all sorts of things, and ideas were shared. </PARA>
<PARA> The report gave us great hope about some of the issues and some of the points raised in our recommendations. Many of us on the Committee have been out to universities to talk to groups about the report. I have been invited by academics to speak at various institutions and I have found them to be responding positively, as Senator Teague has, to the report. They have been prepared to stand back and accept the criticisms and say that there are things that they need to do. But the Minister is not prepared to do that. He says, `No, it is all okay. That has been done in the White Paper. That has been done in the Green Paper. That has been dealt with by some research fund.' But that is not what the academics were saying to us in response to this. They were saying, `What we need to do is to address those issues that have been raised. Yes, we have a long way to go.' What this academic from Flinders is saying is `Let us not close our minds'. He-or she; I am not sure-said in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been clear for some time that the Australian public and media do not want an in-depth debate on the full range of higher education issues . . . </PARA>
<PARA> None the less the debate does continue, despite the general indifference, thanks to the efforts of a hardy few-</PARA>
<PARA>that is us-</PARA>
<PARA>who take the longer view. It is in this context that the reception so far afforded to the Senate Standing Committee's report Priorities for Reform in Higher Education, only released recently, is so important, and so disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Here is a report which tries self-consciously to open up debates, on issues that have been relatively neglected so far in the 1980s-and which is almost immediately condemned out of hand by the minister, distorted by most of the media, and slammed by too many official spokespersons for academe. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite its nearly 200 pages, bibliography, compilation of hundreds of submissions and testimony, and weeks of valuable staff work . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We must not forget how the staff of the Committee must feel with this sort of response following the effort they have put in, and it was no mean feat. We had hundreds of submissions. They went through them with us and produced a report, then we had this flimsy response from the Government. I will be interested to see their reaction when they get their hands on this. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the report seems destined for oblivion-because it dares to ask ``What is higher education for?'' and ``What quality of graduates do we want?'' and to suggest that a better curriculum and better teaching could help bring about higher quality of education. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, let us note that the report fairly specifies that these problems are neither new nor unique to Australia. Moreover, on Mr Dawkins's ``reforms'', it carefully suggests that further investigation is required as the evidence is not all in, while also noting the need for greater support (especially in finance and morale) in order to build and retain high quality institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a quick and superficial report, not a dogmatic, impartial interpretation. There is much that is questionable in the exercise, but it does deserve to be read and to be debated seriously. It at least dares to attempt the difficult tasks of relating quantitative and qualitative changes, structural and academic content dimensions, in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just one quote. What does Sam Lipski say in the Bulletin about the report? On 17 July, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> At $19.95, Priorities for Reform in Higher Education-</PARA>
<PARA>that might take me on to the efficiencies in the Australian Government Printing Service, but I will not do that at the moment-</PARA>
<PARA>is somewhat more expensive than the average paperback but it deserves to be a best-seller at the Australian Government Bookshops which began stocking it last week-especially among those who want the talk about Australia as ``the Clever Country'' to be more than just talk. </PARA>
<PARA> Teachers at universities and high schools should pin the report's conclusion on their walls and, even if they throw darts at it, read what it says: ``The Committee believes that Australia is producing graduates who, all too frequently, are not familiar in any disciplined sense with the society in which they are going to practise their chosen profession . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will just stop there for a moment. I had a conversation the other day with someone at a meeting we happened to be attending. He asked me what I did and I told him and we started chatting about privacy issues. He is a lecturer in computer science. He told me how concerned he was that most computer science courses in our Australian universities failed to have concomitant courses in privacy. He sent me in the mail a copy of a course from Armidale University where every unit in computer science addresses privacy issues and the ethics in computer science. That is the sort of debate we were trying to raise in this Committee. They are the sorts of issues we were trying to address to make academics and the community aware of the need for us to ensure that we do not have C.P. Snow's two cultures, that we do not have technological barbarians on the one hand and those educated in the arts on the other hand-that they are integrated; that those in arts and those trained in technology, engineering and computer science understand the ethical implications of technological change and the effect on their society of change. </PARA>

<PARA>``The Committee believes that Australia is producing graduates who, all too frequently, are not familiar in any disciplined sense with the society in which they are going to practise their chosen profession, who are not critical, analytical creative thinkers, whose education does not provide the basis for adequate flexibility, who are not sufficiently attuned to the need for `lifelong' learning and who are not good communicators.

<PARA>When someone like Senator Aulich stands up in the chamber and is critical of his own Government's response to our report, and it is not easy to do, that ought to be hailed by the press-but it will not be; there will be some criticism-as what this House, the Senate, can do.

We are constrained by members of the press, who say as soon as we criticise something that the party is falling apart-whether it be the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the Australian Democrats. If we make a criticism and if we open up fair and reasonable debate, what happens? We are slammed. We should be thanking Senator Aulich, who is prepared to come out and say what he thinks. Members of the public are not aware of what happens in parliamentary committees-of the cooperation. All they hear is the argy-bargy that occurs in Question Time. The press picks up the adversarial role of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But here we are, on both sides of the chamber, arguing that this is an issue that needs to be debated, that we ought to raise the profile. This Committee will go on doing that as long as the Senate permits. I am sure that it will, given the fact that the Australian Democrats supported us in a motion. When this report was tabled in the Senate a motion was moved condemning the Minister for his response. Sam Lipski went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> With Priorities . . ., for example, the media have paid rather more attention to the scorn heaped on the committee and its chairman, Senator Terry Aulich, by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, John Dawkins-and Senator Aulich's duly recorded rejoinders-than to the national crisis that Priorities . . . highlights. </PARA>
<PARA>The focus was on the personalities rather than on the principles and the issues that we were raising in that document. Why did the Senate condemn the Minister? Why was it able to get a motion through condemning the Minister? Mind you, there was no response in the press. It is a fairly major issue when a Minister is condemned by the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will remind him constantly about his condemnation of the Committee. He said that the report represented two years waste of time on the part of some senators who obviously had too much time on their hands. That is most probably a general reflection of what the House of Representatives thinks about what we do here. Its attitude is that we do not have anything to do-that we have no constituents and do not do any work. Let me remind honourable senators that we will be sitting for two or three weeks longer than the House of Representatives and spending from now until Christmas fixing up its sloppy legislation. But we have time on our hands!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me tell the Minister that if his report-and I want to read it in more detail before I condemn it out of hand, as he condemned our report out of hand; and I do not want to be intemperate-is as evasive as Senator Aulich seems to think it is, given the fact that Senator Aulich had a few more minutes to read it than I did, I think that Minister Baldwin's response is intemperate. It is appalling that a Minister would respond in a way that does not take our priorities for reform in higher education seriously. Maybe `intemperate' was not the right word to use; maybe he was just being offhand and did not take the report seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee is not the sort of committee that just lets things go. We have put down a report entitled Education for Active Citizenship. It is a report that has been acclaimed around the community. In fact, it has been said by some of the senior staff members of the Senate that it is one of the most important reports to be brought down in 20 years. There has been an enormous response. What we have decided to do, and what the Senate is enabling us to do, is continue to study that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that we will not let priorities in higher education sit on the shelf and be a waste of time not only to us but also to all those people who made submissions and the staff members. That is not what we intend to do. This is a very cooper- ative committee. It has good chairmanship from a Chairman who is prepared to stand up and be counted and say what he thinks about various responses. I can assure the Minister that he has not heard the end of this and that the priorities for reform in higher education will continue and will have an effect, despite Minister Dawkins and Minister Baldwin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The matter of concern to me is a report in today's Sydney Morning Herald. This is not over any by-line, which in many ways makes the error more egregious. The article is headed `Opposition forces dole relaxation'. I think we are all aware of the frenzy that the media have managed to fabricate in recent days in suggesting that somehow the Opposition has gone soft on welfare. I want to record my very great displeasure at the way in which I have been, I believe, wilfully misrepresented by this report. What I made clear to the journalist in question, Peter Hartcher, in no uncertain terms, was that the Opposition believed that the proposal to introduce a liquid assets test was de- ficient in two respects. One of those was that it was arbitrary and blunt in its application and could just as well affect those it was intended to affect, being high income casual workers, as it could those that presumably it is not intended to hurt-people on low incomes, usually with a number of children and very modest levels of savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives last night-as I indicated to the journalist-we moved an amendment to provide for the Secretary to have a discretion to exempt certain applicants from the four-week waiting period in the event that significant hardship was demonstrated. I think anyone, and certainly a journalist with the experience of Mr Hartcher, would be well aware that hardship is not easily established in relation to assets tests and in other areas of social welfare. Significant hardship is even harder to demonstrate. Therefore, that would be a very modest concession at best. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst aspect of the matter, and one to which I take great exception, is the total failure of this journalist to make reference to the other amendment that I indicated we would be moving and that is to tidy up the provision because, as it is worded at the moment, if a person has $5,000 or more on hand in cash, or readily realisable assets, at the date of making an application for unemployment or sickness benefits, that person has to wait for a four-week period. Whilst spouse's income is taken into account, there is nothing to stop that person giving the money away to anyone. That is just reducing this whole provision to nought. It is designed to save $23m in the current year and $33m in a full year. What we propose to do is tighten it up to help the Government save that money by saying that any disposal within a period of three months preceding the date of the application will be regarded as ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit to the Senate that that is a very significant tightening of a welfare measure and one that was totally and wilfully omitted from the report. I therefore take great exception to it, especially in view of the fact that the felony was compounded earlier in the week by Mr Hartcher's suggestion that some cloud cuckoo land proposal from the Centre for Independent Studies was identical to any suggestion made recently by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I hope that we can look forward to less mischief-making and more accuracy in reporting from that journalist in the future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, the 1989-90 annual report of the Australia-China Council is not available to us at this time. I want to make a few comments about this very important advisory body to the Federal Government on matters relating to China. Not only does it look at a range of activities, including business contacts between the two countries, but also it looks at cultural matters. The most important thing I want to say is that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade sees the Australia-China Council as a model for the establishment of a council to deal with matters relating to India. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Australia-China Council should be a yardstick for the future development of a council with power to advise the Government on a whole range of matters-business, education, cultural and sporting matters-relating to India. One of the most important recommendations of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee was that there be such a council established; that it include members of Australian business, academics, members of Australian Government organisations to advise the Government on all matters relating to India; that it help boost Australian expertise on India; that it raise awareness in this country about that very important country and that it identify gaps in the relationship between Australia and India. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that because we take the view in our report that India is already an important Asian power of the same general order as China, which is of course the subject of this Australia-China Council report. But the Committee took the view that-and I see Senator Teague nodding-a lot of attention has been paid to China. There are institutions in the form of the Australia-China Council already in place to help develop and further that relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee took the view that it is high time that there be an Australia-India council to help foster relations between Australia and India but, most importantly, to help oversee the development in an Australian university of an Indian studies centre to be a repository of knowledge in this country on India. We hope that that centre can be established in the future. I know that members of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are awaiting with interest the Government's response to our report on India. We hope and trust that there will be some interest in that response to the establishment of an Australia-India council along the lines of the council which currently exists to oversee contacts between Australia and China. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much commend the Australia-China Council on its annual report 1989-90. Following Senator Maguire's remarks I very much support that there be an Australia-India council and that it be established soon. The urgency for establishing that council in response to recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade is now the only available bridge for this Government to win back the favour built up between 1986 and 1989, which was dashed by the inept decision to sell Mirage aircraft to Pakistan. I regard that as a catastrophe because it set back the Australia-India relationship. The best way to reinforce good faith is for the Australian Government to set up the Australia-India Council and the Australia- India studies centre and university in the way in which the Senate Committee has recommended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will address my remarks very carefully to the Australia-China Council report. Nothing that I have said about other areas of the world can detract from the priority that the Australia-China Council represents. Its 11-year experience has shown that it is a strategic initiative, it is one that we have valued for more than a decade and it will have a continuing important role for the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in passing that this report went to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on 14 August-four months ago-and I am disappointed that we get it so late in the chamber. I have read every word of the report. I find that it is clearly set out. I welcome every aspect of the report. I note the current membership of the Council and that this year of report followed the tragic events in Beijing, given the Tiananmen incident on 4 June last year. This coloured everything that the Council had done. It has given a break, a difficulty, an atmosphere of caution to all the Council's programs. I commend the Council for keeping contact with China, for continuing programs and for funding activities in China and in Australia that meet the objectives of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect, I see that the Council has reviewed its objectives. These are set out on pages 10 and 11 of the report. They refer to raising Australian expertise, raising awareness of China in Australia and Australia in China, the grants scheme and identifying gaps in the relationship. I commend all of those matters and also the six priorities of the grant scheme. I have no quarrel with them as set out on pages 12 and 13. Given the year of difficulty, it is all the more commendable that the Council pursued many activities with real success. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Chairman visited China, as Chairman of the Australia-China Council, in August this year. That was also in the style of promoting the objectives of the Council and making sure that the programs were enhanced. It was timely that the Chairman went to China. We in the Opposition had already made the decision by that stage that we would open dialogue by a visit in September at a different level, that is, at a political level, complementing work done by such important institutions as the Australia-China Council. I no longer have time to refer to other aspects. The money provided to the Council is well spent. I would like to see it marginally increased. I genuinely commend the Council, its members and its staff for the good work that is being done on Australia's behalf in this important relationship with China. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to a number of the programs contained in the annual report of the Department of Industrial Relations. The report overall is an excellent outline of the work of the Department of Industrial Relations in the area of industrial relations in the past year. It highlights a number of commendable programs. I draw the Senate's attention to the role taken by the Department in presentation of its case to the Industrial Relations Commission in addressing a variety of wage fixing principles. In particular, many matters were highlighted, including the training issue, which is vital if we are to become a clever country, and the linking of training modules and career paths in industrial awards. That was addressed as part of overall award restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> The report outlines a range of activities, many of which I do not intend to touch on in any detail. They include such vitally important aspects of industrial relations as occupational health and safety, the work change assistance scheme, labour market reform strategies, union rationalisation, recognising trade skills, award observance and a number of other matters dealing directly with the Australian public service. The work change assistance scheme is a vital new initiative by the Federal Labor Government and will ensure the creation of many workplace reform centres in most major regional centres in Australia. These workplace reform centres are established initially by the Federal Government providing seed money and, after a period of three or four years, they are to become self-funding based on the activities and the important work in workplace reform that they carry out at workplace level. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of labour market reform strategies particularly in the metals, timber, textile and clothing, coal mining, building, food processing and motor vehicle industries. If our country is to ensure an adequate level of exports, it is vital that the labour market reform strategies that have been initiated in these areas continue. Having been a union official and having had very frustrating experiences on occasions when having to negotiate awards, agreements and provisions at workplace level, with one major union and a multitude of smaller unions, I believe that the issue of union rationalisation at plant level, establishment level, is of vital importance. It is good to see our Government ensuring that adequate resources are made available to unions that are undergoing an often painful process of rationalisation and amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising trade skills is an interesting area and one of very great importance. Unfortunately, in this country a significant number of persons are employed and work at trade skill level but have no formal trade qualifications. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946 has been amended to provide for a significant number of trades, particularly in the metal and electrical areas, to ensure that those persons who have gained their `trade qualification' through work experience are able to obtain the formal paper qualification through some form of trade certification. That is absolutely vital in ensuring our work force is properly skilled. </PARA>
<PARA> I am greatly heartened by the activities of the Department in the award observance area, particularly in regard to superannuation. I read a disturbing report some time ago-and the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has brought it to the attention of the Senate-about the appalling figures for award observance of superannuation in the private sector. Despite the fact that almost all workers who are covered by private sector awards now have superannuation provisions, only 45 per cent of workers are receiving that superannuation which is their legal entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very encouraging to see the industrial inspectorate conducting a very strong campaign to ensure that employers are observing awards in the superannuation area. Quite obviously it is not only an entitlement of employees to have superannuation payments paid into an appropriate fund but also quite vital that adequate money be provided for their retirement years. The other matter I touch on is the dual appointment to industrial tribunals--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Two issues arise quite clearly out of this report by the technical assessment group. First, the Government has been very slow to act in this very important area of the protection of the Australian public from radiation resulting from the nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s and the 1960s. Secondly, it shows that we are dealing with very long term radiation risks indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now some 30 years since the Maralinga tests. I first became aware of these through a former Royal Australian Air Force employee, one Alvin Hudson, whose job responsibility, in the late 1950s and in the early 1960s, was to bury plutonium on this site. In 1972 Mr Hudson attempted, with the then Minister, Vic Garland, to raise the issue of the radiation hazards of this area. It was simply pushed aside. No action was taken. This was after a so-called clean-up in 1967, which we now know was totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter was raised again by Mr Hudson with me in 1978 when, with John Gilbert of Channel 10, we travelled up to the Maralinga site and took quite a lot of film. In praise of Channel 10, it put on a series of programs over about four or five nights, each of about five minutes duration, highlighting the very important problem of plutonium wastes in this area. That led directly to the McClelland Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia between 1952 and 1963 and, of course, indirectly to the paper before us now. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators will recall that for many years Sir Ernest Titterton, the former head of the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee, attempted to pour cold water on and treat with disdain anybody who raised the issue of radiation risks associated with Maralinga. Indeed, I well recall him saying that of course there was no plutonium buried up there because plutonium was so valuable that, if it were there, people would go up and take it away. We know that he was proved quite wrong. Eventually the British Government came out and collected quite a large amount of plutonium which was buried quite close to the landing strip at Maralinga. </PARA>
<PARA> We also know from subsequent studies that some of the tests were carried out under quite adverse meteorological conditions. One test in particular resulted in fallout which came right down through South Australia and, indeed, even reached south of Adelaide, which itself was exposed to radiation. The way in which the Australian public has been dealt with by successive governments of both persuasions has been quite unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 15 of the report outlines the costs of various options for clean-up. Page 16 says that a well-regulated working environment would result in one fatal cancer among the workers. It states that the clean-up would require some 500 workers over six years. This brings me to my second point. The writers of this report assume that an exposure of five millisieverts per year, which is the maximum allowable for those working in the nuclear industry, is an acceptable radiation exposure. With that level of exposure, the workers involved in the clean-up may suffer one cancer over six years working among those 500 workers. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes on to point out that the very small number of people in the Aboriginal community at Oak Valley may suffer one to two fatal cancers per 100 years as a result of the remaining radiation. As we are talking about plutonium radiation with a half-life of 24,000 years, we can see quite clearly that what this report recommends will result in in excess of 200 fatal cancers in that very small community over the lifetime of that radiation exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise as a very important issue the fact that there is no reason why deaths in future generations should be discounted and regarded as any less significant than deaths which occur in the present generation. One hopes that the Government will press the United Kingdom Government to, and will itself, carry out a very adequate and final clean-up of this important area. </PARA>

<PARA>The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) would be aware that at Question Time this afternoon I sought a response from him as Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications about some horrific increases in the cost of posting greeting cards by seamail to the United Kingdom compared with the cost of sending similar articles by airmail. I quoted an instance of a card endorsed `card only' posted to the United Kingdom last year costing 65c by seamail and 70c by airmail, whereas currently it costs 95c to send by seamail and only 90c to send by airmail. Can the Minister tell me whether this is an indication of the slow progress of waterfront reform or whether it has something to do with reduced efficiency within the public sector?</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, it is quite disgraceful for public utilities to increase charges so exorbitantly. A quick calculation would show that there has been less of an increase in sending articles by airmail. Nevertheless, the figure is just short of 30 per cent. When ordinary wage earners are getting increases far less than that-less than double digits. The cost of sending something by seamail has gone up by just over 40 per cent. These cost increases are just not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a further question to the Minister: how can Australia Post justify these cost increases for Christmas cards to the United Kingdom? Often people communicate with relatives only once or twice a year. Christmas time is special. These increases are not justifiable. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Tourist Commission on its annual report and the tremendous work it does in trying to promote Australia. This work includes working not only to increase the number of overseas visitors to Australia and to maximise the benefits to Australia from those tourists but also to monitor the environmental and social impact of tourism. This report covers a period of two very significant occurrences in Australia's tourist industry. One of these challenges was to be expected-that is, the decline in tourist arrivals after Australia's Bicentenary in 1988 and the tremendous tourist potential of the Brisbane Expo. The other was totally unexpected to the industry. That, of course, as anyone who was aware of what was happening in Australia last year would know, was the long running pilots dispute. In the report the Chairman states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian tourism was hurt by the five-month shutdown of our aviation services. Companies which had expanded to meet demand suddenly lost their cash flow. Many were forced out of business. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1989 domestic aviation dispute will be recorded as a national disaster for tourism but, as the report notes on page 46, it was not the only event to damage Australia's reputation as a reliable destination. The second half of the year also saw the failure of major hotel groups and other tourism operators, several tragic coach accidents and a ballooning disaster in central Australia. These factors, coupled with increased and highly aggressive marketing by competing destinations and the opening of eastern Europe, mean that Australia must work harder than ever to hold and increase market share in our primary markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia finished 1989 with 2,080,000 short term visitor arrivals. This was, despite the problems I mentioned earlier, marginally down on the record 2.25 million visitors during 1988 when Expo 88 and other Bicentennial activities provided extra drawing power. Although the pilots dispute caused heartache in the industry, luckily for Australia, the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA>It also raised community perceptions about the size and importance of the tourism industry to unprecedented levels. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the Commission, indications are that we will surpass the visitor numbers of 1988 by the end of 1990 and go on to achieve 6.5 million arrivals by the turn of the century. That is quite a number. </PARA>
<PARA> I found in my local newspaper today an advertisement about the Lions International Convention to be held in Brisbane from 17 to 21 June 1991. This will certainly be a very large convention for Queensland and will bring up to 40,000 delegates and their families from 130 countries. According to the article, `This would inject at least $80 million into Queensland's economy'. I believe that most of the delegates will stay on the Gold Coast. It will be a very big function and will certainly be a great help to tourism not only in Queensland but in Australia as a whole. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Growth has returned to pre-dispute levels out of Asia and is improving from Europe and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA>But, sadly, I note that the Commission, despite its optimistic hopes for next year, noted that tourist potential from North America, `remains soft, but forward bookings point to a rally in this market'. Perhaps it is because Paul Hogan has stopped doing his `shrimp on the barbie' television advertisements. As last year's report noted:</PARA>
<PARA>It is apparent that Australia's reputation as a reliable tourist destination had been damaged in many overseas markets, particularly Japan and the US . . . any chance of a turnaround has been dashed. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt that this was the result of Government policies and the disreputable part the Government played in prolonging the pilots dispute. The effects of the dispute cannot be underestimated. The Commission noted in the report that its:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . targets are ambitious but not unrealistic, given Australia's quality as a tourist destination and the strategies we have put in place. </PARA>

Firstly, the report makes it very clear that, despite that dispute and the substantially adverse effects it had, particularly on regions such as northern Queensland and Tasmania, the total number of visitors to this country was 2,080,000-a figure only marginally down on the previous year's figure of 2,250,000. Because Expo was staged in 1988, it was to be expected that there would be some decline in tourism the following year. Therefore, the airline dispute had only a marginal impact on total tourism to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. As Senator Watson says, some areas were affected more than others, but it is absolutely incorrect to blame the downturn in the tourism industry purely on the airline dispute. There was no doubt that there was going to be a substantial influx of visitors in 1988. Senator Bjelke-Petersen has referred to the substantial number of hotel failures. I also make the point that these did not occur simply as a result of the airline dispute. There were also some very unwise investments in the hotel and hospitality industry in terms of the massive number of properties that came onto the market at the one time, for which occupancy levels were simply unable to be sustained to support borrowings. That was also a very important contributing factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the airline dispute, it was very pleasing to see that the ATC adopted a very positive approach. It went out into the international market and attempted to ensure that the problems were minimised. I would praise in this place the work of the ATC and, in particular, the work of the Chairman of the ATC, John Haddad. I know John Haddad personally. He has been the Chairman of the ATC for a number of years and he has vast experience in the hospitality industry. He is a very positive and energetic person and I praise him and the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am extremely disappointed with the key findings of the risk management report into the fraud control plan operating within the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The key findings are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>1 although the Department spent almost $8 billion in 1989-90, finalisation of its Fraud Control Plan, and the development of procedures for dealing with fraud, had been unduly slow. </PARA>
<PARA>2 comprehensive investigations and prosecution guidelines had yet to be completed, and</PARA>
<PARA>3 the department had failed to ensure that a strong and viable internal audit unit was maintained following its establishment in July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>These comments are quite scandalous because they denote a strong criticism of the management and the management structure. It is becoming increasingly evident that far too many people in key positions have had inadequate management training. It further illustrates that there are in some sectors of the Public Service people who are incapable of following the Government's dictum of letting the managers manage and take full responsibility for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the onus for effective risk management rests squarely on the shoulders of senior management. Senior management cannot expect to devolve responsibility for decisions to line managers without providing adequate training in the management of risk, for without adequate training the danger is that risks will be taken and not managed. When this happens it is ultimately the public who suffer. Managers need to monitor the costs and benefits of risky decisions. On the other hand, senior managers must push to establish effective internal control sections to promote the receipt of quality feedback on the adequacy of internal controls in place within their organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The initial assessment of risks in an organisation or program must be coordinated at a senior level in all Commonwealth agencies. This assessment cannot be made without input from program managers. Once the level of risk is identified, decisions need to be taken about the controls which should be established to contain the risk at a suitable level. </PARA>
<PARA> The report before the Senate today highlights many of the concerns I have had over the years as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and, through that medium, have expressed. In fact, the PAC issued a discussion paper on internal audit in the Australian Public Service in February 1981. That was report No. 184, which was closely followed by a second report in November 1983. In 1981 to 1983 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was of the opinion that the establishment of effective internal audit units had not been adequately advanced by many senior public sector managers. To this end, as part of its inquiry into the Australian Audit Office-again, report No. 296-the Committee recommended that the Auditor-General undertake an efficiency audit of internal audit in the Commonwealth sector, which should include a comprehensive survey of internal audit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have stated many times in this chamber that internal audits are only as good as the staff employed and far greater emphasis needs to be placed on the training of internal auditors and on promoting their image so that the quality of staff attracted to internal audit positions is enhanced. This training has to extend to education about the sophisticated techniques of planning adequate and meaningful audit coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> If Commonwealth agencies continue to allow such a low priority to adequate resourcing and training of internal auditors, something more fundamental has to be examined. Maybe we will have to go as far as looking at placing the necessity for proper internal audits on the statute books via legislation. As I mentioned, the Department of Employment, Education and Training spends almost $8 billion. It should be an utmost priority with this Government to ensure that internal audits be in place and the Department should have in place an adequate fraud control plan. I believe this report is quite scandalous in terms of the comments and observations of the Auditor-General. I ask that expeditious action be taken to remedy the matters raised in this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a couple of comments on this document, which is the Government's response to reports outstanding from committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to hear Senator Button's comment during Question Time when he was asked to comment on a report from a committee. He said he had only just seen the report this morning and it would be irresponsible of a Minister to respond to a report he had only had for such a short time. However, I draw the attention of all Ministers to this report because there are some disturbing aspects, and perhaps some lessons to be learnt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that this document is tabled and that there is an up-to-date list of reports which have and have not been responded to by the Government. I want to mention a couple of them. Firstly, I mention what I consider to be a deficiency in the report in that there is no date on the report of when the committee report came into this place or was given to the Government. Therefore, at first glance we cannot find out how long we have been waiting for these responses. I think it is worth looking at some of these committees. I note that listed under the heading `Joint Committees' is the report of the Joint Committee into Electoral Matters entitled, Who pays the piper calls the tune-minimising the risks of funding political campaigns, which was an inquiry into the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referendums. That has not yet been responded to by the Government and it is interesting that the same joint committee is now investigating the conduct of a subsequent election, the 1990 election. </PARA>
<PARA> It is just possible-and I have not read the report from page to page-that some of the many concerns raised about the conduct of the 1990 election, which I know the Joint Committee is currently looking at and wrestling with, might have been foreshadowed following the 1987 election had the Government chosen to give some time to addressing that Joint Parliamentary Committee's report. The work of the Committee might have been less difficult subsequent to the 1990 election, and the 1990 election might have been better conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare concerning kangaroos has not been responded to by the Government. The treatment of Australia's national emblem, the kangaroo, in a wide range of areas is an important matter. This Select Committee was established in the first instance by a motion of the Australian Democrats many years ago and has made recommendations. I am concerned that this report has not been responded to by the Government. Only yesterday Community Aid Abroad focused on the issue of Third World debt. I notice that the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on Third World debt has not yet been responded to by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are just some of the reports which have not been responded to yet; in all of those cases there is matter for concern. I also draw attention to the fact that the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled, Feasibility of a National ID Scheme: The Tax File Number-has not been responded to by the Government. That, also, is somewhat ironic as that same Committee is now addressing the Government's current proposals with regard to massive extension of the use of the tax file number, that same Government not having responded to the extensive report of the work done by that Committee two years ago when I was a member of it on that very same issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is having, we could say, some problems convincing the Senate, at least at this stage when those Bills are being addressed by committees, about the extension of the tax file number. It might have made different decisions if it had actually addressed the report of a study which has already been done by a committee of this Parliament. Perhaps the work of this Parliament would be less difficult and more effective if the Government was able to respond more speedily on the reports of the many committees which do a great deal of useful work in this place and in conjunction with the other place in the joint committees. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the tabling statement by Senator Devereux. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President</PARA>
<PARA>The first report which I have just tabled is for the construction of 45 new dwellings for Australian High Commission and Defence Force personnel in Port Moresby. </PARA>
<PARA>It also includes the construction of associated recreational facilities for all High Commission and Defence Force families living in the capital. The proposal provides for 45 dwellings to be constructed on one site. This approach will allow the most economic provision of adequate security measures and will also provide the opportunity for staff and dependents to enjoy a family type environment. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending that the work proceed the Committee recognises the close bilateral relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It also recognises the need for Australia to give high priority to the effective management of our relationship. This includes the protection of Australian interests there. </PARA>
<PARA>Due to the restriction in the Public Works Committee Act 1969 on meetings of the Public Works Committee outside Australia and its external Territories, the Committee was unable to inspect the proposed site or existing accommodation in Port Moresby. This is completely contrary to the normal practice of the Committee which has always regarded site inspections as an integral and extremely important part of its consideration of a project. </PARA>
<PARA>In this particular case, due to the absence of a site inspection, the Committee was hampered in its consideration of the project, particularly in relation to issues of security. The Committee believes that Section 12(1) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 should be amended to remove the restriction on Public Works Committee meetings being held outside Australia. The Committee will be approaching the Minister for Administrative Services on this matter in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>The second report I have tabled deals with the redevelopment of the Aeronautical Research Laboratory site at Fishermens Bend in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has concluded that there is a need for the redevelopment of the ARL site at Fishermens Bend in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>ARL is part of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and this proposal sought to redevelop the site it now occupies by refurbishing a number of buildings, demolishing others and providing additional external works, such as car parking and extended security services. </PARA>
<PARA>The project will cost $17.5 million in April 1990 prices. </PARA>
<PARA>From the Committee's perspective, this was an unusual project because of its length and complexity, and because of the issues it raised. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian Opposition and Government both forwarded detailed proposals that Aircraft Systems Division of ARL, together with the RAAF's School of Air Traffic Control and the Civil Aviation Authority's search and rescue training facilities, be relocated to Newnham at Launceston and, with existing institutions there, form national centres for simulation and aviation studies.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considered these proposals very carefully. Both the Tasmanian Government and Opposition gave evidence at each of the public hearings. The Committee inspected facilities at Newnham on 18 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Having considered the evidence presented to it, the Committee believes that ARL will function more effectively and efficiently if Aircraft Systems Division remains at Fishermens Bend. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's reference from the Parliament dealt with the redevelopment of the ARL site at Fishermens Bend. Accordingly, as was made clear at the public hearing on 5 September, we were unable to comment on the merits or otherwise of the proposal to transfer the RAAF and CAA facilities to Newnham. The proponents of these proposals are, of course, free to advocate them to relevant Ministers and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal raised some very important occupational health and safety issues. The Committee is satisfied that appropriate measures have been taken to deal with radioactive material and chemical contaminates found on the Fishermens Bend site. </PARA>
<PARA>The third report I tabled is for the provision of a new air traffic services centre for the Civil Aviation Authority in Brisbane. As part of the CAA's consolidation and rationalisation of facilities and functional elements in Queensland, a 14 hectare site has been purchased at the former Brisbane Airport. This site includes the former Australian Airlines terminal. The CAA proposes to rehabilitate this building to house new radar equipment being acquired. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee concluded that the location of the new equipment in the refurbished terminal offers cost and operational advantages over other alternatives examined. These alternatives included extending the existing air traffic services centre which is not favoured because of the higher cost, its condition, location and the need for existing equipment to continue to operate during the construction of extensions. Another alternative examined was the relocation of the centre to a greenfields site. </PARA>
<PARA>This alternative would be relatively expensive, it would cause disruption, and would delay the commissioning of new equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has recommended that the CAA undertake an assessment of energy demand for air conditioning during detailed design, with the aim of minimising electricity charges without compromising the operational effectiveness of the centre. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost of CAA operations is recovered from charges on the aviation industry. The Committee therefore sought details on how the proposal will be funded as the capital cost of the proposal will have an impact on the level of charges levied by the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA>The CAA advised the Committee that it is undertaking a major capital investment program involving nearly $500 million being spent over the next five years. During the first few years of its existence, the CAA has undertaken a number of initiatives designed to improve productivity and reduce charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The CAA advised the Committee that whilst the investment program is substantial, it is already producing productivity gains which will enable it to reduce charges to the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend these three reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that the process of having a document such as this tabled in the Parliament-a process which was set in train by a motion of my former colleague, Senator Macklin, in this place in November 1988-does appear to be having a desirable effect on the Government. I make the same complaint I made about an earlier document, and that is that this one does not contain dates on which the unproclaimed legislation to which it refers was actually passed. It makes making comments like this, when we have not had this document for very long, somewhat more difficult. Nevertheless, it is a process which does seem to be working quite well. In fact, the document is getting thinner and thinner each time we get it. In April 1989 it was a 25-page document; in December of that year it was 29 pages; in May this year we had one with 20 pages and this one only has 13. Unless the Government's explanations are getting much shorter, one can only say that less legislation is remaining unproclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> That is important because the Government puts legislation before us in this place eventually-after we have been here for some weeks-and presses us to pass it, very often claiming enormous urgency. At the moment the Senate is looking at some 65 Bills which the Government is telling us it wants through before the end of this year, and another 12 which the Government would like to be given if it is possible. I do not know how any of that is possible in the Senate in the next four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The pressure on these issues has been quite extraordinary at times. For instance, when we have wished to negotiate amendments with the Government we have been told no, this legislation is too urgent, we cannot hold it up and mess around by having amendments. Then we have seen those same Bills unproclaimed for many months and, in some cases, many years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of concern that sometimes legislation is unproclaimed for reasons which are somewhat disturbing. There can be a tendency to give way to bureaucratic influence. There are some examples where we are waiting for regulations to be put in place, and other work to be done at the bureaucratic level and that is holding up the proclamation of legislation. Many sections of this legislation are unproclaimed because they are going to be repealed. I really do not see why the Government cannot get on with that sort of tidying up and housekeeping if it really intends to repeal this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an element in some of this legislation where it appears that the Government may be giving way to the States. In some instances, legislation is said not to have been proclaimed because the Government is awaiting cooperation and moves from the States. I would be concerned about that in some areas because it is important that the Federal Government accept its responsibility and pursue its responsibility as the national government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>I give an example of one piece of legislation that is of concern, that is, the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Act 1989, proclamation of which, we are told, has been deferred to enable clarification of some administrative and policy issues that arose as a result of the intention to repeal the Hostels Act. We are told that it will be proclaimed in late 1991, but that area does seem to me to be an example of problems in the bureaucratic arrangements attached to that legislation. If we have to wait, after passing this legislation in 1989, until 1991 for those sections of the Act to be proclaimed, I think that that is an extraordinarily long time if it is just a question of putting in place surrounding bureaucratic structures. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously I have to comment on the last piece of unproclaimed legislation in the list, that is, part IV, sections 12 to 18, of the Financial Corporations Act 1979. It is interesting that just today in this place a private member's Bill was introduced by my colleague Senator Spindler, the Financial Corporations (Prudential Standards) Amendment Bill 1990, which picks up part IV of the Financial Corporations Act 1979, which is that provision of the Act which would empower the Government to impose direct controls on non-banking financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall have more to say about the Australian Democrats' views about the failure of successive governments since 1974 to proclaim that provision of the Financial Corporations Act. As a Victorian from a State where the collapse of financial institutions has created enormous economic and financial damage and personal damage to many ordinary Australians, I state that the significance of this piece of legislation appearing today on the same day as the Democrats are moving to effectively institute that piece of legislation is quite strong. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that successive governments have been extremely lax in not proclaiming that piece of legislation and that much of the financial stress and distress that have been caused in our community, particularly recently, can be traced right back to the very fact that this piece of legislation has not been proclaimed since 1974 and to the failure by successive Federal governments to pick up their responsibility to depositors in non-bank financial institutions around this country. They have walked away from their responsibility. The most recent of those to do that is the current Treasurer, Mr Keating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I wish also to speak on the paper on unproclaimed legislation to which Senator Powell has been speaking. As she said, it was very much the initiative of Senator Macklin and, on our side, of Senator Puplick, both of whom took a keen interest in the issue of unproclaimed legislation. They seem to be continuing their activities together, and I am sure that we look forward to their very serious book on the process of Parliament. Also, many of us will be very interested to see the novel that they are producing, but that is an aside. I am sure that we shall see some of ourselves in that book.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, under a different name. As Senator Powell was saying, we have seen the amount of unproclaimed legislation decrease since this sort of document has been an activity of the Senate. Let me give another example. When I was speaking earlier on priorities for reform in higher education and the Minister's response to that matter, I talked about the Minister's attitude to the Senate and how he had said that the senators on the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training had more than enough time on their hands, implying that we, as senators, really did not do very much. I remind honourable senators that, when they move around talking about the role of the Senate, they should be talking about the function of this place as a House of review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Powell said, often legislation is pushed through the House of Representatives, a perfect example of that being the Family Law Act at the end of 1987. That piece of legislation was pushed through the House of Representatives and there was an attempt to push it through the Senate, but it was delayed. There were 4 7/8 days of activity in this place to ensure that that legislation, with which all of us agreed-the Democrats, the Government and the Opposition-was amended. In fact, Minister Tate praised Senator Durack for his contribution to the chamber at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of review and attention to detail that we see in this place. More and more, this Government has a total disregard for the Parliament and the parliamentary process. We saw legislation this week of which the shadow Minister did not even have a copy. That legislation was to be introduced the next day and it had not been printed. With that sort of shoddy handling of Government business, it is no wonder that we see legislation unproclaimed: it has not been properly thought through. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, we have in the Senate people who take an interest in this area, both in the Opposition and in the Democrats, and I believe that this has drawn the attention of Ministers to this important area. As we have seen, in some cases where legislation has not been proclaimed, there may have been some quite serious effects. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Powell said, there are a number of pieces of legislation on this list in respect of which it is simply stated that there is a need for it to be repealed. I can hardly understand why such legislation is still there and why the responsible Ministers do not get on with it. I hope that Minister Bolkus, who is not actually sitting at his desk, will remind Ministers of their responsibility to look at this report and to do everything in their power to have the legislation either proclaimed or repealed. </PARA>

<PARA>The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill amends several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Subclause 2(4) of the Bill was omitted by a Government amendment in the House of Representatives. The effect of the amendment was that each of clauses 41 to 48 (inclusive) in Part III of the Bill, which amend the Circuit Layouts Act 1989, will now commence on the day on which the Bill, if passed, receives the Royal Assent. The purpose of the amendment was to avoid unintended retrospective operation of those provisions, consequent upon commencement of the Circuit Layouts Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>None of the amendments will have any direct financial impact. However, after regulations consequential upon the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 have been made, there is expected to be a slight rise in revenue from fees and some minor savings as a result of the proposal to extend the range of judicial powers that may be delegated to Registrars of the Federal Court by the Judges.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, there is the possibility of flow-on costs should the ACT Government enter into a co-operative arrangement with the Commonwealth for the performance of human rights functions in the ACT, consequent upon passage of a proposed amendment to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I propose to confine my remarks to the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the Acts Interpretation Act to overcome a number of technical difficulties which have arisen in relation to the making of statutory instruments before an Act under which the instruments are made has come into effect. The amendments will allow different commencement dates to be prescribed for different provisions of such instruments. The amendments will also make it possible to combine in the one statutory instrument provisions made under an amending Act, which has not come into force, with provisions made under the parent Act that are already in operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill makes a number of other amendments to the Act. The most important of these makes clear that a regulation which retrospectively prejudices the rights of a person has no effect at all, and is not simply ineffective to the extent that it is retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA>The other proposed amendments will clarify the operation of certain provisions of the Act, and further the advances being made by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in relation to plain English drafting. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, the Act provides that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court must be exercised by not less than 3 Judges in matters relating to applications for admission to practise as a barrister and solicitor, and in disciplinary proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will allow the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, subject to the approval of the Chief Justice, to be exercised by less than 3 Judges in applications for admission to practise as a barrister and solicitor, and to provide that a single Judge can give directions of an interlocutory nature in disciplinary proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains amendments to Part VA of the ASIO Act, which deals with the functions and procedures of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO. It has become apparent, in the context of the Committee's current review of the access provisions of the Archives Act, that certain provisions in Part VA make anomalous distinction in the manner in which they treat evidence taken by the Committee from a witness on the one hand, and documents produced to the Committee on the other, for the purpose of a review that the Committee is conducting. The relevant provisions are section 92G (publication of information obtained by the Committee) and Section 92P (continuance of evidence by a previously constituted Committee). </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments in the Bill are designed to remove the impediments to the Committee's operation posed by that distinction. The amendments to sections 92G, 92P and 92R of the Act will allow the Committee to continue its current review and to publish the contents of a document produced to it for that purpose. Publication of such documents will be subject to the same constraints that now apply to the publication of evidence given by a witness in a review conducted by the Committee in private, namely, that publication is authorised by the author, and the Committee is satisfied, after obtaining the Attorney-General's advice, that publication would not disclose a matter that the Committee could not include in a report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Amendment Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA>The remaining uncommenced provisions of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Amendment Act 1986 are to be repealed. These provisions, if commenced, would change the basis of employment from one based on contract to a statutorily based one. </PARA>
<PARA>The employment policy that underlay the uncommenced 1986 amendments has now been reviewed and a satisfactory arrangement that retains the contract of employment while giving the Director-General scope to vary terms and conditions in a manner consistent with the Government's public sector employment principles has been arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Bankruptcy Act 1966</PARA>
<PARA>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to make a number of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966. In four broad categories, the amendments will:</PARA>
<PARA> * implement suggestions by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court for reforms to the substantive law relating to debtors' and creditors' petitions; to confer judicial immunity on judges issuing search warrants; and to transfer certain functions-such as audit of the accounts of registered trustees-from Registrars in Bankruptcy to the Insolvency and Trustee Service of my Department;</PARA>
<PARA> * implement suggestions made by the Auditor-General to relieve the Australian Audit Office of statutory audit functions more properly carried out by the Insolvency and Trustee Service and to improve the system for the registration of trustees;</PARA>
<PARA> * make amendments, consequential upon the enactment of other laws, that were omitted to be made previously; and</PARA>
<PARA> * consolidate overlapping provisions in the Bankruptcy Act and simplify other provisions to eliminate unnecessary administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chief Justice of the Federal Court suggested changes to require Registrars in Bankruptcy to refer a debtor's petition to the Court for a direction whether to accept or reject it when a creditor's petition is pending against that debtor. Because there is no present limitation on the acceptance of a debtor's petition, some debtors have used the period between committing an act of bankruptcy and the making of a sequestration order, to dispose of assets before making their debtor's petition. In a number of circumstances this stratagem can mean that the Trustee in Bankruptcy is unable to claim title to particular property of the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA>A petitioning creditor, who would suffer from a consequent reduction in the pool of assets available for distribution, may apply to have the debtor's petition annulled and the creditor's petition reinstated, but this is expensive. The proposed amendments will remedy this defect by enabling the Court to examine the merits of the debtor's application at the earliest suitable time. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the Bill will confer judicial immunity on judges who issue search warrants under the Act. At present, judicial immunity from suit does not extend to the function of issuing search warrants which is an administrative, rather than a judicial, function. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Auditor-General suggested, the Bill will introduce more effective registration and certification procedures for registered trustees. So far, the current procedure for issuing certificates of registration to trustees in bankruptcy has not been used and no fees have been collected, because trustees are not obliged to hold a certificate of registration. The amendment provides a better basis for collecting registration fees and issuing certificates of registration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the view of the Auditor-General that responsibility for the audit of registered trustees' accounts should rest with the Insolvency and Trustee Service rather than the Audit Office. The Bill will amend the Act accordingly. The opportunity is also being taken to transfer statutory audit responsibilities from Registrars in Bankruptcy to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and the Official Receivers. </PARA>
<PARA>An amendment has been included in the Bill to make it clear that a person is discharged from a bankruptcy at the expiry of three years from the date of the bankruptcy, subject only to an objection to discharge being entered by a creditor or a court order that the person not be discharged. This is to overcome uncertainty in the application of the Bankruptcy Act about whether a person had been discharged. This uncertainty could cause doubts in relation to real property and conveyancing transactions, because it may not be possible for a former bankrupt to establish that he or she was discharged from bankruptcy, and so entitled to acquire property, at the time of the transaction. </PARA>
<PARA>The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 confers a priority for dividends upon the Child Support Registrar in respect of amounts of unremitted child support deductions by a bankrupt employer. Similar priorities are conferred upon the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of unremitted taxation instalment deductions. An amendment will recognise this priority in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also simplify certain provisions of the Act. For example, two provisions relating to the examination of a person on oath about the financial affairs of debtors and bankrupts substantially overlap. The Bill will consolidate them into one provision. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also abolish cumbersome procedures for the approval of sound recordists and stenotype machine operators by the Registrar in Bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Circuit Layouts Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to this Act will address technical concerns raised in certain quarters of industry regarding the definition of ``circuit layout'', taking into consideration definitions in similar legislation overseas. The amendments also bring the Act into line with the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits concluded in Washington in May 1989, especially as regards the scope of exemptions from the protection conferred. This will preserve the possibility of Australia acceding to the Treaty, should it decide to do so at some stage in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Family Law Act 1975</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill makes a number of minor amendments to provisions of this Act concerning the Family Court's appellate jurisdiction, which will allow the Full Court of the Family Court to control the impact of appeals from interlocutory orders on its effective operation. Such appeals contribute to delay in the hearing of appeals. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to this Act will:</PARA>
<PARA> * provide greater flexibility in the deployment of judicial resources of the Court by allowing a single Judge, as well as a Full Court, to hear applications to stay orders of a Full Court and applications to amend grounds of appeal in appeals to the Full Court;</PARA>
<PARA> * overcome the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Petreski v Cargill (1988) 79 ALR 235, by providing that the time during which an appellant in a criminal proceeding, pending the determination of his or her appeal, is at liberty on bail shall not count as part of any term of imprisonment under his or her sentence; and</PARA>
<PARA> * give the Federal Court power, where the interests of justice so require, to order that a judgment debt shall carry interest at a rate less than that fixed by the Rules of Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and Sex Discrimination Act 1984</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes three amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act. The first will provide that discriminatory acts which are motivated by several reasons, including race, are prohibited, without the need to prove that racial discrimination was the dominant reason. </PARA>
<PARA>The second amendment will provide for vicarious liability of employers and principals for racially discriminatory acts by their employees or agents done in the course of their employment or agency duties. However, the employer or principal will be exempted from liability where he or she took all reasonable steps to prevent the racially discriminatory act being done by the employee or agent. </PARA>
<PARA>The third amendment will include, within the meaning of prohibited racial discrimination, acts that indirectly discriminate by imposing a requirement or condition which is not reasonable in the circumstances and which adversely affects a particular racial or ethnic group. It will not be necessary that the effect is on every person of the racial or ethnic group. Provisions similar to each of these amendments already exist in the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also amends the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act and the Sex Discrimination Act to remove an anomaly from the operation of Commonwealth human rights legislation which has arisen since ACT self-government. At present, sections of both those Acts bind the Crown in right of the States and the Northern Territory but not the Crown in right of the ACT. In addition, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, which permits the Commonwealth to enter into inter-governmental arrangements for the performance of human rights functions with the States and the Northern Territory, does not permit such arrangements to be entered into with the ACT. The amendments place the ACT on the same footing in relation to those Acts as the States, or, where appropriate, the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Marriage Act 1961</PARA>
<PARA>This Act is to be amended to remove the need for gazettal of each approval, or revocation of an approval, of a marriage education organization. Lists of the twenty-four organisations approved by the Attorney-General to provide marriage education are published regularly by my Department and the information is available from a broad range of sources, including the Family Court and the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA>There are two minor amendments to Part IVA of the Service and Execution of Process Act. Part IVA provides procedures for the interstate enforcement of fines. </PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment will allow a police officer, who has arrested a fine-defaulter without producing to him the warrant of apprehension authorising his arrest, to produce to him at a later time a facsimile copy of the warrant instead of the original warrant. At present the Act requires that the original warrant be produced within 48 hours, or such longer time as may be fixed by a Justice of the Peace. The amendment will make it unnecessary to apply for an extension of time where the original warrant is held at a place too distant from the place of arrest to enable its production within the 48 hour period. </PARA>
<PARA>The second amendment will remove an anomaly in present procedures to allow a police officer to receive the amount of the outstanding fine when executing a warrant of commitment without formally arresting the fine-defaulter. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Statutory Declarations Act 1959</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, this Act provides that a statutory declaration may be made before a person before whom a statutory declaration may be made under the law of the State in which the declaration is made, but makes no provision in relation to similar laws of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will provide similar recognition under the Act to the laws and administrative processes of the Northern Territory as is given to the laws and administrative processes of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>PIPELINE AUTHORITY (CHARGES) BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill 1990 is the first step in the implementation of the Government's decision to commercialise and sell the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system. </PARA>
<PARA>This sale is an essential component of the Government's program of major asset sales. This program commenced in 1987 and to date has generated gross proceeds of $2.8 billion, with a further $1,000m in prospect this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>The success of the sales program has been a major contributor to the restraint in Government outlays over recent years, and the pipeline sale will make a major contribution to the $8.1 billion Budget surplus this year. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures in this Bill will improve the efficiency of the pipeline. They are thus consistent with the Government's broad micro-economic reform objectives, in particular those relating to the performance of basic economic infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision to sell the Pipeline was taken in the 1989-90 Budget. During that year a large number of expressions of interest to purchase the Pipeline were received. The Government subsequently announced in the 1990-91 Budget that the operations of the pipeline system would be placed on a proper commercial basis, prior to its sale. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government acknowledges that in introducing this Bill it has been necessary to address a number of difficult issues, ones which a Government less determined to address Australia's fundamental economic problems may well have sought to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA>But hard decisions are needed in the current economic environment if we are to make our economy more efficient. Further, we cannot as a responsible Government, call upon the States to get their houses in order if we ourselves are not prepared to show a lead. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is designed to remedy a fundamental defect in the arrangements by which the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system is operated-and to do so in a way which is fair to all parties. </PARA>
<PARA>The present haulage tariff arrangements between the Pipeline Authority, which operates the pipeline system on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) are not commercially based. </PARA>
<PARA>They do not provide for the TPA to earn any overall profit on the bulk of its business until the year 2006, and to earn only inadequate profits over the following 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus under current contract arrangements it is not possible to earn a proper economic return on the pipeline's full current value. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, the Commonwealth-or rather taxpayers generally-are subsidising the transportation and consumption of gas in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>In this regard it has been claimed that the existing haulage arrangements should be only a debt servicing device because taxpayers have no equity in the pipeline system. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a claim highlights precisely what is wrong with the current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>While the depreciated historical cost of the pipeline is about $250 million, its current value is well in excess of this amount. An indication of this is that the replacement cost of the pipeline today is around $1.3 billion. Its current value, as measured by the depreciated replacement cost, would therefore be several hundred million dollars above its depreciated historical cost. </PARA>
<PARA>As anyone running a business responsibly will acknowledge the difference between depreciated historical cost and current value represents the latent equity of taxpayers in the pipeline system on which it is appropriate to expect a commercial return. </PARA>
<PARA>This point was eloquently made by AGL Petroleum-AGLP-in a recent submission to the Industry Commission Inquiry into Energy Generation and Distribution, where it was stated that:</PARA>
<PARA>AGLP agrees with the Commission's comment that tariffs based only on historical costs erode the capital base needed to provide ongoing pipeline capacity. Further, the owners of any commercial facility such as a pipeline are entitled to a return on the value of their investment. This approach is becoming more common as Governments and Government Authorities set tariffs for the provision of energy and other services to their consumers having regard for the current value of their capital investment in providing those services.</PARA>
<PARA>Pipelines are long-lived assets. The value of money, due to inflation, changes significantly over the life of the asset as does the value of the asset, both in terms of its market value and the cost of partial or total replacement. Historic cost accounting methods are therefore inappropriate when applied to returns on long lived assets, whether pipelines, manufacturing assets, or public infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent Federal and State Government initiatives have been taken to `corporatise' various publicly-owned assets and to examine the returns appropriate to the particular asset. The results of these examinations have shown a strong consensus that the evaluation of returns on the current or market values of the enterprise's assets are more appropriate rather than on their historic value. This is appropriate in AGLP's view. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this is also appropriate in the Government's view, which is why this legislation is now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA>The key to putting the pipeline system onto a proper commercial basis is to increase the existing haulage tariffs charged by the Pipeline Authority (and subsequently the new owner of the pipeline system). </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of those pipelines where no profit component is incorporated in the current haulage tariff the provisions of this Bill will increase the existing haulage tariff by 25 per cent from 1 January 1991 and by a further 25 per cent from 1 January 1992. This comprises the main trunk line between Moomba in the north east of South Australia and Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney and the lateral pipelines to Cootamundra, Wagga Wagga, Bathurst, Orange, Lithgow and Junee. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus on 1 January 1991, the existing haulage tariff will increase from 80c to $1 per gigajoule of gas carried by the Pipeline Authority, and then increase further to $1.25 per gigajoule on 1 January 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>In the absence of these provisions the tariff would increase to 82c and then 84c per gigajoule on the dates indicated. </PARA>
<PARA>The two lateral pipelines to Canberra and Oberon are the subject of specific agreements between the Pipeline Authority and AGL that already allow for some profit margin to be earned, having regard to normal commercial principles. In these cases it is proposed to give the Authority (and subsequently the new owner of the pipeline system) the opportunity to determine in consultation with AGL whether the existing haulage tariffs charged for gas transported to those destinations should be increased by some lesser percentage than 25 in each of the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA>In the event that no such agreements are reached on the alternative increases to apply, the haulage tariffs applicable to these two lateral pipelines as from 1 January of each year concerned will be determined by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, there is no question that over-riding the present unsatisfactory pricing provisions in the existing contractual arrangements between AGL and the Pipeline Authority is a very significant step for the Government to take. </PARA>
<PARA>And, I can assure the Senate that it is not one which was taken lightly. </PARA>
<PARA>In normal circumstances the Government would be loath to alter such contractual arrangements. However the imperative of achieving economic reform in Australia today means that difficult decisions must be taken for the good of the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>The haulage tariff adjustments proposed by this Bill are the only feasible way to ensure that the economic efficiency of gas marketing arrangements is improved. They are essential if Australian taxpayers are to obtain a fair and reasonable return on the current worth of this extremely valuable asset. </PARA>
<PARA>Without these adjustments to improve the commerciality of the pipeline system, the likely sale price would fall well below any reasonable assessment of its current value. The shortfall, on current indications, could well be several hundred million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is not prepared to short change the community in that way. </PARA>
<PARA>Without adjustments to the haulage tariff of this order the Government would withdraw the pipeline system from sale and not support a future sale until the current haulage agreements are appropriately modified. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of provisions in the Bill are designed specifically to ensure that AGL is treated fairly. </PARA>
<PARA>These provisions relate to freedom for AGL to determine how the increased haulage cost is passed on to its customers and the inclusion of detailed compensation arrangements for reductions in profit resulting from price increases. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible at this stage to state precisely what effects these haulage tariff increases will have on prices charged to individual gas consumers in New South Wales and the ACT-be they industrial, commercial or domestic users. This is because such increases will be decided by AGL in accordance with its commercial judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>However, haulage tariffs represent only a small proportion of the final gas prices charged to consumers, which means that the percentage increase in final gas prices will be dramatically less than the proposed increases in the haulage tariff. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the average increase in final gas prices charged to all consumers in New South Wales as a direct consequence of the two proposed 25 per cent increases in haulage tariffs is not expected to exceed 4 per cent in each of the two years. </PARA>
<PARA>The average increases likely to apply in the case of gas transported through the Canberra and Oberon pipelines will be less than this. </PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be expected, however, that the price to all consumers will increase by the average percentage price increase. </PARA>
<PARA>This is partly because gas prices vary substantially as between major industrial users, smaller industrial users, and commercial and domestic users, with the former enjoying far lower prices than the latter. </PARA>
<PARA>A 20c per gigajoule increase for major industrial users would therefore be a much larger percentage increase than the same 20c increase to domestic consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, it seems reasonable to expect, for example, that in recognition of the inherent price sensitivity of some of the major industrial users of gas in New South Wales, AGL may decide to insulate, at least in part, certain segments of the gas market from the full effects of these haulage tariff increases. </PARA>
<PARA>This would mean that other sectors of the market with much lower price elasticities of demand would have to bear a more than proportional share of the additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Prices for commercial and domestic consumers are considerably higher than prices for industrial consumers, so that if the costs associated with the haulage tariff increases were flowed through evenly the resultant percentage increase for them would be less than the average. However, the outcome may well be quite different. </PARA>
<PARA>For instance, if industrial users as a group were required to bear only about two thirds of their share of the increased haulage costs, the resultant increase in price to commercial and domestic users over the two years would be around 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>I have noted the claims attributed to AGL that, as a consequence of the need to protect some industrial users, prices in other sections of the market could rise by up to 25 per cent. I want to make clear to the Senate that this claim cannot be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA>There is simply no reasonable basis on which to translate an average price rise of 4 per cent in each of the next two years into an increase of 25 per cent for any significant sector of the market. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, if AGL were to seek to impose increases of anything like this order the Government would have no hesitation in referring the matter to the Prices Surveillance Authority forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the impact of the probable price increases on domestic consumers is likely to be quite small in monetary terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Updated ABS household expenditure statistics indicate that the average gas bill of households on mains gas in Sydney is currently about $225 per annum. Accordingly a 9 per cent increase, for instance, would amount to about 40c per week. So the increase in the average weekly domestic gas bill by 1992 as a result of this legislation is likely to be less than the cost of a daily newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA>To ensure that AGL's position is appropriately protected, this legislation will have the effect of setting aside any existing State legislation, or any contractual arrangements, which might otherwise prevent AGL from recovering the proposed haulage tariff increases in higher gas prices to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it is proposed that further discussions be held with the New South Wales Government to determine whether a more targeted approach to existing State legislation could achieve the Commonwealth's objectives. If that proves to be the case, the Government intends to use the scope which exists under this legislation to reinstate by proclamation part or all of the existing State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>As a further measure in support of the Government's wish to treat AGL fairly, the Bill before the Senate also provides explicitly that in the event that AGL can demonstrate that it has suffered a loss of profit as a consequence of a reduction in demand for gas due to the haulage tariff increases proposed-and provided that AGL has taken all possible steps available to it to mitigate the extent of that loss of profit by seeking alternative markets for the gas-there is a mechanism whereby AGL would be able to claim compensation from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me add that the Government does not expect that the compensation payable, if any, would be significant. Substantial rises in field prices for gas were awarded to the gas producers (by arbitrators) in 1983 and 1987 without any significant fall in the demand for gas. In fact, increases in the field price of gas of around 45 per cent and 55 per cent occurred without undermining the viability of manufacturing industry generally or the market for gas in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the best advice available to the Government is that significant continued natural growth can be expected in the market for gas, which in these environmentally conscious times has promising future prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Government does not expect that significant compensation will be payable to AGL. </PARA>
<PARA>This will be especially so when assessed in the context of the potential benefits to the Budget, and hence taxpayers, that will result from the additional revenues which will flow to the Pipeline Authority as a consequence of the commercialisation of its operations-or, subsequently, the achievement of a price for the sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system which would better reflect its true value. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators will be aware that purchase proposals are currently under examination by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The indications are that the adjustments proposed in this Bill will enable us to secure a realistic sale price for the pipeline system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government intends to introduce further legislation at a later time to regulate the operation of the pipeline system after its sale in order to ensure that unfair advantage is not taken of its monopoly position and to prevent possible exploitation of consumers by the new owner. </PARA>
<PARA>Two alternative regulatory regimes are being considered and prospective purchasers of the pipeline system have been invited to submit bids on the basis of each of them. The final decision on this matter will be taken in due course in the light of the responses received and after consulting other interested parties, including the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I would repeat that the essential purpose of this Bill is to put the operations of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system on to a sound commercial footing, consistent with the broad thrust of the policy focus of this Government to commercialise the operations of all of its business enterprises and so promote a more efficient allocation of resources in the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA>In pursuing this significant element of economic reform, moreover, the Government is seeking an outcome which is fair to all parties: to AGL, to consumers and, of course, to the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSSAT AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental part played by telecommunications in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda is now a matter of public record. The continued pursuit of that agenda across a wide range of sectors has been, and will remain, one of the Government's prime economic concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1988, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, took the first steps towards reforming and restructuring the Australian telecommunications system. The May 1988 reforms, foresaw the need for a review of the existing carrier arrangements with a view towards promoting efficiency in the telecommunications market, providing universal access to telecommunications services, and bringing foreign investment into this country through an effective and cost efficient telecommunications service. </PARA>
<PARA>Since that time, major restructuring of the industry has been underway. Previous Ministers in the portfolio of Transport and Communications, the Hon. Ros Kelly MP, and the Hon. Ralph Willis MP, implemented changes through a new Telecommunications Act 1989 which enabled competition in value added services and customer equipment, and which provided for an independent regulator, AUSTEL. Complementary reforms to enhance the commercial orientation and accountability of the telecommunications government business enterprises were also made. </PARA>
<PARA>The first step in the next stage of the Government's reform process is being taken with these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The telecommunications reform package, announced earlier this month by the Prime Minister, will promote competition and dynamism in the industry, guarantee community service obligations in telecommunications, maintain quality of telecommunications services, maintain Telecom and OTC in full public ownership, maintain maximum possible Australian ownership in the industry, further develop and promote the industry, ensure effective regulation, and remove from Telecom and OTC all Government imposed constraints which limit its ability to respond effectively to competition and which do not serve the broader national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Legislation is being prepared to implement the Government's reforms. As an essential interim measure, I present to the Senate the AUSSAT Amendment Bill which seeks to give the Government the capacity to sell AUSSAT and put in place temporary measures to allow AUSSAT to compete in the short term with OTC and Telecom. The Bill does not, however, seek to establish the duopoly on network provision which is to apply until in 1997 as foreshadowed by the Prime Minister. Legislation related to these reforms will be introduced in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the AUSSAT Act 1984 will facilitate the sale of AUSSAT, in accordance with the Government's announced policy, by repealing those parts of the AUSSAT Act 1984 which prohibit its conversion to a public company, and which limit its number of shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments will also serve to allow AUSSAT to compete with OTC and Telecom across the full range of services in the international and domestic markets. They provide an interim measure to facilitate AUSSAT's entry into the market pending revision of the present Telecommunications Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSSAT will, under this Bill, have the primary object of providing telecommunications services within and outside Australia. Previously, AUSSAT was restrained by its charter to providing telecommunications systems for Australia and neighbouring regions by the use of space satellites. It will now be able to utilise both terrestrial and satellite facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision is also made for AUSSAT to have genuine access to the reserved services market by giving AUSTEL the power to direct another carrier to make available telecommunications networks and facilities should they be required by AUSSAT. AUSTEL will also have the power to set the terms and conditions of the access in the event that the providing carrier and AUSSAT are unable to agree on them. AUSTEL's powers will also ensure that the supplying carrier receives reasonable remuneration, either through negotiation directly with AUSSAT, or, failing satisfactory negotiations, by determination by AUSTEL. </PARA>
<PARA>It is expected that AUSSAT's ability to provide new services will improve its commercial viability and that substantial Commonwealth revenue will be generated by its sale. The price obtained for the sale of AUSSAT will depend on responses by tenderers in negotiation later this year. The extent to which AUSSAT's commercial viability is enhanced from new services is not readily assessable because the AUSSAT Board will need to take its own decisions on how it will react to the new business opportunities offered. It is expected, nevertheless, that the AUSSAT Board will consult closely with the Minister for Transport and Communications on any new business ventures it proposes to undertake, in order to ensure that AUSSAT does not pre-empt any plans which a potential purchaser may have. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments will not affect the basic telephone service, or the first telephone service currently provided by Telecom. Nor will they have any effect on community service obligations provided through services such as outback links for rural and remote communities. The requirement will continue to be on Telecom to provide these services. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, the importance of this Bill lies in its removal of the constraints on the sale of AUSSAT and its provision for AUSSAT to be able to compete, both of which are necessary to facilitate the emergence of a second carrier. AUSSAT can begin the process of entry into the market, and the way is laid clear for tenders to be sought from prospective purchasers. The bill is an essential part of the Government's announced package of reforms for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I am proud to continue this Government's outstanding record on telecommunications reform, knowing that with these reforms, our telecommunications industry can grow in strength, and at the same time services can become more efficient and cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the notice of the Senate one section in particular of the annual report of Film Australia Pty Ltd. On page two we see that the first role of Film Australia Pty Ltd is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To produce film, video and television programs which cover issues of national interest or which illustrate or interpret aspects of Australian society and the lives of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased that Film Australia is doing that because, as I see it at the moment, Australian culture is under direct attack from other cultures-bigger cultures-with a much bigger share of the market as far as film and television goes. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, as anyone who watches television will know, we are in danger of having our culture gradually subsumed into the more powerful, more aggressive and more self-assured culture of the United States of America. I do not want these remarks to mislead anyone about my attitude to the American people or American culture. I have actually visited America several times and I found the people to be very friendly and very generous, and I have made several friendships there which have been enduring and which I value very much. </PARA>
<PARA> American culture is a wonderful thing for Americans in America. As Australians though, we have our own unique cultural identity, and it is one of which I am particularly proud. As an Australian and as the Australian Democrats spokesperson on arts and heritage, I am quite appalled at the Americanisation I see around me. Nowhere is this more evident than in the mass media. I believe that it is no coincidence that it occurs at a time when so many of Australia's mass media organisations are in serious financial difficulties. One could almost be forgiven for thinking that receivership is a prerequisite for any organisation in the broadcasting or print media in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's balance of payments situation is not the only thing to have suffered because of the delusions of grandeur of too many of our former mass media barons. Australian culture is now paying for their follies. It is precisely because of the threat to our cultural heritage that I was particularly interested to read a report on an aspect of Film Australia. I believe that the financial uncertainty in the mass media now makes the role of Film Australia doubly important. </PARA>
<PARA> Film Australia has been and is able to operate without being totally subject to commercial pressures. Its products do not have to be internationalised or homogenised for the overseas market and can, therefore, retain their Australian identity. That does not mean that its products do not sell overseas; they do. Excellent examples of this are Film Australia's docu-dramas. They are an innovative combination of drama and documentary techniques using people playing themselves, as well as actors, to portray important social issues. Key issues such as discrimination, sexism and racism are tackled in these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> They reflect a balance of the very people targeted by equal opportunity programs and, most importantly, they are Australian programs about Australian people living in Australia. They are shown on commercial television for maximum impact in the community. No-one who has seen these programs would be surprised to see in this report that Film Australia has taken its equal employment opportunity responsibilities very seriously. It is vital that this Parliament continue to support Film Australia so that it can continue to make products which remain distinctly Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I want simply to make an observation about the Joint Coal Board Annual Report 1989-90 because it leads into the debate we are about to embark upon. The powers and functions of the Board, stated on page 1 are, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>to ensure that the coal resources of the State are conserved, developed, worked and used-</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress these words-</PARA>
<PARA>to the best advantage in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the 1989-90 annual report of the Joint Coal Board makes no mention whatsoever of greenhouse and of the role of coal burning in Australia or anywhere else-most of our coal is exported-as a contributor to greenhouse, and what in the public interest under its charter the Coal Board is doing about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in this report the Board's strategy is listed on page 5 as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the development of a safe, technically efficient, stable, competitive and economically viable coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the optimum development and utilisation of coal resources. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be making the point more strongly in a few moments that coal is one of those resources that we should be seeking to use as little as possible, precisely because it is one of the very polluting sources of energy. The third strategy is stated as:</PARA>
<PARA>the development of markets for coal. </PARA>
<PARA>Also on the same page it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The common thread in the Board's policy of providing assistance to the industry in order to improve its competitiveness and long term prospects is to focus such assistance on activities that are of value to the industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA>The long term prospects for coal are probably zero, and yet here we have a government which has created a Board to promote this industry. We have a Board which is reporting that it has these objectives, and yet apparently it is absolutely blind to the future that is staring this country and this industry in the face. Again, I stress that it makes no mention at all that its public responsibility is to address this important issue of greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points out that, even while it is attempting to promote the increased consumption of coal and to put in place long term prospects for the coal industry, and while it has been to some extent successful in increasing saleable production-there is a series of histograms on pages 8 and 9-the profitability of this industry has not been all that great. On page 7 the report states that:</PARA>
<PARA>Aggregate industry profit for the six months to December 1989 was estimated at $76 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the total turnover was absolutely astronomical. So despite the turn off in terms of capital investment in this industry, the increased production and, if I might remark also, the quite marked increase in the annual output per employee, this industry is not producing a very great return for this country.</PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, I must simply voice a great deal of concern that, in my view, the Coal Board is not doing its job properly. It is not directing its attention to those areas which are staring this country and the world in the face in relation to greenhouse. Indeed, it is not doing such a marvellous job in terms of productivity and returning to this country the sorts of returns that should be forthcoming for the exploitation of a non-renewable resource. After all, when the coal is gone the coal is gone, and most of it will be up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide if we continue the way we are going. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, coal is a valuable resource for a number of things other than simply to be burnt as a fuel. For those reasons, I would urge the Joint Coal Board in its next annual report to take on board a much wider view of its charter in the light of its functions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the car leading the Darwin to Adelaide solar car race is equipped with solar cells researched and made in Sydney at the University of New South Wales by Professor Martin Green,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) as of the morning of 13 November 1990 this car was 150 km ahead of its nearest rival which was made in Japan,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) this Federal Government has progressively reduced its funding of renewable energy research,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had the gall to suggest that Australia needs to become a clever country when it clearly has leading-edge science and technology appropriate to the urgent needs of tomorrow's greenhouse world, and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) this research and technology is being starved of funds as a direct consequence of the decisions of this Government; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Hawke Government to reverse, as a matter of priority, its damaging approach to funding research in the area of renewable energy. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate, in beginning debate on the motion, that we will be bringing this to a vote at the end. Secondly, although the motion had its genesis in a great deal of enthusiasm over the absolutely magnificent performance of the so-called Swiss car powered by Australian designed solar cells, this led me to reflect upon the absolutely atrocious way in which this Government has dealt with this leading edge technology. I direct the Senate's attention particularly to subparagraphs (iv) and (v) and paragraph (b) of the motion, which state:</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had the gall to suggest that Australia needs to become a clever country when it clearly has leading-edge science and technology appropriate to the urgent needs of tomorrow's greenhouse world, and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) this research and technology is being starved of funds as a direct consequence of the decisions of this Government; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Hawke Government to reverse, as a matter of priority, its damaging approach to funding research in the area of renewable energy. </PARA>
<PARA>Although I will draw on the solar car as an example, I will direct my remarks particularly to those paragraphs because that is the important crux of this motion. This motion speaks of the need for real vision, real courage and real leadership in facing the challenges of the future. It speaks of the failure of the Hawke Government to meet those challenges, or even to recognise that they exist. I must say that the Opposition has contributed very substantially to this failure and has given every indication that in this respect it would be worse than the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical importance of changing our patterns of energy use in a greenhouse world has not been comprehended by most members in this chamber. Sustainable energy technologies, renewable energy sources and energy efficient products are crucial to the future viability of both our nation and our planet. The Government's energy vision was spelt out in one of the most depressing documents ever tabled in this chamber-the Energy 2000 paper. The Energy 2000 paper looked forward to a world which consumed Australian fossil fuels and uranium at an accelerated rate. Metaphorically speaking, it rubbed its hands in glee at the thought of the impact on our balance of trade of that increase in sales. It was as though the environmental concerns could be disregarded and resource depletion was simply not a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's and the Opposition's technological vision is bound up in outdated science fiction images of the twenty-first century in which we all lead high material consumption lifestyles, dominated and cushioned by a bewildering array of high technology services and gleaming devices. Information technology has been singled out for attention of a particularly gee whiz variety. This is evident from the telecommunications debate, the partnerships for development program and the proposed multifunction polis, on which I have spoken and questioned Senator Button at some length on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, ecologically sustainable development does not depend nearly as much on further advances in information systems as it does on sustainable energy technologies. The obsession-I stress `obsession'-with telecommunications has more to do with facilitating the speculative movement of capital at the speed of light than with productive activity to secure our economic, social and environmental future. </PARA>
<PARA> The findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have far-reaching implications for the vision and policies that we should be pursuing. I stress that: this is the imperative that we must meet. The critical finding is that in order to stabilise the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere-I stress `stabilise', not reduce back to what they were before the start of the industrial era, but merely to stabilise-the global rate at which carbon dioxide is emitted must be cut by over 60 per cent. If this does not happen, carbon dioxide levels are destined to rise until fossil fuels are entirely depleted. The resultant climate change would probably render the globe absolutely uninhabitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The IPCC concluded that the global annual average emissions of carbon must fall from 1.45 tonnes per person to about 0.35 tonnes to stabilise-I stress that word-atmospheric concentrations. But Australia is now one of the most energy wasteful nations on earth, being somewhere between second and fifth in the world in terms of our profligate use of fossil fuel. We will, therefore, have to reduce our energy consumption to a much greater extent than most other nations. Australians now emit four and a half tonnes of carbon per person per year. To reduce this to the global average of 0.35 tonnes represents a cut not of 60 per cent, not of 80 per cent, but of 92 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The task before us is to reduce our emissions by this very large amount while assisting Third World countries to energy sustainability without their following our environmentally destructive path and repeating our mistakes. This puts the Government's highly qualified 20 per cent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2005 in proper prospective. Twenty per cent is all the Government is offering-and 20 per cent with very severe qualifications even on that amount. We have much further to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I read in yesterday's Australian newspaper that, rather than accept the inevitability of the environmental imperatives that I have just outlined, Senator Button is leading several of his colleagues to exclude major developments for environmental assessment. I see Senator Button as one of the most dangerous people, along with the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in this Parliament. This Government is leading this country in totally the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA> A landmark study of global energy policy by Jose Goldemberg and others has concluded that some progress in the direction required could be made quite readily given present technology by stringent energy efficient programs and increased use of renewable sources. This would allow energy consumption in industrialised countries to fall to 3.2 kilowatts per person, with no loss of service-in other words, a substantial reduction in energy consumption per person, with no loss whatsoever in the end services to which that energy is put, while Third World consumption would rise to 1.3 kilowatts. For Australians, this would mean a cut of 50 per cent-a substantial move in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was making the point that it was possible to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions very significantly while allowing Third World consumption to rise somewhat and at the same time meet the end use services without any significant increase in cost. I said that we could do this with a 50 per cent cut in energy. While that is nowhere near the 92 per cent I indicated earlier that was necessary in the ultimate situation, nonetheless it was a much more substantial start than the Government's 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear to the Australian Democrats, but obviously not to either the Government or the Opposition, that the development of a sustainable energy base is the single greatest challenge which we face both as a nation and as global citizens. In its rhetoric, the Federal Government is starting to acknowledge that huge savings in energy consumption and money are possible by energy conservation and the use of energy efficiency technologies. I will show later in this speech that those words, however, have not been met by very much action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, the Opposition and Australian business also appear to be convinced that renewable energy sources have almost no role to play. Government funding of renewable energy sources has fallen 88 per cent in real terms in the 12 years since 1978. Funding supplied by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) for renewable sources in 1978-79 was $4.66m in 1978 dollars. In 1989-90 this had fallen to $1.32m. This decline is particularly scandalous in view of the establishment in December 1987 of a renewable energy research trust account funded from oil tax revenue in response to Democrat pressure in the Senate which we applied at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter to Senator Janine Haines, the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, the then Minister for Resources, Peter Morris said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government is willing to commit an additional-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the word `additional'-</PARA>
<PARA>$5m over five years for . . . renewable energy and energy conservation and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>That commitment has not been met. Estimated expenditure from the special trust account in 1990-91-that is the current Budget year-is $483,000, less than half of the $1m promised by Mr Morris in the recent past. Just before the extra funding was agreed to in 1987 the Government announced grants of $2.1m for NERDDC funding for renewable energy. The 1989-90 figure was $1.2m; in other words, roughly half. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the States have shown a similarly short-sighted approach. In 1987 the activities of the Solar Energy Research Institute of Western Australia was greatly reduced while the Solar Energy Research Centre of the University of Queensland was totally disbanded. Federal officials are wont to claim that there are simply not enough worthy projects to justify greater funding. However, our research-that is, the research of the Democrats-has shown that numerous projects of world class have not been funded and researchers are leaving the field. It is remarkable that world class researchers such as Dr David Mills of the University of Sydney have made great advances while constantly having to fight for funding. Just as importantly, there has been no strategic use of the purchasing power of the Government to take new technologies out of the laboratory and into production. </PARA>
<PARA> Here I return to the first couple of items of the motion which refer to the solar car race currently progressing between Darwin and Adelaide. The Solar Challenge car race illustrates very well this short-sightedness. The Swiss entry, The Spirit of Biel, which earlier today had increased its lead-from the time the motion was moved two days ago-to 250 kilometres, is using high efficiency solar cells designed by a University of New South Wales team headed by Professor Martin Green. While some Federal money did go towards that research, the arrays of cells were actually manufactured in Germany by Telefunken. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several points I would like to make about that. The most efficient cells developed by Professor Martin Green in his laboratory have achieved a 24 per cent efficiency. These are the last generation of cells which achieve only 17 per cent efficiency. So there has been almost a 50 per cent further increase in the efficiency of the solar cells and yet these cells have been put into an array not in Australia, not using Australian labour and not using Australian money for support, but by Telefunken in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to appreciate the extraordinary technological advance which these cells indicate. In 1987 the Solar Challenge was won by General Motors-Holden's Ltd Sunraycer-most people will remember that beetle shaped car-using gallium-arsenide cells worth $1.5m. The Swiss car is using silicon cells achieving the same efficiency and costing $20,000. It has reached Alice Springs in exactly the same time as the Sunraycer did in 1987. That represents a 75-fold increase in the dollar efficiency in just three years. As race organiser Hans Tholstrup says, `If that's not one hell of an advance for technology and humanity, I don't know what is'. Even so, the best is yet to come. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out, the cell array on the Swiss car has an overall efficiency of only 17 per cent. Professor Green's goal is to reach 30 per cent efficiency, which is very close to the maximum theoretically achievable efficiency, and to mass produce thin film cells at around the cost of their glass substrate. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, in my own personal purchases of computer equipment-I remind the Senate that computing is one area that is normally regarded as rapidly developing-I reckon that there has been about a 20-fold improvement in the dollar power available in computing in the last 10 years. I am comparing a computer I bought in 1980 with one that I bought this year. Compared with that technology we have a 75-fold increase in the dollar efficiency in solar cells developed right here in Australia at the University of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> As spectacular as this progress in computing is, it looks absolutely insignificant compared with the technology development in photovoltaic cells in Australia. The Federal Government has missed an extraordinary opportunity to develop an Australian technology of environmental and commercial value. This is very symptomatic of the malaise identified in a recent speech by computer industrialist, Lionel Singer, in which he pointed out that North American, Japanese and European governments stimulate a high technology industry by encouraging individuals to create solutions to a problem that needs to be fixed. If there is one problem that needs to be fixed in this world, it is the problem of greenhouse. Mr Singer contrasted the approach overseas-that is, the European, Japanese and North American approach-to stimulating technology with that of the Australian Government's techno-cultural cringe. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Not much thought is paid to bolting down true Australian based technology. </PARA>
<PARA>While he was referring there to information technology, the criticism applies even more to renewable energy. Switzerland, I would remind the Senate, is busy building what will be Europe's biggest solar power station, with a peak rating of half a megawatt. That is not very large by world standards, but it is interesting that the Swiss are doing it in a country that has much less sunshine than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Switzerland has registered a 100 per cent increase in the use of solar power with units of over 100 kilowatts being installed to power whole streets and businesses while feeding power into the grid. Swiss authorities acknowledge that solar power is more expensive than some other forms, but they have made a strategic decision to invest in solar technologies because they understand-but the Australian Government does not, evidently-that their energy future demands it. I point out that just the other day a Swiss expert said that the best solar generated electricity is now available at only twice the cost of nuclear generated electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> Given what I have said earlier about the possibility of doubling our efficiency without any increase in the end use costs-that is, the costs of the services which the electricity is finally used for, and given also that there has been a 75-fold increase in the cost efficiency of solar cells developed in this country in only three years, one can see that we are very close to the break-even point in which we could have a substantial solar generation of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of renewable sources that are viable right now which could make a large dent in our energy consumption. For example, solar water heaters for domestic use could eliminate most of the fossil fuel energy used for this purpose-for heating water. That is responsible for about 6 per cent of our CO2 emissions. Wind energy is economic in many locations. Passive solar building designs are cost effective and again I refer to Dr David Mills and his solar steam generator. What we are seeking from government is support not just for the glitzy high-tech but for what is appropriate technology to get the job done. Dr David Mills's steam generating evacuated tube technology has proven its ability by providing steam for Sydney's Campbelltown Hospital. This could offset a large proportion of our industrial use of fossil fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> The barriers preventing these sources from entering the market in significant quantities are non-technical in nature. They are political and they lie very much with the Government. To take just one example: if I buy electricity from the grid, I pay for my share of the generating plant over a long period. The cost of the generating equipment which my purchase of electricity makes necessary is amortised perhaps over as many as 25 years. On the other hand, if I buy an energy efficient light globe or a solar water heater, I have to pay the total capital costs up-front. The equivalent financing arrangements used by central electricity generation utilities would remove this market distortion and immediately make economically viable a large array of technologies that we already have available to us. </PARA>
<PARA> To take another example, in Australia it would be illegal to connect private, small solar generators to the electricity grid, as is happening in Switzerland. To remove these barriers means reorienting our existing electricity utilities to focus on selling efficiency and renewable sources-that is what Amory Lovins calls `negawatts' rather than megawatts-which would offset the need for large, expensive and environmentally damaging supply sources and have long construction lead times requiring risky long-range demand predictions. I would point out, as I did in a question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, the other day, that there is a crisis with our electricity utilities which is inhibiting such reform. </PARA>
<PARA>Michael Gill, writing in the Australian Financial Review of 24 September, summed up the problem well when he pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Electrical utilities have run up a $32 billion debt. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that this is a debt of $32,000m-</PARA>
<PARA> Over-optimistic demand projections have left them with excess capacity. Energy prices have been subsidised in attempts to stimulate demand, and energy efficiency measures largely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>The utilities stand in the way of real change because of their economic predicament and the outdated assumptions on which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Electricity Commission (QEC) has begun to build a 600 megawatt hydro-power scheme at Tully-Millstream which is likely to submerge 3,700 hectares of tropical forests, 1,400 hectares of which is listed as World Heritage, with the remainder on the National Estate. Tully-Millstream-if it is built-will cost $550m. On past indications, 25 per cent of this will be spent overseas for the heavy generating equipment. Yet the QEC admits to debts of between $4.1 billion and $6.7 billion, depending on which of its reports one reads. This debt is growing at a rate of 15 per cent per year-well above inflation. The QEC is convinced that the demand will be there in 1996 when the station is supposed to start operating. But this is the same QEC which in 1982 overpredicted 1988 demand by 1,000 megawatts-an error of about 30 per cent and nearly twice the output of the Tully-Millstream scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Opposition have expended enormous energy debating the alleged need for telecommunications micro-reform. Yet even the Opposition has conceded that Telecom Australia basically works. It provides a reasonable service and pays its way. Indeed it makes a profit. By contrast, the electricity utilities are not providing a reasonable service and are not paying their way. They have run up $32 billion of foreign debt. Their operations dwarf those of Telecom. Capital investment in the electricity utilities totals $50 billion-approximately four times that of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> Energy sector reform should be at the top of the Government's list. Yet the recent Special Premiers Conference could do no more than discuss possible extensions to the interstate network and other ways of improving interstate arrangements. When on Tuesday I asked Senator Button to comment on Federal control of electricity supply, he said he would obtain a response. This reply, only two days ago, indicates clearly that Senator Button and the Hawke Government have not even considered this important matter. So on the one hand the Government has intruded into the operations of Telecom, which is efficient and profitable, but on the other it has failed to address electricity generation which is wasteful and has caused a debt of $32 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> What clearer indication, even on the Government's own exclusively dollar-based criteria, could one find that the Government is simply looking in the wrong direction? When one adds the problem of greenhouse, of course, one sees that quite clearly the Government is headed in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply point out that by directing government expenditure in appropriate ways to help support these burgeoning technologies-in which we are not behind; we are right at the very forefront-we would move this technology to a point where it would become extremely valuable to Australia and the rest of the world. Indeed, if one looks around one finds that the Federal Government is well aware that its spending power can be exercised strategically. Senator Button has said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . one fundamental element of a policy environment conducive to the development of a robust manufacturing sector is to ensure that the maximum benefits are obtained from the Government's considerable purchasing power. </PARA>
<PARA>He was, of course, referring to the purchase of submarines, frigates and other military equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> This strategic exercise in purchasing power through the military Budget is a shocking misdirection of national resources at a time when global environmental disaster is looming and the stimulation of global development should be our first priority. If we do not act now, future generations will curse our shortsightedness; if we do act, we have every reason to be optimistic that, for the first time since the dawn of the industrial age, human kind will live well and within its ecological means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on behalf of the Opposition on this motion by Senator Coulter, I feel I should point out that the leading car referred to in the motion is a Swiss entrant called the Spirit of Biel, the solar cells for which were designed by the team headed by Professor Green at the University of New South Wales. As I understand it, however, they were not built in Sydney; they were built by the German Aerospace Co. Whether Senator Coulter's information or mine is accurate, I cannot be sure. One interesting piece of information that I obtained is that it performs 10 per cent better here than in Switzerland, due to the amount of sun that we enjoy. I also understand that the leading Australian entry was in sixth place at Alice Springs yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The program that is referred to at the University of New South Wales gets its funding from a variety of sources-including private companies, the Australian Research Council, the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC), and the Department of Energy in the United States-and has recently been made a centre of excellence by the Federal Government. To put the program on the footing that it would like, the centre needs to be successful in an application which is currently under way for a Federal Government cooperative centre. I hope that Senator Coulter's motion and our support for it might go some way to helping the centre to achieve the funding it seeks on an important matter, certainly one that is well suited to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of research projects supported by the Government, according to the Minister for Resources, Alan Griffiths, `demonstrate Australia's place as a world leader in solar energy research'. Mr Griffiths, in his press release of 8 November from which I have just quoted, drew attention to the research into solar cells at the University of New South Wales. The interesting thing is that governments, in the way they do, have tended to enjoy taking the credit when something is successful. From watching politics over a number of years, I know that governments do enjoy sharing the limelight with successors in other fields. Perhaps one of the features of the energy debate has been that governments have tended to come and go, depending on the fashion in the energy world. Of course, that also has something to do with the price of oil. Currently, with oil prices rising, alternative energy sources have become of much greater interest to all of us, including the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is that we have not had established a sustained and consistent research effort over time. The angle of criticism which I would have is that this is something which governments cannot turn on and off like a tap. It is something which must be sustained and, for the country's sake, alternative energy research should not be subject to the whim of fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that we have a comparative and natural advantage in the availability of sunlight. Many people would say that that is an underutilised advantage. The journal of the Australian and New Zealand Solar Energy Society, Solar Progress, has claimed that Commonwealth spending on renewable energy resource related research has collapsed over the decade. According to the journal, the spending in the area of renewable resources dropped by 88 per cent over the last 12 years. If that is correct, it would tend to suggest that we are spending on renewable energy research only about one-eighth of what we spent in 1978, at the time of funding of NERDDC. If those figures are correct, it would appear that the Government seems to be evacuating the area of renewable energy research. The Government has been prepared to draw attention to itself by advertising the breakthroughs in these research efforts and those that it continues to support, but it has not been continuing the effort on a sustained level. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that the Government has appreciated the long term timeframes involved in research. There has been a history of pulling the pin on research programs before they have been able to work up to a suitable level of activity. The research community needs consistency in the application of policy and certainty as to its direction. That is absent under this Government. In that sense, we should be directing attention to some of the organisational issues in support for solar energy research. </PARA>
<PARA> The theme of greater cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States is very much in fashion, and energy research and research into renewable energy are areas which could be properly addressed in that framework. There are national issues, but a coordinated and cooperative approach with coherent objectives across all States could well provide an important boost for such areas as solar energy. We must not forget that there has been a real problem with the entry of people into science and only today an article appearing in the Australian newspaper talked about the ageing of the scientific community and the sexism, if you like, of the scientific community. There is clearly a need for more women to go into scientific research. We have an underprovision of people generally to fill the jobs which have been advertised for physics graduates. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed that last year there were 810 job advertisements for physics graduates in the Australian newspaper but that the nation as a whole produced only 360 graduates and Ph.D students in physics. There was quite a drift away from tertiary studies in maths, science, technology and engineering between 1977 and 1987. Of course, we tend to see those that we do produce go overseas. The salaries in the public sector in Australia have consistently been lower than those being offered overseas. In the private sector there has not necessarily been the concentration on research as part of industry that is desirable if we are to become the clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we are limited in time tonight and I do not wish to labour the point. We in the Opposition believe that the Government's priorities have not been satisfactory when it comes to funding research in the area of renewable energy. We think this is very largely a matter of priorities within its approach to science and the habit it has had of jumping onto bandwagons and then getting off when something more attractive comes along, which is not conducive to the long term and valuable research that this country needs. It means that our scientists and our engineers are inclined to look to greener fields, both for better salaries and for more consistent program management. This brain drain will not stop unless the Government is prepared to take a fresh look at how people are funded for projects and how controlled our universities are by the central government in the projects which they can undertake and in the money which goes to these centres. I urge the Government to look at national priorities when it comes to renewable energy research and to reverse the direction which, I agree, has been a damaging one in this field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Coulter's motion deserves a great deal more seriousness than it has been offered so far, either through the attention offered to it by Government speakers or the depth of consideration that other honourable senators have been able to muster for it. I know that Senator Coulter, in his usual modest way, would not have drawn the chamber's attention to his own press release, which he put out in an attempt to show support for the people who have designed and manufactured and then led a race from Darwin to Alice Springs with their solar powered car.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter led his press release with the heading `Well done Australia'. It is that sort of support which I thought that a government interested in the future of Australia would be able to offer the designers of the particular solar panels which are used on this vehicle. It is the design on which they need to be congratulated. It is the design of something which is immensely more efficient than the previous victor in this race. That point seems to have escaped other commentators and honourable senators who have considered this motion. It is a fact that it is within Australia's capacity to lead the world in the design of high-tech modern technology applications not only in the design of solar panels but also in many other fields of renewable energy research. Senator Coulter has spent many sessions in this place trying to point out that we really do not need to be suffering this cringe of looking towards another international source for leadership in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about solar power. Before I go any further, the point should be made that even the term suffers a little. It is considered a soft issue, an issue which does not seem to be very macho or very attractive to the hard core of politics. When this matter is considered properly, we should be aware that everything on this earth is solar powered. Even the dirtiest of the coal, even the greatest grunting diesel engine, derives its original energy source from the sun. We should be paying much more attention to the correct use of our solar derived energy sources. </PARA>
<PARA> To harness our energy from the sun in a manner which is as direct as possible is only commonsense to me. All the other sources are several steps away from the initial energy which was the input to create the fuel which we use. One of the solar created energy sources we are exploiting is coal or, in fact, the entire petroleum resource. We recognise that this resource is finite. To be prepared for the day when that resource is exhausted, we should be conducting research tests and evaluations now. This would assist us in the capacity to substitute truly renewable fuels for the finite petroleums. This is all conventional wisdom; we are all well aware of it. It is really difficult to understand why there is no evidence at all that this Government has accepted that wisdom. It should accept it and then go on with enthusiastic support for research into renewable energy applications. But we do not get that enthusiastic support; we get begrudging acceptance of this motion, not even tacit attention paid to Senator Coulter's speech, which was as enlightened as any other that one could hear throughout the world on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> It is very interesting that earlier this afternoon I attended one of the meetings of the parliamentary United Nations Children's Fund group, where we were told, of all things, about solar powered child weighing scales that would be provided, through UNICEF, to the world. This is a wonderful project. Through this project our technology is on display to the world. It will benefit the world. It is frustrating that not more of these sorts of projects are being developed and allowed to be brought to fruition, to actual production. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is particularly well placed in this regard. We have our own domestic market, which has immediate application to many products which incorporate a self-contained energy collection and conversion process. Our isolated communities provide ideal proving grounds for such leading technologies. These leading technologies are such things as solar powered public telephones, and solar powered beacons and navigational aids, et cetera. People who live in isolated areas understand and appreciate these things more, because they are able to be demonstrated. Quite often, the proving ground which is our outback is the place where Australian ingenuity can lead to great advances for people in Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We are at the forefront of this technology. Our particular geography has forced us to take that position. Our harnessing of renewable energy has become part of our very heritage through our establishment and development of windmills all over the country. I subscribe to a magazine called Soft Technology. In that magazine it was reported that a backyard researcher and talented engineer has been able to improve the efficiency of our traditional windmill, which harnesses renewable energy. He was able to improve the traditional design by replacing the steel blades with aluminium ones. I am sure that even Government members would understand the basic engineering principle of centrifugal forces being lower with reduced weight and the fact that therefore the blades could be increased in size. For a given piece of equipment the efficiency could thus be improved. Such ingenuity has been the hallmark of Australian pioneers. We can and should be taking advantage of this by exploiting such developments and taking such work internationally to the stage where they become marketable products. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it is because of the lack of understanding and lack of appreciation of just what we are capable of in this country that so often such developments do not occur-they die before they are brought to fruition-and are lost because our ingenuity cannot be fully developed. This is where government initiative and support is necessary and would be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area where government support is required and where it would be beneficial is the renewable energy which could be derived from ethanol used as motor fuel. Despite being bombarded with facts and examples that demonstrate that ethanol is a viable, effective fuel, despite having an Australian trial conducted by Queensland canegrowers demonstrating the suitability of ethanol as a fuel, and despite the only too obvious threats to the supply of existing petroleum-based motor fuels, this Government is unable to see beyond the entrenched industrial position. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is unable to see the huge advantages which would accrue to the Australian economy and the Australian society in general if we were to provide government support for the establishment of an ethanol industry for motor fuel. I remind the Government that the support that is being asked for does not necessarily mean cash grants, subsidies or infrastructure development. All it means is enlightened, progressive purchasing policies, especially in fuels; leadership, especially in the Government's use of energy; and leadership in the Government's conservation of energy. With regard to this, I think it was ironic-of course it greatly amused the journalists-that it took an invasion of bogong moths to encourage the administration of this building to switch off unnecessary lighting. The saving of energy was seen as incidental. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not speak for too long, but it bears repeating that there are well established methods by which the Government can not only reduce energy consumption throughout the entire nation but also encourage investigation into alternative energy and renewable energy sources. These methods have been mentioned many times over the decades but they bear repeating briefly. The basic suggestion of a taxation reduction being available for the purposes of home insulation is one method which has been adopted previously and I cannot see any justification for denying it in the future. There needs to be Government research and then consumer guidance in all manner of ways so that consumers can be encouraged to reduce their consumption of energy. I might say, in passing, that Tasmania's Hydro Electric Commission has finally realised the wisdom of offering tariff rates which favour householders who wish to harness the energy of the sun to heat their water. For years, the accountants of that organisation pursued a policy which positively discouraged people from installing solar water heaters. The ridiculousness of that was finally realised and the new enlightened policy is an example which could and should be followed throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Commonwealth Government could assume a leading role in committing funds for research. As Senator Newman quite rightly suggested, funds could be committed, not as a matter of fashion but as a matter of a long term commitment, which I am sure would pay a dividend. The dividend to be derived from this is not necessarily one which is to do with cash savings; it is a dividend which is to do with the infrastructure which the whole country can benefit from. The dividend in this instance is simply a matter of pride. It is with quite sincere pride that Senator Coulter is able to congratulate the designers of these particular solar cells. While we readily invest money, time and effort in seeking national pride from other endeavours, whether they be cultural, sporting or otherwise, the sorts of national efforts which bring pride in other areas could also be directed towards our research into renewable energy. It is with great pride that I endorse Senator Coulter's press release which says, `Well done Australia'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the time pressures on us tonight I will be as brief as I can in responding to the Financial Corporations (Prudential Standards) Amendment Bill 1990 that has been introduced by the Australian Democrats. The purpose of this Bill, as outlined by Senator Spindler when introducing it, is to establish a proper national framework for the regulation of the non-bank financial system in Australia. In essence, what the Bill does is bring into law part IV of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 which was one of the Acts of the Whitlam Government. Part IV of the Act has never been proclaimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make it clear at the start of my remarks that the coalition, like the Democrats, believes that something must be done to improve the supervision of non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) in Australia. Regrettably, the Government seems to be all over the place on this matter at the moment. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said that it is unnecessary to have a more national or integrated approach to prudential supervision. In his view, apparently the present system of prudential supervision is adequate. On the other hand, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said-and he said it in July in response to remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to whom I will turn in a moment-that in fact an integrated national system of prudential supervision of non-bank financial institutions was necessary and desirable. I hope that the Government will get its act together on this before too long because it is a matter of considerable importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out to the Senate that it is a matter on which the coalition has set the agenda. The Leader of the Opposition has made repeated statements in recent months calling for action. I am pleased to see that as a result of the pressure that has been brought to bear on it the Government has now put this issue on its agenda as well through the Special Premiers Conference which was held last month. In July Dr Hewson said that, in his view, there was a need for a more uniform integrated national approach to prudential supervision. At that time he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister should instruct the Treasurer to establish a committee of inquiry into a national system of prudential supervision. The committee of inquiry should consist of representatives of the Reserve Bank, the States and relevant industry experts. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>must be asked to report as quickly as possible on the adequacy of existing prudential standards and quality of supervision as well as on measures which may be necessary to improve the degree of protection afforded to depositors in financial institutions in Australia including the adequacy of existing information available to depositors. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt at all about the coalition's attitude to this matter. We believe that it is necessary to have a much better approach to prudential supervision of non-bank financial institutions than exists at the moment. We believe that there is a need for a more uniform integrated national approach to the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, there are of course various ways in which that can be achieved. We believe that the degree of inadequacy of the prudential supervision can be tackled in various ways and I will return to that matter in a moment. However, the coalition will not be supporting the Bill introduced by Senator Spindler. There are several reasons for this, some of which are of a technical nature. We believe there are some technical faults and difficulties with the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would be happy, if in due course those changes were made, to look at that to see whether it is possible to do that without undermining the thrust of the Bill. There are other reasons as well why we will not support the Bill at this time. The primary reason is that the whole issue is currently under review following the Special Premiers Conference held earlier this month. The nature of that review follows very closely the type of inquiry called for several months ago by the Opposition, through Dr Hewson. The communique released from the Premiers Conference said in relation to the question of the regulation of non-bank financial institutions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leaders and representatives agreed upon the need for reform of current State legislation and administration of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in the context of the stability of the financial system as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important statement. The communique went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Governments of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories have instructed a working group of Officers of all Governments to prepare a report by 31 March 1991 on specific proposals for a system of State-based prudential supervision with national co-ordination of high uniform standards and practices and suitable industry-funded liquidity support mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of this process, the working group should consult widely with the Reserve Bank, industry organisations and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that, and given the reporting date for that high level working party-namely, 31 March 1991-the coalition believes that it would not be prudent to pre-empt the outcome of that review, which will involve a much closer and more thoroughgoing examination of all the issues that I am sure even the Democrats would agree is available to them or indeed to the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the approach adopted at the Special Premiers Conference is a sensible way to begin tackling what is a complex and very difficult issue. In light of the all-government agreement to consider the matter, the timing of this Democrat Bill, I must say, is unusual, and I will be interested to hear Senator Powell's comments following my speech as to why the Bill is being introduced at this time. I would have thought it would have been much more practical in a timing sense to have deferred consideration of this Bill until such time as we see what the experts produce in the work they will be doing between now and 31 March next year, and possibly going beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition does not have a closed mind about either the degree or the best way to achieve a more uniform integrated national approach to prudential supervision. The coalition has made various statements on that matter. In an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio as far back as 20 July in relation to his call for a more integrated uniform national system, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA> I'd also make clear that I'm not advocating increased control. Supervision doesn't necessarily mean control. It means a standardisation of supervisory practices, selecting data, and of course, importantly, understanding who's got the responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to agree with the interviewer, John Shovelan:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that there needs to be a common system between the States, not necessarily administered by the Federal Government-</PARA>
<PARA>nor, necessarily, he went on to agree with the interviewer, with responsibility vested with the Reserve Bank. As I understand it, that seems to be a view broadly shared at this stage by the Government and certainly by the Prime Minister who has said similar things to that. We need serious and considered views from all interested parties on the array of topics involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, as I have intimated, does not want to put its views finally on the table until all the facts and analyses are available. This was a prime reason for the coalition's earlier call for an inquiry. What we need are the facts. In connection with that, it is also important to look in the course of this inquiry-and I presume the expert working party will do this-at the actual degree of supervision that may be desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> My attention has been drawn to a speech given in Melbourne today by Mr Des Moore from the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA), in which he pointed out what I think are some very pertinent matters in relation to the degree of increase in prudential regulation and supervision that is desirable. The IPA's view, just to quote from Mr Moore's press release, is that:</PARA>
<PARA> The enormous increase in `prudential' regulation and supervision of financial markets that is now occurring is largely based on false premises and the rush to reregulate is being focussed in each individual area without any overall assessment of the costs and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say in that speech that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the main cause of the over-lending and over borrowing that occurred during the 1990s was not a lack of prudential regulation but the Government's policy of accommodating inflation through monetary policy and the Accord. This had encouraged over-borrowing to purchase assets whose prices had seemingly been `guaranteed' to rise. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Moore went on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the moves to increase prudential supervision and regulation were in serious danger not only of failing to recognise the real limits to these processes, but also of providing de facto guarantees to depositors, thereby creating moral hazard and contravening a vital principle of efficient regulation. ``Primary responsibility for the safety of depositors must be, and be seen to be, with the financial institutions themselves, not with governments or their Central Banks''. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are very important comments. Without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with them, they highlight the sort of considerations that need to be brought into account and considered in any full analysis of this matter. With the Democrats' Bill to date, that degree of analysis and examination is just not possible. The timing of this Bill may therefore have more to do with, as I understand it, the Democrats' opposition to deregulation of the financial sector than to anything else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right. The coalition, on the other hand, is, and remains, committed to deregulation supported by an effective supervisory framework. It is essential to realise that a properly deregulated financial market will always require supervision. It is incumbent on the Government to ensure that the proper supervisory framework is put in place. That is why the coalition has been so keen to set the agenda on this issue. The coalition has also taken careful note of the statement made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, in May when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we believe that financial deregulation, on balance, has been good for the economy, there is no doubt that prudential supervision will have to be developed further. The rules will have to be adjusted as we learn more about the game. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the view of the coalition. The rules do need to be changed in a way which gives due consideration to the links between the supervisory mechanisms that may ultimately be adopted and the overall question of deregulation of the financial sector. It is important not to lose sight of the reason for prudential controls within the deregulated system. To quote Mr Fraser again:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not even now have a fully deregulated system and we never will-the public will rightly expect governments to impose some restraints to ensure that the basic rules of the game are adhered to and that individual freedoms do not lead to undesirable social consequences . . . [that] is the basic rationale for prudential supervision of the banking system.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to remember that responsibilities relate both to those who manage and to those who supervise financial institutions. The fact remains, however, that ultimately individual institutions must take responsibility for their own integrity. That is the point Mr Moore made in his speech to the IPA today. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at effective supervision, many of the issues which will need to be addressed were outlined in a paper prepared for the Special Premiers Conference by the Queensland Government, entitled Committee of Inquiry into Non-Bank Financial Institutions and Related Financial Processes in the State of Queensland. I understand that that paper was very influential in the heads of government reaching the agreed position that they did at the Conference. That paper includes a number of interesting recommendations. While it is too early for the coalition to decide on its position on those recommendations, it does suggest, I think, that the Democrats may not have looked fully at all the issues before coming to their conclusions; and I commend to the Democrats, in their further consideration of this matter, the Queensland paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats do not appear to have considered the possibility of maintaining a State based system. While there are advantages to national consistency, this can be achieved through mechanisms which would allow a continued State based system. A national approach would provide automatic uniformity between the States, economies of scale in supervision, and acknowledgment of the similarities of many NBFIs. However, the history and unique nature of some regional institutions must also be recognised. That may best be achieved under a State based system, with some form of national coordination. </PARA>
<PARA> A State based system would also appear to be preferable from the standpoint that non-bank financial institutions are established and administered under State legislation, so a Commonwealth supervisory role could be somewhat contradictory.  Consistent with the intent of this Bill, however, a State based system could involve the adoption of a Reserve Bank style of prudential supervision without the Commonwealth being responsible for the entire supervisory role. In that respect I note that Dr Hewson has also said that it need not be the Reserve Bank which plays the oversighting supervising role, as I pointed out earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not, on behalf of the coalition, necessarily advocating continuation of a State based system, but I do think that the relative merits of such a system deserve a closer and more detailed examination than the hurried presentation of this Bill has allowed. There may be particular reasons for it, but this Bill was introduced into this Parliament only 11 hours or less ago. Obviously it has not had the opportunity to be as carefully examined as we would like. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder, too, whether the Democrats have fully thought out the implications of increasing the Reserve Bank's role to the extent that this Bill suggests. In May of this year the Governor himself said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is always a risk in adopting a higher profile in even general ``surveillance'' of building societies that we may raise false expectations about what we are prepared to do to support an intermediary in difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the spin-off effects of any action in this area which also bear careful consideration. The fabric of our financial system is based primarily around confidence and possible contagion effects. It is these psychological factors which make reactions to changes in the financial sector especially difficult to predict, and make caution and well-considered conclusions essential. The Opposition recognised as much when the Financial Corporations Act, on part IV of which this Bill is heavily based, was first introduced in 1974. At that time the late Hon. Phillip Lynch said:</PARA>
<PARA>The views of both a former Governor of the Australian Reserve Bank and the present Governor clearly support the Opposition's position that the powers contained in the Bill before the House have the capacity to be counterproductive if used without regard for their economic consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>The other major issue which must be carefully considered involves just how the supervision of institutions can, and should, contribute to solving problems which have led to the concern evident in this action by the Democrats and our call for an inquiry, namely, closures and collapses of financial institutions, particularly in Victoria. It is clear from the Reserve Bank bulletin of 1987-July 1987, I think-that regulation in areas covered by part IV of the Financial Corporations Act do already apply, albeit to varying degrees within the States and the Territories. It is, therefore, the precise nature and extent of the regulation enumerated in part IV, rather than the subject areas themselves, which is the critical element. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect it would be helpful for the Opposition to be fully briefed on exactly what information the Commonwealth Government already receives about the financial system, exactly who receives it and when. The recent collapse of, particularly, the Pyramid Building Society is a case in point. Despite repeated attempts to ascertain exactly what happened, who knew what and how much should have been known, given the current supervisory arrangements, we still have no answers of substance. It is difficult to correct a problem when one cannot even be sure of the situation which applied when it happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of how best to address the supervisory improvements, which, I think we would all agree, must be considered, is a very difficult one. While the Democrats have rightly recognised that a problem exists-and we agree totally with them on that-we will wait for the outcome of the current review of the matter before deciding on the best action to take. De- regulation has put all of the authorities involved with the financial sector on a very steep learning curve. It is now imperative that we do not jump too soon to conclusions which may not best meet the diverse objectives which must be met in this new environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure what is going to happen to this Bill, but I hope that the Democrats might consider deferring it until such time as the work that is going on and that has now been set in train by the Special Premiers Conference has come to fruition and we have had a proper analysis of all the issues and considerations involved. Only in that way will we then be able to be confident that we are taking the best solutions to meet those problems which we commonly agree exist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Short for his contribution to the debate on the Financial Corporations (Prudential Standards) Amendment Bill 1990, and for his constructive approach and his request that time be given for consideration. Indeed, it is the intention of the Australian Democrats that this debate tonight should not close consideration of this Bill which, as Senator Short has said, was introduced earlier today by my colleague Senator Spindler, the treasury and finance spokesperson for the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short questioned the timing of this Bill and has also made a claim on behalf of the Opposition that the Opposition has led the way on the whole question of the oversight of financial institutions and, in terms of this legislation, non-bank financial institutions. I challenge that claim and do so in the context of answering his query about the timing of this legislation. For many years the Democrats have been the only political party in this country opposing the rampant deregulation in the financial system and in other areas. It ought not to be a surprise to Senator Short or anyone else that, within the first six weeks of the sitting of this Parliament, the Australian Democrats are bringing in an initial piece of reregulating legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, within days of the collapse of the Pyramid Building Society in Victoria we called for the proclamation of part IV of the Financial Corporations Act, which, as Senator Short has said, is largely the basis for Senator Spindler's Bill. In that respect, as well, we have led the way. As I said, this Senate has not been sitting for six weeks yet, and during that time energy and effort have gone into the drafting of this piece of legislation, and the timing is determined by the fact that this legislation has now been made ready for introduction into this place. That is the reason for the timing. It is rather interesting that earlier today, when this chamber received a report to the Senate of a list of unproclaimed legislation, in that report was the note of the lack of proclamation of part IV of the Financial Corporations Act. So the timing is, I would suggest, quite fortuitous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to establish a national prudential supervision system for deposit-taking non-bank financial institutions-that is, building societies and credit unions. Senator Short quoted his parliamentary leader, Dr Hewson, in challenging the right of the Reserve Bank to be responsible in this area. It is within the charter of the Reserve Bank of Australia to be responsible for the Australian financial system. The non-bank financial institutions are part of that system, and the fact that under Treasurer Keating the Reserve Bank has confined itself to banking institutions does not make either Senator Short or Dr Hewson right when they say that the Reserve Bank has no capacity to act in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Before considering the Bill in detail, I would like first to consider the main attributes of non-bank financial institutions. Many people may think, `Why not just join a bank? Why join a building society or credit union?'. The reason is that the non-bank financial institutions sector offers a vast array of choice, and innovation is often linked to a particular region. One example of this innovation is the proposal that is currently before the Victorian Government concerning the recent purchase of the former First Mortgage Permanent Building Society. A Perth based women's organisation has purchased that society and is applying to establish Australia's first specialist women's building society. Parking places for prams and creches will be provided and there may be special provisions applying to loan repayments during pregnancy and maternity leave. Can honourable senators imagine any of our banks providing such services? The Australian Democrats totally support such community-minded initiatives, particularly those which take account of the special needs of women in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to activate the dormant provisions of part IV of the Financial Corporations Act 1974. These provisions provide the mechanism for the national regulation of the non-bank financial institutions. Currently there is a variety of State based regulatory systems, to which I shall come later in the speech. In doing so I will respond to some of Senator Short's other comments. The Federal Government, the Democrats believe, should accept its responsibilities, and the Reserve Bank is the appropriate mechanism by which that should happen. It has the statutory duty to maintain the health of the Australian financial system, as I have said. It cannot do this without being involved in direct prudential supervision. We have seen that, and many Australian investors are suffering from the fact that at the moment that is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the current system the Reserve Bank operates through the banks when it provides liquidity support. Such a system is clearly unacceptable. Since the banks are in competition with the deposit-taking non-bank financial institutions, there is obviously a potential conflict of interest in these types of arrangements. It is a classic example of putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. Why will the Government not show some leadership in this area? Surely people's savings are more important than political considerations. The ideological deregulationist position taken by the Government is supported by the Opposition. Treasurer Keating, by rejecting this kind of approach is clearly trying to distance himself from any sense of responsibility which he should be accepting for the disaster of the Pyramid Building Society. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper to which Senator Short referred prepared by the Queensland Treasury for the recent Special Premiers Conference has suggested what we consider to be an unwieldy State-based structure, which is quite ridiculous in terms of a conference which was supposed to address problems of duplication. But when one looks at the paper it is clear that this is recognised as a second best option. Paragraph 3 of the paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Reserve Bank has some responsibility under its charter for the whole financial system, the Federal Government has indicated clearly that it is not prepared to legislate in this area, provide any liquidity support or assume responsibility for the various non-bank financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>We consider that a disgraceful situation. This is why this Senate, which represents the States, should send a message to the Government that the Pontius Pilate attitude is both inefficient and unacceptable. I urge honourable senators to contact their respective State governments to seek their views. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the New South Wales Deputy Registrar, Mr Uri Windt, recently spoke at the seminar on managing non-bank financial institutions in crisis. In that speech he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The first and most fundamental fact to be established is whether the regulation of non-bank financial institutions is to remain a State Government responsibility or come under Federal jurisdiction. If the Federal Government was to assume this responsibility the outcome is probably straightforward in the sense that there exists machinery for corporate and prudential supervision which could be adjusted to take on this role. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, I believe that a number of States would desire such an outcome. So you can expect none of the drama that accompanied the introduction of the Corporations Act. The fact is that the Federal Government has resisted the temptation of assuming this responsibility. All the informal and semi-formal feedback has indicated a distinct lack of interest in enacting legislation or any similar step that would presume Federal responsibility (or liability) in the area. At best, it is my impression that the Federal Government's interest is in ensuring that a State-owned system is in place, capable of meeting the regulatory challenge of non-bank financial institutions. So let us assume that the outcome will indeed be a State-based system. </PARA>
<PARA>What a way to design a financial system! That is comment on Senator Short's remarks as to why we do not sit around and do nothing while this whole system is investigated, looked at and turned over for many more months while many more people remain in financial danger, as the Government washes its hands of its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to commence the process of the full national regulation of non-bank financial institutions. It proposes to update all financial penalties for offences under the Financial Corporations Act by 500 per cent to bring their real value up to the level of 1974-the point at which the relevant part of the Act was not, I remind the Senate, proclaimed. Monetary penalties must be kept at an adequate level to act as an effective deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes to extend the scope of the Financial Corporations Act to friendly societies for the first time. It is only proposed to bring these societies under the registration and statistical provisions at this stage. Indeed, the Government is understood to be examining the possibility of bringing friendly societies under the supervision of the office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC). As such it is recognised that the ISC may well be the appropriate supervisory body and no action is taken in this Bill, except as I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> A new part IV(A) is introduced into the principal Act by this Bill. Bank style prudential standards are contained within this new part. It will apply initially to building societies and credit unions. A prime assets ratio is introduced for these institutions. There is power to set various levels for differing categories of distributions. However, the same rules must apply to each member of a category. Where the institution does not satisfy the prime assets ratio it is generally not allowed to grant any loans. </PARA>
<PARA> A further prudential control is the setting of minimum capital adequacy standards. This will ensure that the particular institutions maintain secure structures with adequate capital bases. There are also provisions concerning large exposures. These must be notified to the Reserve Bank and the bank may intervene to protect the interests of the deposit holders. The measures are designed to ensure that institutions do not put too many eggs in one basket. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes that the supervisory functions of the Reserve Bank will be paid for by an administrative levy on all non-bank financial institutions. This will be paid into a special fund and can be used only for this specific purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, industry specific liquidity support funds are to be created for both credit unions and building societies. All institutions will have to make deposits into these funds. Interest will be payable at a rate below the market rate-rather like the non-callable deposits which banks are obliged to make with the Reserve Bank. These moneys are then available to provide liquidity support where necessary. Deposits are repayable on exiting the relevant industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To create a more secure regime for depositors, a separate reserve fund will be established for both credit unions and building societies. Basically the fund is to secure deposits in these institutions. A levy may be imposed on building societies or credit unions which will be paid into the fund. The reserve funds will invest the moneys deposited and the total assets of the reserve funds will be available to provide assistance to depositors where an institution has to be liquidated-and there are many Victorians who wish that these sorts of provisions had already been in place. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not be compulsory to contribute to the reserve fund. Since the reserve fund arrangement is basically an insurance arrangement for deposits, there will be no levy available where an appropriate deposit insurance has been obtained by the institution. These measures will not commence until six months after the royal assent of this Bill to enable the appropriate consultation with the States concerning existing liquidity fund arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Views within the industry, as one would expect, vary. However, the general trend is towards support of national regulation. For example, the General Manager of the Australian Federation of Credit Unions, Mr Graham Loughlin, is reported in the Australian Financial Review of 1 November 1990 of welcoming the opportunity:</PARA>
<PARA>to achieve high uniform standards, practices and prudential supervision Australia-wide. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, senior business representatives have privately supported this approach. Our approach in this Bill-in contrast to the State-based mishmash which we were asked to consider seriously and which we believe is inappropriate-is preferred, we believe, by building societies, and senior business representatives have also privately supported the approach. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does not seek to create a complete national regulatory structure. We think that such a massive job should be achieved gradually. The most important move at this stage is to a national prudential supervisory system with a full national regulatory system, the natural further step not too far into the future. The non-bank financial industry provides a perfect microcosm of the absurd structure which pervades so much of Australian life. Senator Short laid emphasis on the State-based approach that has been put forward by the Queensland submission to the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to some statements by Mr Windt on that matter and I commend further comments from him to Senator Short and to others. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> In some States the regulator is a Registrar administering a piece of legislation for each of the various types of entity. In others there is an Omnibus Act covering every form of incorporation. In other States the role of the Registrar has been subsumed in the functions of Corporate Affairs Commissions and there is no longer a distinct role of a Registrar. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is there consistency in the set of entities regulated by Registrars . . .</PARA>
<PARA> To add to the confusion, the process of Ministerial responsibility is not homogeneous either . . . </PARA>
<PARA> To complete the picture it should be said that the relevant Ministers responsible for cooperative type organisations had never met to consider the matters of common concern until October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>A final quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the point remains, if you were to set out and design a regulatory framework this would not be considered the most perfect system. </PARA>
<PARA>My own State of Victoria, as I have already mentioned, has had some enormous problems in recent times in the area of non-bank financial institutions. The tragic collapse of the Pyramid Building Society following the stupendous problems with the merchant bank Tricontinental Ltd show clearly that effective prudential supervision is essential to safeguard depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial deregulation has been a disaster. Slowly more and more people are coming to realise this. How can we hope to increase savings which will reduce the current account problems facing Australia under the present climate? People need proper incentives to save. Firstly, they must have security. This Bill addresses the problem of depositor security by enacting proper prudential controls similar to those applying to banks to help restore the confidence that has taken such a battering recently. </PARA>
<PARA> The second incentive that people need to encourage them to save is that they must get a reasonable return because all of us want a reasonable return on our savings. Inflation and taxation together work to eliminate much of the interest earned in financial institutions. Just as people need a reasonable wage to work hard, investors need a reasonable return on investment to save hard. </PARA>
<PARA> In our alternative Budget put down in August before the Treasurer's Budget, we proposed a tax rebate on the first $1,000 of interest earned. This rebate is set at the marginal tax rate which applies to a person on average weekly earnings. Thus to low and middle income earners up to $1,000 interest will be tax free under Australian proposals. However, those on higher incomes will have to pay a small amount of tax on their interest. </PARA>
<PARA> People have seen an extraordinary binge since the 1980s. A small element of our society went on a huge spending spree and they have left the bill to the rest of the community. We now have a stupendous foreign debt which is still growing inexorably. Even though we have the terrible evidence from our own performance in the United States, Britain and the Nordic countries that financial deregulation smashes the savings ratio, the deregulation fervour that grips the old political parties here in this place has not died but appears to be actually increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> This is despite the fact that the Government has had to engineer a recession to attempt to contain the current account monster it has created. As usual, those on the bottom of the social ladder will bear the cost by being thrown out of work. To add insult to injury, Opposition members say that if they were in government they would cut off unemployment benefits after nine months. So much for their commitment to society. We have to realise that policies like that will cause poverty, crime and violence in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people say, `Well, so, if the Skases and the Bonds lose all their money or the banks' money, I have not lost anything'. If only that were true! The banks have a huge portfolio of so-called non-performing loans. Estimates vary, but the accepted estimate is about $10 billion. The banks always complain about supposed government inefficiency. Yet in response to this $10 billion of non-performing loans disaster they say, `We have been on a learning curve'. I think that I heard Senator Short refer to the learning curve. When will they learn that financial deregulation is in nobody's interests. Since the banks are earning no interest on these non-performing loans, the amount charged to all their other customers is increased. That is in the general level of interest rate increases, or the interest rates do not decrease at the rate that they otherwise would. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks increase their margin on loans to customers who pay for the often reckless lending which the banks themselves undertook. So, as usual, in the end it is the ordinary person who picks up the tab. Indeed, some ominous signs of the second wave of crashes are already coming through. As unemployment rises, which is occurring quite dramatically at the moment, we will see an increasing number of private bankruptcies. As people lose their incomes they will become un- able to pay their mortgages and their credit card debts. This will place further strain on families and increase poverty. Yet the Government and the Opposition want to accelerate this process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has before this Parliament a Bill to commence the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. Even Sir Robert Menzies and Malcolm Fraser would not have countenanced such legislation. The crash of Tricontinental was a direct result of deregulation. This has cost the people of Victoria their State Bank, an unprecedented result except for the New South Wales State Saving Bank disaster during the Depression. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also wants to deregulate the domestic and international telecommunications market. Why? It is so that it can give to the private sector the fastest growing industry in the world. This Bill is proposing an historic national solution to a national problem. I urge all honourable senators to think of their constituents' interests, of the depositors, when they decide which way they will vote on this legislation. We need something positive to be done. Of course, the majority of building societies operating are in a sound, stable position, supplying good services. But those depositors who are unfortunate enough to be involved with an institution where that is not happening do need the right and proper protection which it is the responsibility of the Federal Government, through the Reserve Bank of Australia, to supply. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of this Bill were included in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 3) of 1989. That Bill lapsed however due to the dissolution of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. The Bill should therefore be seen against the background of the Government's efforts to strengthen and, where necessary, protect the legitimate autonomy of higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Student organisations provide a wide range of services to their members, from counselling, sporting, health and careers services to the necessary social outlets for young people in higher education. These services and amenities must be maintained at a viable level and that requires money. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal source of that money is services and amenities fees collected from students themselves by the governing bodies of the institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interests of students generally. At present these fees are paid in accordance with provisions made by the governing bodies of the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>It was made clear when this measure was originally introduced into the House, that the Government considers it unfortunate that there needs to be a Bill of this kind at all. However, States have in the past interfered with these arrangements and there have been threats, notably from the New South Wales Government, that this might occur again. We are not prepared to see this happen. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides that, as a condition of grant under the Act, a State must not interfere with the rights of the governing bodies of institutions to make decisions as to the imposition or collection of fees for organisations representing the interests of students generally. If a State breaches this condition it will be required to make up any consequential shortfall in revenue to those institutions. If necessary this will be achieved by a requirement that the State pay the Commonwealth an amount to make up the shortfall, or alternatively, the Commonwealth could reduce the State's general revenue assistance. The Commonwealth will then make payments direct to the affected institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government again encourages any State contemplating such interference in the autonomy of higher education institutions to think again and hopes that the provisions of this Bill will never need to be invoked. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 which provides funding for the 1990-92 triennium. This Bill provides funding for higher education institutions for 1993 amounting to $3,204 million in accordance with the Government's commitment to rolling triennial funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill reflects the Government's decision to provide $29.6million for additional intakes in 1993 and additional funding for capital projects to maintain the capital program at its 1992 level. The total funding for major works in 1993 will be $212.5 million. These measures reflect the Government's continuing commitment to the expansion of the higher education system to provide for a more highly skilled and educated Australian community, as announced in the White Paper. Indeed by the end of 1993, the Government will have created some 70,000 new higher education places since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The capital funds will allow the Government to make early decisions on new capital projects to commence in 1993 in order to facilitate the proper planning of these developments by institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased funding is being provided for 1990, 1991 and 1992 amounting to some $533 million in accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements. The Bill also provides for the incorporation of the Australian Postgraduate Course Awards and the Research Fellowship Scheme of the Australian Research Council (ARC) into the Act. The incorporation of these programs into the Act completes the implementation of the Government's decision to fund ARC programs on a rolling triennium basis, and facilitates further rationalisation of the administration and conditions of postgraduate awards. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides for the integration of the higher education component of the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP) from the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 with the Aboriginal Participation Initiative (API) within the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. From 1993, new places for Aboriginal students will be funded with a premium to reflect the need for additional support services for Aboriginal students but no additional funding will be available under AESIP. Institutions will be required to support participation by Aboriginal students within their total educational program and account for such activities within the profile planning and negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly the conditions of grant for the Equity Program have been varied to reflect a change in emphasis from funding of specific projects to the achievement of participation targets for disadvantaged groups as set out in institutional equity plans. This approach will require institutions to incorporate equity initiatives as an integral component of their management and decision making processes and is consistent with Government objectives for equity in higher education as set out in the statement A Fair Chance for All. Institutions will be required to report on progress towards achieving their equity objectives within the profile planning and negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Bill provides increased flexibility in the remitting of HECS semester debt to assist students who, but for the current statutory period, would have had the debt remitted. This change will provide relief to a small group of students who could not become aware of the circumstances which prevent them from continuing their studies until after the statutory period or are incapable of making an application within the period. The change will further enhance the equity of the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (TAFE ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 to implement the Government's Budget decisions on Commonwealth assistance for technical and further education and to supplement for cost increases grants for 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill appropriates $358.587m for technical and further education in 1991 and provides for additional funds for the 1990 program in line with cost supplementation arrangements to bring funding for 1990 to $343.477m. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The main purposes of this Bill are to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to implement decisions in the recent Budget on Commonwealth programs for schools in 1991 and to supplement for cost increases grants already appropriated for schools programs for 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The major areas for which altered or new arrangements are proposed concern the Special Education Program, a new Literacy and Learning Program, additional assistance for disadvantaged schools, a new element of the Capital Grants Program to support increased secondary school retention rates, and a new Award Restructuring Assistance Program to help meet additional costs arising from approved measures for teacher salary award restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of Special Education, government schools will receive additional funding through a 20 per cent loading on general recurrent grants for students with disabilities. Where students with disabilities attend non-government schools a per capita supplement will be paid in respect of such students equal to the difference between maximum general recurrent rates and the rates which apply for the funding category of the school. In addition, measures to reduce from seven to four the number of programs or program elements providing for special education, while maintaining coverage of the current client groups, will achieve greater flexibility and simplification in administrative processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Disadvantaged Schools Program will receive additional funding to increase its coverage from the present 422,000 students to 500,000. </PARA>
<PARA> A new Literacy and Learning Program will operate for three calendar years from 1 January 1991. The objective of the program is to improve learning in the junior secondary years by supporting the development of targeted professional development programs and their delivery to teachers in schools serving populations with high concentrations of disadvantaged groups. The program will be administered on a joint basis and will have a national element providing for collaborative developmental projects and a general element providing allocations to the States and the Northern Territory for professional development programs. </PARA>
<PARA> A new element of the Capital Grants Program for 1991 and 1992 will fund projects which support increased secondary school retention rates in government schools and non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to provide an impetus to government and non-government school authorities to improve the quality of teaching by encouraging a process of restructuring of teacher salary awards in each sector in each State. The Commonwealth will provide financial assistance towards the additional costs incurred by government and non-government school authorities who undertake approved measures for award restructuring. These funds will be made available under the Award Restructuring Assistance Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill appropriates an estimated $2,440m for schools programs in 1991, and provides for additional funds for 1990 programs in line with cost supplementation arrangements to bring total funding for 1990 programs to an estimated $2,220m. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>BUILDERS LABOURERS' FEDERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 proposes an extension of the period during which the Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation or any equivalent association is excluded from applying for registration under the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the provisions of the current Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration) Act 1986, that period will expire on 14 April 1991. This Bill proposes, among a number of other matters, that the period be extended for a further 5 years until 14 April 1996. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is introducing this Bill in an attempt to ensure industrial peace in the building and construction industry. There is no doubt in the Government's view that the attitudes and behaviour of the Builders Labourers Federation have not changed in the past four and a half years and it continues to be a threat to law and good order in the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the provisions of the Cancellation of Registration legislation, the BLF may not be registered under the Industrial Relations Act, unless the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is satisfied that the association would not engage in conduct inimical to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has no doubt that the Federation would be unable to meet this requirement. Our experience in the past clearly demonstrates this. The period of de-registration of the Federation from 1974 until 1976 did not result in any noticeable change in the behaviour of the union when it was again allowed to operate in the Federal industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA>Attempts were made in the early 1980s to have the Federation de-registered once again. This process was not completed, and the BLF was given a further opportunity to modify its behaviour. In 1985, in the light of the BLF's activities, the Government introduced the Building Industry Act to provide for a review of the behaviour of the Federation by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Following the review, the Commission found in 1986 that there was an overwhelming case against the Federation in the light of its proven record of serious industrial misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation introduced in 1986 following the Commission's finding de-registered the Federation for a period of 5 years. This was done in the hope that the Federation would learn that the type of industrial behaviour it adopted had no place in the Federal industrial relations system and that it would therefore alter that behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Federation has not altered its behaviour in the slightest. </PARA>
<PARA>In Melbourne this year alone, there has been a series of incidents, which is still continuing, in which building workers have been constantly harassed through violence by BLF officials. Since the BLF was deregistered in 1986, there have been more than 100 convictions against BLF officials in Victoria. The crimes for which convictions have been recorded include: trespass, assault, assaulting police, resisting arrest, contempt of court, receiving secret commissions, wilful damage, defacing property and theft. Such behaviour cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>More recent examples are incidents in Melbourne at 417 St Kilda Road and other sites, where the costs of police protection alone have cost the Victorian taxpayer in excess of $1 million and costs generally to industry are in excess of $15 million. </PARA>
<PARA>This dispute arose over a claim for payment of lost time. An unofficial picket was mounted in June 1990 at BLF instigation. The picket indulged in persistent and premeditated violence against workers on site and against police. Nuts, bolts and rocks were thrown at the workers and at trucks making deliveries to the site. Contractors and their families were harassed. BLF organisers defied court orders and were gaoled in July and August for contempt of court. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, members of the picket have continually disrupted weekly meetings of the Victorian Trades Hall Council and vandalised the historic Trades Hall building. BLF officials have also organised pickets at other sites operated by Leightons Contractors in Melbourne. One of these sites is the extremely important Commonwealth Serum Laboratory building project in Broadmeadows. These pickets are not supported by the Victorian Trades Hall Council or the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly in New South Wales there have been many arrests of BLF members for trespass, assaults and causing damage to property. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1986 NSW BLF supporters caused the May Day rally to be abandoned because of assault to BWIO officials. Police had to restore order. </PARA>
<PARA>NSW BLF officials have regularly been arrested from 1986 to date for trespass and assault on building sites. BLF members have regularly disrupted work on building sites in Sydney by staging sit-ins on cranes. </PARA>
<PARA>In June 1988 the Federal Court granted orders precluding the BLF from entering 11 building sites in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>The entire trade union movement, employers and the Victorian Government have joined forces in an attempt to ensure that the BLF does not succeed in such campaigns of unacceptable and abhorrent industrial behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of incidents such as these, any suggestion that the BLF has changed its ways is ludicrous. We could sit back, take no action and allow the BLF to continue this campaign of industrial lawlessness while the Australian Industrial Relations Commission once again listened to the Federation put a case for registration under the Industrial Relations Act. There is little doubt what the outcome of such proceedings would be. There is no place for the Federation in the Federal system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has noted that suggestions have been made in some quarters that an inquiry of some kind should be conducted into these matters. In the Government's view, such a suggestion cannot be seriously considered in this case. The necessity for such action has been vitiated by events which have been observed and condemned by the broad community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federation's record speaks for itself. To allow registration proceedings in the Commission or to conduct an inquiry would play into the hands of the Federation, which would use any delay in the Government's dealing with it as an opportunity for it to continue its disruption and violence against others in the industry. It would pursue a forceful recruitment campaign and exert all the industrial muscle it could muster to maintain and defend its influence in the building industry. The building industry could not withstand the financial and other costs incurred. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government would be remiss if it invited breaches of law and order in the industry through delay or hesitancy. It cannot afford to gamble on the chance that the Federation would change the habits of many years and act responsibly during any delay. </PARA>
<PARA>The tactics used at the St Kilda Road site are reminders of what the Federation would attempt if there was a chance of again asserting its influence in the Federal Industrial Relations arena. It is the branches of the BLF in Victoria and New South Wales which present the greatest danger to the building industry. These are the branches which have been isolated from the formal industrial relations framework at both the Federal and State levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, to allow full participation in the Federal system by any part of the Federation, even by its branches in those States where it remains registered at the State level, is to invite the militant faction of the Federation to attempt to gain entry to the Federal system through those State branches. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed by this Bill, will however, give some recognition to the more moderate State branches while ensuring that the irresponsible elements are denied access to the formal system of industrial relations existing at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the Bill to explain how the Government proposes to achieve this goal. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to go into the provisions of the Bill in any great detail, as the explanatory memorandum to the Bill gives a very comprehensive explanation of each clause. </PARA>
<PARA>The main provisions of the Bill will amend the Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration-Consequential Provisions) Act 1986 to achieve three important objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The prohibition on any application for registration by the Federation or any other non-registered association will be extended for an extra period of 5 years, until 14 April 1996. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the definition of ``non-registered association'' will be expanded to include an association, a substantial number of the members of which perform work which would make those members eligible for membership of the Federation or which would have made them eligible for membership of the Federation prior to the cancellation of its registration. Associations will come within the definition if the work performed would make the members eligible for membership of the Federation anywhere in Australia. The rules concerning eligibility differ between the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The final objective of the proposed amendments is to provide a limited right of intervention before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by all State registered branches of the BLF; namely, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The New South Wales branch is not able to participate in the New South Wales State industrial system. In Victoria legislation denies the BLF recognition before the State Industrial Commission. In the Australian Capital Territory only the Federal system applies. </PARA>
<PARA>The specified State branches of the Federation will be able to seek leave to intervene before the commission to present submissions in matters in which the commission might exercise its powers under section 111 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 not to hear or determine an industrial dispute. This right of intervention is limited to cases in which the commission might dismiss or not deal with a matter because the matter is trivial, or more properly dealt with by a State industrial authority, or because further proceedings are not desirable or necessary in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, those State registered branches will have the same rights of objection as other registered organisations in proceedings concerning the registration, amalgamation or alteration of eligibility rules of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill presented to the Senate contains certain amendments made in the House of Representatives. The purpose of these amendments is to provide greater flexibility in the commencement of the provisions of the proposed legislation. They are described in the revised explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In essence, upon Royal Assent, the Bill's formal provisions and the extended deregistration period under clause 5 will commence. The other provisions of the Bill will commence on proclamation but, if a proclamation is not gazetted within six months of assent, the provisions concerned will lapse. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that, until these unproclaimed provisions commence, the existing definitions and exclusions under the Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration-Consequential Provisions) Act 1986 will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government initiated the amendments to the Bill because certain of its provisions have the potential to affect current proceedings before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which involve, in various ways, the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia, and the Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers Western Australian branch). Certain other State registered branches of the BLF have sought to be involved in the proceedings, which concern the representation of builders' labourers in the Federal system. </PARA>
<PARA>The proceedings are to be adjourned until January 1991 to give the parties time to resolve the underlying issues by agreement. The commencement of clauses 3, 4 and 6 on Royal Assent could undermine that process. It would not be desirable to diminish the prospects of an orderly and constructive resolution of these matters without industrial friction. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government hopes that it will not be necessary to proclaim the provisions of the Bill which relate to proceedings instituted before the commencement of the amendments. That would only be necessary if the underlying legislative scheme of the Act appeared likely to be defeated by such proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislative action proposed by the Government will not prevent the Builders Labourers' Federation continuing to exist as a trade union, or continuing to operate in those State industrial systems in which the branches of the Federation are registered or recognised. The proposed legislation will prevent the BLF from operating in the formal Federal industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA>Registration under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 is voluntary and brings with it a number of rights and obligations. The conduct of the BLF was found to be inimical to the objectives of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, which was the predecessor to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It was that unlawful conduct which caused the Government to initiate the legislation cancelling the registration of the BLF under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>It is apparent that the conduct of the BLF would not be any different if it was allowed back into the formal federal industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA>Experience with the Federation's de-registration has clearly demonstrated that its removal from the system does not cause it to alter its behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, registration under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 brings both benefits and obligations. The BLF has consistently taken the benefits and ignored the obligations. Unless an organisation is willing to accept those obligations it should not be able to gain the benefits of the registration. </PARA>
<PARA>I must reiterate, however, that the Government's proposed legislative amendments will not prevent the Federation from continuing to exist as a trade union or prevent its members from remaining members of the Federation. The amendments will simply remove the ability of the Federation, or any equivalent association, to participate in the formal industrial relations framework established by the Industrial Relations Act 1988 as the objectives of the Federation are clearly inimical to the system established by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Government takes absolutely no joy at having to take the action that this Bill proposes. We are a Labor Government. We derive great satisfaction and great strength from our connection with the Australian Labour Movement. It was a Labor Government which brought about the ratification of ILO conventions No. 87 And 98 more than 17 years ago. In its application to Australia, these conventions seek to protect the rights of Australians to organise and to join and participate freely in the activities of trade unions. This Government is a staunch and energetic defender of these rights. But, as I said a moment ago, with the right to organise comes the obligation to observe the law. It is the Federation's refusal to accept this obligation that forces the Government to take the steps I have outlined in the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending 15 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments are highly significant, they are important for the administration of the functions of that Department. Details of the amendments follow. </PARA>
<PARA>Air Navigation Act 1920</PARA>
<PARA>The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), which is part of the Department of Transport and Communications, is responsible for the investigation of all air accidents and incidents. The aviation industry has a high regard for BASI and the integrity of its officers. </PARA>
<PARA>To assist the process of investigating accidents and incidents, officers of BASI are given the power to summon witnesses and to require those witnesses to answer questions. These powers, and other matters relating to air safety investigation, are provided for in the Air Navigation Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General's Department has advised that, due to a technical amendment of the Air Navigation Act at the time of the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority, those parts of the Air Navigation Regulations relating to air accident investigation may, if the matter was to be considered by a court, be found to be invalid. An amendment is proposed to the regulation-making power of the Air Navigation Regulations to remove the doubt about the validity of those regulations. The amendment is to be backdated to 1 July 1988, the date from which it appears that the regulations could be invalid. There have been no prosecutions for breaches of the relevant provisions of the Air Navigation Regulations between 1 July 1988 and the present time. By virtue of subclause 4(2) of the Bill, any conduct engaged in during that time will not be an offence under the relevant parts of the Air Navigation Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952</PARA>
<PARA>Aircraft landing charges levied by the Department of Transport and Communications for the use of aerodromes financially supported by the Commonwealth are collected by the Civil Aviation Authority, in conjunction with the collection of the Authority's charges. This arrangement provides significant economies, and is convenient for aircraft operators as only one account is received for the two organisations. The economies of the current charging arrangements can only be maintained if common provisions apply to both sets of charges. The Civil Aviation Act allows for some changes in the method of calculating the penalties applying to operators who do not pay their accounts by the due date whereas the Air Navigation (Charges) Act does not. The proposed amendment of the Air Navigation (Charges) Act will align it more closely with the Civil Aviation Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Broadcasting Act 1942</PARA>
<PARA>Part 4 of the Bill amends the Broadcasting Act to enable the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health to delegate the power under the Act to approve the text of medicine advertisements to the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>A Public Service Board Review of Drug Evaluation Procedures which reported in 1987 recommended, among other things, that self-regulation of advertising of therapeutic goods occur for a two-year trial period. The Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia has agreed to participate in approving the text of advertisements for medicines and has set in place administrative arrangements for assessing the advertisements. It is intended that the Department of Community Services and Health will monitor the arrangements to ensure that they are meeting the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will also include a definition of the term `medicine' in the Act to clarify what types of products require approval for their advertisements. The new definition will make it easier to determine whether advertisements for products such as ointments, lotions, eye drops, throat lozenges, suppositories and nasal sprays require approval. </PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA>Part 5 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Civil Aviation Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 12 amends the definition of `aircraft' for the purpose of the provisions dealing with charges and statutory liens. Currently, the definition requires that the kinds of machines, craft or objects which come within the scope of the definition be prescribed by regulation. As there is no need to limit the kinds of aircraft which would otherwise come within the scope of the definition, clause 12 removes the reference to prescribing the kinds to be covered by the definition. </PARA>
<PARA>Until recently, no action had been taken to prescribe kinds of machines, craft or objects for purposes of the definition. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that, as a result, the Civil Aviation Authority did not have power to impose statutory liens. Therefore, the Bill provides that clause 12 be deemed to commenced on the commencement of the Civil Aviation Act. This does not impose any new liability retrospectively; rather, it is intended to ensure that liabilities that have already been incurred are not evaded because of a technical defect in the law. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 16 provides that regulations made under the Civil Aviation Act may require that, in circumstances specified in the regulations, a statement concerning the contents of air cargo be given by the consignor. This clause fixes a maximum penalty of $3,000 for the carriage of cargo when a statement is required but none has been made. It also fixes a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for knowingly or recklessly making a false or misleading statement. </PARA>
<PARA>These requirements are to replace a provision included in the Civil Aviation Amendment Act 1990, which is to commence on 24 November 1990. That provision would require that all items of air cargo be accompanied by a declaration of contents. Following representations from the aviation industry to the Civil Aviation Authority, the Authority requested the amendment to accommodate circumstances in which it may not be practical or desirable for cargo to be accompanied by a declaration of contents. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 19 provides for regulations to be made under the Civil Aviation Act to enable persons who are alleged to have contravened a specified provision of the Civil Aviation Regulations to pay an on-the-spot fine as an alternative to prosecution. The maximum penalty would be set at one-fifth of the maximum penalty on prosecution of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>It is intended that, on payment of an on-the-spot fine, there would be no determination of liability and no conviction would be recorded. All monies paid to the Civil Aviation Authority under this system would be paid by the Authority into consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a system would enable the Civil Aviation Authority to utilise its resources more effectively in ensuring that its safety standards for aviation are met. At present, the only way of penalising a breach of the regulations is to prosecute. As this is often expensive and time consuming, there is a disincentive to prosecute minor breaches. Also, in the case of minor breaches, the prosecution process may be unduly onerous on the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA>The aviation industry will not be disadvantaged by this proposal as any person alleged to have contravened the regulations would retain the right to proceed to prosecution through the courts, rather than pay an on-the-spot fine. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments relating to environmental protection</PARA>
<PARA>On 11 September this year, the Government tabled its response to the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise (HORSCAN). As part of its response, the Government indicated that it intended to amend the legislation for the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation to require them to take account of the environmental effects of aircraft operations. This will enable them to take ameliorative measures as necessary, and to ensure the cost is borne by the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Civil Aviation Act and to the Federal Airports Corporation Act included in this Bill will extend the functions of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation to include carrying out activities to protect the environment from the effects of aircraft operations. These amendments form part of the Government's undertaking to HORSCAN, and are in line with the Government's commitment to the community to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation are being consulted on the issue of recovering the costs of carrying out environmental protection activities. At this stage, it is intended that cost recovery legislation, based on the principle of polluter pays, be introduced in the 1991 Autumn Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation Act 1912</PARA>
<PARA>The Navigation Act is to be amended to discourage the abuse of alcohol and other drugs by seafarers on board ship. The proposed amendment provides that if a seafarer is under the influence of alcohol or another drug to the extent of affecting the performance of his or her duty, a prison sentence of up to one year may be imposed. If the impairment in the seafarer's capacity results in death of, or injury to, another person or loss of, or damage to, the ship or its cargo, a prison sentence of up to two years may be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Navigation Act is also to be amended as a result of a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amendment will remove doubt about the validity of regulations under which the Marine Council exercises its functions, to ensure that unsuitable persons do not serve in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Telecommunications Act empower the Minister to give written directions to AUSTEL regarding the variation and cancellation, in addition to the issuing, of customer equipment permits and cabling licences. They also create an offence where a person fails to comply with a written notice from AUSTEL to disconnect customer equipment for which there is no permit. Where such an offence occurs and results in damage to the network and/or loss to a carrier, that carrier will be able to apply to the Federal Court for relief. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments also make it mandatory for a person selling customer equipment for which there is no permit in force to notify the customer of the fact in the form prescribed by the regulations. This means in effect that it will be obvious to consumers whether the telephones and other telecommunications equipment they are buying have an AUSTEL permit for connection to the public network or not. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the amended Act, AUSTEL will be able to wholly or partly waive application fees payable under the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Act. It is intended that AUSTEL will use this power mainly to waive fees for the connection of specially designed equipment for disabled persons, and in the case of registered charities and benevolent institutions. The amendments also exempt AUSTEL from Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes. This is in line with the practice for other similar Commonwealth statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>As well as the above amendments, the Bill will also make minor amendments to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, and the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to facilitate the administration of those Acts. The Schedule to the Bill will correct some very minor drafting errors that have occurred in some other Acts.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed by the Bill will have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would give effect to the wide-ranging data-matching measures announced in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The agencies involved in this exercise are the Departments of Social Security, Veterans' Affairs, Community Services and Health, Employment Education and Training, and the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA>At present there are two major areas of potential abuse of the assistance and taxation systems. These arise when people provide inconsistent information on their income and family structure to two different government agencies. It is possible, for example, for a person receiving family allowance to fail to inform the Department of Employment, Education and Training and thereby receive AUSTUDY in respect of the same child, although the payment of one of those payments should preclude payment of the other. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, a person may be evading a tax liability by failing to disclose income to the Taxation Office, although information on that income may be held in another government agency's data base. </PARA>
<PARA>We expect that by matching data it will be possible to detect where a person has provided inconsistent information to one or more agencies and is thereby receiving incorrect payments. </PARA>
<PARA>The ability to cross-check data in this way builds on provisions in the social security legislation introduced earlier this session requiring claimants for or recipients of pensions and other benefits to provide their tax file numbers to the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA>The advantages of matching data on income, family structure and tax file numbers are enormous. This facility will virtually eliminate a major cause of social security and taxation fraud. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to emphasise that privacy considerations have been a primary concern when drafting this legislation. Data would be transferred physically-not by online computer connection. The program would therefore not create a new data base made up of the individual agency data bases. Furthermore, time limits would be imposed on the completion of any data-matching exercise and on any action to be taken arising from discrepancies disclosed by the exercise. At the end of three months all material produced in the data-matching program would have to have been followed up by the agencies or it would be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA>An obligation of confidentiality would be placed on all staff dealing with the information. </PARA>
<PARA>Set out in the Schedule to the Bill are the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines for the conduct of the data-matching authorised by the Bill. These are designed to ensure that there is appropriate and proper protection for individual privacy in the conduct of such data-matching. </PARA>
<PARA>These guidelines have been prepared in consultation with, and have been approved by, the Privacy Commissioner. They have been specifically developed for this particular form of data-matching. The Government proposes to develop data-matching guidelines of general application following a period of public consultation and comment which has already been started by the Privacy Commissioner. It is proposed that these general guidelines would be enacted as a schedule to the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The present guidelines contained in this Bill are not necessarily indicative of the form and content of the proposed general guidelines. However, when such general guidelines are enacted under the Privacy Act, the Bill provides that they will replace the interim guidelines now set out in the Schedule, thus ensuring that there is consistency in approach across all areas and that the standards applicable in this area are no less protective of individual privacy than those which will be generally applicable. If the general guidelines are seen as less protective the legislation to introduce these guidelines would provide that the present guidelines be retained for the purpose of the data-matching activity authorised by this Bill. The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on these guidelines and agrees with this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA>There would also be a restriction on the frequency with which data-matching can be carried out-the Bill specifies a maximum of nine occasions in one year.</PARA>

<PARA>WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 and the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964. These amendments, together with amendments to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos. 1-5) 1964 which I will introduce shortly will put into effect the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation's Business Plan 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's request to the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) for a Business Plan arose from decisions on the AWC borrowing limit which Government took in September this year. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision to remove the $2.5 billion ceiling on the AWC's borrowings, was conditional upon the AWC presenting a comprehensive Business Plan to Government. This Plan was to provide details on how the AWC proposed to manage its potential financial exposure for the remainder of the 1990-91 wool selling season. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision to lift the borrowings ceiling was also conditional upon the AWC presenting a Strategic Plan to Government. The Strategic Plan is to outline strategies during the next three years for the financial management of the AWC and the associated financial risks of the proposed strategies for wool growers. This Plan is to be presented by 31 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The main objectives of the Business Plan are</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to contain AWC borrowing requirements</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to hold grower equity in the Market Support Fund at 50% or more</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to reduce wool production and increase trade clearances so that the AWC's stockpile can decrease as soon as possible</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to implement strategies that are flexible, achieve the financial objectives of the Plan, but which minimise as far as possible any adverse effect on grower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Business Plan detailed recommendations to address those objectives and was presented to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on 1 October 1990. The broad thrust of the Plan has been accepted by Government and has received the broad endorsement of the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The minister announced the Government decisions on the Plan on 8 October, having previously announced an increase in the maximum rate of wool tax to 30% with an operative rate of 25% taking effect on 4 October. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the scope of the legislative changes primarily relate to:</PARA>
<PARA>* the implementation of the increased rate of wool tax;</PARA>
<PARA>* making provision for the possible introduction of a wool surcharge tax;</PARA>
<PARA>* the exemption of carpet wools from the wool tax and provisions of the reserve price scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA>* making provision for the AWC to be able to use its funds on sheep disposal schemes;</PARA>
<PARA>* support for growers disadvantaged by recent flooding. </PARA>
<PARA>I will deal with each of these areas in turn. </PARA>
<PARA>IMPLEMENTATION OF WOOL TAX</PARA>
<PARA>The first aspect to the proposed legislative amendments is to increase the rate of tax on the sale value of wool. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, you will be aware that the rate of wool tax has been increased from 8% to 18% from 1 July 1990. This rate was then further revised to 25% from 4 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The increase to 25% was brought into effect quickly because speculation in the market about the prospect of an increase in the tax was adding to the pressure on the market and Reserve Price Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The increased rate of tax demonstrates the industry's commitment to the Reserve Price Scheme and extends the capacity of the Market Support Fund to support the purchase, storage and handling of wool by the AWC. It will also send a message to growers about the profitability of wool production. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the higher rate of tax taking effect during a financial year the amendments also provide for the apportionment of the tax between the Market Support, R and D, and promotion components of the tax to be varied during the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the present restriction of refund periods to whole financial years is to be lifted to provide additional flexibility to declare any specified period as a refund period. </PARA>
<PARA>PROVISION FOR WOOL SURCHARGE TAX</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to increased rates of wool tax, this Bill provides for the implementation of a separate wool tax surcharge up to a maximum rate of 20%. At this stage it is planned that decisions on whether to apply the surcharge, and at what rate, will be made in the context of the outlook for the 1991/92 season. </PARA>
<PARA>The operative rate of the surcharge will be set by regulation after considering the recommendations of the AWC. </PARA>
<PARA>The surcharge, if imposed, will be revolved to growers after a period which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will determine in consultation with the AWC and industry representatives. To that extent, the surcharge tax is different to the basic wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The imposition of the surcharge will reduce the AWC's level of borrowings, and will provide a disincentive to produce wool. </PARA>
<PARA>EXEMPTION FOR CARPET WOOLS FROM RPS AND WOOL TAX</PARA>
<PARA>The third aspect included in this package is the exclusion of wools of 32.0 microns and coarser from the market support component of the wool tax and from the Reserve Price Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>These wools can be referred to as `carpet wools' because they are mainly used in the manufacture of carpets. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision to take this step is a variation of a recommendation from the Business Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government took the decision on carpet wools for several reasons. Australian carpet wools were facing severe competition as a result of importation of carpet wools at prices below the reserve price. </PARA>
<PARA>This pressure, combined with the higher tax rate meant that many carpet wool producers and the carpet wool cooperatives were becoming unviable. The Government found it could no longer accept a situation where carpet wool producers could be forced out of business as a result of corrective action to maintain the viability of the Reserve Price Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The carpet wool industry only produces about 1% of the Australian clip. It is not now, nor likely to be, a major supplier of carpet wool types, consequently we do not set the world price for such wools. </PARA>
<PARA>It should also be mentioned that our carpet wool is processed in Australia and some carpet is exported. The decision therefore complies with the Government's broader policy on domestic processing and value adding. </PARA>
<PARA>I should note that several Senators have written to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in support of the carpet wool industry's case. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, although carpet wools are no longer eligible to receive reserve price support they will continue to be included in other functions of the AWC. Carpet wools will remain subject to the R and D and promotion components of the wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>SHEEP DISPOSAL SCHEMES</PARA>
<PARA>This aspect of the Bill provides for the AWC to use its Market Support Fund for sheep disposal schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Sheep numbers in Australia are at record levels due to a combination of good seasons, high prices for wool, and the relative profitability of wool compared to wheat and beef. The Australian sheep flock is not expected to decline significantly this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, trade clearances of wool are forecast to rise only modestly from the 1989-90 season. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore the recommendation put forward in the AWC's Business Plan to implement schemes for the disposal of sheep in an humane and orderly manner has been accepted by Government in an effort to reduce sheep numbers and the supply of wool. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to assure the Members of the House that disposal schemes will be considered with care. Animal welfare considerations will be foremost and funds will only be available for quick and humane methods of disposal. </PARA>
<PARA>The possibility of an adverse impact on the mutton market is recognised and care will be taken to ensure that as far as possible the mutton processing sector has access to those sheep it requires. </PARA>
<PARA>The level of expenditure in a financial year from the Market Support Fund will require the approval of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA>PRICE SUPPORT FOR FLOOD WOOLS</PARA>
<PARA>Another aspect covered in the Bills relates to support for landholders whose marketing of wool was delayed due to flooding in New South Wales and Queensland in April/May this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Many landholders who experienced flooding were not able to either shear their sheep or deliver their clip for sale at auction prior to 30 June as they would normally have expected. As a result of this delay, their clip was subject to the lower reserve price as well as the increased rate of wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>In an effort to maintain equity among wool producers, and in response to a request from industry, Government decided that provision would be made for the AWC to be able to use the Market Support Fund to make a special payment to those producers. </PARA>
<PARA>The payment is to be equivalent to the difference between the price received at auction when the wool is sold and the old 870 cents floor price. </PARA>
<PARA>OTHER ISSUES IN THE LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA>The remaining issue covered in the package concerns meetings of the AWC. </PARA>
<PARA>Current market difficulties for wool have resulted in the AWC Board meetings being held at relatively short notice with not all members being able to attend. Provision has therefore been made for the Board to meet other than in-person, for example by telephone hookup or closed circuit television. </PARA>
<PARA>DEMAND BUILDING</PARA>
<PARA>All of the measures I have mentioned so far are aimed at the supply aspects of the industry's current problems and the short term financial management by the AWC of the Reserve Price Scheme. This is because that was the primary focus of the AWC Business Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, measures to improve demand for wool are of vital importance if the current situation in the wool industry is to be reversed and its long term future to be improved. Measures being undertaken by the AWC to lift demand include:</PARA>
<PARA>* expanding targeted promotion and the co-development of new products through the International Wool Secretariat</PARA>
<PARA>* continued emphasis on aggressive marketing in the northern hemisphere</PARA>
<PARA>* extension of technical services to wool consuming/processing customers</PARA>
<PARA>* continued negotiations to encourage a recovery in the USSR and China markets</PARA>
<PARA>* consideration of credit sales from reserve price stock. </PARA>
<PARA>The Strategic Plan currently being prepared by the AWC will comprehensively address demand building initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Later this month the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will lead a trade mission to the USSR, China and elsewhere to further some of these initiatives and examine prospects for our wool trade. He will be advising our customers of measures we are taking to address the significant problems we are encountering both with supply and demand. </PARA>
<PARA>RURAL ADJUSTMENT</PARA>
<PARA>I fully appreciate there will be severe hardship for many growers. However we must not lose sight of the fact that some painful adjustments have to be made, and quickly, in the longer term interests of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I want to make it clear that the Government does recognise the enormity of the situation facing the wool industry and that adjustment assistance will be required. </PARA>
<PARA>The situation is being monitored closely and I repeat that the Government is prepared to review the supply of funds under the Rural Adjustment Scheme, including possible carry-on assistance and structural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures I have outlined are designed to boost badly needed confidence in our wool industry and in the market. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and I present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>WOOL TAX (NOS 1-5) FURTHER AMENDMENT BILLS 1990</PARA>
<PARA>These Bills will make a number of amendments to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5) 1964. </PARA>
<PARA>The maximum rate of wool tax that may be imposed under each Act is increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>An operational rate of wool tax lower than the maximum rate may be set by regulation. The existing operational rate at which wool tax is imposed is increased from 18 per cent to 25 per cent by these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>A third measure contained in the Bills is a reduction in the rate of tax on carpet wool from 18 per cent to 3.85 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes are effective from 4 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally the Bills make provision for the introduction of a wool tax surcharge. If it is necessary to impose the surcharge, the amendments provide for it to apply from a date to be prescribed by regulation and that it not exceed a rate of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>A more detailed explanation of the provisions of these Bills is also contained in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies this package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bills to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator McMullan)-by leave-agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Wool Tax (Nos 4 and 5) Further Amendment Bills 1990, the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 3) Further Amendment Bills 1990, may be taken together for their remaining stages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I have been pointing out is that the reduction by quota must come from all over Australia on an even basis and the ones that overproduce must be the ones to lose quota in the first place. As I have said, it has to be equitable between States. In New South Wales alone there are 30 million speculator sheep running around on the public stock routes of New South Wales, which I believe is a disgrace. I thought stock routes were used in drought seasons. Quotas would cause problems, as they did with the wheat industry. Those of us who were around in the wheat industry at that time remember what happened, so that is not on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not have a slaughter scheme, although the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) has one in mind, but I once again question how a slaughter scheme can be equitable. Woolgrowers are being asked, equally around Australia, to contribute 10 per cent of their clip if they go for a $400m slaughter and 2 1/2 per cent of their clip if they go for a $100m slaughter but, because of the overproduction in New South Wales, not all woolgrowers increased their flocks. Many flocks have not been increased in 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again I must give Mr Beggs a mention. He is telling people who use the term `slaughter scheme' to wash their mouths out. He said that we should be calling it a flock reduction program. A flock reduction program and a slaughter scheme mean the same thing to me. If the media round the world want to pick it up and run with it, they will. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be well aware of this situation as you are in the middle of shearing. I know that you have some pretty cheap sheep going out at present. I believe that you got about $5 net for about 60 sheep that were sent to the abattoir. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go back to a point which I made in May and which I reckoned was a salient point at the time. Our reserve price was too inflexible and it should have reflected the way the Australian dollar moved. I have a chart put out by Dr Andy Stoekel which shows just that. If we look at it in detail, we see that towards the end of July 1990, when the new sales started for this season, the Corporation was buying 35 per cent. The Australian dollar was moving in an upward trend from a previous trough in February of about US60c. By October the buying by the Corporation had reached 70 per cent of the offerings and, for one short period, the Corporation bought 82 per cent. The chart follows exactly the path of the Australian dollar. The Australian dollar is very critical in this issue. The Corporation took no notice of what we said in May. I seek leave to have the chart incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. As I have said before, the position we have arrived at is that we support the Government line and what the Corporation and the industry want. Mind you, the AWC represents only 44 per cent of the woolgrowers in Australia. It keeps telling us that it represents all the woolgrowers, but it certainly does not because only 44 per cent belong to grower bodies from which representatives are elected to the AWC. So we have arrived at the position that we are prepared to support the maximum rise of wool tax to 30 per cent, but not beyond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bell in his address earlier today told us that we should control the world's wool market because we produce 80 per cent of the world's wool. That might be true but, unfortunately, we still have the mentality that we are marketing wool as wool. The point is that wool is a fibre. Lumped together with the rest of the fibre of the world, it represents only 5 per cent of the world fibre, so there is no way we could control the fibre market on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition arrived at this position after much thought. When we questioned Mr Beggs the other day, he told us that in February we would have more sales, that there would be less production of wool by slaughter, and that from February to June we would know what the final production of 1990 would be. On being questioned about the introduction of a $100m slaughter scheme for the older sheep, he told us that we could get by on a 25 per cent wool tax. Bearing that in mind, we decided that we would support the 30 per cent and not the extra 20 per cent. If he set out to show that he needed the other 20 per cent, he certainly did not do a good job briefing us on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to believe Mr Beggs for the third and final time. I have believed him twice before and twice he has not delivered the goods. This is the last time I will believe him. D-day will be 30 June 1990. If the system is not working then and the wool is not flowing by then and a 20 per cent surcharge is needed to carry on, we will certainly not be supporting it. If that stage is reached, all the members of the AWC should resign. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that last May I still supported the reserve price scheme. Events since that time have destroyed my faith in the wool scheme, which certainly cannot be kept going, as has been proven by the Tin Council and the oil cartels around the world, which all fell over. </PARA>
<PARA> I implore the Australian Democrats to think once again and to support us on eliminating the extra 20 per cent. After all, a person has to work on a certain budget and, when he works out his budget, the bank manager does not double the limit in case it is needed. If a little more is needed a bit later on, he can talk to the bank manager and try to convince him that more is needed. I implore the Democrats not to throw away the extra 20 per cent because, if the woolgrowers are given the 20 per cent, they will use it. If they were to get hold of the 20 per cent, we would not know what sort of a mess we would finish in. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately this debate has been rushed. In the House of Representatives a Bill such as this, that could eliminate 40 per cent of $4 billion, which is about $1.6 billion, was rushed through the committee stage in seven minutes. That is unbelievable for such a large Bill. I believe that the Government should stand condemned for using the guillotine on such an important Bill. I believe that all growers around Australia should be made well aware of this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of legislation which is now before the Senate has attracted some degree of public comment. One could even say that it is fairly contentious legislation in certain ways. The main difficulty that we on this side of the chamber have with the legislation boils down to the 20 per cent surcharge. We have no difficulties with the other aspects of the Bills as they are presented to us. I cite, for example, the carpet woolgrowers, the legislation to amend anomalies suffered by flood victims, and so on. However, it is the question of the 20 per cent surcharge that I wish to address this evening, because this will be the point of contention between those of us in the Opposition and those who occupy the treasury benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal behind the Bills is that there be a maximum rate of tax of 30 per cent and that the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) should have the power, if necessary, to levy a surcharge on growers of up to 20 per cent. The surcharge is envisioned as being the next year's tax paid in advance. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that it is necessary to agree to the Corporation having the power to levy up to 30 per cent in tax if needs be. We believe that it is necessary to support the floor price mechanism, and this is part of that process. What we do not accept is the recommendation that woolgrowers throughout this country should be asked, or may be asked, to pay an additional 20 per cent surcharge on that. I speak with particular reference to the opinions of woolgrowers in my home State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very brief period that we have had available to us since these Bills were drafted, I have had the opportunity to do a survey of some 40 to 50 woolgrowers throughout all of Queensland-from the south to the north-western areas around Richmond and Hughenden-and have gauged the opinions of those woolgrowers with respect to, firstly, the tax and, secondly, the surcharge. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming majority of those woolgrowers said that the 30 per cent maximum rate of tax was acceptable and they believed it was also necessary. An overwhelming number of woolgrowers, however, rejected the suggestion that the Corporation be allowed to levy a surcharge of up to 20 per cent. The comments that those woolgrowers made to my staff who were conducting the survey were that they would not survive if the surcharge was levied; they did not have much money left over when they owe so much money to the banks; they were barely making money and had no money to replace vehicles; they could not afford a surcharge when interest rates were already too high. This, I believe, is the nub of the argument, because Mr Beggs admitted earlier on this week that the Corporation has had its borrowing limits raised and the Government guarantees are still in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing about the surcharge is that it is meant to supplement the funding of the Corporation in the short term. It is, after all, next year's tax in advance. The question is whether it should be the Corporation or individual growers that are being asked to pick up this short term funding for the Corporation. I believe that in the current situation around rural and provincial Queensland we just cannot afford to have the potential for individual woolgrowers to be asked to pay this extra surcharge. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand all of the arguments that might be raised from the other side-that 20 per cent is the maximum and it might be substantially less and it might not be called upon at all-but I also understand what the woolgrowers were telling me. They were very sceptical of the suggestion that the surcharge would not be used, or that it might be only 5 per cent or 7 per cent, because they believed that if the Corporation had the power to levy a 20 per cent surcharge, it probably would. </PARA>
<PARA> The point they made was that they as individual woolgrowers were unwilling to play dice with that very last bit of income that was left remaining to them. One woolgrower, in a very long conversation with me, said that if quotas were implemented in addition to a surcharge and a 30 per cent rate of tax, the net value of the fleece for each of the sheep that he shore would be down to $7.88 per head. He said that, with quotas cutting his clip down to 260 bales, the total value of his clip would not be enough to pay the wages and the cost of shearing. </PARA>
<PARA> This is really what it all boils down to. It boils down to what we are going to do to protect thousands of woolgrowers across this country from going bankrupt in the current economic circumstances. Whilst we accept wholeheartedly the need to maintain the floor price, and we accept wholeheartedly the fact that the floor price is absolutely essential for the survival of the industry, we on this side of the chamber do not believe that the best way to ensure the maintenance of the floor price is to put the burden upon the woolgrowers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Corporation should be asked, if necessary, to pick up the funding in the short term, and there is a very good economic reason why that is the case: individual woolgrowers themselves are already running on overdrafts-overdraft rates of something like 18 per cent at the moment. If somebody has to borrow to fund the operations of the Corporation, I am unwilling to ask woolgrowers to borrow at 18 per cent to fund the operations of the Corporation in the short term when the Corporation itself can borrow at rates of around 13 per cent. That 5 per cent is absolutely critical. That 5 per cent margin is really what the debate is about. That is why we on this side of the chamber reject the 20 per cent surcharge. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as Senator Tambling has already said, if our amendment is not accepted, we will be ultimately supporting the Bill because we accept the necessity of acting to support both the industry and the woolgrower. I take this opportunity again to appeal to the Australian Democrats, who sit to my left, and say that we look forward to the possibility of their supporting our amendment. We hope that they will see the sense in not imposing a further burden on individual woolgrowers at a time when they are unable to meet it. Something that perhaps the members on the Government benches do not understand, but something that we on this side of the House very much recognise, is that there is a rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Courtice, the member for Hinkler, can say as often as he likes that there is no rural crisis. Mr Courtice can say as often as he likes that the people who talk about a rural crisis are trying to talk down the rural economy. But the truth is that there is a crisis. The Government will not walk away from that crisis, it will not absolve itself from the responsibility of what it has done to the rural sector in this country, by pretending that the crisis does not exist. That is why we on this side of the chamber do not believe that we can accept at this point the potential to impose a 20 per cent surcharge on woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken with woolgrowers all over Queensland in the last week, from Stanthorpe to Hughenden to Richmond. I have spoken to people out west and even people in the better areas around Blackall, Longreach and so on. There is overwhelming opposition to the possibility of an additional 20 per cent being imposed upon them. It is very clear that those woolgrowers are operating on the edge. I have had people phoning me up from parts of provincial Queensland saying they have enormous difficulties; that banks want to foreclose on them; that banks will not make any further money available to them. The idea of a 20 per cent surcharge will only make the matter worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Our woolgrowers-in fact, our entire farm sector-is in so much difficulty at the moment that they cannot afford to bear any further increases in costs. This is a matter of which I have already spoken at length previously. I do not want to rehash it at great length tonight because it is obviously going to be a very late debate. We have already seen all of the things that this Government is doing to increase the costs on the farm sector at the very time that it has the least ability to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the introduction of the fee for service system and the inspection charges, both on abattoir levies and dried fruit levies, and so on. We have seen other increases in charges that the Government has imposed on the rural sector, and yet we have seen absolutely nothing done by the Government to alleviate the problems of the rural sector. We have seen absolutely nothing but a blind refusal by this Government to recognise the fact that there is a crisis at all. One of the major reasons why members on the Government benches are so reluctant to go out to the electorate and attend rural crisis rallies is because they know that the people out there who really matter-the voters; the members of the electorate-have seen through this sham; this poor series of falsities and untruths spread by people such as Mr Courtice who have only one purpose in saying what they say, and that is their own political survival. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to stand by and allow the farm sector of this country to collapse. I do not intend to stand by and allow small business throughout provincial Australia to die as a result of the Government's failed economic policies. That is why I do not support the introduction of a surcharge which could go as high as 20 per cent. One thing that the Government fails to point out, as it rushes this legislation so shamefully through the House of Representatives, is the fact that it is responsible for the current wool crisis. Whilst the Government may pat itself on the back and say that it is supporting everything the industry wants, the fact of the matter is that the Government failed to support what the industry wanted at the critical time. </PARA>
<PARA> We come back yet again to the shameful actions of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin-the man who is earning the nickname in the bush as the phantom Minister because he will not front the people-in slashing the floor price. The argument that the Government likes to perpetrate, the argument that it repeats ad infinitum, is that the floor price was unsustainable. Those facts are not borne out by the annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation, which pointed out that when the 1989-90 selling season started the indicator price was approximately 890c a kilo clean. The lowest price that the market indicator reached in all of that selling season was 879c a kilo. In fact, in April the indicator price had clawed its way back to 900c a kilo clean with between 60 and 70 per cent of the wool on offer being sold to the trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell interrupts me to point out that at some auctions as much as 80 per cent of the wool on offer was sold to the trade. What happened was that the Minister was so irresponsible, so lacking in nerve, so lacking in understanding of what the wool industry was really about, that he intervened shamefully and needlessly and slashed the floor price, cut the confidence of the trade, put some of the trade out of business-this is something that the Government does not talk about-and then tried to wash his hands of the whole affair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems we have in trying to shift wool is that some of the buyers who were there 12 months ago are not there any more. Why? They had borrowed to purchase wool at 870c a kilo, having confidence in the existence of a floor price, only to find that the floor price was cut to 700c a kilo. A combination of the losses on their trading and the fact that they lost the necessary equity in their borrowings, the equity in their stockpile, put those traders out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the reasons why there is a reduced demand in the market for wool. Some of the people who were there 12 months ago are not there now. They were put out of business, as many woolgrowers have been put out of business, by the activities of the Government that faces us at the moment. The whole crisis of confidence that has perpetuated itself until now arose from the shameful actions of Mr Kerin, the shameful actions of those people who sit opposite me with their heads down so-if I dare say it-sheepishly at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills 1990 and the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, in the same way as did Senator John Panizza, I must declare an interest in the debate because I am a woolgrower and I also had a previous interest in the industry in that I was a shearer for 17-odd years. I understand both sides of the equation. It is very important that we remember in terms of the wool industry that many people in the community who do not involve themselves in growing wool rely on the industry. That is something that must not be lost on us in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been emphasised by many speakers here tonight, the wool industry is in a serious situation. Many would believe that the industry is facing its darkest hour. I want to make it quite clear that, unless the industry acts decisively and quickly, there is worse to come. History shows that the wool industry is the most important industry in the history of this country. It is our greatest export earner and one of our greatest employers of people. It is worth noting that between 1979-80 and 1988-89-I will not quote all the figures-wool produced from $1.2 billion to $4.6 billion in export income earnings each year. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to put on record the current situation of the wool industry. At this very moment we have 4.251 million bales in the stockpile. The total cost of that stockpile is $3.7 billion. The debt of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) in terms of that is slightly more than $2 billion, the rest being grower equity in the fund from levies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what has happened in the industry. In June 1989 we had 200,000 bales in the stockpile. In June 1990 we had 3.1 million bales in the stockpile. There have been many signals to the industry and the Government in terms of what was happening. If I have a criticism-and I believe it is a valid one-of the wool industry, the Wool Council of Australia, the Wool Corporation and the Government, it is that they have been tardy and slow in reacting to the situation. If we look a little further down the track, and I think it is important that we do, we find that it is estimated that by June 1991 there will be between 5.3 million and 5.7 million bales in the stockpile. By this time next year, if nothing is done-and by that I mean selling or slaughter-to reduce supply to put it in line with demand, that stockpile will be between six million and 6.5 million bales. </PARA>
<PARA> The position is totally unsustainable and it cannot go on. The stockpile has become an albatross which unless brought under control will destroy the industry in two ways: firstly, by distortion of market prices into the future and, secondly, in that the tax required to maintain it will send producers broke. We are currently producing close to six million bales per annum. Our average sales over the past 10 years are slightly more than 4m bales. In other words, we are producing two million bales per annum more than we have been able to sell traditionally. I emphasise the point that production must equate with demand. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the solutions and the magnitude of the stockpile, one must be cognisant of stockpiles since 1970. In 1974-75 we had an upper level of 1.6 million bales in the stockpile. In 1983-84 we had 1.2 million bales in the stockpile. The situation the industry faces today is much more serious in terms of the effect of the stockpile and the cost of it than it ever was then. In fact, it is minute when we compare the figures. The current situation cannot go on. It will destroy the Corporation; it will destroy the industry; but, most importantly, it will destroy producers and the associated jobs that are part of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before us provide for an increase in the wool tax to a maximum of 30 per cent and surcharge provisions to a maximum of 20 per cent, giving the AWC power to tax to 50 per cent. In addition, the AWC will have the power to implement a disposal scheme with a target of 20 million sheep to be disposed of in a humane way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters, one which deals with the flood victims and the other with carpet wools. The coalition supports each of these two provisions. As I understand it, the provisions for quotas and the Corporation's management plan will start in July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with each of these provisions one at a time. First, the 30 per cent tax. We support that provision but I make the point that if, prior to 1 July last year, the 25 per cent wool tax, which was the industry's choice at the time, had been put in place, we would not be debating this Bill tonight. The other important aspect is that, had it been done then, growers would have been treated equitably instead of some paying 18 per cent for part of the season and others paying 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I now deal with the surcharge. The coalition does not support this. I feel very strongly about it. It is very irresponsible of the Government and the Australian Democrats to agree with the Wool Corporation about that level. No institutional bureaucracy should ever be given the power to tax to 50 per cent of gross income. If this were applied to any other sector in the economy the Government would have strikes everywhere on its hands. It is akin to giving a kid a bucket of ice cream and telling that child to eat only half of it. It is as simple as that. If the Wool Corporation gets its act into gear, 30 per cent will do the job. If it does not, the reserve price will collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> The disposal scheme is totally inadequate. It will do little to overcome the supply demand. I do not know why people want to mince words when talking about the disposal scheme or the slaughter scheme because they are one and the same thing. The first option is for the industry to sell more wool. I will deal with that later. The second best option is a commercial slaughter scheme. In looking at that, the purchase of two million bales by November next year would cost $2 billion, that is, $1.65 billion for the purchase of the wool and just over $300m for storage, handling and other costs. To effectively address our oversupply, a commercial slaughter scheme would cost between $400m and $500m. As unpalatable, abhorrent and undesirable as it is, the economics are clear. The other point about this is the impact of overstocking. One way or another over time those sheep will go. It will either be through a controlled, effective, humane process, through environmental pressures or through drought. History has proven that many times. </PARA>
<PARA> My next point is quotas. Quotas will fail. They have never succeeded in any industry that I am aware of. They certainly did not succeed in the wheat industry. It is impossible to provide equity. It is unfair to producers who have not increased production. At a meeting I was at the other day a lady clearly stated her position when she said, `We have not altered our wool production for 20 years. Why should we be penalised?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza talked about the States and production. It is impossible to ensure equity between States. There are so many variables which exist from year to year and from season to season within the States. Why should a producer whose wool that is selling be put on a quota? It is the most illogical suggestion I have heard in a long time. As I said before, quotas will fail. The other problem with quotas-that seems to be missing in this debate-is that they will provide a private stockpile. This country will have two stockpiles-one with the Corporation and another in the sheds of farmers. One must recognise the fact that we cannot stop a sheep growing wool. We can stop putting a paddock into crop or doing some other things. We can chop a tree down. But we cannot stop living sheep walking around the paddocks, fields or wherever it might be, from growing wool. </PARA>
<PARA> From day one of these proposals-I refer to the 50 per cent tax and related suggestions-we, on this side of the chamber, said that we had to be satisfied with the business plan; that we did not believe that quotas would work; that we had to sell more wool; that we had to reduce sheep numbers; and that we had to have a commercial disposal scheme. Once again I will say that quotas will not work. We can support only 30 per cent. This is the Wool Corporation's last chance to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point is what I term `ignorance in the bush'. I do not blame the farmers who live out there; I blame the Corporation, the Wool Council in particular and, to a lesser extent, the Government. If it was fitting for Mr Kerin to write to all growers last May, it was fitting for him to carry out the same exercise last month about the state of the industry. I emphasise that the real responsibility for this lies with the Wool Council. I will say a little bit more about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point is selling. We need a little bit of lateral thinking and imagination. We need some initiatives in credit sales; export insurance and what can be done in that area; barter trade; and what the industry itself can do in industry investment. I point out to the Senate that for every two years that a bale of wool sits in a stockpile it costs $300 in interest rates, storage, handling and all other costs. The industry has lost that money forever. The banks get it, the warehouses get it or somebody else gets it. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems logical to me-I put this to the representatives from the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation-that the industry should be investing that $300 in the pipeline and coming to some arrangement with the trade to get that money working. I put a lot of emphasis on that. The Corporation has been very backward with initiative and lateral thinking when addressing an issue that has been around for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention diversified or new uses for wool. I make reference to the speech made in the other place by Graeme Campbell, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I take this opportunity to congratulate him, first, for recognising what Dr Hewson said at the conference held in Tasmania the other day and, secondly, for pointing out that when he was in France just a year or two ago the wallpaper was made of wool. I am not sure whether it is called `wall wool' or `wool wall' or what. It is interesting to note that that was an initiative and something that should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I make is something that was pointed out to me at a grower meeting I was at last week. I guess everybody has heard of pink batts or ceiling insulation. What are called `wool batts' are now being sold in Perth. I had never heard of them until the other day. I have never seen them advertised but they are commercially priced to compete with the pink batts advertised on television or in newspapers. It is time that some initiative was taken in what can be done with wool. It would be good if wool products could compete with other products. Also, these wool batts are a much better product. They are fire proof, they keep a place cooler and they save energy. </PARA>
<PARA> My next point on initiative-and this is where I will be somewhat critical of the Government because I gave it an opportunity-is that on 24 August 1990, just after the problem in Iraq started, I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I suggested to him that we set up a business task force separate from our corporations and what have you of businessmen, get around the world and find out what niche markets and opportunities were available to us. In that letter I referred, if I remember correctly, particularly to wheat, wool, sheep meats, et cetera. </PARA>

<PARA> I also want to refer to some other points concerning processing and the development of industry locally. Once upon a time we did have some processing capacity in this country, but unfortunately our taxation policy and our industrial policy do not provide an incentive for these things.

<PARA> I now turn to the Wool Council. I think it is time for us to say quite clearly to the Wool Council: `It is time to lift the game. It is time to inform growers what is going on'. I will give honourable senators an example of what I mean. I attended a meeting at Calingiri last week. A grower at that meeting, quite legitimately, asked what levels of taxes would be required during this coming year for different corporate purchases-how much would it cost to purchase one million bales, two million bales, et cetera? There were three representatives from the Wool Council in attendance and not one of them could answer the question. I think that is an indictment of those people and of the Wool Council. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Senate's information, I would like to cite some figures relating to this matter. If the wool trade bought four million bales during the current selling season and the AWC bought two million, the tax required would be about 33 per cent. If the trade were to buy three million bales and the Corporation were to buy three million bales, the tax required would be about 42 per cent. That situation is just not sustainable and that is why we have adopted the position that we have on the matters I have talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter I would like to address in relation to the wool industry concerns the operations of the International Wool Secretariat (IWS). I also seek to have incorporated in Hansard a chart which shows Australia's figures and those of other contributing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The chart read as follows-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can see from the chart that Australia's contribution is 72 per cent, and the point I particularly want to make is that the non-exporting countries who grow wool and who benefit from much of the work done by the IWS contribute nothing to the work of the International Wool Secretariat. When I look at the wool production levels of these countries, particularly China, Russia and Europe, which are very large producers of wool, I find it incredible to see that some of them benefit from much of the work that is done by the International Wool Secretariat. It is time that our negotiators-and it might be required at Government level-became really involved in this matter and made sure that the beneficiaries of this organisation, not just the wool exporting countries, make a contribution to it. In fact, those particular countries ride on our back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now address the situation regarding carpet wools. I would particularly like to mention Senator Bell's comments on this matter. I respectfully inform Senator Bell that our carpet wool producers are piggybacking on the New Zealand reserve price scheme. I think it is absolutely pointless and inaccurate to suggest that, because the reserve price and the levy are not being applied to carpet wools in this country, producers have sustained their position in the market. It is quite clear, in view of our production levels and the situation that exists in New Zealand, that producers are piggybacking there. In fact, it is no different from what all the other wool exporting counties are doing to Australia. Those countries are piggybacking off our reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, our first priority is to get out there and sell the wool. I believe there has been a lack of initiative at Government and Corporation level when it comes to investigating what can be done-looking at opportunities, looking at niche markets and really getting wool into the pipeline. As I have outlined in my speech, there are many opportunities for us to maximise our performance. The pain must be minimised. It is important that growers be informed clearly of the state of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the situation in which we now find ourselves and the challenge that faces us in the form of this legislation, the time has come to put blame behind us and give all of the support we can to getting on with the job. The Wool Corporation needs support; the industry needs support; and those people who can get out there and do something need support. If we do not give that support, we will find that six, seven or eight months down the track we will be back in this chamber debating the wool industry again, but we will not be debating whether the levy will be 30 per cent, 50 per cent or 25 per cent; we will be debating whether we have a corporation, because I do not believe that the situation can be sustained. I appeal to the Government and the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is irresponsible in the absolute extreme to give an open cheque book to an institution, whether it be the Corporation or any other institution, to the extent of 50 per cent of gross income. The Corporation's figures show that in its 1991-92 scenario it is looking at using about 35 per cent of that 50 per cent. I cannot, in all honesty, justify handing that sort of financial power to an institution which is essentially run by bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I cannot emphasise strongly enough how serious the situation is in the wool industry. I believe it is on the verge of a collapse of a magnitude that we have never seen before. I believe that, unless everybody pushes very hard in the right directions and stirs up those people who have the responsibility of marketing and selling our wool and those people who have the responsibility of putting the slaughter scheme in place, the reserve price scheme will collapse and we will see the industry suffer an enormous amount of pain for many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wool industry is in a very serious and difficult situation. That has not been brought about by one factor but by a number of factors which have compounded on each other and accelerated the massive problems of the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The industry could have copped one or two knocks and ridden through with just a few minor movements, but that did not happen. It has been king hit by a number of things which have happened to it. The Chinese have withdrawn from the wool market because of international problems. They have not been able to sell their wool products on world markets. That has resulted in the loss of 80 million kilograms of wool sales. Russia's move into a free market economy took money from the centrally controlled economy; that decision removed Russia from the market and resulted in the loss of another 90 million kilograms in 1987-88 and a massive 130 million kilograms in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The collapse of the live sheep trade in the Middle East had a large effect on the overall problems. For instance, in 1983 Australia was selling 7 million sheep a year in that market. That is a total of 35 million kilograms of wool coming on the market each year. Given that those sheep had a producing life of a further four years, their sale to the Middle East would have taken 140 million kilograms of wool from the present market and would have caused a reduction in the AWC's stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had excellent seasons since 1984, resulting in the breeding up of our flock by 40 million sheep. Australia's increased production is equivalent to the total in South Africa, New Zealand and South America. As a result of the bountiful seasons, the average kilogram cut from a sheep has added a further 100 million kilograms to production and consequently to the stockpile. These things have resulted in supply overrunning sales with a consequent build-up in stocks of 4 million bales in the AWC's warehouses, rising at the rate of 80,000 bales a week. </PARA>
<PARA> We can add to that the wrong decision by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin)-and if he were honest he would say it was the wrong decision--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite on course. In May this year the Minister dropped the floor price for wool from 870c a kilogram to 700c a kilogram. That sent shock waves throughout the industry. Every sector of the industry-from growers to manufacturers to processors-felt the shock. The lowering of the wool price to 700c was done regardless of warning. All sections of the industry, including importers and manufacturers, wanted stability in the market. Everyone wanted stability in the market, except Mr Kerin, and I think Mr Kerin will rue the day he made that decision. It will haunt him until the day he dies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know a lot more about it than Senator Button does. If Senator Button wants to make a contribution, I would be interested to listen to it. After that decision was taken by the Minister, buyers stood out of the market and waited for the next reduction they believed would come. They were living only from hand to mouth, not placing decent orders. Now all the industry's worst fears have come true. The market has lost confidence in the floor. It is critical that we retain confidence in the floor and that confidence in the floor be held at 700c.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All these factors have come together and they have resulted in an extremely difficult situation for the wool industry. We all know that primary industry is cyclical but no one would have expected all these problems to hit over a five-year period, adding millions of kilograms of wool to the AWC stockpile. There is confusion, hardship and hurt out in the bush. The industry has to come to terms with its problems and work through them in a calm and rational manner. It is no good looking for scapegoats. That will not help the industry one little bit. If we do not get it right, it will not only be the woolgrowers who suffer; the repercussions will be felt right across Australia. In small country towns, regional cities and the largest capital cities people will feel the effects of the downturn in this industry. I believe-and I think Senator Button would agree-that this is one of the most serious problems facing this Parliament. Certainly it is one of the most serious problems I have faced in the eight years I have been a member of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1987-88 selling season Australia sold 784 million kilograms of wool; in 1988-89 the market met 840 million kilograms; in 1989-90 we dropped to 600 million kilograms and at present we are selling around 400 million kilograms a year, which is about half what we were doing in the 1988-89 season. It is in the national interest that we get wool flowing on to the market again. In 1988 the industry earned $6 billion for Australia in export sales. Directly and indirectly, it employs 650,000 people. On top of that, it has given great prosperity to Australia. It is the biggest industry in Australia and its marketing and research have been successful. It has been the flagship of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We did it right in 1983 when the International Wool Secretariat promoted cool wool. The world wanted our product and we were all very proud then of the Australian Wool Corporation. The world wanted our product so much that it drove demand ahead of supply. It was promoted in fashions and became the most sought after fibre for men's and women's garments. For the last 17 years sales have been increasing in both kilogram terms and value terms. We must ensure that this industry survives and we must give a strong commitment to the floor price. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is on record as saying the floor price will never be lower than it is now. The Government has agreed to back the floor price until the end of the 1992 selling season. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That must be some sort of record. Twenty four cents is the lowest figure I have heard but 18c is even worse. It would be a recipe for disaster if we ever went down that track again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the floor price was to go I do not know how we would stop pies and cartels being formed, because that is exactly what happened in the 1960s and the 1970s. Buying cartels and pies drove the price down to a point where farmers were at a subsistence level. The great wool industry was driven to its knees, returning the farmers a pittance for their sweat and toil. Supply had only to outreach demand slightly and down the market would go. If demand got ahead of supply, wool would take off. Neither the grower, the processor nor the manufacturer could know or plan for the future. It was chaos in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> In the late 1960s and early 1970s the interest rates were fairly minimal by today's standards. In those days farmers could just sit down, tighten their spending and pull in the belt a few notches, but today they cannot do that. The interest rate clock is running at around 20 per cent, and they cannot just sit out these disasters as they were able to do in the 1960s or 1970s. In those days-in the late 1960s and early 1970s-Australia escaped the worst of the wool recession because of the compensating mineral developments that poured millions of dollars into the economy, much of which went into the rural towns of Australia. We do not have that luxury in 1990. The economy is on a precipice now. Industry-and this industry in particular-has to remain viable for Australia's sake. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1970s the Australian Wool Corporation was set up. It had a rocky start and went close to running out of money in its very early years. It just got in. I would like to pay tribute to the former Leader of the National Party of Australia, Doug Anthony, who stuck to the industry then through thick and thin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza. After a very shaky start it fired, giving the wool industry a strong base to work from. It played a role in Australia's prosperity. More importantly, it took the roller-coaster effect out of the industry. It allowed the growing, the processing and the manufacturing sectors to plan, grow and develop with some certainty. It allowed the processors to know exactly what their base cost was. It put some certainty into the market and the result was that the industry was able to carve out a niche for quality and premium products. It allowed the International Wool Secretariat to promote the hallmark, the logo for the industry, as the best. When people bought a garment bearing the wool logo they knew that they were buying a top product. The promotion cost millions of dollars, but it got results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last 17 years the wool industry has been monumentally successful. During the April crisis we had wool exporters in all sections of the industry beating a path to the door of this Parliament, begging on behalf of their customers to maintain the floor price as they saw it to be necessary and absolutely essential. That was not to be the case. The floor price went from 870c to 700c and Mr Kerin copped plenty when he went overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that in 1973 the Australian wool industry was returning the grower from around 18c-as Senator Crane tells me-to 24c a kilo. Farmers were actually putting grass in the tyres of their cars because they could not afford any alternative. After the AWC was formed the floor price moved, over a 17-year period, up to 870c. Depending on who one listens to, this may have been a wrong setting. It may have encouraged over-production, but I say that the setting of 870c was not what sent the wool industry into the decline that it is facing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In April this year the AWC was buying 20 per cent of the offering and traded the remaining 80 per cent on to the market. After the decision was made to reduce the floor, the trade was purchasing 20 per cent and the Wool Corporation was buying 80 per cent. Today the Corporation bought 70 per cent of the offering. I believe that it is essential that the floor price be held at all costs. The ramifications of not holding the floor are too horrendous even to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has to set supply in line with demand. In a lot of areas that is already happening. The industry will make its own decisions on how this is done. We are seeing some variations now. Some of the farmers are using British rams to produce meat sheep for sale in the lamb trade. There are a number of farmers not joining their young ewes this year. The industry plan is to remove 15 to 20 million sheep. That will take away from the market a further 50 million kilograms. The industry, the farmers and the graziers are accepting what has to happen on the supply side. They will make the decisions that are necessary by force of economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry and the Government have to look at further ways to get the wool out of the warehouses and onto the market. I believe that at the end of this week-possibly tomorrow-the Chairman of the AWC, Mr Beggs, will accompany the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on a sales visit around the world to sell wool. I wish Mr Kerin and Mr Beggs the best of luck on their selling trip. I hope they come back with full order books. The industry will address the supply side, but the Government and the Australian Wool Council must try new, innovative ideas and methods to get the wool out of the warehouses and onto the floor of the factories. I hope that Mr Kerin has some sort of sweetener in his sample bag so he can encourage the industry in terms of extending lines of credit and get the pipeline moving again. The Australian wool industry needs some big sales to create a circuit-breaker. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWC recommendations are based on the maximum of 750 million kilograms of wool going onto the market in the 1991-92 selling season; a tax of a maximum of 40 per cent in the 1992-93 season; and a culling program of around 20 million sheep. That is nasty medicine for any industry to swallow. The Wool Council will have to get out there and explain its action plan to the growers in all States of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Corporation's predictions are that unless that course of action is followed Australian stocks will rise to 6.4 million bales by 1991-92 and the debt will rise to over $3 billion and will have to be sustained by a wool tax of up to 40 per cent. That would spell disaster and the end of the floor price scheme as we know it now. The Wool Corporation's plan to bring in quotas will have to be carefully explained, as it seems to have very little support amongst the woolgrowers. Tonight the Senate will pass the necessary legislation to allow this plan to be implemented, and some hard decisions will have to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Last week the Australian Wool Council and the Australian Wool Corporation launched their plan in Hobart. Tonight it is being debated in the Senate. I do not believe the growers have had enough time to understand what the ramifications of the plan mean to them at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are trying to work it out and, as Senator Panizza knows, anyone who has tried to get on the phone to any woolgrower in the last couple of nights knows that they have been ringing each other to try to find out how the plan will affect them, what it will do to their budget and how they will approach the bank manager. All these problems are going around and around out in the bush as if they were in a washing machine. I acknowledge the need to get the legislation in place at the earliest possible time so that the market and the growers will know just where they are in the next two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the plan, and the coalition will support the Bill ultimately, because I do not believe that the industry has any alternative other than to remove the floor and, as I said before, that is completely unacceptable. I can imagine what would happen with $3 billion worth of wool in stock and no floor price. We could go back to face exactly the situation that Senator Crane and Senator Panizza faced in 1970 with wool prices down very low. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the Corporation is buying approximately 60 per cent of the offering. Today it bought 70 per cent. But once this legislation comes down, hopefully the market will gain some confidence. It seems to me that it is imperative that the Corporation buy less than 35 per cent of the wool if the plan is to succeed. At present the Corporation is buying around 60 per cent. That will have to be reduced by half in the next six months to a net buy-in of around 35 per cent by the Corporation. Well, I wish it the best and I hope that it succeeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Quotas are raising great concerns. I have had a lot of questions directed at me about this, and I believe that this is the most unacceptable part of the plan. Many farmers remember the wheat quotas. They were before my time, but they are still causing a bad hangover in the bush. It seems to me that such quotas were universally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I was assured by Mr Beggs that there would be an appeal system set up to handle any inconsistencies regarding properties that have been in drought areas in the last 12 months, or any other contingencies. One share farmer asked me whether the quota, if it is brought in, would belong to him or to his share farmer because they both own the sheep in partnership. We will need the wisdom of Solomon to sort out these sorts of contingencies, but that was just one question that was thrown up to me. Farmers do not seem to have great faith in appeal boards. One farmer told me that he had never won an appeal in his life. </PARA>
<PARA> The business plan includes provision for a low cost slaughter program returning the grower between 90c to 180c. I do not know whether this will compensate them for the losses or cover the cost of slaughter. It would be very easy to criticise the Australian Wool Corporation plan. It will be very hard for producers to come to terms with the problem. But I do not think that criticism will get the wool industry anywhere. It is time to get behind the plan and to give it a go. It is time for all the Monday morning quarterbacks to retire from the field and let the wool industry-the growers, the exporters and manufacturers-play the game. It is time for everyone to work together to see that this great industry survives and continues to give prosperity to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the legislation that is before the Senate tonight is the Government's attempt to put forward its plan to set the wool industry on a stable course. First, let us look at what the problem is and then at how the Government proposes to fix it. There is no argument that there has been an enormous oversupply of wool in Australia, with an equally dramatic drop in demand. The oversupply has occurred for many reasons, but the two main reasons, I believe, are a succession of good seasons and secondly, the high wool prices of the past few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the reasons for the present lack of demand, we find that because of the political situation in Europe, which we all applaud, the economic upheaval is so great that the Eastern bloc countries, particularly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) are unable to enter the market through the lack of hard currency. Indeed, the USSR still owes Australia for some of its last year's sales. Again, China has had similar problems, although the political situation is in reverse. Demand in western Europe is there, but it has had a couple of unusually mild winters and, because of our uncertainty and its present stockpile, it is staying out of the market-and who would blame it? Its stocks were markedly devalued when the Government lowered the floor price of wool from 870c a kilo at which they had bought their stocks to 700c. So the Europeans are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see whether we intend to lower the price further. Of course, the Gulf crisis has added further to the uncertainties. </PARA>
<PARA> The only ray of light in the whole situation is Japan where wool stocks are running out and the Japanese will soon be forced to enter the auction because they will not let their woollen mills close. However, they too are waiting to see which way we will jump before they start buying. The message that the debate here in this Parliament is giving is that the floor price remain. To enforce this message the farmers are paying an additional levy to maintain that price. Having looked at the lack of demand, let us look at the over-supply. As I have said, we have had a succession of good seasons in many parts of Australia since the dreadful drought of 1982-83. Some States have had better seasons than others. The wool price has boomed and many farmers decided to run a few sheep for the first time in their lives, and those farms that could run sheep increased the numbers of their flocks over previous years. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote the percentage increase State by State of greasy wool production for the years 1984-85 to the estimated 1990-1991 season. I have chosen 1984-85 because that was the year that represented the average number of sheep-168.2m run over the past 10 years. New South Wales had an increase of 48 per cent; Victoria, 34 per cent; Queensland, 23 per cent; Western Australia, 28 per cent; South Australia, 15 per cent; Tasmania, 12 per cent; and Australia on average 34 per cent. So we have a 34 per cent over-production of wool, which represents about 47 million more sheep than our average. Therefore, it is pretty obvious to everyone that we have to do something about our over-production. </PARA>
<PARA> This group of Bills proposes several strategies but really fiddles around the edges. It proposes that the farmers should pay a levy that will enable the Wool Corporation to first continue the 700c floor price scheme; next, pay for a slaughter scheme; next, exempt some carpet wool growers from the levy; and finally provide assistance to those farmers affected by the recent disastrous floods in northern and central New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal just with the first two problems. As we are all aware, until July this year, farmers were paying an 8 per cent levy on their wool to maintain the 870c floor price. It then went up to 18 per cent; from 8 to 18 per cent. In October this year it rose again to 25 per cent; and, of course, by this time the floor price had dropped to 700c. The woolgrowers, according to this legislation, are now asked to increase their levy to 30 per cent, with a 20 per cent surcharge: a total of a possible 50 per cent tax on the wool they will produce. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that the floor price has dropped by just on 20 per cent and that the levy they are being asked to pay has gone from 8 per cent to a possible 50 per cent. The surcharge of 20 per cent, we have been told, will be repaid eventually. Not only that, but the Wool Corporation is now talking about a quota. I would like to know how this can be done in a just and equitable fashion. At least the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, now acknowledges that there is an enormous oversupply. He has suggested that about $100m of this new levy be spent on a slaughter scheme to cull 20 million sheep, less than half the number, as I have already pointed out, that need to be culled. If my figure were agreed to, that would bring us back to the 168 million, which is our average. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation says that the rest can be culled by a quota scheme, a scheme that covers the wool clip of farmers from November last year to November this year. How can this quota scheme be implemented with any justice? I return to the figures that I cited a few minutes ago of the State by State increases: New South Wales increased its production by 48 per cent; Victoria, 34 per cent; Queensland, 23 per cent; Western Australia, 28 per cent; South Australia, 15 per cent; and Tasmania, only 12 per cent. Why in the heck should Tasmania and South Australia pay the price for the greed of New South Wales and Victoria?</PARA>
<PARA> We are told that there will be an appeal mechanism that will allow for drought conditions and other such tragedies to be taken into consideration, but not State by State overproduction. How is it suggested that we cope with those farmers who shore their sheep early to claim the 870c while the Government vacillated, through bullying and threats, et cetera, before it forced the floor price down to 700c? Those farmers, by shearing early, added to their clip; and that is what the quota would be taken on. Because the quota will cover all lines of wool, the farmers will not be able to put up for auction all their best fleeces. So we will find that some of the finest, cleanest and highest priced wool in Australia, coming from my State, will be affected by the quotas. Why vote for this legislation if one agrees with that? We will find that some of the finest wool-wool that is in great demand and wool that Australia needs for its current account figures-will not be sold because of the quota scheme. Quotas just cannot work with any justice. Because it will be unjust, the farmers will store their own wool and we will end up with two stockpiles. </PARA>
<PARA> The only answer we can come up with is that our oversupply must be cut by a commercial slaughter levy. No-one wants to do this. There is no-one amongst those who have seen the slaughter of the sheep that has already occurred who has not suffered tremendous heartache, but there is simply no other answer. There is talk about additional marketing and about the long term needs-and there must be more effort in this regard-but something has got to be done right now while farmers are still shearing. It is when the sheep are sold off shears that farmers can be best enticed to sell their sheep at commercial rates. They have to be picked up at point of sale so that we do not have other farmers buying sheep at 20c a head and putting them on pastures that normally would be used for other less commercially viable products such as wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, can I make it just perfectly clear to those senators in this chamber who do not understand the industry just what is happening in the bush. In 1989-90, the average woolgrower in Australia, producing 21-micron wool with an average yield, received $20.47 for the wool from each sheep after he had paid all the direct costs associated with running the sheep-shearing them, selling the wool and paying the levy. Because the reserve price has been dropped to 700c a kilo and the levy increased to 25 per cent, the return to the woolgrower has gone from $20.47 per head to $11.71-a reduction of 42.8 per cent in just one year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now suggests that a 30 per cent levy with a 20 per cent surcharge should occur. If this does happen, the net return per sheep on the average will be reduced to $6.14, which equals a reduction in income of 70 per cent. That is before interest rates and wages are even considered. The Opposition will not go along with the surcharge. No-one can survive on a 70 per cent reduction in his income. </PARA>
<PARA> We will vote for an increase in the levy to 30 per cent, but not for the surcharge. An increase in the levy will mean a 48.2 per cent reduction in the income of the farmer, but we cannot go to a 70 per cent reduction. Let me assure those Labor senators opposite that there would not be one Australian Council of Trade Unions affiliated trade union member in Australia who would tolerate anything like the type of treatment the Government is attempting to hand out tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was all very quick, if we remember, in handing out money to subsidise Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd because it may have lost a few employees in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). What was the figure again? I am sure that Senator Walsh can tell us. About $30m-odd was given to Kodak, which has now made a tremendous profit. </PARA>

The reduction in income would end up being 70 per cent if that surcharge were used in full.

<PARA> I heard Senator Crane say tonight that it is like giving a bucket of ice-cream to a child and saying, `Eat only half, don't eat the lot'. How true. Once the 50 per cent tax was able to be charged, does the Government mean to say that it would not be used? If the Government is serious that it would not be used, then for heaven's sake it should not impose it. That is how the Opposition feels and that is how we will be voting. We will vote for an increase in the levy to 30 per cent which, as I have already said, means a reduction of 48 per cent in the farmers' income, but we will not go that extra 20 per cent, which would mean a 70 per cent reduction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Tax (No. 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills and the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill, which are before the Senate this evening, are vital to Australia as they relate to the survival of the wool industry as we know it at present. After all the excellent speeches given by coalition senators this evening, the Government must be convinced that the 20 per cent surcharge proposed by it is not necessary and should be omitted from the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has ridden on the sheep's back for years. Wool is Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. Ninety-nine per cent of Australian wool is Australian owned and 97 per cent of wool is exported-or at least it used to be. It is a bit hard to get it exported at the moment as it is all stored up waiting for sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool has always helped Australia pay its way. Yet today in Australia wool has become so expendable that we daily read of farmers who have to shoot their flocks because it is not even profitable to ship these worthless animals to markets. As one newspaper headline said, `$1.80 will buy one beer or 18 sheep'. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry faces a very difficult time. Production is dramatically ahead of demand and so naturally we are witnessing an ever-increasing stockpile problem. With that are rapidly increasing taxes to finance the purchase and storage of those stockpiles. How dreadful that this once great industry has been reduced to such circumstances. I ask honourable senators: How can we have had such a profitable and efficient industry so quickly destroyed in a few years? Just why are Australian woolgrowers in the current situation?</PARA>
<PARA> Back in the autumn session we debated in this chamber the Government's legislation to drop the wool floor price. The Government may have thought it was helping the industry by its action of dropping the floor price, but I say to honourable senators that all it did was help to damage the industry. The marketing scheme had been great for the wool industry and for Australia. Our sometimes first, and sometimes second, largest export earner, the wool industry, had developed and made an enormous contribution to our export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> European and Japanese wool buying interests disliked the success of our wool marketing scheme. They were not able to manipulate the market, and they have not benefited from the periodic collapse in price that was familiar prior to 1970 when the scheme was put into place. For 20 years the Australian wool industry benefited from unprecedented price stability. Yet the Government decided to intervene purely because it was unhappy that money was not going quickly enough into Treasury coffers to cover the enormous balance of payments this Government had created. </PARA>
<PARA> As I told the Senate earlier this year, nowhere had it been demonstrated-as distinct from asserted-that were the offer price for Australian wool to be lowered there would be any kind of direct and significant demand response. Further, and more importantly, it had not been shown that any such response would ensure that gross income to the industry would increase or even be maintained.  Our current growing wool stockpiles are testament to that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I told the Senate, this interference could ruin the reserve price scheme and ravage future orderly wool marketing. We have to realise that the speculation about the floor price has done market damage that may not be recoverable. The slightest doubt and lack of resolution will only give the buyers encouragement to continue their resistance to the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> Today Mr Kerin and, sadly, woolgrowers are having to adapt to some of those consequences. It is not that wool has been surpassed as a fine material. Woolgrowers are not facing a situation where a synthetic fibre has been developed that can replicate the desirable and superior characteristics of wool-not at any price, let alone a comparable one. Confirmation of this is the fact that sales and exports data for the eight months to 28 February 1990 show that several traditional large and important wool buying countries with sophisticated and high technology processing industries have substantially increased their wool imports compared with the same period last year: West Germany by 49 per cent; Italy by 9 per cent; the Netherlands by 377 per cent; the United Kingdom by 9 per cent; and Taiwan by 19 per cent. But what has happened is that, where countries have purchased significantly less wool, it has been agreed in most cases to be due to a shortage of foreign exchange currency, as in the Soviet Union, China and Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Australian Wool Corporation said in its annual report, which was tabled in the Senate only last week:</PARA>
<PARA>Demand . . . fell sharply, partly in response to high market prices in 1988 but also as major export markets in China, Russia and eastern Europe almost collapsed because of totally unpredictable economic and political changes. </PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion, therefore, must be that today we are dealing with normal economic market forces of supply, demand and price. Raw wool price has little effect on demand for wool. It did not in the late 1960s and early 1970s before the reserve price scheme began when prices fluctuated wildly. The academic economists' approach to the current wool industry battle was flawed badly. Today we have to take some action to correct those bad decisions made by the Government when it reduced the floor price of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Government thought that it would be able to get those millions of bales of wool in Australia to the markets if it reduced the price. Where are those bales? They are stored in sheds throughout Australia. It is to correct this problem that we are debating these Bills this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> To finance those growing stockpiles the growers pay a levy. Until 1 July that levy was about 8 per cent, then it rose to 18 per cent, and in October it moved to 25 per cent. According to industry projections, it could be 40 per cent from July next year. At the beginning of the  1980-90 wool selling season, 200,000 bales were in the stockpile. At the conclusion of the selling season in June of this year, 3.1 million bales were in that stockpile. The projection for this year is that there will be between 5.3 and 5.7 million bales by the end of the wool selling season in June next year. If the increase continues at the same rate, obviously it will be between 7 million and 8 million bales at the end of the next selling season. Marketing alone will not get the industry out of its problems, as the Australian Wool Corporation has finally acknowledged. Production must be dramatically reduced and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The 20 million flock reduction, together with quotas and the 20 per cent surcharge from 1 July, will not bring supply into line with demand fast enough. Therefore, as has been indicated by earlier speakers, the coalition will be unable to fully support all aspects of this legislation. A major slaughter scheme is the only realistic method of bringing supply down in the short time available to the industry, although this does not come into the legislation that we are discussing this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is the essential aspect of what we are talking about. This industry does not have the luxury of time in dealing with its problems, and to date this urgency has been missing from the measures imposed. Neither will quotas be a solution to the industry's problems. They have never worked and I believe they will not work in the wool industry. Despite what I can only call the flawed actions of the Government earlier this year to reduce the floor price, I agree with the decision of the Government to maintain the current 700c a kilogram floor price. This legislation aims to keep that 700c floor price, and I agree that this is very necessary. Without a firm floor price, the market will disappear. But I remind honourable senators that the Government should never have tampered with the floor price in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the need to increase the wool tax to 30 per cent for the market support fund and to pay for the flock reduction scheme. What I am critical of is the continuing failure of this Government and the Minister, Mr Kerin, together with the industry, to inform woolgrowers, fully and adequately, of the seriousness of the situation they were facing and are still facing. That includes the 30 per cent oversupply problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Many growers today do not yet realise that the 25 per cent wool tax they are paying already will never be returned to them. It will be eaten up in interest and storage payments. To add another 20 per cent surcharge to this would destroy too many growers; in other words, an eventual tax of 50 per cent. What a slug to have your income halved. Honourable senators would not be very happy if someone said they were to lose 50 per cent of their income-just as I do not believe that the average woolgrower wants a scheme where 50 per cent of the wool cheque is taken up in tax as well as sales quotas. </PARA>
<PARA> I also support the provision in the legislation for growers disadvantaged by recent flooding. This provision is to allow growers who were not able to deliver wool for sale before 30 June, because of the floods, to receive the higher floor price and the lower wool tax. I ask honourable senators: Is there any way that wool farmers can get at least some small amount of money for their sheep which could help them to meet costs? The Government must investigate and, if necessary, give some assistance to cut red tape, or other bureaucratic hindrances, to use and sell this commodity. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators from my own State of Queensland would have read of the plan by a Brisbane Catholic priest, Father John McKeon, to use some of those worthless flocks for the hungry and needy. That is a commendable use for what would otherwise be a destroyed commodity. But growers, of course, would not receive any payment for those sheep. In today's Australian it was reported that Queensland welfare and meat industry representatives agreed to a scheme where sheep slaughtered by farmers because of the wool industry collapse would be distributed to the needy. That is certainly better than shooting them and just burying them. It is giving some people the chance to have some good food.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I also ask that the Government help the industry out of the hole into which it has been pushed. That means not only looking at reduction in production, and an aggressive marketing scheme, but also searching out markets which we would never have contemplated in the past. I believe an instance of this could be the Philippines businessman who approached my husband's company in Brisbane advising that millions of sheep could be taken to the Philippines-live sheep and, indeed, slaughtered sheep. But we have to realise that the Philippines is a Third World country and has no foreign exchange. Of course, that would be a matter of bartering: fast patrol boats, rubber gloves and carpet underlay. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not hurt the Government to support a proposal such as this with finance. Farmers would get a bit back for the sheep that were going to be slaughtered and buried. It would be a good thing for a Third World country such as that to get a bit of help when one considers how much money the Government gives away to other countries. The Minister should help to by-pass some of these problems by at least selling some of our product overseas. I also ask that the Government look at some ways of addressing the ever decreasing income and the financial burdens that those in the wool industry are expected to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> Only yesterday I asked Senator Cook, as the Minister representing Mr Kerin in the Senate, whether the Government would, as a measure of relief to growers, be prepared to reduce the prescribed minimum value for sheep from the current value of $4 per head to the 1984 figure of $1 per head. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presumably we all know that we are debating a wool package which, among other things, increases the maximum wool tax from 20c to 30c. It includes an overriding 20 per cent surcharge and it provides support for growers disadvantaged by recent flooding. This will allow growers who are unable to deliver their wool before 30 June to receive a higher floor price. It also exempts carpet wool and provides the ability to use money from the market support fund for the sheep disposal scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wool industry is in a state of crisis. That is an expression often used in the rural industry. Perhaps it is because of the droughts, the floods and the pestilence that seem to be visited upon Australia every so often. But we really are in a dreadful state-the wool industry in particular. I suspect that the minimum price is at risk of collapsing. I do not know whether it is going to be with us next year or not. In the event that it is not, I wonder what price farmers will receive for their wool. </PARA>
<PARA> International demand is weak and I would think it is likely to remain weak for some time yet. Of course, this is due to two things: the price we have been demanding for our wool and the fact that a number of our traditional markets now have very serious economic problems. For instance, in the year 1988-89, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics purchased 18 per cent of our wool. Last year it purchased only 9 per cent. There is great hope that, with the changes in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, there is going to be a new dynamic market. My own view is that the economy in the Soviet Union is a great deal worse than has been judged. I would think it is not going to be in a position to increase its demand for Australian wool in the near future. Sales to China fell by 56 per cent between 1988-89 and 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not have thought that in the medium term we could be optimistic that there would be an improvement in China's demand. It has very real domestic problems. One of the tragedies is that the Wool Corporation perceived China's wool purchases as the norm rather than aberrations. It was inevitable when we could see what was happening to China's economy, when it broke away from the rigours of a centralised system and dallied for a time with a deregulated, decentralised system-with the provinces having much autonomy-there was a temptation for each province in an uncoordinated way to distort the economy. There was an enormous inflow of capital, a number of factories started up and inflation grew very rapidly and China had to do something about that. That has been exacerbated by recent events which were caused in part by the cut off of international funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community sales have fallen by 12 per cent over the last financial year. I would have thought that there was not a great deal of optimism to be had that it will increase its level of demand. With prices being distorted the way they are, the European Community has moved away from wool and has found substitutes. In the last 12 months demand fell by 30 per cent in Japan. While there are different views about the state of the Japanese economy, I would have thought that it is still fragile and it is unlikely that its demand will pick up. We need only to have the Gulf crisis continue to overlay that problem, and that will cause oil prices to remain high or go higher, stimulating inflation and slowing down world demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The inevitable has happened as a result of Australia's price. Current production is approximately six million bales. Sales are averaging 3.8 million bales. I understand that this year we will be lucky to sell three million bales. Production in Australia has increased by 20 per cent over the last three years. By the end of this year the Australian Wool Corporation will have five million bales in stock and next year, all being equal with no changes, there will be about six million to 6.5 million bales with the Wool Corporation presently having a debt of $2 billion and likely to be $3 billion by the middle of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a classic case of the reserve price being distorted and in turn the price signals being distorted. The price signals became so camouflaged that the reserve price bore no relationship to the real price. What started as a floor price ended up as a minimum price and as the prices went up in the short term, the minimum price dashed up after it. Had we used more efficient ways, from the outset we could have sorted out the peaks and troughs or smoothed out incomes. As we all know, we had an income equalisation deposit scheme which this Government saw fit to abolish. That would have been a much more efficient way of smoothing out the incomes of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major proposals in this legislation is to introduce a slaughter scheme. The initial scheme is to take about 15 million to 20 million sheep out of the flock. That will cost about $100m. Based on that calculation, it is intended to take out about 50 million kilograms of wool. To me that projection seems far too low. On my calculations if we return to average sales of 750 million kilograms, we need to be reducing production by about 250 million and that would require reducing the flock numbers by between 40 million and 50 million sheep. To do that we would be looking at a figure of about $400m. </PARA>
<PARA> While we can get the crackers, the old sheep and the rubbish out, we can get the first five million out pretty cheaply but after that prices are bound to go up for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that farmers, ever the optimists, will imagine that as they reduce the numbers, the demand will increase, and the price will go back up and they will be tempted to hold on to their flocks, imagining that everybody else is selling his. As they come to their quality flock, they will tend to store it. That is why quotas will not work; one ends up with two stockpiles-the official stockpile and the on-farm stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a 50 per cent levy will destroy many woolgrowers. It will cause massive bankruptcies, drive down land values and drastically reduce the equity of many farmers and their properties. That will make the banks all the more nervous as they inevitably have more foreclosures. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragedies of this situation is that it is almost unique. We have a situation of dramatically falling wool prices and dramatically falling wheat prices. What has caused part of the problem is the exchange rate. That has, of course, sapped demand. In the bad old days when we were in this situation with a fixed currency, we could just devalue and get rid of stock without having to reduce prices. But, of course, we cannot do that now. </PARA>
<PARA> The other twin evil is the high interest rate, which is very much caused by the high exchange rate. That is destroying the value of the stockpile. It has undermined the capacity of the rural sector to weather out this storm. If we look at net farm cash income, we see it will fall by 32 per cent this year. Net farm production is expected to climb by 57 per cent, which gives some idea of the state of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this legislation deals with the fundamental problem. It plays around the edges in terms of removing the numbers out of the flock that are necessary. We have a flock of 175 million, have not we?</PARA>

Just to make it clear, in case anybody is under any misapprehension, the surcharge is not a government initiative; the idea did not originate from the Government-it originated from industry.

The Opposition cannot have its cake and eat it too in these matters as it does in other economic matters which it is trying to deal with.

<PARA> Probably the rest of the world, except the National Party of Australia, has noticed that there is a Gulf crisis and that that is having some impact on the international economy. The economic circumstances in Japan have led to a change in its demand for wool. Certainly, dramatic changes in eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union have had a substantial impact which no-one could deny and the consequences of which have been profound on demand for wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems with the United Kingdom economy under the policies advocated by the Opposition in the hope that they would be introduced here have led to double digit inflation and double digit unemployment in that country, as the Opposition's policies did the last time it tried them here in Australia.

I do not mean to reduce the significance of that important part of the industry but, if we could solve that single-handedly, we would still have a rather significant wool industry problem. Everybody wants to talk about that. I am not saying that it is insignificant, but it is important that the Australian Government is represented through the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett), who is in New Zealand at the moment dealing with some significant arguments with that country about issues of subsidy of carpet wool and the consequences of the import of that wool to Australia. That is a significant part of the subsidiary problem that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the enthusiasm of the Opposition for this debate, I could, with the enthusiasm of my colleagues, go on at some greater length, but I am happy to say that it is important that this Bill be carried, and be carried promptly, so I urge its support to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, before I move to the amendment I have circulated, I have a question of you, as Chairman, with regard to the formality of the Bills we have before us. You will notice that before the listing of the short title in the preamble to the Bill it is stated, `The Parliament of Australia enacts'. This is the first occasion on which Bills coming before this Senate have used those words. In effect, they create a new formula which I believe needs explanation and creates a precedent. Previously the words that appeared on all Bills that came before the House were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>BE IT ENACTED by the Queen, and the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill then proceeds. This change has been made, very obviously, without any consultation with the Parliament. It is not a matter for government pursuit or government decision. I look to you, sir, for an explanation as to why this change has been made, who has made it, and why there has been no consultation, as there should have been as a matter of very proper form, with both this Senate and, of course, the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot answer the second and third questions. I am not quite sure that I can answer the first question, but I will give it a go. I understand that the Constitution refers to the Parliament as consisting of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives, so the Parliament, under that definition, would mean the same as the words which Senator Tambling mentioned as being in previous Bills. I cannot provide any further information. It might be an appropriate course of action for Senator Tambling to ask the Minister, but at this stage I would say that the Bills are in order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I am not disputing the order of the Bills. The main thrust of my argument was the decision to change the form without consultation with the Parliament-either the Senate or the House of Representatives-on an important matter that obviously has consequences of both precedent and authority of the Parliament. As you request, Mr Deputy President, I certainly redirect that question to the Minister and ask him whether he is able to answer any of the questions that I posed initially to you.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a fascinating issue in which to get involved. I have heard a lot of accusations in the two or three years that I have been in the Senate about things being done without consultation with the Parliament, but it is the first time that I have heard it alleged about something that has already been passed by the House of Representatives and is now being debated in this chamber. It is what one would call a secret manoeuvre-only 224 members of Parliament have seen it!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not quite sure what Senator Tambling's point is. This is what is called the world's worst kept secret-everybody has been given a copy. It is being expressed differently and the honourable senator is entitled to have a passionate view about the way it is being expressed and to debate it in the second reading stage or now, if he can find some formula here. But I do not understand the problem. The honourable senator says that this is being done without consultation. I regard it as a fairly routine and mundane matter. The honourable senator is entitled to have a view about it, but I cannot see how he can think that it is being done in any secret manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuing to raise the issue, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it was raised in the House of Representatives on 7 November by Mr Peacock with Mr Beazley. I believe that on that occasion a very unsatisfactory answer was given and recorded and, again, no explanation was given as to why a very important form and process of the Parliament has, in effect, been changed and thwarted by the Government without consultation with the Parliament. I think it is appropriate that we record our reservations and our notation that as part of the Labor Party's republican thrust it is choosing to implement Government policies in an area that is more properly the domain of the Parliament. I seek leave to move a motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment to each Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5, page 2, omit the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>I will speak very briefly to this amendment. The matter was addressed by a number of members of the Opposition during the debate. Of course, it reflects very strongly on the issue of the surcharge that is included in the Bill, to come into effect next year. We believe that this is not sustainable because taxing up to 50 per cent of woolgrowers' income is not being realistic about the woolgrowers themselves or the scheme that requires that level of tax. It is very important to note also that this matter was not able to be properly canvassed in the House of Representatives. The debate in that chamber was guillotined and the Government did not allow a proper consideration of the issues, even though the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, highlighted the matter and certainly distributed a similar amendment in that chamber. However, he was thwarted totally from being able to pursue the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the issue was raised here by a number of honourable senators today in debate, it was interesting to note that again there was no participation, other than by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) in his concluding remarks, by any Australian Labor Party senator on this most important issue. I would have thought that the issues that were raised-some of them very comprehensive issues-about a taxation measure that seeks to raise hundreds of millions of dollars would have solicited a Government response. Yet not one comment of any nature has come forward from the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow up the point that Senator Tambling has made. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, the Chairman of the Wool Corporation, Hugh Beggs, told us the other day that the Corporation can easily get through to 30 June 1991 with a 25 per cent wool tax. I was across the table from him when he said that and I questioned him on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If he can get through to 30 June 1991 with only 25 per cent and we are granting 30 per cent, can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) tell me, as an economic rationalist-he speaks that way in the chamber-why we should give nearly double that amount? After all, if an overdraft is set with a bank, the bank will not normally say, `Have twice as much just in case'. </PARA>
<PARA> If in this case the Corporation can see itself getting through to 30 June 1991 on a 25 per cent wool tax, even with the slaughter scheme-this having been assured by Mr Beggs-why can the matter not come back to the Parliament for scrutiny then and a decision made on whether it should be 30 per cent? Can Senator McMullan please address that point?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I take this opportunity to respond to Senator Panizza and to some things that were also said very briefly by Senator Tambling and in previous interjections. People were talking about the fact that there had not been any debate on the matter. I am told-I have to say that I did not listen to the debate personally-that there was a two-hour debate on this matter in the House of Representatives, as I expected. As I understand it, several Government spokesmen participated in that. Apart from that, there was the second reading speech in the House of Representatives, which was incorporated in the Senate on behalf of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact of the matter is that this is a matter of great significance, but it does not necessarily mean that it is a matter on which everybody has to get up and be as boringly repetitive as the Opposition was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Panizza has raised a question. As I am advised, there is nothing unusual about the circumstance in which legislation sets a cap or maximum for such a levy much higher than that which is about to be practically applied. That is the circumstance on this occasion. It is neither unique nor even unusual. It is being utilised by the Government on this occasion as it has been in most similar legislation in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what is happening on this occasion. The 50 per cent rate is not the rate that will apply forthwith. It is the maximum which is being set in the event that the circumstances might lead to its being required. That is not dissimilar to what has been done on previous occasions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for his reply. I fully agree that there is plenty of legislation around which sets a maximum of tax, or levy, or whatever one might like to call it. However, in this case the Government is setting a maximum and the Corporation is not charging that maximum, or at least it tells us it will not charge it. I have Mr Beggs's word for it that the Corporation will charge only 25 per cent. Neither I nor the rest of the coalition disagree with giving the Corporation a maximum of 30 per cent, but I think it is very unusual to add another 20 per cent just for the sake of it. I believe that by adding that other 20 per cent, as Senator Crane pointed out in his speech about the bucket of ice-cream, the Corporation will be given a false sense of security. To put it a better way, it will give the Corporation the idea that more will come out of the bucket if it does not stay within its 30 per cent. It will not encourage the Corporation to work within that 30 per cent target. The Government will just give the Corporation an open cheque from this day forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the Government should be able to see the light a little better than it has. Senator McMullan told the chamber that in this case it was not what the Government wanted; it was what the industry wanted. I say it is what the Australian Wool Corporation wants. As I said earlier today, the Corporation is elected by only 44 per cent of woolgrowers. That is on record, because that is the percentage of growers in Australia who belong to the industry that elects the Corporation. So that the Corporation is better representative of all the growers in this country, I think the Government should give it the extra 20 per cent. But if it wants any more after that, its requests should be brought back here in order to keep it fiscally responsible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add briefly to what Senator Panizza and Senator Tambling have said. I believe that this is really a matter of responsibility by this chamber. We should create the situation where, if things changed and additional finance were necessary, the Corporation would have to report back to this chamber in respect of what it required. We could then make an objective assessment of the situation and act in a responsible manner. When it has been spelt out very clearly in the Corporation's marketing plan and in what Mr Beggs said the other day that the Corporation's requirement for the rest of the selling season was 25 per cent tax and for the start of the next selling season was of the order of 30 per cent, I believe it is totally unrealistic that we should agree to give it 50 per cent. If the Government does that, it will take away responsible fiscal management in terms of the running of operations of the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the main purpose of this Bill is to remove an inequity based on gender which has existed in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (the Act) since its commencement on 26 January 1949. The Bill also seeks to correct three minor administrative difficulties with the operation of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will be aware that prior to 26 January 1949, people born or naturalised in Australia were British subjects and that the Act introduced the status of Australian citizen on that date. </PARA>
<PARA>The Transitional Provisions of that Act automatically conferred Australian citizenship status on 26 January 1949 upon British subjects if they were born outside Australia and New Guinea and their fathers were born in Australia or New Guinea and acquired Australian citizenship on 26 January 1949, and they had entered Australia and been allowed to stay permanently. The Act provided that those persons who had not previously entered Australia became Australian citizens automatically when they did so, providing their entry was for permanent residence. </PARA>
<PARA>Following amendments to the Act on 6 May 1966, such persons were also required to be British subjects upon entry to Australia if they entered on or after that date. The Transitional Provisions were repealed on 1 May 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Although this provision enabled a child to acquire Australian citizenship by descent through the father, there was no similar provision for Australian citizenship to be acquired by descent through an Australian mother. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will enable a person born outside Australia and New Guinea before 26 January 1949 to apply for and acquire Australian citizenship by descent through registration where the person's mother became a citizen on 26 January 1949 providing certain requirements are met. To ensure the provision corresponds with the provision to acquire Australian citizenship through a father, only a person whose mother was born in Australia or New Guinea, or who had been naturalised in Australia before 26 January 1949 will be eligible. The person also must have been present in Australia at some time before 1 May 1987, and apply for registration on an approved form. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be no application fee and upon registration being approved, evidence of citizenship will be issued free of the usual charge. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also allow the children of these applicants to be included in the registration. No age limit will apply to these persons. </PARA>
<PARA>This provision is based on descent. The concession will therefore be limited to the natural issue of the parent from whom the benefit derives. </PARA>
<PARA>Unlike the paternal concession, however, the proposed provision will not be limited to British subjects, the definition for which was repealed from the Act in 1987 to remove discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>A five year limit will apply to the lodgement of applications under this provision. </PARA>
<PARA>While the number of people covered by this provision is thought to be small, absence of it has nonetheless caused considerable and justifiable concern to those affected and it is clearly a discriminatory matter which needs to be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now move to discuss the minor administrative difficulties that the Bill seeks to remedy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Act currently requires a person who applies for registration of citizenship by descent to be registered within 18 years after the person's birth. The Bill will ensure that where an application for the registration of citizenship by descent is lodged before the person's eighteenth birthday but actual registration has not been effected prior to that date, then the person will not be denied citizenship because of administrative delay. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend section lOB of the Act to provide that registration of citizenship by descent may be effected where an application is lodged at a place of registration-usually an office of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs or an Australian mission overseas, no later than an eligible person's eighteenth birthday. This amendment will be retrospective to rectify cases where administrative oversight has resulted in unlawful registration after the eighteenth birthday of persons who applied prior to that time and who have satisfied all other requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also amends section 13 of the Act to ensure that a child who has been included in a responsible parents application, but whose name has been unintentionally omitted from the certificate of citizenship, and who is over 16 years of age, can nevertheless acquire citizenship by amendment of the responsible parent's certificate of citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 13 currently requires that the child has to be under 16 at the time the certificate of citizenship was amended. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment will overcome doubts associated with Departmental practice of remedying this situation by amending the responsible parent's certificate pursuant to section 47 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The final matter addressed by the Bill relates to the definition of an application for the purposes of the Act. To ensure that all applications lodged under the Act can be properly identified and the appropriate application fees are paid, the Bill provides that an application is not made unless it is on an approved form, accompanied by the prescribed fee and is received at an office of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs or an official representative of the Australian Government overseas designated for such a purpose. This provision is consistent with similar provisions in the recently amended Migration Act 1958. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>NORTHERN PRAWN FISHERY VOLUNTARY ADJUSTMENT SCHEME LOAN GUARANTEE AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989 the Government undertook a major review of the management of Commonwealth fisheries. This review culminated in my release of a policy statement titled `New Directions for Commonwealth Fisheries Management in the 1990s'. The policy statement placed particular emphasis on the need to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA>Fisheries resources are not overexploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment</PARA>
<PARA>Commercial fishing operations are economically efficient, using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatest net returns</PARA>
<PARA>Fishermen make an appropriate payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain, provided that new profits are generated and that the industry has the capacity to make such a payment. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy statement also emphasised that the administration of Commonwealth fisheries should be established on the most efficient and effective basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Taken together these management objectives emphasise the importance of maximising economic efficiency, but are always constrained to protect the resources. These objectives are entirely consistent with the Government's policy of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy statement identified the existence of substantial excess fishing capacity as the main factor inhibiting the attainment of these management objectives. In order to address this problem the Government gave a commitment that it would assist the fishing industry to reduce overcapacity, as long as it was convinced that this would help the fishery concerned to become more profitable. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement also indicated that this assistance would be provided on a fishery by fishery basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The northern prawn fishery is the most valuable fishery managed by the Commonwealth. For the past few years operators in the northern prawn fishery have experienced financial difficulty. This has been largely caused by considerable excess capacity in the fishing fleet and a sharp reduction in world prawn prices due to competition from farm grown prawns mainly originating from South East Asian countries. A poor Australian banana prawn catch this year has aggravated this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is general agreement by industry that there needs to be significant reduction in fishing effort to restore the fishery to profitability. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has estimated that if the capacity of the fleet was halved the profitability of the fishery would increase significantly from the current negative levels of about $40m to positive levels about $20m per year or more. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore the possibility of too much fishing effort damaging the prawn stocks is always a concern. At present the prawn stock does not appear to be in danger, but this could change relatively quickly. Only five years ago CSIRO scientists were most concerned about this and the Government with industry support implemented gear restrictions, extended seasonal closures and bans on daylight trawling to protect the stocks. </PARA>
<PARA>For these reasons it was decided it was appropriate for it to be the first fishery to be restructured. A joint government/industry task force was established and together with the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Committee a restructuring package was developed. Throughout the process the industry was widely consulted and there were a number of meetings with fishermen at the principal ports. </PARA>
<PARA>The assistance package which the Government has agreed to will build upon the Voluntary Adjustment Scheme (VAS) that was introduced in late 1985. The original scheme did succeed in reducing capacity but became increasingly expensive and was too slow in achieving the necessary level of restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA>The new package is also based on providing incentives to industry to restructure through a buy-back program, but there are important differences from the old approach. </PARA>
<PARA>The first difference is that there is a fixed target size for the fishery of 50,000 fishing units to be achieved by the beginning of the 1993 fishing season. Experience has demonstrated that for restructuring schemes to be successful a fixed target is essential. Although the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics projections indicate that the most efficient level of exploitation would be achieved with a fleet size of less than 40,000 units, the management advisory committee for the northern prawn fishery and the Government have agreed to a target of 50,000 units. If the target is not met a pro rata compulsory surrender with special provision for single boat operators will be implemented to bring the number of units down to 50,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Another major difference is that the voluntary buy-back part of the scheme will only operate for a short, sharp, three month period at the beginning of 1991. There will be a fixed price for fishing units and a compensation payment which will be paid when fishermen take their boats out of the fishery (referred to as a redundancy payment). </PARA>
<PARA>To fund the buy-back the Government will provide a guarantee for a commercial loan of up to $40.9m, to be repaid over 10 years. The Government will also provide a grant of $5m over three years from the National Fisheries Adjustment Program to assist the industry to repay the loan in the initial years while the increased profits in the fishery are building up. This Bill will amend the existing act to reflect the new loan guarantee. The loan repayments will be funded by a levy which will be collected twice yearly from the northern prawn fishermen. The Fisheries Levy (Northern Prawn Fishery) Regulations will be amended to make these collections. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments will also be made to the northern prawn fishery management plan to allow the whole package to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has made no secret of the fact that it expects industry to share some of the new profits which result from this restructuring with the wider community. However. the Government will ensure that any community return charges which it requires industry to pay do not destroy incentives. The Government's view is that where genuine new profits are made arising from the exploitation of a community resource for private gain the industry will share a portion of those profits with the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA>I would emphasise that the Government realises it is important to take account of all costs when calculating these profits to avoid creating a cost burden for the industry. The community return legislation which will give effect to this policy is an integral part of this package and will be introduced in the autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>While fishermen will not welcome the requirement to pay a community return it is fair to say that they recognise that the fishery will be considerably more profitable after the restructuring even allowing for the new payment of a community return. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the northern prawn fishing industry have been most helpful in the provision of advice during the development of this restructuring scheme and have supported the totality of the restructuring package outlined above. Many of their suggestions are embodied in these arrangements. An industry/government committee has been established to ensure a continuing high degree of consultation. With their assistance and co-operation I expect a smooth transition for this structural adjustment initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901, in addition to a consequential repeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to:</PARA>
<PARA> i) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to provide the legislative framework for the introduction of an electronic entry and cargo reporting system for exports (EXIT), and the consequential repeal of the Export Return Scheme (Clauses 15 to 23);</PARA>
<PARA> ii) the repeal of Sections 64 and 74 of the Customs Act 1901 and the introduction of new sections to provide for the advance reporting of ships and aircraft and their cargo and crew, including the electronic reporting of such information (Clause 10), and the corresponding tightening of customs control over the unshipment of imported goods, especially where no cargo report in respect of such goods has been provided, or where such report is not provided sufficiently in advance (Clause 12); and</PARA>
<PARA>iii) the saving of the prohibited imports status of dangerous goods under Item 18 of the Second Schedule of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, which was declared invalid by the Full Federal Court in the recent Owen v Turner and Jones case (Clause 49). </PARA>
<PARA>I will now refer briefly to each of those proposals:</PARA>
<PARA>i) Introduction of EXIT and Repeal of the Export Return Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>The public and private sectors have for some time been pursuing the considerable cost savings available through the use of electronic technology to improve the flow of cargo documentation and information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Customs Service is playing a crucial role in this reform through its development of a number of electronic initiatives. Exports integration or``EXIT'' is one of these initiatives, and is one of the largest Electronic Data Interchange initiatives undertaken in Australia to date. </PARA>
<PARA>The reports and clearances which the EXIT system allows to be computerised provide the basis for Customs control over Australia's exports. It is also the main source of data for the export component of the periodic balance of payments assessments. Prior to EXIT it was the Export Return Scheme which provided the principal reporting mechanism for export trade statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>Administration of the Export Return Scheme over the past 12 years has shown the Scheme to be an unsatisfactory arrangement which does not meet Australia's basic control and statistical requirements. Firstly, Customs control over high risk exports is undermined, as most exports are not reported to Customs until after cargo has left the country. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, over the past few years inadequacies have become apparent in the statistical information provided through the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>It is for these reasons that the Government has proposed the repeal of the Export Return Scheme and the introduction of the EXIT system for electronically reporting exports prior to shipment. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the economic significance of Australia's balance of payment figures, it is considered that export trade statistics should be collected on a similar basis to imports. In other words, they should be recorded on computer prior to Customs clearance. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the introduction of an electronic option under the EXIT system, exporters will not be forced to become direct participants in the new regime. Exporters may either join EXIT directly, engage the services of a registered EXIT user (a freight forwarder, Customs agent, etc.) or utilise the traditional paper based preshipment export entry scheme. To facilitate the latter process, exporters will be permitted to lodge paper entries by facsimile. </PARA>
<PARA>Close to 1,000 exporters have voluntarily joined the EXIT system since trials began and as a result in July 1990, over 65% of our export trade was reported electronically. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Customs Service and the pioneering members of industry who have participated in the development of EXIT have tackled an ambitious program aimed at taking export reporting into the 21st century. Clauses 15 to 23 of the Bill seek to provide an appropriate legislative basis for the continued operation of the EXIT system. Those clauses are explained in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the proposed new export reporting regime for the Customs Act 1901, consequential amendments are necessary to the Excise Act 1901. This will provide uniformity in the treatment of all exported goods, whether excisable or otherwise, and is effected by the proposed amendments contained in Part 3 to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>ii) Repeal of Sections 64 and 74 and the introduction of new sections</PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 10 and 12 of this Bill propose the repeal of Sections 64 and 74 of the Customs Act 1901 and the introduction of new sections to provide for the advance reporting of ships and aircraft and their cargo and crew. Clause 10 also proposes an electronic reporting option for this information in line with other initiatives of the Customs Service, and amendments to the Customs Act to provide for paperless reports and entries. This will expedite the clearance of inward cargo, and benefit the importing community and Australian consumers generally. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that the requirements for advance reporting of cargo will also tighten customs control over the unshipment of imported goods and aid in targeting risk cargo to protect the Australian community against the illegal importation of narcotics and other prohibited imports. </PARA>
<PARA>iii) Item 18 Amendments</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the amendments contained in Clause 49 of the Bill is to validate past seizures of dangerous goods, which had been seized on the basis that they were prohibited imports pursuant to Item 18 of the Second Schedule of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Item 18 was introduced into the Regulations on 14 December 1956, and prohibited the importation of:</PARA>
<PARA>``Goods which, in the opinion of the Minister, are of a dangerous character and a menace to the community''. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1956 Item 18 has been used to prevent the circulation into the general community of dangerous goods such as machine guns; land mines; flame throwers; flick knives; toys contaminated with dangerous levels of lead, heavy metals or other poisons; unsafe children's toys which do not meet Australian Safety Standards and many other dangerous goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Court of Australia has recently found that Item 18 is invalid. The basis of its decision is that Item 18 is an unauthorised delegation of the Governor-General's power in Section 50 of the Customs Act 1901 to prohibit the importation of goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The result is that goods previously understood to be prohibited imports under Item 18, and therefore able to be seized by Customs, are in fact not prohibited imports at all. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has already addressed the future control of dangerous goods by repealing Item 18 and inserting new Items into the Regulations to prohibit the importation of most former Item 18 goods. This was effected by Statutory Rule No. 324 of 11 October 1990, less than 1 month after the Full Federal Court's decision. </PARA>
<PARA>The present amendment in this Bill is intended to address the status of pre 11 October 1990 action under the Item 18 prohibition. </PARA>
<PARA>This Senate has long been careful when faced with provisions which are retrospective in effect and operate to remove citizens rights, and properly so. In this circumstance, however, the Government is of the view that the amendment is both justified and necessary. The alternative would be the possibility that Customs could be required to release into the general community the bombs, guns, unsafe toys, flick knives etc., that had been seized, in good faith in the belief that Item 18 was valid. </PARA>
<PARA>Both the necessity of this provision, and the suggested commencement date for it, have been the subject of advice from the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, a copy of which was provided as a matter of courtesy to the Opposition spokesperson for Small Business, Housing and Customs, the Member for Forrest. </PARA>
<PARA>iv) other amendments</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the amendments already outlined, the Bill also proposes three further amendments which deal with the control of narcotic goods, and the consequences of their illegal importation. The need for these amendments arises from matters identified by the Courts and the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. These amendments, which are contained in Clauses 26, 27, 30, 35, 36 and 38 of the Bill, are explained in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present its accompanying Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (PLANNING AND LAND MANAGEMENT)</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 by extending from one year to two years the period within which the National Capital Plan is to cover the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsections 57(1) and 57(2) of the Planning and Land Management Act provide that:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) When the Governor-General is satisfied that the National Capital Plan sufficiently covers the Territory, the Governor-General shall, by Proclamation, declare that the transition period ends on a day specified in the Proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) The day specified shall not be later than one year after Self-Government Day. </PARA>
<PARA> The drafting of the National Capital Plan was completed in February 1990 following a process of public consultation. However the approvals processes which include consultation with the ACT Executive on the Plan, its approval by the Minister and consideration by the Parliament could not be completed largely because of the intervention of the federal election and the application of the convention that Ministers do not take policy decisions which may commit an incoming Government. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department received advice from the Attorney-General's Department which indicated in part that. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Planning and Land Management Act shows a Parliamentary expectation that the National Capital Plan will sufficiently cover the Territory within one year after Self-Government Day (ie by 10 May 1990), the Act does not impose on anybody any duty in this regard;</PARA>
<PARA>If the National Capital Plan was not in effect until after 10 May 1990, the Governor-General could declare the end of the `transition period', under s.57 (1) of the Act, to be later than 10 May 1990, notwithstanding s.57 (2) of the Act;</PARA>
<PARA>The `transition period' would not automatically come to an end on 10 May 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> However it is possible that a court may decide that this is not the case, and the transition period has ended. Such a judgement would mean that the Australian Capital Territory has no valid planning system. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to remove any possible doubt as to the status of decisions taken in the period since the expiration of the one year period set out in the Act, that is since 10 May 1990, this Bill seeks to provide a period of two years rather than the existing one year period. </PARA>
<PARA> The draft National Capital Plan has been recently submitted to the Hon David Simmons, MP for approval and is now under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum for this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator McMullan) agreed to:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that at the end of a long sitting day there is often a reluctance for people to speak on the adjournment and that there is even greater reluctance to listen to people speak on the adjournment, but this is a matter, I believe, of some significance. I wish to take this opportunity to raise an article recently published in this month's edition of the Readers Digest entitled `Australia's Asians-are they getting a fair go?'. The article in question canvasses, if it is correct, a significant degree of racial discrimination against Australia's Asian community, a matter that I believe all honourable senators in this chamber would view very dimly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity to cite one particular case. It concerns two young school students who have recently migrated to Australia. The portion of the article reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>On their first day at a Melbourne school after arriving from Taiwan, Julius Yang, 13, and his 15-year-old sister, Li Ting, sat eating their lunch in the playground. Suddenly a stone whizzed past Li Ting's head. She looked up to see a group of seven teenagers, preparing to hurl another rock. `You chinks!' one of them yelled. `Get back where you come from!' Another stone cracked against the bench before the teenagers ran off laughing, leaving Li Ting in tears. </PARA>
<PARA>This country has had in the past a very shameful history of racism, a history that embarrasses, I believe, everybody who sits in this chamber this evening. It is a history of racism that I was hoping this country had left behind it. I certainly know that growing up in Queensland, anyway, is a lot easier for many Asian children than it was 20 years and I hope that in 20 years' time it may be easier still. Yet this particular survey by Readers Digest, a survey of Asian people in Sydney and Melbourne, found that 57 per cent of Asian people under of the age of 30 had experienced racial discrimination and 59 per cent of all male respondents in the survey had experienced racial discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of this are very clear. We must attempt to be one country, a united country, not divided by bigotry, racism or prejudice. I note the comments of Mr Will Bailey, the chief executive officer of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, who said, when interviewed by the Readers Digest:</PARA>
<PARA>To allow bigotry to alienate our export base would be economic lunacy. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe this really goes to the core of the whole issue. I am very aware of the fact that in times when there is an economic downturn racism always historically rises in this country; it rears its sinister ugly head again amongst the ill-informed, bigoted people who exist in the very cesspit of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> In an increasingly international world, a world in which we must fit into South East Asia, these bigots and racists run a very real risk of alienating this country from our trading partners. I believe that it is the same racism that is endemic in those who oppose foreign investment in this country for no other reason than that the company in question might happen to be Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean or whatever. I was hoping that, in the 20 years since I can first remember growing up in this country, Australia would have changed. If this survey is correct, Australia has changed for the worse. I hope that the results of this survey are some sort of statistical anomaly. I hope that it is some quirk of the people surveyed in Sydney and Melbourne and that it is not found elsewhere in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look to the future-to the future of one Australia, one people. The Asian population of this country, the Asian community, has played and will continue to play a very significant and proud role in this nation's future. The Asian community is already under-represented in Parliament. I think that will change over time, and it will be a change for the better. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Asian immigrants to this country are very hardworking, as are most immigrants, and they embrace this country wholeheartedly as their own. That is why they have come here. They do not see themselves first and foremost as Chinese or Vietnamese or Asian; they see themselves as Australians. They look only for acceptance in a country that they have accepted as their home. I hope that all honourable senators will support me in condemning the bigots and racists in our society and will agree that we must work for a unified Australia which will be for the better interests of all of us. </PARA>

<PARA> However, my main reason for taking part in this debate tonight arises from the fact that I saw when walking past the newsstand a headline in the Australian Financial Review. The headline has been running in most of the press, and I believe that tonight is an appropriate time to put down the story that is running in the press because it is untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> The headline to which I refer is: `Hewson's credibility hit by party revolt'. I was in the party room when that decision was taken. I can say without any doubt that Dr Hewson listened carefully to the arguments put forward by his parliamentary colleagues-not only in the National Party but also in the Liberal Party-who saw what the Government was trying to do on family allowances and how they would affect people, particularly those in the bush, and made the decision to accept the view of the party room. That is not being `rolled'; it is quite wrong even to suggest that. </PARA>
<PARA> In this building we are all representatives, whether we have a seat in the other place or are members of this Senate. We represent a constituency. We are the voice of the people in this Parliament and, as everyone in the Senate will agree, most of the action does not take place on the floor of Parliament, but in the party room. It is wrong to suggest that Dr Hewson was rolled at all. I would like to go on record as saying that, when a leader listens to his troops and then reacts to their wishes, that is not being rolled; it is just representation working in the party room. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unlike the Labor Party which factionalises its representation. Its members do deals before they go into their party room and lock those deals in place.  Honourable senators opposite would probably never understand what true representation is all about.

<PARA> Wagga Wagga (work in progress) $445,000</PARA>
<PARA> Bundaberg (work in progress) $350,000</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Forbes Street refurbishment items were done on a Certificate of Inexpediency as the work required was urgent and minimum disruption to staff working in the area was required.</PARA>
<PARA> For all the other development, public tenders were called for building work and technical facilities where the cost was in excess of $20,000. Below that cost, tenders were called in some cases and not in others.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Tenders were assessed against a written specification either by the ABC technical staff or in conjunction with external project management consultants. For major building works, a two-stage tendering process was used with the first stage producing a short list of tenderers who were then invited to participate in the full tendering process. In all such cases, the lowest tender complying was accepted.</PARA>

<PARA> How many, and what are the names of all foreign nationals who gained approval to come to Australia as pilots for Ansett and Australian Airlines in 1989; additionally, what were: (a) the dates of their original applications; (b) the dates of approval; and (c) the dates of entry into Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pilots sponsored by Ansett and Australian Airlines in 1989 entered Australia either as specialists under temporary residence policy or as employer nominees under migration policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Specialists entering for periods of up to 12 months may apply directly to any Australian office overseas and an assessment is usually made without reference to an Australian office of my Department. In my Department's records, specialist temporary resident visas are not necessarily classified by occupational category and consequently it is not possible to provide accurately the information requested by the honourable senator in relation to these visas. My Department has identified 271 pilots sponsored by Ansett and Australian Airlines who applied for visas, were approved, and entered the country as temporary residents for stays varying from less than one week up to 12 months. All these applications were received and approved and the pilots entered Australia in the second half of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> According to Departmental records 62 applications were received in 1989 (1 in October 1989, 40 in November 1989 and 21 in December 1989) from pilots sponsored by Ansett and Australian Airlines under the Employer Nomination Scheme. Visas were issued to 40 of those applicants in 1989 all of whom travelled to and entered Australia. (The number of visas issued in 1989 given in this answer corrects an earlier answer given by the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Ray, in answer to a question from Senator MacGibbon-PQ 1481. More accurate information is now to hand from overseas posts concerning applications received from and visas issued to pilots).</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also asked for the names of the pilots who gained approval to come to Australia. I believe to provide this information would be a breach of the basic right of the individuals involved to information privacy. I am therefore not prepared to answer that part of the honourable senator's question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes-the drug fenoterol hydrobromide (Berotec is the brand name) was deleted from the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits on 1 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for deletion, on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, was due to doubts about the safety of the drug for which suitable alternatives are available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). (Reports have indicated an increase in mortality with the use of fenoterol in patients with severe asthma).</PARA>
<PARA> There are a considerable number of drugs available on the PBS used in the treatment of asthma. The most closely related alternative drugs to fenoterol are salbutamol (and salbutamol sulphate) and terbutaline sulphate.</PARA>
