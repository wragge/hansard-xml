<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469,274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA>BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents the first stage of legislation to reform the operation of broadcasting regulation. It replaces a similar Bill which was introduced in the other place on 1 November 1990 but which lapsed when Parliament was dissolved. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and a package of efficiency reforms that I propose to introduce later in the current sittings represent useful interim measures to address some immediate deficiencies in the Broadcasting Act 1942. However, the Government remains fully committed to the wider reform of this Act, and work is proceeding well on the main reform package. I expect to announce the results of this later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal access to more appropriate remedies in cases where a commercial radio or television licensee does not meet the basic suitability requirements that are currently applicable to a licence. It also includes amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA> - confirm that the Minister can initiate, and the Tribunal can hold, joint inquiries into the grant of a licence for a supplementary or an independent commercial FM radio service in a regional area;</PARA>
<PARA> - allow aspirant public broadcasters to transmit sponsorship announcements when conducting test transmissions; and</PARA>
<PARA> - allow public licensees to broadcast community promotional material. </PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill, I will briefly remind Honourable Senators of the framework for reform of the Broadcasting Act laid down late last year. We are addressing seven key areas and the scope of the Review remains as outlined by the Minister on 1 November last year. </PARA>
<PARA> First, future broadcasting legislation must serve the explicit policy aim that there be no more regulation of industry than is necessary to support stated objectives. The current legislation casts a very wide and complex regulatory net. In seeking to address all aspects of broadcasting it can also extend regulation to non-broadcasting communications services, and indeed to other commercial activities. Future legislation will need to be more closely targeted. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we are examining the regulatory needs and implications of new electronic communications services and service delivery methods. Where new services are different from broadcasting, they should not be subjected to regulation aimed at broadcasting. We need a regime that encourages initiative and service development and facilitates the innovative use and development of technology. But, of course, where any particular service amounts to mainstream broadcasting, then we must ensure that it is regulated as such, regardless of whether it is ultimately delivered from radio transmitters, from satellites or by cable. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we are examining the need for reform in the broadcasting planning processes. We intend to provide a more transparent process that also provides for proper commercial and public accountability. We need a framework within which technology, and especially the radio frequency spectrum, is allocated and used efficiently and equitably. We need to avoid unnecessary second-guessing of commercial decisions or commercial outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, we are continuing to examine options for further reform in the area of ownership and control regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, we are examining reform to the processes of licence allocation, review and renewal in order to enhance efficiency and to streamline processing. We will, of course, retain arrangements for public accountability on the part of broadcasting licensees within this framework. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, we are examining possible changes to the process for setting the program standards which broadcasters are required to observe. Whatever new arrangements are adopted, the Government will maintain support for Australian content, quality children's programming and observance of community standards.</PARA>
<PARA> The final area involves the future of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as the regulatory authority in this area. Its role, function, powers and structure may require amendment to reflect changes decided on in the overall regulatory regime. It is not, however, intended to abolish the Tribunal. It is important that that body has the appropriate powers, resources and status to do its job efficiently and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> In developing options against this agenda the Government's position remains that broadcasting is more than just another industry. Its cultural role means that it has special characteristics which will continue to require government intervention to ensure that undue concentrations of ownership or control do not arise in commercial broadcasting; to ensure that commercial and programming control remains firmly in Australian hands; and to ensure community responsibility on the part of broadcasters through appropriate program standards. The Government's concern does not relate only to ensuring the efficient, equitable and responsible use of the radiofrequency spectrum. Increasingly our efforts are directed to the product or service being delivered to homes or businesses, whatever the method of transmission and delivery-be it terrestrial radiocommunication, satellite or cable. </PARA>
<PARA> These concerns present special challenges to Government in our efforts to develop a more appropriate, contemporary regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The first challenge is to ensure that public interest safeguards are provided with rigour, but in a manner which recognises that, while it has these special requirements, commercial broadcasting is also a business where its participants compete at some considerable risk for commercial returns. It is therefore important that only the minimum regulation needed to meet those objectives is imposed, so as not to unnecessarily inhibit normal commercial development. </PARA>
<PARA> The second challenge is to ensure that essential regulation of mainstream broadcasting is not unnecessarily applied to new and emerging electronic services. Differences in the nature of services provided by broadcasting, telecommunications and publishing have narrowed significantly through their use of common technology and through the development of new and complementary services. Inappropriate regulatory restriction on some electronic entertainment and information services, on educational services and potentially on pay TV, would be likely to significantly constrain their development. This in turn could deny Australian homes and businesses timely access to the technologies and to the entertainment and information services that they have the potential to provide. However when these services converge to the point where they become de facto mainstream broadcasting, broadcasting regulatory provisions should of course apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The third challenge is to recognise that, in addition to its special regulatory regime, the broadcasting industry is subject to a wide range of general business regulation. It is therefore important that interaction between the two regimes avoids conflict and provides, as far as possible, a stable and consistent environment in which the industry can operate efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the Efficiency Package to be introduced later are consistent with the objectives of the wider review. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal now with the provisions of the Bill, concentrating first on the ownership and control changes. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the Tribunal would be faced with extremely limited options if, after conducting an inquiry that it was required to hold, it were to find that a commercial licensee was no longer fit and proper, or no longer had the financial, technical or management capacity to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. It presently may only impose licence conditions or suspend, revoke or not renew the licence. If the licensee's unsuitability was due to the conduct or character of a person in a position to control the licensee company or its operations, licence conditions may not be an effective remedy. This is because the conditions may not be capable of affecting the influence of the relevant person on the licensee company. The only other remedies available-suspension, revocation or refusal to renew the licence-would put the service off the air. </PARA>
<PARA> Cessation of a service would penalise not only the licensee company, but also the viewing or listening public and other innocent shareholders and creditors. There is a need to give the Tribunal more flexible and less draconian remedies. This Bill achieves that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill allows the Tribunal, where it finds that a commercial licensee is no longer suitable to hold the licence, to issue specific directions to relevant parties and/or to impose appropriate licence conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions do not create new substantive powers for the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of licence conditions, the Bill confirms that the existing power of the Tribunal under section 85 of the Act can be used as an alternative to licence cancellation. Similarly, in the case of directions, the Bill extends the current directions power under section 92M of the Act to enable it to be used in the event of a failure by a licensee to meet basic suitability requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> In some circumstances, licence conditions or directions may still be insufficient to deal with the situation. In these cases, the amendments allow the Tribunal to order divestment of relevant interests. </PARA>
<PARA> If a relevant interest is directed to be divested, a six month deadline will apply. By then it would have been fully established by the Tribunal, if necessary through court and Administrative Appeals Tribunal avenues, that the licensee had failed to meet the suitability requirements and that divestment was the appropriate remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, the Government proposes no change to arrangements for any divestment that may be required in other circumstances, such as following a breach of ownership limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides powers for the Tribunal to impose licence conditions and to issue directions to apply pending divestment. </PARA>
<PARA> These powers will mirror the existing provisions that are available to the Tribunal pending its consideration of a share transaction. The purpose of this power is to enable the Tribunal to prevent actions that might adversely affect the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of licensing remedies provided in this Bill enables the sanctions of licence suspension or revocation to be put in a clearer perspective. These remedies are best used as an ultimate deterrent against repeated or serious breaches of the Act. This Bill will remove concern that such draconian actions could be taken by the Tribunal because it had no other real alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, I would like to refer more generally to the powers that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has long held under section 85 to impose licence conditions at any time, and, under section 92M, to issue directions pending an inquiry into an ownership transaction. In recent months, some doubt had been cast on the possible validity of the section 92M power and a possible procedural requirement may have inhibited its use in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> These doubts had led to calls for additional powers to be provided to the Tribunal. In the light of advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the Government now considers that the current section 92M powers are valid. There are no undue obstacles to the use of these powers, or to the imposition of licence conditions, in cases where those steps would by warranted. Accordingly, the Government is not proposing any amendments in this respect at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also proposes some minor adjustments and clarifications that reinforce existing policy and do not pre-empt the Government's ongoing review of broadcasting regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill places beyond doubt the power of the Tribunal to inquire concurrently into applications for grant of both commercial radio licences and supplementary licences in the same market. These amendments answer arguments that the Act may require those applications to be considered sequentially, an interpretation that could substantially delay the introduction of new, competitive radio services in non-metropolitan markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also will permit public broadcasters to transmit community promotional material. Presently, public broadcasters may transmit community information, which under recent interpretations, may not be promotional in nature. The Government considers that this is too restrictive and that public broadcasters should be able to promote actively genuine community events of interest to their listeners. </PARA>
<PARA> While the promotion of commercial sponsors will continue to be prohibited as a form of advertising, the Government is considering the implications of recent Tribunal findings (and a Federal Court decision) on these aspects, and may propose further clarifying amendments if that seems necessary. The amendment has been cast in broad terms on the basis that the Tribunal has power to make Program Standards in this area if it considers that to be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also allow public broadcasters undertaking test transmissions to broadcast sponsorship announcements as if they were licensed services. This will assist aspirant public groups to pay for the tests, and enable them to gauge the level of support likely to be available within the community. Any of the sponsorship requirements during the test would be an offence, and may also be taken into account by the Tribunal it comes to determining who should be licensed. </PARA>
<PARA> The continued growth of public broadcasting as an integral element of the Australian broadcasting system is fully appreciated by the Government and these amendments will continue to assist that growth. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that this Bill is substantially similar to one introduced last year, but not passed before Parliament was dissolved. The present Bill incorporates a number of changes arising from representations on the previous Bill. Those changes are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> - The Tribunal will now have the power to extend the period of six months allowed for divestment of interests required on suitability grounds; and</PARA>
<PARA> - provision has been made for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal over directions by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal under proposed paragraph 92M (1A) (b) or subsection 92M (1B). </PARA>
<PARA> The first change recognises that an absolute limit in which interests must be disposed of may not be appropriate in every case. However, the Government is not prepared to allow people who do not meet the suitability requirement to hold interests indefinitely. The maximum extension, therefore, is six months and the Tribunal is required to consider whether all reasonable steps have been taken to dispose of the interest before an extension can be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change does not allow appeals against protective directions by the Tribunal. These are interim measures designed to protect the licensee company and it is consistent with the current scheme of the Act that these protective directions are not subject to appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes respond to industry concerns while maintaining the role of the Tribunal to protect broadcasting services to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents a further step in the process of reform of broadcasting regulation in Australia. The efficiency measures proposed in the Bill were announced on 20 February 1990. However, I stress that they are interim measures pending the outcome of the review of broadcasting regulation currently under way. </PARA>
<PARA> The framework for that Review and its underlying philosophy were outlined in my Second Reading Speech on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes a number of improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of key areas of the Broadcasting Act 1942, particularly in respect of ownership and control of commercial broadcasting licences. The amendments are designed to:</PARA>
<PARA> a) change the share transaction approvals process to require Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) inquiry into, and approval of, only those transactions which result in the acquisition of a prescribed interest; in changes in actual control; or in possible breaches of the foreign ownership licence condition;</PARA>
<PARA> b) change the `prescribed interest' definition for television licences to exclude loan interests and to increase the threshold for shareholding interests from 5 per cent to 15 per cent, except in the case of the newspaper-television cross ownership limit which remains at 5 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> c) require licensees to notify the ABT on a quarterly basis of arrangements, other than shareholdings, which give rise to actual control of the licensee;</PARA>
<PARA> d) clarify the definition of actual control of a company;</PARA>
<PARA> e) extend the maximum licence renewal period from three to five years and allow concurrent renewal inquiries of licences where the licensees agree; and</PARA>
<PARA> f) ensure that legitimate networking arrangements do not breach relevant ownership and control limits. </PARA>
<PARA> While a necessary interim step in the process of reform, these measures in no way compromise the Government's commitment to wider reform of the Broadcasting Act. Rather, they ensure that the Act continues to be workable while the complex task of crystallising policy options to minimise special and costly regulation and deliver a system of straightforward and generally applicable rules is completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with that objective, this package addresses a number of deficiencies in the Act which give rise to unnecessary regulation. It will bring about some immediate reductions in paperwork, time and effort, and substantially reduce the ABT's current backlog of work to enable it to concentrate on issues of real public importance. The package has been developed in close consultation with all interested parties and has general support. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now discuss the measures to be covered in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Revised share transaction approval process</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The present ownership and control regime of the Act requires ABT approval for every share transaction involving the acquisition of, or increase in, a prescribed interest in a commercial licence. This scheme allows the ABT to check the suitability of new owners and to ensure that any associated change in control will not adversely affect the licensee. It also provides a means of enforcing the foreign shareholding licence condition and general ownership and control limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The process has been a major source of investor and industry complaint. Because the Act attempts to identify all persons who might conceivably exercise control, the approval process catches many persons who are in no position to exercise actual control. Furthermore, approval is required for all acquisitions of, or increases in, prescribed interest holdings, irrespective of the size of the transaction, or of its impact on control of the licensee. The process itself has a range of automatic notice and application requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> This process is widely acknowledged to be inappropriate and the Bill proposes a range of measures to streamline it. The changes are expected to reduce substantially the workload on all parties to a transaction and the ABT in three main ways:</PARA>
<PARA> - by reducing the number of transactions requiring inquiry approval and focusing ABT resources on those transactions requiring closer attention;</PARA>
<PARA> - by reducing delays and increasing certainty in the current process by establishing time limits; and</PARA>
<PARA> - by reducing reporting requirements, consistent with the ABT maintaining sufficient information to carry out its regulatory functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will mean that ABT approval will only be required in three cases. First, where a person acquires a 15 per cent prescribed interest in a licensee for the first time. Second, where the ABT considers that an increased prescribed interest results in a change in actual control of a licensee. Third, where the ABT considers that there may be a breach of the foreign ownership licence condition. As a result, it is expected that up to 90 per cent of transactions currently requiring approval would no longer have that requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Time Limits</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, for the first time, introducing time limits for various stages of the process to reduce delays and increase certainty for the ABT and affected parties. In cases where the ABT has commenced an inquiry into a share transaction it will be required to complete that inquiry within six months of its commencement, unless the Tribunal formally extends the inquiry period. The same time limits will apply also to applications for transfer of a commercial licence. Where the Tribunal extends the period, which it could do repeatedly if necessary, the extension will need to be for a fixed period and the ABT will have to give reasons in writing for the extension. If the ABT chooses not to continue an inquiry by extending the period, the transactions subject to the inquiry will be deemed to have been approved. </PARA>
<PARA>Reporting Requirements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also represents a substantial streamlining in the reporting and general paperwork associated with a transaction. This includes: the complete removal of the requirement for pre-notification of share transactions; a streamlined post-transaction notice to replace applications in most cases; and removal of procedural requirements such as statutory declarations. Generally, notice and application requirements have been reduced to a minimum compatible with the ABT being able to carry out its relevant statutory functions. The aim is to reduce routine, detailed reporting under the Act and to rely instead on the ABT's information gathering powers to supplement its information base as required. For the revised process to work optimally, co-operation from licensees will be necessary, and the Government will be monitoring the outcome of the revised procedures closely. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also be a condition of a commercial licence that the licensee report to the Tribunal each quarter if, during that quarterly period, a person gains control of the licensee company. This procedure will enable the ABT to identify and inquire into situations of changes of actual control without having to rely on the detailed share transaction reporting arrangements under the current Act. </PARA>
<PARA> These revised reporting and transaction procedures have been the subject of detailed consultation with licensees and the ABT and have received strong support as worthwhile improvements to the administration of the ownership and control provisions. During these discussions, it was suggested, however, that the broader requirements for reporting of information to the ABT should be reviewed in the light of practical experience over recent years. The Department of Transport and Communications will hold further discussions with the broadcasting industry, public interest groups and the ABT to consider areas for further reform of the reporting and information provisions. This review will link with the current inquiry by the Administrative Review Council into ABT procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Definition of Television Prescribed Interest</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The ownership and control limits in the Act apply to a person who has a `prescribed interest' in a licence (or newspaper). For commercial radio licensees and newspaper companies, this occurs when a person acquires a 15 per cent equity or voting interest in a licensee through shareholdings. For television, however, the prescribed interest level for shareholdings is 5 per cent and loan interests are regulated under a 5 per cent `financial' (aggregate shareholding and loan) interests test. </PARA>
<PARA> The television prescribed interest rules were introduced in 1965 to address concern about the potential for control or influence to be exercised through loans or small shareholdings. However, the current prescribed interest level has been ineffective in achieving the intended purpose, and often imposes an excessive regulatory burden on licensees, investors in licensee companies and the ABT. </PARA>
<PARA> Few, if any, share and loan transactions involving prescribed interests between 5 per cent and 15 per cent confer actual control. More importantly, there are consequences for legitimate business investment. For example, it is common for investors to acquire (indirectly and unintentionally) a 5 per cent interest in a television licensee through the tracing and aggregation of unrelated shareholding interests. The ownership and control limits then apply, restricting their further investment in companies that may hold similar deemed interests in other television licences. The potential for acquiring a prescribed interest through loans has similar consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, therefore, proposes to raise the prescribed interest threshold for a television licence from 5 per cent to 15 per cent, except in respect of the television-newspaper cross media limit. This recognises legitimate concerns that increasing the 5 per cent threshold could weaken the effectiveness of this cross media limit by allowing strategic newspaper investments in television licensees of up to 15 per cent (the television radio limit is already set at 15 per cent). </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, this Government introduced strict limits on cross media holdings by radio and television licensee companies. Those provisions ensure diversification in the ownership in any one area of radio or television services and local newspapers. The Government does not wish to change the application of these rules through alterations in the level of interests allowable in individual licensee companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with other cross media limits, a person already having a prescribed interest in a newspaper will continue to be required to notify the Tribunal when acquiring a 5 per cent or greater interest in a television licensee. That person would then have a six month period of grace from the date of the transaction in which to divest excess interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the matter of television loan interests which are subject to regulation under the current provisions of the Act. The Bill proposes deletion of the current 5 per cent financial interest component of the television prescribed interest test and of the registered lender provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience has shown that it is unnecessary to regulate all direct and indirect loan interests. In the vast majority of cases, loan interests do not confer real control of licensees.These provisions have been a particular source of justified complaint from broadcasting licensees and financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Where substantial loan interests do confer a real capacity for control, those interests can be investigated by the ABT case by case. The special quarterly reporting arrangements to which I referred earlier will bring to the notice of the ABT any situation of actual control arising through loan arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Definition of `Control'</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The primary concern of the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting Act is to identify situations where there is an actual capacity to exercise control of a commercial licence, either through control of the licensee company or through control over programming or other broadcasting operations. It is a matter for the Tribunal in administering the Act to determine whether actual control can be exercised in the particular circumstances of each case. </PARA>
<PARA> Related provisions in this Bill require the licensees to report actual changes in corporate control and the ABT to determine whether particular share transactions have resulted in an actual change in control of the licensee company. It is therefore considered desirable for the Act to give clear guidance to the ABT and to licensees on the meaning of the term `control of a company'. The definition of `control of a company' to be inserted in the Act is based on, and consistent with, the Federal Court ruling in Re News Corporation Ltd on which the ABT has relied in its recent decisions. The definition covers situations where a person is in a position to exercise direct or indirect `control', whether through the power of direction or restraint, over any substantial issues affecting the management or affairs of a company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also make it clear that, for the purposes of the administration of the Act, two or more persons will each be taken to be in a position to exercise control of a licensee (or newspaper) if an agreement, arrangement or understanding puts them in a position to jointly exercise control of a licence. This `associate' provision is intended to further assist the ABT and all parties to arrangements in setting out clearly situations in which actual control will arise. Control would not exist, for example, merely because two persons at a shareholders' meeting agreed to vote together on a single issue affecting the management or affairs of a company (such as a decision whether the company should take over another company). If, however, two persons agreed to act regularly together for the purpose of securing control, the new associate provision would apply to deem each to be in a position to exercise control. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing amendments in relation to actual control of a licensee company, I should also emphasise the importance of related provisions already in the Broadcasting Act which attribute control of a licence to any person in a position to control the selection or provision of programs to be broadcast by a licensee. The existing provisions in the Act, in particular, prohibit any foreign person or company from entering into transactions or other arrangements which confer control over the programs to be broadcast by a commercial licensee. While it is a matter for the Tribunal to determine whether particular arrangements confer control, potential foreign investors in licensee companies need to have regard not only to the individual and aggregate limits on foreign shareholding interests, but also the prohibition on foreign programming control. </PARA>
<PARA>Periods of Grace</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The current Act allows a period of grace in which purchasers or third parties to a transaction may dispose of interests which contravene the ownership and control limits. There has been criticism that, in conjunction with the system for approval of share transactions, the operation of these period of grace provisions has allowed companies to hold excess interests for indefinite periods. A practical effect of the streamlined transaction approval system which I have outlined will be to reduce the length of time during which contraventions of the limits can be allowed under a period of grace. The Bill also makes consistent the requirement that applications for extension of time must be made within the initial six month period. This remedies a previous anomaly in relation to cross-media limits which allowed repeated applications for extensions of the period of grace. The Bill also makes it clear that all reasonable efforts must be made to dispose of excess interests as quickly as possible before any extension of the six months period can be considered by the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Licensing and Renewal Inquiry Procedures</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There are currently 273 broadcasting licences on issue which, after the initial period of grant, are subject to renewal every three years. This process is so demanding that the ABT has not been able to cope with the current workload. It has deferred renewals for periods of between 18 months and two years for up to 40 per cent of the licences due for renewal in the 1989/90 period. </PARA>
<PARA> In practice, the experience of the ABT has shown that it is unnecessary to review the performance of licensees every three years and that an extension to five years would be sensible in terms of practical evaluation and use of resources. Such an extension would continue to allow public interest groups and concerned citizens adequate opportunity to participate in the evaluation process. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions do not prevent the ABT from examining any issue of importance which may be raised with it during the term of a licence. Similarly, the ABT is still able to renew a licence for a shorter period if it believes this desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will allow the ABT to shorten licence periods, with the agreement of the licensees concerned, to synchronise renewal inquiries for licences. This mechanism will enable the ABT to consider issues common to all related licences as part of a single inquiry. Normally, this will apply to commonly owned licences or licences that have substantial programming or operations in common. Issues specific to a particular licensee would still be considered individually but in the context of a common inquiry process. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedure will save licensees time, effort and expense, and will enable the ABT to streamline its licence renewals by avoiding repeated inquiries into issues common to a number of other licences. Consent of affected licensees will be required before a joint renewal inquiry can be held for licences that have common ownership or programming operations. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemptions for Networking Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Recent legal advice indicates that arrangements between licensees who are affiliated to networks for the purposes of distribution of programming could breach the 60 per cent population reach television limit or associated cross media limits. Clearly, such arrangements between licensees are encouraged to make possible economies of scale in the production of programs and to support the Government's policy for equalisation of television services in regional areas of Eastern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, to ensure that these legitimate affiliation agreements proceed, the Bill provides that parties to a written networking agreement, lodged with the ABT for this purpose, will be exempted from operation of relevant ownership and control limits to the extent that direct or indirect control would arise from the terms of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the means of resolving this issue, it has also been necessary to look at the effect of networking arrangements on the provisions of the Act relating to participation in the benefits of a licence to which programs are supplied. The amendments proposed in the Bill ensure that these provisions are similarly not compromised. A minor amendment to the provisions on participation in the benefits of a licence is included to exempt agreements under which a percentage of a licensee's revenue is payable to another party under programming rights agreements for performing artists or other copyright purposes.During consideration of these amendments, it was suggested that, in the context of revised provisions dealing with control of a licence, provisions in the Act relating to participation in the benefits of a licence may no longer be required. This issue will be considered further in the more fundamental review of the Broadcasting Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of measures has been the subject of detailed consultation with representatives of licensees, public interest groups and the ABT. I express my appreciation for the constructive assistance provided by all these parties. Should any interested persons or industry representatives wish to have further discussion on the effect of the detailed provisions of the Bill, I will be pleased to facilitate those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated at the outset that the package of measures is an interim step in the overall process of comprehensive reform of broadcasting legislation by this Government. Further proposals will be brought forward when the results of the broader review have been exposed and decisions taken by the Government later this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Patents Bill 1990 has had a very long history. Industrial property rights and ownerships have been recognised for many years. This Bill replaces the Patents Act 1952. In 1979 the then Minister for Productivity initiated an inquiry into industrial property by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee. The Committee, representing the Australian Law Society, the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia and the Patent Office, reported to the Government in 1984. On 28 November 1986 the Government made its response and in 1989 the then Minister for Science and Technology brought down legislation in the House of Representatives. However, as we know, Parliament was prorogued, the Minister changed, and we now have a new 1990 Bill before us for debate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By any standards, Australians have a very proud record of inventiveness, novelty and innovation and, per capita, are amongst the world leaders-and I do not just mean the Victa lawn-mower, the Hill's hoist and the photocopier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Patents Office is a fee for service operation, its fees cover its running costs, rent, superannuation and so on and, in addition, provides the Government with some cash input. The Australian patents system is part of an international network, and the Australian staff and leadership have a very high reputation throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the essence of the patent system is designed to encourage entrepreneurs to develop and commercialise new technology. We hope that that is what it will do. I will come back to that later. The patent system confers a limited monopoly to the grantee and, hopefully, should extend sales into export markets. The legislation before us is designed to perform several particular functions. It brings Australian inventions under international scrutiny, not just in Australia. It goes along the way towards providing a simpler piece of legislation, stated in simpler English than previously. It transfers much of the mechanics of the system from legislation into regulations. It does not change the standard 16-year patent system or the six-year petty patent system. It puts us in better shape for negotiations in the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in which Australia is playing quite a senior role. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech of the 1989 Bill, the then Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Barry Jones, made a point which I think is worth repeating. When discussing what we were doing with patents legislation, the Minister quoted the Industrial Property Advisory Committee report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>More specifically, this implies seeking-</PARA>
<PARA>to gain increased benefits for Australians by fostering indigenous innovation, and utilising the international patent system in developing export markets to improve Australia's international competitive position;</PARA>
<PARA>to reduce unnecessary social costs including those resulting from undesirable anti-competitive conduct involving patents; and</PARA>
<PARA>to improve the efficiency of the administration of the patent system with consequent reduction of direct costs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the legislation is all about and I believe that is the way that we should all pursue the matter. Later on in the second reading speech, the then Minister raised the question of New Zealand. I would like the Minister, when closing the debate, to give some information on where we now stand on the New Zealand question. In the next few years our cooperation with New Zealand is going to be essential. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to the transfer of some of the previous legislation into regulation. I have been here long enough now to always be a bit suspicious when things are taken out of an Act to be dealt with by regulation. In the meantime, I am unable to give the Bill my total support, but I will wait and see. If the legislation is changed by legislation, then we know we can thoroughly cover it in this place after full and proper debate. However, I hope that the regulations will not be used to do things that may be difficult by amendment, but I trust the officers and I presume that we can rely on being fully informed. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of getting a patent inspected currently takes about 20 months, but with increasing efficiency the office hopes to have this reduced to its goal of approximately 18 months, despite the fact that there was, according to the last available figures, a 6.5 per cent increase in lodgment. In 1988-89, according to the annual report of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, there was a 6.5 per cent increase in lodgment. Page 49 of the report indicates that, in 1988-89, 16,915 standard patent applications were lodged and that there had been an increase each year since 1984-85, when 15,720 applications were lodged. </PARA>
<PARA> I, along with many other people who used the technology information service, greatly regretted its cancellation in 1986. It had become an integral part of the process for innovative people to use, and it was supported by the Australian Science and Technology Council and the Industrial Property Advisory Committee-but it was axed just the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The granting of a patent is one of the most misunderstood things that I have ever come across. I know so many people who have saved and slaved and paid and waited until, ultimately, the joy of their life materialises in the form of a piece of paper granting them a patent for this or that. There it stops; that is when the disappointment starts. The piece of paper informing one that one has a patent is not the finish of anything; it is only the beginning. The stage is then reached of wondering whether what has been done has a use, whether it can be put to any commercial production, whether there is a market for it, how it can be sold, how it can be funded, whether it can be exported and all these sorts of things. Regrettably, a huge proportion of the patents currently taken out never materialise into fortunes for the inventor and, in fact, many of them never achieve anything beyond gathering dust in a little workshop somewhere. That does not mean that we should not proceed with the job of inventing and innovating, far from it. I still give encouragement to people with that sort of bent wherever I possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA>Patents Bill</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I return to the opening of the Minister's second reading speech in which he talked about encouragement for entrepreneurs. I urge him and all members of the Government to stop and look at where Australia's industry and exporters are right now. Over the entire period of this Government so far, Australian industries have been absolutely hammered. We have an artificial dollar fix, a crazy interest regime, an inbuilt accord disaster, rising costs and conditions, all matched by falling productivity as a result. From that we get falling exports, rising imports, a huge growing and mortifying overseas debt and a Treasurer who steadfastly goes full steam ahead for the rocks. Why does the Government believe that the small and dwindling industry and export section can go on being milked and strapped more and more so that the non-productive and non-exporting group are preserved from facing the realities of life?</PARA>
<PARA> Recently I raised the same question on another Bill, and I do so again now. I would like to know what difference the value of the Australian dollar makes to the non-productive, non-competitive majority of Australians-whether we work 30 or 40 hours a week, whether there is paternity leave, superannuation, two-hour lunch breaks, eight weeks annual leave or anything else. I talk about people such as hairdressers, accountants, members of parliament, union officials, estate agents, bakers, bankers, insurance salesmen, shop assistants and so on. But if one buys raw materials overseas or sells goods overseas or competes with imported goods, one is in trouble. The accord nonsense has the built-in effect of ensuring that the competitors are always getting further and further in front and the Aussies further and further behind. Is this the Government's plan?</PARA>
<PARA> We have many very competitive and very productive industries, but a Patents Bill will not save them. I look at the heartbreaking list of great Australian inventors and inventions that have gone and are going overseas as a direct result of Government policy. I did not say `in accordance with Government policy', but I do say `as a direct result of it'. I also say that unless there are fundamental changes to the underlying problems of our economy-not just tinkering with some of the peripheral spin-offs-the trend will not only continue but grow, and grow rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> The inventors that I know want to do their thing in Australia and I implore the Government to rethink the position. We are not discussing the question of efficient and inefficient industries. This applies to all industries. I draw the Minister's attention to the very alarming list of whole industry groups that we once had that have now gone-probably forever. The list of replacements in the high technology, sunrise, whiz-bang variety is, I regret, very small. That is the problem to be addressed. Even though this Bill has taken since 1979 to produce, it will not change the real problem; it will just draw attention to it. The inventors of Australia want to stay here and the Minister's assistance would be most welcome. However, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with the Opposition, the Australian Democrats do not oppose the broad thrust of the Patents Bill. However, I would like to make some general remarks before dealing with one particular aspect which concerns us greatly. We seem to be living in a time when more and more considerations are based on what is profitable, not necessarily on what is right or socially desirable or in the best interests of human beings, either as individuals or as a society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a party, we would certainly prefer to see intellectual property developed within publicly-funded institutions, obviously much more widely publicly funded than at present, and in which the intellectual property resided with the public interest and not with private individuals. This suggests a totally different arrangement from that anticipated in this legislation, and indeed in the way in which intellectual property has been regarded in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> I make those introductory remarks to indicate the broad thrust of the direction in which we would like society to move. It would mean a much greater level of funding for educational and research institutions. The research institutions themselves, being publicly funded, would hold the property rights in discoveries for the good of the public in general, and not merely because they were commercially advantageous to an individual or company. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that is not the position we now have before us. We live in a world where, increasingly, considerations are made on commercial grounds. The idea of patenting intellectual property and exclusively owning it for a period of 16 years to the exclusion of others-except by payment of a fee-is the way in which we are currently organised. This Bill, as Senator Archer said, merely attempts to upgrade the provisions of the Patents Act which have been amended and modified over many years and which have become unsatisfactory in many practical details.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one area, however, in which this Bill is remarkably silent and on which the Democrats and many in the community have a great deal of concern. I refer to the area of patenting biological materials. It seems to us that there are two factors which lie behind this aspect of the legislation. One is the fact that science and the results of scientific research are moving on much more quickly than can be understood either by the legislators in this place or elsewhere-certainly by the lawyers outside who have to interpret these very difficult questions. Secondly, I believe that we are living in a society in which we are becoming blunted as to the important distinctions that need to be made between ethical matters and matters of commercial interest. This Bill, which is silent on the question of the patenting of biological material, essentially accepts the view that biological material is like any other material-to be patented and exploited for commercial gain without any consideration whatever of the ethical dimension which underlies it.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important for the Senate to recognise that there is no difference-I emphasise that: no difference whatsoever-between the genetic material which serves to describe, at the unicellular level, a human being, a bacterium, a plant, a tiger or an ant. The code which describes the sequence of amino-acids which go to make up the proteins is identical throughout all species. We now know that it is possible, and indeed it is being done, to take bits and pieces of that genetic code from one species and do things which nature was not able to do previously-that is, to take that genetic material from one species and put it into another totally unrelated species and produce something which is absolutely novel. </PARA>
<PARA> That poses very significant ethical questions, some of which I hinted at in a question to Senator Button last year. The crux of Senator Button's reply was that the patenting of a creature, for example, containing a large number of human genes, indeed approaching a human being, would be left with the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices. I used that example in the question to draw out, first of all, the power of the technologies which are now available and also the inadequacy of the legislation, as we have it, in dealing with that very important question. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not personally for a moment draw any distinction between human genes and the genes of any other creature because, as I have indicated, they indeed use a common vocabulary to describe the sequence of amino acids which go to make up the proteins which determine each individual animal, plant, bacterium or whatever. Indeed, one could find in human beings many genes which have remained essentially unchanged throughout millennia, throughout billions of years, which subserve very similar functions in human beings, bacteria, plants and so on, and which have very similar genetic codes. So one should not, in our view, draw any sharp distinction between human genes or human genetic material and genetic material which comes from any other source. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned, therefore, that this legislation is silent on the question of the patenting-that is, the exclusive ownership for commercial gain-of genetic material which derives from any source whatsoever, including, indeed, the artificial manufacture of genes. It is now possible to take the individual bases which make up the triplet codes in DNA and to put them together to construct an artificial gene. That gene could be incorporated into an animal, a plant, or, indeed, a human being. Under this legislation, that material would be patentable and could, therefore, be exclusively exploited for commercial gain for a period of 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the ethical considerations which underlie this matter are of such a nature and are so far-reaching that there should be an exclusion of the patentability of any of this genetic material at all. In the committee stage, we will be seeking to move an amendment to the clause which deals with the definition of patentable material, clause 18, to exclude from the ability to patent a gene or genes, whether derived from cells or chemically synthesised. That covers the situation in which a gene may be artificially manufactured in a laboratory; a genome, or, in other words, the complete genetic description of an individual cell or a complete animal, one which was intact or one which had been added to or deleted; the altered organisms which might arise as a consequence of the inclusion of those genomes, whether natural or altered, and those organisms would cover humans, plants, bacteria, viruses-in fact, the whole range of living forms; and the progeny which would arise from those genetically engineered organisms. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we are not at this stage seeking to prevent the patenting of the techniques which may be used to manipulate genetic material, because, as I have indicated earlier, we do not have any moral or ethical objection to a discovery of the life processes and a discovery of how genes might be interpreted into different enzyme systems in cells and so on. It is the commercial ownership and exploitation of that information and the exclusive nature of that commercial ownership and exploitation which we find extremely abhorrent. It is far worse than, say, taking one's grandmother and commercialising her in prostitution. This is prostituting the very substance of life, prostituting for commercial gain the very essence of life itself. We find that extremely repugnant. It is an ethical question of the highest order. Yet this Bill, because of its silence on this matter, simply seeks to allow that that genetic material is of the same form as any other material-as a piece of machinery, a piece of chemistry or a clever idea which might be fed into a computer. We find that idea repugnant. It indicates an incredible degree of blunting of ethical perception on the part of those who have framed this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We in Western society have for a very long time, for many millennia, taken a view which we are now recognising as one which is leading to very severe problems in our relationship with the environment. The Judaeo-Christian philosophy, which underlies our view of the world, is one which appears to have led us to a situation in which the rest of the world is out there simply to be owned and exploited by human beings. We are now recognising that that view is not sustainable in the long term and that we need to adopt a different view, a view in which we recognise what many of us, particularly those from a biological background, have known for a long time-that is, that we are part of a living world and we cannot distinguish between ourselves and rest of the environment. We are part of it. We are dependent upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that we can continue to own and exploit the world-that is what underlies what I am saying here-simply advances that old idea which has led to so much destruction and which, if unchecked, will lead to the destruction of life forms on this planet, including our own. This is not inconsistent with the pattern which has been pursued by Western industrial society, particularly over the last several hundred years, but it is certainly inconsistent with the present recognition that it is that very attitude which has to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, some practical consequences flow from this. They are that we will see increasing conflict between the public interest, as expressed through ethical and moral considerations, and the commercial interests, as expressed through those who own the genetic material. For example, it would now be quite possible to produce crops which are resistant to a range of pesticides by incorporating into those crops genes deliberately manufactured which render the crop, such as a wheat crop, resistant to 2,4-D. Those crops could then be heavily sprayed with material such as 2,4-D to eliminate weeds and other competitive plants. </PARA>
<PARA> That may well seriously reduce the genetic base on which future generations will need to make judgments about those genes which are desirable and necessary for a continuation of life, or a continuation of ecological systems, in particular localities. Those judgments will be made increasingly more difficult if the powerful multinational companies have commercial ownership of the very genetic information on which that technology is based and from which it is applied. It will be increasingly difficult to make those sorts of judgments with those very powerful commercial interests intruding their particular short term financial interests against the interests of the public good. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that unless we allow the patenting of these sorts of materials we will fall behind the rest of the world. We have been through these arguments in the past with relation to the plant variety rights legislation. It was argued that without plant variety rights Australia would not be well served with new plant varieties. The technologies which have come along in the last couple of years far and away exceed in power the technologies which were available when that legislation was debated. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out, as I think the Democrats did on that occasion, that Australia has been particularly well served by publicly-funded research into new plants and new plant varieties. The plants remaining are in public ownership for public use. If people who have defended plant variety rights-particularly those on the Opposition benches-reflect for a moment, they will recognise that in varieties of crops such as wheat, barley, oats and those sorts of things, organisations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and the Waite Agricultural Research Institute in South Australia, have served this country extremely well with the development of new plants and new plant varieties. They have done that without having the heavy hand-the inhibitory hand-of commercial ownership and exploitation placed across that research work in such a way that what is done, or what is used, is determined not by the public good but by the good of the company which happens to own the patents and is able to exploit them. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that we will be introducing an amendment, with a number of consequential amendments, to this legislation in order to bring it into line with what is now known about the capability of genetic engineering and genetic manipulation. As it has taken from 1979 until now-and a review-to get this Bill codified into an up-to-date form in a legal sense, it is a pity that this legislation does not recognise the power of the new techniques which can be used for genetic manipulation. If we pass the legislation in its current form we are passing a piece of legislation which is really out of line with the most recent thinking. In other words, we are simply repeating the errors of the past. The previous legislation had become out of date. This legislation will be out of date when it is passed unless it takes into account this very important area defined in our amendment and excludes it from patentability. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate sees fit to pass this legislation without accepting this amendment, I can only say that it indicates either or both of these two things: an incredible ignorance on the part of my fellow senators in not understanding the extreme power which modern biological methods have conferred on us; or an incredible degree of blunted perception of the ethical dimensions of what they are legislating when they are prepared to hand over for commercial ownership, commercial exploitation, and exclusive commercial gain, the very substance of life itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Archer said at the outset, we will not be opposing the legislation but there are some important points that should be made. The first is that the progress of patent law reform over the last decade has been painfully slow. Again, as my colleague pointed out in his speech to the Senate, it was the Fraser Government that initiated reform in this area in 1979 when we ordered a review of patent law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC) conducted that review and reported to the Parliament in 1984. It recommended three basic things: firstly, that the present standard patent term of 16 years ought not to be altered, and indeed the Bill leaves that period in place; secondly, that the procedures for granting extensions to terms of standard patents be eliminated and, thirdly, that patents be tested for novelty against disclosures in documentary form anywhere in the world and not merely against prior disclosure in Australia. The Committee also recommended a general streamlining of procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until November 1986 that the Government finally released its response to that report of 1984. More than two years elapsed before the Patents Act 1952 was amended. Now we are told that this Patents Bill, which has come more than six years after the 1984 report, is an attempt to implement parts of that report. Thus the progress of reform in this area has been far too slow, given the pace of technological advance and the dire need to improve our balance of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The substance of the Bill is simply that it replaces the Patents Act 1952 as the principal piece of legislation dealing with patents in Australia. We would like to refer particularly to two of those changes. Firstly, under the Bill patent applicants who apply for a standard 16-year patent will have their inventions tested for novelty and inventive step against disclosures anywhere in the world. We think that this is an important test to introduce. This development, which is welcomed, will make it more difficult for a standard patent to be granted and should be helpful in multilateral trade negotiation forums. More importantly, this development ensures that domestic innovation is not inefficiently protected from competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, procedural matters are to be left to regulations and these are to be completely redrafted. This always creates concern because it means that such matters are subject to less scrutiny by the Parliament than if they were dealt with by an Act. The rationale is, supposedly, that this will make the Act more streamlined. However, as I said, it could mean that the substantial changes that may be made will not be scrutinised in a very full way by the Parliament as a whole. Thus we will have to be vigilant to ensure that the Government does not interfere with the property rights of patent holders without referring that matter to the Parliament. As a matter of principle, the legitimately acquired and inviolate rights of property ownership should not be altered by government without consultation with the parties involved and reference to full debate by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to hear some of Senator Coulter's remarks. He puts forward a standard socialist approach and likes the idea that we should somehow nationalise individual intellect. This whole system has failed in eastern Europe, where it is now realised that people need incentive, that the concept of private property is important-indeed, essential-in developing prosperity for individuals within nations. A quick visit to eastern Europe should help Senator Coulter understand that nationalisation does not aid either the inventor or the consumer. Patents are a form of private property. They are intellectual property and as such are, of course, subject to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round, with which I will deal later. </PARA>
<PARA> It was Mark Twain who said:</PARA>
<PARA> A country without a Patent Office and good patent laws is just a crab and cannot travel any way but sideways and backways. </PARA>
<PARA>Twain's sentiments may very well be true but it is questionable whether the current system of intellectual property laws has been proven to encourage domestic innovation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, patents do confer property rights. But it is when a government seeks to enact intellectual property laws for some sort of public benefit reason which can allegedly be derived from industry protection that problems are bound to arise. The rationale for the granting of patent rights must be for the enforcement of private property rights rather than the protection of domestic innovation as a matter of industry protection. I think the Government has not delineated clearly enough the basis on which it brings forward this legislation. If research innovation and ideas are to be stimulated by the method of conferring private property rights, this is fair comment; but if this is done by way of bringing forward some additional form of protection for industry, such a course is not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy that the 1984 IPAC report concluded that overall the costs of the patent system, if one were to use that public benefit test, probably exceeded the benefits. However, it pointed out that patent systems operate around the world and that patents are an important part of our establishment of private property rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Patents are designed to recognise the rights of creators of new ideas. Traditionally, they have been granted for a certain period to allow the originator of that new idea to gain a return for his efforts through the sale of his rights or through the direct production of the product which is patented. Once defined, these rights should be as inviolate as any other form of right to property. </PARA>
<PARA> If a government were arbitrarily to alter people's rights to property which was previously acquired, such as land, those owners would legitimately be outraged and seek compensation. Rights to intellectual property are just as important. This means that intellectual property law reforms should be handled just as studiously. But, as I pointed out earlier, intellectual property laws may be used as in a way to prevent competition and to stifle free trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In his dissenting statement to the 1984 report, Professor Lamberton recommended a package of reforms which included a reduction in the patent term to 10 years, some freeing of important competition and, among other things, a weakening of professional patent attorney monopoly of costly advice. This creates a good deal of problem in some areas, where government regulation and, indeed, inefficient bureaucracy means that the processing of the patents takes so long that the benefit of the patent is lessened quite considerably. This, of course, is the case with regard to dealing with patents concerning pharmaceuticals, which have to go through a very cumbersome procedure. I had hoped that when legislation concerning therapeutic goods was introduced we may have seen a streamlining of the process rather than added bureaucracy, which much of this legislation introduces. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Professor Lamberton made some worthwhile points. Rather than extending patents terms, which many protectionist countries and advocates would encourage, we should perhaps look to shortening the term where there is no intervention by government bureaucracy. This would lessen the worthwhile nature of the patent while at the same time recognise the property rights of patents holders. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is important to look at patent rights in the context of the current Uruguay Round of the GATT, which is rapidly coming to a close in November. At the outset, I think it is important to say that if there is no satisfactory outcome for agriculture in the GATT, there will be a lessening of protection by the European Community of its common agricultural policy, a lessening of protection by Japan, particularly in respect of rice, and a lessening of protection by the United States by way of its farm Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Carla Hills, the United States trade representative, whom I had the pleasure of meeting with in the last few weeks, understands that very well. On the other hand, I had talks with the European Commission, and I do not think it understands the position at all well. Mr McSparry came up with a proposition that somehow the new piece of European-speak, the AMS, which is an averaging of all subsidies that are paid with regard to agriculture in the European Community, should be used. He proposed that these could be lessened by 30 per cent over a 10 year period and made retrospective to 1986. Having asserted that they have already reduced that protection by 15 per cent, I do not think, bearing in mind the attitude of the European Community, that the final outcome in November is looking at all hopeful. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I have mentioned that attitude is that protectionism is alive and well in some countries that would like to see free trade in other areas, including the question of intellectual property. Indeed, through the previous US trade representative, Clayton Yeutter, the United States contends that lax respect for intellectual property is costing American firms some $US61 billion a year. He threatened that if there were not a satisfactory outcome for intellectual property from the GATT Round, bilateral action in respect of those countries not willing to agree to their position would be taken. Indeed, he has stated that he may remove them from the generalised system of preferences, which often means the exporting of goods without duty. With the Uruguay Round coming to an end, we have to see a lessening of protection talk. We have to see a true commitment to free trade so that all the world may benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter spent a good deal of his address dealing with proposed amendments which literally appeared on my desk prior to my rising to speak. Senator Archer did not have time to look at them. We usually expect little consultation from the Australian Democrats, but on this occasion there was no consultation whatsoever. Therefore, there has been no opportunity to appraise the merits of the arguments which they may put forward. In accordance with that, the Opposition will not be supporting the Democrats' amendments. However, as I said at the outset, we will not be opposing the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Tasmania-Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs) (11.04)-I thank Senator Archer in particular for his support for the Patents Bill. He has taken a very keen interest in these matters as the shadow spokesman in this chamber carrying out duties in relation to this very important matter, namely, the patents system, designed to encourage entrepreneurs to develop and commercialise new technology. I believe that he has asked to be kept fully informed on the development of regulations under the legislation and I certainly give him the undertaking that not only the Opposition but all honourable senators with an interest in the matter will be kept fully informed as the regulations are developed and not merely when they are finally promulgated. I understand that the working party which was set up to assist in preparing the Bill will be used in developing those regulations, so that will continue with a role. There will be consultation involving the representatives of the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia and the Law Council of Australia, who have been of great assistance to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With those assurances, I thank the honourable senator, as I say, for his support for the outline of the legislation and indicate that the more detailed application of it through regulations will also be subject to the sort of consultation which he quite rightly indicates would be of assistance. Expert groups are required to give advice in this very complex field, and we will certainly be taking advantage of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator Coulter has foreshadowed certain amendments relating to biological materials. As I understand it, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has undertaken a reference in connection with the development, use and release of genetically modified organisms. That is probably a good forum for this Parliament to first test the matter in a very considered way, taking advice, recommendations and submissions from around Australia, rather than trying to deal with the matter as it has been presented to this chamber, I think in a very untimely way, if I can put it that way. As indicated, Senator Bishop and Senator Archer certainly have not had time to consider the ramifications, and neither has the Government. We have a parliamentary committee of the other chamber looking into the development, use and release of genetically modified organisms and it may be that within that Committee's terms of reference our submissions might be usefully considered. Any recommendations made could, of course, then be considered by the Government and/or the Parliament as a whole, including this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop indicated the Opposition's support for the Bill. The Government welcomes this. I think Senator Archer and Senator Bishop would also agree with me. Senator Coulter might consider not pressing his amendments at this stage, but taking advantage of the opportunity to put his views to the House of Representatives Committee. That may be the best way to deal with the matter. It might be better from his point of view than seeing those amendments defeated in the course of the committee debate this morning. It would be better to keep them alive as useful propositions for consideration by the House of Representatives Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Bill, using greatly simplified language and structure in comparison with the present Patents Act, will be more comprehensible to people who are not patent experts, and that is important. As I heard Senator Archer point out, there is a great wealth of innovative expertise and characteristics to be found in the Australian people to the extent that inventiveness and innovation in the design of particular products can be quite revolutionary. The question is then how one takes them through into production in the marketplace in a way which protects the legitimate interest and expectation of the inventor, the innovator, to get some financial recompense for the creation of a new way of making a mousetrap or something even more important than that. I thank those honourable senators who contributed to the debate and I seek the support of the chamber for the second reading. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Patents Bill 1990 be referred to the Selection of Bills Committee for consideration and reference to the appropriate legislative and general purpose standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA>When I saw this Bill on the Notice Paper and on the `red', I immediately assumed that the force of Standing Orders which we adopted at the end of the last session would take effect and that this Bill would automatically go to the Selection of Bills Committee and be referred to the appropriate standing committee. We have been told this morning by Senator Jones that, presumably in the last session, the Selection of Bills Committee considered this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones might correct me if I am wrong, but I understood that the Selection of Bills Committee was not actually established at that stage. If it were established at that stage, a decision was made prior to the Standing Orders coming into effect because that standing order relating to the reference of Bills was not due to come into effect until yesterday. From a senator's point of view, such as mine, one assumed that the Patents Bill would go to the Selection of Bills Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> On that assumption I did not then prepare the amendment that I wished to have prepared on the basis of the information that I had studied in respect of new forms of life, particularly an article written by Mr I. A. Wilson and Mr K. R. Wilson entitled Patenting New Life Forms: A Dilemma in Bioethics and the Law in which those two commenced by quoting Mr Justice Michael Kirby, to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA>The dynamic forces of science and technology affect the definition of human rights. It could scarcely be otherwise in the last years of the twentieth century. Our time has seen many remarkable scientific and technological developments. They profoundly affect the individual, the social environment, the relationships of nation states and the planet. They reach out into space. The dreams of scientists of yesterday become the fascinating achievements of today and the prospects of tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, I am concerned that not enough consideration is being given in the debate, in this chamber at all events, to the possibility of patenting new forms of animal life. There have been a number of contributions relating to genetic engineering and genetic material, but there has been little said of the matter which I have raised and which was raised in this article.</PARA>
<PARA> I am most concerned as an individual senator to hear from persons outside of this chamber of their views in respect of the Patents Bill. One of the ways for that to be done, of course, is for it to be referred to a standing committee by the chamber on recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee so that we are in possession of all the relevant information before we do or do not pass a piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), in his response at the second reading stage, did say, `This is being considered in various other circles'. I assume that what he meant was that it was being considered departmentally and is being considered by a House of Representatives committee. I do not think that that is sufficient. We have here a piece of legislation which ought to be amended to ensure, for example, that people are not able to take out patents on new species; animals, I suppose, would be word that is used, and it is used in that article. It is important that that be done now. Is it agreed that the Bill should go to the Committee?</PARA>

If we simply let the Reference of Bills to Committees Orders of the Senate of 5 December 1989 operate, that will allow the matter to go to the Selection of Bills Committee without prejudice, of course, to the outcome of its deliberations.

<PARA>DRAFT TABLING SPEECH FOR HIGHER EDUCATION REPORT</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I present the report of the Senate Committee on Employment, Education and Training on `Priorities for reform in higher education'. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was referred to the Committee in May 1988. The Committee's involvement at that time with its very successful inquiry into `Education for active citizenship' prevented it from focusing on the higher education reference until April last year. In one respect, this delay proved an advantage since it allowed time for the implications of the Government's White Paper on higher education, which was released in July 1988, to be fully appreciated by the higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received a large number of written submissions to this inquiry-277 in all-from a variety of sources including higher education institutions, academic staff associations, students unions, private sector organisations, individual academics, and State and Federal governments. It held public hearings in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra, gathering evidence from a total of 80 witnesses who included university Vice-Chancellors, student union leaders, employer representatives, individual academic staff, officers of State and Federal departments, and representatives of the National Board on Employment, Education and Training. The Committee has set out its conclusions in this report. I wish to comment briefly on some of the key points we have made. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, higher education has been a prominent issue on the agenda of public debate in Australia in recent times, particularly since the release of the Government's Green Paper on the subject in late 1987 and the subsequent White Paper in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes, however, that much of this public discussion-including that generated by the White Paper-has missed certain points of major significance. The debate has focused almost exclusively on the way the higher education system is to be structured and how it will be controlled. In the Committee's view, a central consideration in reforming higher education must be the quality of the education which students receive-what they learn, how effectively they are taught, and how well their education prepares them to live and work in a world of rapid change. The preoccupation with the way the system operates, rather than what it is intended to achieve, has excluded these issues from the agenda of the debate. The Committee believes it is time to correct this imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the qualities which graduates from Australia's higher education institutions should possess? In the first place, the Committee believes, they must be highly competent in the sciences and the arts underlying the practice of their profession-they must have a solid grounding in the skills which their profession requires. But their education must go well beyond this narrow base. They must also have a sound understanding of the society in which they are going to practise-its history, its literature, its social structure, and its social mix. In addition, they should possess a critical capacity which enables them to look at problems from a number of differing perspectives-to analyse, to gather evidence, to synthesise, and to be flexible, creative thinkers. They also need to develop a capacity for `lifelong learning' to enable them to keep abreast of the world of rapid change in which they will live and work. And finally, they must be good communicators, orally and in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> How well are our institutions meeting these criteria? The Committee believes that Australia's higher education system has generally maintained high standards in the technical aspects of the curriculum. Universities and colleges have produced graduates entering fields such as engineering, medicine, law, architecture and science who are usually well grounded in the knowledge and skills essential to the practice of their professions. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence suggests however that, on the other criteria I have mentioned, the quality of higher education courses is less than satisfactory. The Committee believes that Australia is producing graduates who are often not familiar in any disciplined sense with the society in which they are going to practise their chosen profession; who, all too frequently, are not critical, analytical, creative thinkers; who are not sufficiently attuned to the need for lifelong' learning; and who are not good communicators. The Committee reluctantly finds itself in agreement with a view expressed by one witness that the undergraduate curriculum is tending to produce highly trained, highly competent technicians who are undereducated in the broader sense of that term.</PARA>
<PARA> Part of the problem has to do with the narrow and specialised nature of much higher education. The Government's White Paper states that `We wish to be a rich society intellectually, culturally and economically' and that `higher education is a primary source of the skills we need in our cultural, artistic, intellectual and industrial life'. The evidence provided to the Committee indicates that the sense of breadth and intellectual richness suggested by these words is conspicuously absent from the education received by the vast majority of undergraduates. There are too many Economics graduates who have an inadequate understanding of History; too many Science graduates who have no knowledge of their own society; too many History and Politics graduates who have no idea of how national budgets are formulated let alone about the major scientific ideas or arguments of the age; and too many Engineering graduates with no concept of the likely impact on society of the technology which they control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is not advocating the mere addition of a thin veneer of cultural enrichment to a technical education. Nor is it arguing that students in the humanities and social sciences should be given a smattering of scientific knowledge. The aim is not to produce graduates who are better equipped to answer questions in a quiz about cultural or scientific topics. As A. N. Whitehead remarked, `culture has nothing to do with accumulating scraps of information' and `a merely well-informed man is the most useless bore on God's earth'. The change which the Committee is advocating is more substantial, and much more closely related to the real needs of graduates in a rapidly changing society. The aim is to produce graduates who are well equipped for both life and work-better citizens and better professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> My Committee believes this will require a careful re-examination of the nature of higher education courses. It will not be achieved by law courses which reflect a narrow range of social concerns, economics courses which ignore the political, social and psychological context of many economic problems, engineering courses designed solely to produce technical experts, or humanities courses which remain insulated from the world of science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this question is crucial, but the Committee does not believe that the reforms required in the higher education sector relate only to the content of courses. At stake also is the way in which students are taught. A key issue for the Committee in this inquiry was the quality of teaching in institutions of higher education. The Committee gathered substantial evidence on this topic and concluded that one of the most serious weaknesses of Australian universities is their failure to encourage and reward excellence in teaching. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that some academics care deeply about their teaching role, and put a lot of time and effort into it. It also recognises that some institutions have taken steps in recent years to give greater recognition to the importance of the teaching function. The evidence presented to the Committee suggests, however, that in many cases only lip-service is paid to the importance of teaching and that in too many instances the crucial factor in decisions concerning appointments, promotion and tenure is research performance and the number of publications produced. The position was well summed up by one academic staff member whom we spoke to who said that in his own faculty the productivity measure is a nice econometric equation which comes down to the number of pages published. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes it is imperative to rectify this situation. As Sir Zelman Cowen argued in an address at the University of Tasmania earlier this year, teaching is central to the role and purpose of the university at all levels, and particularly at the undergraduate level. In our attempts to become what the Prime Minister has called the `clever country' this fact will become more and more important. If we are to harness fully the resources of our higher education institutions and ensure that the recent reforms arising from the White Paper have not been made in vain, it is imperative that this central teaching role of higher education institutions be recognised, reinforced and rewarded-not just through pious statements of principle but in real, substantial, concrete terms. Policies within institutions and at Government level must be geared to this end. My Committee's report suggests ways of addressing the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to comment briefly on the concept of `lifelong education' which is also an important theme in my Committee's report. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the numbers of adults undertaking some form of further education. A research study in 1986, aptly titled A Nation of Learners, found that 6 out of every 10 Australians have taken at least one adult education course in their lifetime. The growth in interest has been rapid and seems to be accelerating. For every course taken in the mid-1950s, two were taken in the mid-1960s, six in the mid-1970s and fourteen in the mid-1980s. Employment related courses are the most common, though courses for leisure purposes are not far behind. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this trend reflects a radical change in outlook-a rapidly growing realisation that it is no longer realistic to expect people to store up sufficient education during their initial vocational education to last them through a lifetime of change. </PARA>
<PARA> My Committee believes this trend to be of particular significance for higher education in Australia-for two reasons. First, we believe it is becoming less and less credible to assume that higher education can be provided once and for all at the end of schooling. This is particularly true in the sciences and technologies where the pace of change, and the contemporary knowledge explosion, make it more and more difficult for courses to provide a detailed coverage of any field of knowledge and to keep up with latest developments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason directly relates to the problems in the higher education curriculum which I have referred to. As I have indicated, a major weakness of undergraduate courses in Australia is the tendency towards excessive narrowness and specialisation. If this problem is to be overcome, institutions and professional organisations must recognise that, while the basic degree course can lay a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding, it can no longer hope to teach students everything they are likely to require in the course of their professional careers. Instruction in many specialist topics will need to be deferred to a later stage, and the emphasis will often need to be placed on key principles rather than on a detailed treatment of every topic. In addition, more stress will need to be placed on giving students the skills and enthusiasm to continue their education after graduation. </PARA>
<PARA> If this approach is adopted, it will be possible to reduce the excessively specialist emphasis of many higher education courses and create room for the broadening of course content which my Committee is advocating. Institutions will then be in a position to design courses which place more emphasis on widening social and cultural horizons and promoting capacities such as critical awareness, adaptability and creativity. They will then be in a position to remedy the defects in the higher education curriculum which my Committee has identified. </PARA>
<PARA> If this is to occur, however, undergraduate courses must be able to proceed on the assumption that students will have access to continuing education opportunities. Many institutions already provide a range of continuing education courses for both professional and general education purposes. There are also increasing opportunities for continuing education in other areas of the education system and in business and industry. My Committee recognises and applauds this trend but believes that these efforts need more encouragement and also need to be placed on a solid and systematic footing. In short, the higher education system-at both institutional and government level-must adjust to the rapid contemporary trend towards a `learning society'. My Committee's report suggests ways in which this process might be facilitated. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, higher education is a large and complex topic and my Committee's report covers a wider range of issues than I have addressed today. The remarks I have made have highlighted some of the central themes of our report-themes which I believe are vital to the future of higher education in this country. My Committee believes that we must come to terms with the basic purposes of higher education and look carefully at the nature and quality of the courses which we are providing. It is time to move beyond the current preoccupation with the mechanics of the system and ask what we are really achieving. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of explanation, I have incorporated my speech so that other members of the Committee will have more time to speak to the report. At this stage I will confine myself to some brief remarks. First of all I wish to acknowledge the cooperation and work of the Committee members. As honourable senators know, it is an all-Party committee. Our recommendations and the whole report, in fact, were unanimous. I must say that in the six years or so that I have been in the Senate, I have not had as much pleasure in putting together a report. The relationship that we enjoyed as members of that Committee was extremely good and productive and I think a testimony to the type of people who volunteered to be on that Committee. I might say, also, that we are extremely grateful for the work of the secretariat, led by Derek Allan. This report was a very wide-ranging report and was an extremely difficult one to put together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might just indicate, as a brief observation, that our aim as a committee was basically to create a debate about the fundamentals of higher education in this country, to review our national goals and assess our achievements. Basically it was to place education in the forefront of the public mind. I guess in an age where economic and fiscal news dominates our media, our report is, in fact, extremely timely. I think, on the whole, we have achieved our goal of putting education at the forefront of the minds of many people in this country, and I finish on this basis: no-one, I believe, has summarised the efforts of this Committee better than Mr Sam Lipski in the Bulletin of 17 July 1990. His column begins:</PARA>
<PARA> Tertiary studies get the third degree. </PARA>
<PARA> At $19.95, Priorities for Reform in Higher Education is somewhat more expensive than the average paperback but it deserves to be a best-seller at the Australian Government Bookshops which began stocking it last week-especially among those who want the talk about Australia as the Clever Country to be more than just talk. </PARA>
<PARA> Teachers at universities and high schools should pin the report's conclusion on their walls and, even if they throw darts at it, read what it says: The Committee believes that Australia is producing graduates who, all too frequently, are not familiar in any disciplined sense with the society in which they are going to practice their chosen profession, who are not critical, analytical, creative thinkers, whose education does not provide the basis for adequate flexibility, who are not sufficiently attuned to the need for `lifelong' learning and who are not good communicators. In short, Australia is producing highly trained technicians who are undereducated in the broader sense of the term. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from part of the report. There are many other areas in which the report has some very positive statements to make about the progress we have made in higher education in this country. But, above all else, I believe that we have, as all Senate committees should be able to do on major issues, created a forum for public debate, and I thank very much the members of the Committee who helped me, as Chairman, to achieve that goal. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> I speak now after 12 years as a member of this Committee. At some stages, I have been Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and the Arts, and I happen now to be Deputy Chairman of this successor committee, the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I will be retiring this week, after these 12 years serving on the Committee, because of my need to concentrate on foreign affairs and defence. It is, therefore, all the more reason why I place on the record the enormous value that I have seen in this Committee. I have enjoyed every day of my involvement with it and with all the colleagues who have served with me, the secretaries and research officers. As I look around the chamber, I see other senators who have contributed to perhaps some 20 reports. </PARA>
<PARA> This report, Priorities for Reform in Higher Education, is one of the better reports in that series to which I refer. The one that I feel most proudly associated with is the Committee's report, Towards a National Language Policy for Australia. Having said that, endorsing the committee system of the Senate, endorsing this particular Committee, and endorsing these particular remarks, let me turn to the outrageous comments of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins. When this report was made public he said that it revealed `everything that is wrong with the Senate Committee process'. He had the gall to say that this was senators reporting `the shallow observations of unrepresentative people as fact'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an insult to the Senate, Senator Reid, and it is the arrogance of this Minister that he can make such a sweeping statement about the Senate. It is unparliamentary. It may well be against the privileges of this House for a Minister to make such an unforgivable denigration of the important processes of this chamber. It shows his ignorance and his foolishness and stupidity. Instead of accepting the bona fide evaluations of eight senators who have looked at 200 submissions evaluating higher education in this country, and instead of reading and understanding what the report says, within minutes of it being made public he comes out with this fatuous and stupid remark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ministers of any government serving Australia should respond to the bona fide reports of their colleagues in parliament and to important Senate inquiries. It goes without saying that whilst there have been a number of structural changes to provisions for higher education in the last three years while Mr Dawkins has been Minister for Employment, Education and Training, there has been insufficient concentration on the quality of higher education. This need was expressed by those who took part in the White Paper debate and it has been expressed by members of parliament, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> To complement the debate that was already, with such controversy, ensuing about Mr Dawkins' White Paper reforms, we believed it was timely and right, and we had the endorsement of this Senate to conduct this inquiry into other priorities for reform in higher education. It was thoroughly undertaken. I believe, and I still stand by, the recommendations that are in the report. It would have been very much to the Minister's advantage if he had sat down and read the report, referred it to his Department and referred it to the Higher Education Commission of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) so that there could be a proper and considered response to what we have found. </PARA>
<PARA> What did we find? There are five areas that we particularly addressed. In the few minutes remaining to me now, I will refer to the three most important areas: these are, first, the quality of undergraduate higher education, in particular; secondly, the need to reward good teaching in our universities and colleges; and, thirdly, the need for a new focus and additional resources to ensure that there are facilities for adult continuing education in this country. If the Minister thinks that we have `arrived', that we are fully on top of these three areas, let alone the others referred to in this report, and if there was any reflecting impertinence in the Higher Education Council of NBEET-I have no evidence that there will be-they are sadly ignorant. We will never have `arrived' with regard to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has taken into account the fact that there have been advances in these areas. There is more recognition of teaching, along with research, amongst our academics. Of course there have been reforms-very notable reforms by some universities-to give recognition to those academics who have excelled in teaching, so that they are promoted to senior lecturer, reader or professor, and their teaching performance has been, in some cases, taken into account along with their research record. But it is still a sad situation that insufficient recognition is being given to the teaching capabilities of academics. We are wanting to give a comprehensive regard to teaching. We are wanting the Higher Education Council and NBEET-indeed, each of the higher education institutions-to systematically give the assurance that they are giving that recognition to teaching. If we are to lift the quality of higher education and to become increasingly a cleverer country, there will need to be excellence in the teaching in those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the first area-the quality of undergraduate teaching. We say in our conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that Australia's higher education system has generally maintained high standards in the technical areas of the curriculum. </PARA>
<PARA>None of us are here to denigrate Australia's higher education record. This country is looked to by many people in other countries as being amongst those giving a first class higher education, both at the undergraduate level and, especially in certain areas, at postgraduate level. </PARA>
<PARA> The point we are wanting to add is this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that Australia is producing graduates who, all too frequently, are not familiar in any disciplined sense with the society in which they are going to practise their chosen profession, who are not analytical, creative thinkers, whose education does not provide the basis for adequate flexibility, who are not sufficiently attuned to the need for `lifelong' learning, and who are not good communicators. In short, Australia is producing highly trained technicians who are undereducated in the broader sense of the term. </PARA>
<PARA>We are ringing an alarm bell. We are saying it is not good enough to have graduates who are good technicians with good specialist knowledge. They need to relate to the whole perspective of Australia to see how their profession fits in to a full social and political perspective and to have the flexibility and the creativity to apply themselves to the continuing needs as they go through their profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Undergraduates themselves feel that they are underprovided in this way. Many academics have told us so. Some of the wisest of those who have made submissions to us have made that observation. That is why we bring a particular focus to this. I commend all of the recommendations of the report. I believe that NBEET and the Higher Education Commission should-I believe they will-take them seriously and act upon them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a member of the Committee that contributed to the production of this extremely significant report. Senator Teague has addressed some of the content of the report. I wish to be fairly brief in my remarks and, essentially, to react to the responses that have been made public by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For reasons of pressure of work in other areas I have just resigned from this Committee, but for the last three years as one of its members I have taken part in what I consider to have been one of the most productive and positive experiences of a senator. It is an excellent committee. It has committed itself to important areas of reference. It has reported thoroughly and very professionally. I am sorry to be leaving it. I am particularly sorry to be leaving it in a context where such a vitally important report has been rebuked so superficially by one of the key members of the community to whom it was directed-namely, the responsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable senators will be aware of the fact that in the last three years, particularly under the architecture of Minister Dawkins, significant structural changes have been made, as Senator Teague has cited, to higher education in this country. They were made very quickly and made very politically by the instruments of Green Papers and White Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people in Australia, particularly those who have been involved in higher education for decades, believe that these reforms were railroaded, rammed down their throats and, in fact, were not in receipt of adequate attention by the community at large. They cite Minister Dawkins as being a master strategist in having achieved things so quickly by a process, disguised as a form of participation, called Green Papers and White Papers, which calls for public response, and then substantially ignoring it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the public response should be acknowledged for what it is-a responsible, informed response. We have faith in Senate committees as being a vital process by which the public can respond to legislation and administration. That is the importance of this new committee process that we are putting in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister responsible for administering one of the most important social processes in our community-education and higher education specifically-has, I believe, responded shamefully, superficially and egotistically to a vital document that emerges from that sector of the community charged with responding and called upon to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen Green Papers and White Papers swiftly achieving major structural change. Members of the Committee asked, `What should we put alongside that as a complementary process of comment and feedback from the community?'. This document was deliberately intended to be a complementary process. </PARA>
<PARA> The report said some stinging things to the responsible Minister. That is what it was intended to do. It was provocative. That is what it is intended to be. It is responsible to be provocative; it is responsible to be constructive; and it is responsible to report to the Minister what those who take part in this process feel about its quality. The Minister has reacted in some respects predictably, but absolutely shamefully and superficially. He has denigrated the people who took part in the process, he has denigrated the Chairman and members of the Committee and he has described us as senators who have nothing better to do than to waste our time by sitting in committees and deliberating over these serious processes. His response is shameful. The Senate as a whole needs to react to what the Minister has said about the process of reporting and those who take part in it, let alone its content, which is the area for which he has responsibility on the behalf of the nation. I believe that the Senate must take very seriously the reactions of Minister Dawkins in relation to this report. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I congratulate those who took part in the process, particularly the staff who spent so much time on it and carefully and objectively synthesised and reported the 200 submissions that were received. The vice-chancellors of all the universities reacted. People in high places taking part in designing and implementing higher education in the country presented submissions to us. Those submissions were then processed and refined in a very responsible manner and now take the form of a vitally important report to this Parliament which has been shamefully and superficially denigrated by the responsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich as Chairman has made his comments. He has cited what I believe is a very significant analysis and comment from journalists. I commend this report to the Senate for its serious attention. I direct the attention of honourable senators to the shameful and sad reaction of the Minister, which really deserves our very serious response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments of my colleagues. In my first three years in parliament I, like Senator McLean, have found my service on the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training one of the most rewarding experiences. The Committee started off by looking at active citizenship. In the first part of our three years we brought down a report which, I believe, has raised the public's awareness of Australians' lack of understanding of the political process and also made recommendations which have gone some way in addressing that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee then turned its mind to trying to raise the debate about the goals of higher education, at a time when university people and people in the college sector were feeling rather beleaguered and embattled by the structural changes which, as Senator McLean has said, have been forced upon them. It is not often that a Liberal senator can rise in this chamber and agree with the Australian Democrats and Labor senators. On this occasion we are all speaking with the same voice. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich had to withstand an amount of battering from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins. If I were to believe in Freudian psychology-which I do not-I would analyse Mr Dawkins's response as some sort of guilt response because of what he has done to higher education in this country. When we pointed out some positive things-they were constructive suggestions-I believe that his reaction was one of guilt. He knows what he did to the Australian education system for his own personal promotion. Mr Dawkins said that this report revealed everything that was wrong with the Senate committee process. He claimed that it had taken two years to produce and relied on a few observations of a few unrepresentative persons and, in some cases, malcontents around the country. I am sure many people who made very positive submissions to our Committee would have been appalled at the Minister's attitude that they are malcontents. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly we met some people who were feeling pretty pained and upset about what has happened. They had been forced to merge, and they felt that there really had not been a proper discussion about the real issues in education. Many submissions were constructive. They mentioned concerns about teaching, about our lack of use of technology, about adult education and, in particular, about transferability of skills. If we are to make Australia a clever country, then the graduates coming out of our universities need to have research skills in order to update their knowledge. By that I do not mean experimental research; I mean that they should have the ability to use a library to update their knowledge. This was an area where people felt there was a great lack. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins said that this report was totally useless and a waste of time. I have a few letters that were received by the Committee. I have picked out the letters from the universities, from people whom we are claimed to criticise. One letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the report is a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate on higher education in Australia, and I hope that our comments will be of service to your Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Another letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I have read with great interest the press excerpts such as . . . producing skilled barbarians . . . appalling teachers . . . and the failure to reward excellence in teaching. You are 100% correct in too many cases!!</PARA>
<PARA>To quote another letter:</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for sending me a copy of `Priorities for Reform in Higher Education'. Despite the bucketting from on high, it is a good report. Indeed, I suspect it is because it hits the mark that some critics have been stung. There are issues in it that regrettably the Government and AVCC seem not to want to hear about. </PARA>
<PARA>A further quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Based on media reports your Committee on higher education has made a welcome contribution-thanks on my part. </PARA>
<PARA>Politicians do not often get letters like this. I quote from another letter:</PARA>
<PARA> I enjoyed reading this report and thought that many of its recommendations were very valid.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that all these comments are written by university people. Another letter from some students says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> We find this report to be particularly relevant to our student organisation, one of our important functions being monitoring the quality of education and the effects that many Dawkins reforms have imposed on our institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Those comments come from Mr Dawkins's malcontents. I believe that this report has raised important issues and that our recommendations were reasonable and achievable. From the response we have had from universities and people in the community, I believe that the report will go a long way to changing and raising the standards of higher education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a member of Monash Council and, as the Senate has been told before, I think I am the only Federal politician who has been the subject of a merger! I was chairman of a large department at Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences which merged with La Trobe University. Although the merger was voluntary, it was a painful experience because we realised that there were going to be problems. There are still problems with that merger. The physiotherapy school in Victoria was torn asunder, and the same thing will happen in many other institutions. As a member of Monash Council, I have seen some of the problems that have arisen as a result of mergers. I do not believe that some of these mergers will create increased opportunities for students or will have the effect of reducing costs. In fact, I have great concerns about how we are going to unscramble the egg that Mr Dawkins has scrambled. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the report raises an issue that was raised by Prince Philip in a graduation address at Monash at which I was present. He talked of his concern-and it ought to be the concern of all of us-about `educating school barbarians'. The last thing he referred to in his speech stuck in my mind-he said that school barbarians might be of greater concern than those of the primitive kind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, entitled Priorities for Reform in Higher Education, from the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training deserves more than the brief comments that I am able to bring to the debate now, but I wish to make a few specific points about it. I welcome and agree with many of the aspects of the report. It raises some important and disturbing issues about the quality of higher education in Australia and deserves serious consideration. Unfortunately, as has already been mentioned, the report, immediately upon its release, was subjected to a poor level of political debate. I think Senator Teague's criticisms of that debate are well founded. It is time to concentrate on the public debate which the report deserves and which can and should take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report recognises major deficiencies in the quality of graduates and describes the quality of teaching at some universities as `appalling'. While the report comes up with some very good recommendations about the essential qualities for graduates, it fails to prioritise sufficiently its recommendations for funding in the current climate and to take into account the enormous resources we need for education in this country. Education is now a question of funding and, as a first step, it is essential to determine which recommendations should be a priority for funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The question to be answered is: what is quality teaching? It is time to tone down the politics of the debate and have sensible consensus and discussion involving students, academics, administrators and the Government, such as it is, in this area. We should be aiming for consensus. A consensus approach is needed to determine what quality teaching is and what it means in real terms. We must knuckle down to this debate, disregard the politics and, as Senator Patterson suggested, if it is possible to have a cross-party consensus, take advantage of that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Teaching quality is the priority which should become an essential basis of our education system. We have been told that equity is one of the bases, that it is a principle supported at all levels. Teaching quality is the next thing that we should be aiming for. Funding should be directed, for example, to staff development and rooms for small group teaching. </PARA>
<PARA> The report talks directly about the quality of education in terms of the individual, while the White Paper discussed education for the country. The two things are compatible. For Australia to become the clever country, we cannot ignore the needs of both. It is important to stop the politicking and get on with establishing proper priorities for funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague quoted from a section of the report, which also attracted my attention, addressing the capacity of graduates to function in society. The Committee was right to highlight the community's concern about the skills with which graduates leave university. I will not repeat the section from which Senator Teague quoted, but honourable senators will know which one it is. The report provides the basis of the further debate that should take place. Whether or not the Minister wants to hear the debate that the Committee has brought forward, the community has been itching for it to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation from the report that appealed to me was recommendation No. 7: that the Commonwealth establish a permanent policy focus for adult and continuing education at the national level and that a mechanism should be established within the structure referred to in the report. The recommendation further said that a leadership role should be assumed for continuing education and that policies should be developed appropriate to the emerging educational needs of Australian society. The section that attracted Senator Teague's attention is the section which asks for people to graduate from university with the capacity to function in society. This recommendation also makes the point that we need to be looking at adult and lifelong education-in other words, the skills to function as a citizen throughout one's life. </PARA>
<PARA> The report indicates that, while tertiary institutions have been undergoing massive restructuring associated with amalgamations over the last two years, the real needs in terms of quality education have been largely ignored. In other words, the amalgamations have been taking place perhaps for some other reason and the real needs in quality education do not seem to form part of that process. It is disturbing that amongst the submissions to the Committee is a report that as many as 40 per cent of university graduates lack skills in basic literacy. I wonder how those skills are defined; but even so, literacy is still a concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the grassroots needs of students at each institution are more relevant than administration as the starting point to achieving quality in higher education. That is a point that the Democrats will continue to make while the community debate on this matter is taking place. We believe that the provision of on-campus and off-campus student accommodation is urgently needed for students attending rural and smaller campuses in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is very important in raising these particular matters for community discussion. I am pleased that the report has served as a catalyst for that discussion, and I hope that it is not put aside in the process which can and should take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I apologise to Opposition members for not presenting them with my tabling speech, but we were caught at an earlier stage by the collapse of a previous debate. Therefore we did not have time to circulate the speech which, in fact, encompasses all the agreed issues and takes all of its ideas from the report itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicate, in passing, that obviously the aim of the report was to create debate, not political furore. I also indicate clearly to the Senate that the response we have had to this report has been extremely positive. People have had time to look at the report and to consider their position. I think that it is worth pointing out that around 1,100 copies of the report have gone out on request or have been sold through government bookshops. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training I have received many letters about the report. I have had 38 letters personally addressed to me from academics throughout the country. Thirty-six of those letters were strongly in favour of the report, its recommendations and the way in which we approached the issue. Two were critical, and I will at any time present those critical letters because they encompass a viewpoint that we need to examine. In fact, one was from a vice-chancellor of a newly restructured university. But on the whole the response has been overwhelmingly positive. We welcome that. We look forward to a positive response from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and from any other bodies which have some responsibilities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by reading from an article that appeared in the Australian of 1 August 1990 which referred to the views of Professor Brian Wilson, the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. Under the heading `Wilson Backs Barbarians Senate Report', the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Professor Brian Wilson, has expressed sympathy with a Senate education committee report which attacked universities for turning out barbarians. Professor Wilson described the report as much more sensible than it was portrayed and praised its emphasis on the need to liberalise the educational backgrounds of students. </PARA>
<PARA>I leave the Senate with the remarks of Professor Wilson, who represents the vice-chancellors of this country. We believe that we have taken an important first step in encouraging the institutions themselves to examine their aims, goals and performance. We believe that that first step should be mirrored by the Government and government bodies responsible for this area. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On 28 June 1990 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs presented to the President, in accordance with the order of the Senate of 31 May 1990, its report entitled Debt Recovery under the Social Security Act and Veterans' Entitlements Act. The presentation of the report concluded a 14-month inquiry into the methods by which the Department of Social Security (DSS) and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) recover amounts paid to people under their respective legislation in excess of the amount to which those people are actually entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> The title of this report is rather turgid, but it raises some significant matters. It deals with the law that impacts on the vulnerable members of our society and on the disadvantaged-the people whom the community must treat fairly if we are to be a truly humane and decent society. For that reason I think the report is worthy of considerable attention. It draws attention to matters affecting the quality of life of people who, as it were, are at the bottom end of things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received more than 40 submissions from the departments concerned, welfare rights groups, community legal centres, banking organisations and law societies, as well as from numerous private individuals. The Committee held public hearings, at which not only institutional witnesses appeared but also people with personal experience of the way in which current procedures impact on social security clients. Evidence was given as to the mix of structures by which social security benefits and benefits under the Veterans' Entitlement Act are delivered to recipients. We also heard evidence from the recipients themselves. Perhaps at this stage I should congratulate the present occupant of the Chair, Senator Colston, on his well-deserved appointment as Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of the inquiry I told the Senate that the Committee was interested in examining both the recovery of overpayments and the impact on people whose benefits were reduced by the departments as a means of recovering such overpayments. I indicated that the inquiry would address such matters as the methods that the departments used to recover overpayments-the use of garnishee proceedings, the processes by which they collected information and their implications for privacy, and the write-off and waiver of debts. </PARA>
<PARA> I also said that the Committee would examine the proposed code of conduct to govern banks' dealings with the accounts of social security beneficiaries, and in particular the operation of section 249 of the Social Security Act, which provides that pensions, benefits and allowances paid under the Act are to be `absolutely inalienable'. This is a high issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has dealt with these issues in the report, which contains 29 recommendations, some of them quite detailed. I draw some of the more important recommendations to the Senate's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the debt recovery process, the Committee in chapter 2 of its report sets out the processes by which debts are recovered. Both DSS and DVA submitted that the primary cause for overpayments was a change in the client's circumstances, with a consequent effect on the benefit payable, and a failure on the part of the client to notify this change of circumstances. Both the Acts involved impose an obligation on the client to notify the relevant department of such changes of circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Various groups and individuals submitted that administrative error on the part of the Department was a major cause of overpayments. In contrast, DSS told the Committee that such error was present in only a `small proportion' of overpayments. The Department was unable to provide the Committee with any figures on this. In any event, various people submitted that such overpayments should not be recoverable. It was pointed out that this was the situation under equivalent legislation in the United Kingdom. When this proposition was put to representatives of DSS, they said that under the Australian legislation DSS had an obligation to recover all overpayments, which were debts due to the Commonwealth. DSS told the Committee that if a debt arose clearly, unequivocally and for no reason other than administrative error and had been received by the client in good faith, the Department could waive such a debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that, where a client receives an overpayment in the honest belief that it is part of his or her entitlement, and the overpayments arise because of administrative error or unreasonable administrative delay, recovery procedures should be undertaken only if the department concerned shows that recovery would leave the client in no worse a position than he or she would have been in if the correct payment had been made. </PARA>
<PARA>Notifications of overpayment</PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 4 of the report deals with the methods by which DSS and DVA notify clients of overpayments. Many of the submissions commented unfavourably on the letters sent out by DSS in particular to advise of alleged overpayments. The Committee noted that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs had identified similar problems in a report published in May 1989 and had made detailed recommendations for `a revised set of standards for the content of letters to clients'. In this report the Committee endorses those recommendations and makes some detailed recommendations of its own in relation to DSS's standard letters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that such letters should be clear, precise, non-intimidatory and in plain language. The DSS's efforts to achieve this goal have been to date `manifestly unsuccessful'. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Government in its response to the report should specifically address what steps have been taken to achieve the improvements called for. </PARA>
<PARA>Administrative Charge</PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 246 (3) of the Social Security Act allows DSS to recover an amount additional to that owed to the Commonwealth for an overpayment under the Act. This is said by DSS to be an administrative charge, though welfare organisations and others refer to this charge as being penalty interest. The charge is applied where a debt in excess of $50 is not repaid within three months of being notified. It is calculated as 10 per cent of the balance owing plus $15, with the maximum charge allowed being $515. </PARA>
<PARA> DSS told the Committee that it was meant both to provide an incentive to repay the debt quickly and to partly offset the cost of administering the debt recovery system. Welfare agencies told the Committee that it impacted most harshly and inequitably on those people least likely to be able to repay a debt within three months. Accordingly, several submissions recommended that it be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Both points of view have merit. However, as suggested by the National Secretariat of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT), the Committee has recommended that the Act be amended to provide that the charge be not levied where a person has, within the three month period, made arrangements with DSS to pay the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Recovery of overpayments from welfare recipients still receiving payments is usually effected by withholding a portion of the continuing benefit. The current rate applied by DSS is 14 per cent of the basic entitlement plus 55 per cent of any additional income within the allowable income limit plus 27 per cent of any income received over that figure. Submissions to the Committee objected to these levels of withholding. Given the subsistence level of pensions, the Committee has recommended that a standard level of no higher than 10 per cent of the client's entitlement be withheld. </PARA>
<PARA> Several submissions expressed concern that child-based payments such as family allowance were withheld in order to recover overpayments. The Committee found that this was inappropriate. Children should not be made to suffer as a result of a parent's obligation to repay a debt. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that such payments should be exempt from withholding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee looked at the use of garnishee powers by which overpayments can be recovered from former clients. It was suggested that, since DSS was not required to prove an alleged overpayment before recovering it in this way, it gave the Department a special advantage over other creditors. Indeed, it was pointed out that, under South Australian law, garnishee proceedings were not permissible. The Department of Social Security has assured the Committee that garnishee proceedings were used as a last resort, being applied only when negotiations with the client had failed. The Committee has accepted this. Nonetheless, the Committee recommends that garnishee rates be limited to no higher than 10 per cent of the client's after tax income. </PARA>
<PARA>Appeals</PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 7 of the report deals with the methods by which people dissatisfied with departmental decisions to raise and recover overpayments can appeal against those decisions. The Committee has made several recommendations about the procedures governing appeals, namely that:</PARA>
<PARA> when notifying clients of an overpayment, DVA advise them of the ways in which recovery decisions can be stayed pending the determination of the appeal;</PARA>

<PARA>Independent Advice</PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 8 of the report, the Committee deals specifically with the need to make skilled and dedicated advice available to clients of the welfare system. This advice needs to be independent so that when, for example, DSS makes `discount' offers to debtors those people can, as the Committee also recommended, take advice on whether or not to take up the offer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has noted that DSS officers can be placed in the position where their duty to the Department is in conflict with their duty to advise clients on their legal position and on how to protect their interests. Welfare right units and community legal centres are much better placed to advise such people. Accordingly the Committee has recommended that the Government provide funds to such bodies and to allied organisations to enable them to provide competent independent advice to those relying on the social security system for relief. Prevention is better than cure and the cost of funding these bodies may well be offset by savings resulting from disputes being resolved at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Institutions and the Social Security System</PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 9 of the report, the Committee discusses the role of banks and other financial institutions in the social security system. This discussion traverses such matters as the direct crediting of benefits to clients' accounts, the withholding of benefits by banks to meet shortfalls in other accounts and the code of conduct being negotiated between the Government and the banks to regulate the ability of such institutions to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered the meaning of `absolutely inalienable' in so far as pensions, benefits and allowances paid under the Social Security Act are stated to be absolutely inalienable pursuant to section 249. The Committee has been unable to reach any conclusion on the meaning of the phrase, stating that it was for the courts to make an authoritative determination. However, the Committee has raised doubts about the voluntariness of the direct credit scheme, which may in turn involve questions about the legality of banks using social security payments to offset debits in other accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> This report addresses great and pressing problems. As was pointed out time and time again in evidence, the people who are liable to repay overpayments, however they arise, are usually those least able to repay them. These people are often vulnerable and they need to be handled with care and compassion. At the same time there is a need to recover debts to the Commonwealth. A balancing act must be undertaken. In discussing the relevant issues in this report I hope that the Committee has assisted those who are in a position to ensure that this balance is achieved with the interest of the client as well as of the Government foremost in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking of the Committee, I extend my thanks to the Committee for the work it did on this report. It was considerable. There was, on this occasion, a subcommittee of four who need special mention. There is Senator Giles, who is very much the quiet, but great, achiever in this chamber and whose work is often overlooked. Senator Powell, who has gone on not to greater things but to different things, has on this Committee been a veritable tower of strength and commonsense, and great thanks should be extended to her. Senator Collins, who was here a while ago but has now left the chamber, has now gone from being a great committee member to pursuing some micro-economic reform on the waterfront. That is a sad loss to the Committee but a happy gain for micro-economic reform. Then there was me. I am about to be followed, I understand, by Senator Vanstone. I publicly welcome Senator Vanstone to the Committee. She has already done great work and I hope with her as a deputy we will continue to work as we work so well now. So I welcome Senator Vanstone. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I would like to commence by congratulating you on your recent election to your high office and I look forward to working constructively with you. I would also like to commend Senator Cooney for his sterling efforts. I think he probably thoroughly enjoyed himself with all those arcane meanderings through the legislation. At the end of the day, of course, it was a very important inquiry that was conducted by the Committee, of which until recently I was the Deputy Chairman, and I certainly regarded that reference as one of particular significance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the real question that arose out of all that and in a sense was not able to be properly explored was why there were indeed the levels of overpayment that ultimately emerged. I think the bulk, if not the entirety, of the report was taken up with some very necessary but technical assessments of the balance that had to be struck between the Commonwealth asserting its rights and those who, for one reason or another, found themselves with a very limited capacity to repay. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing is this: the Committee itself was provided by the Department of Social Security with a distribution of overpayment reasons and that listed accounts outstanding at the end of the 1988-89 financial year as amounting to $214m. That is a very substantial sum of money owed by something in excess of 100,000 people. That means that the average overpayment was of the order of $2,000-indeed, in some instances, up to $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly significant about that is that we cannot simply dismiss overpayment as a function of somehow marginal overruns paid to a few people for a few weeks. It is quite clearly a very significant problem and one which I would have thought has to, by deduction, involve people continuing to receive moneys for, in some instances, very substantial periods of time. Indeed, to receive an average figure of some $2,000 a person would need to have received overpayments at the maximum level of benefit for in the order of 15 weeks. That does suggest a very serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is not a problem that has been faced up to by this Government, and that is what I think is the most extraordinary result of the Committee's inquiry. It is highlighted by the most extraordinary announcement in last night's Budget: we are now about to be subjected to a massive inquiry and clampdown on social security fraud and overpayment. We are being told that in the current financial year the Government expects to be able to save $120m. Of that amount, $65m will come from a clampdown based on matching of Social Security and other departmental records, and $55m will come from the amnesty which will operate for a period of six weeks from yesterday's announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are very substantial sums of money and they give the lie completely to the sort of nonsense that has been peddled by not only the current Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, but his predecessor, Mr Howe, who are constantly at pains to down play any suggestion of anyone cheating on the system or of any maladministration within the Department. By that, I do not mean any deliberate maladministration but inadequate monitoring and supervision of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Cooney rightly points out, overpayments can cause very severe hardship and they also have the effect, especially if they are not able to be recouped, of there being simply less money to go to those who are genuinely in need. I think that ought to be our principal concern in the matter: to target welfare payments effectively so that moneys go to those in need and do not go to those that are not in need. That is what happens by definition with overpayments: people who are not entitled to the moneys, by one means or another, receive them and then often find that, because of that irresistible temptation that befalls us all to spend money that we have on hand, they are not in a position to repay. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures that were provided to the Committee showing that list of $214m contained no embellishments-simply a statement that that was the amount owing. But Senator Richardson then had the temerity to say a month or so later that some of those debts went back to 1962. He said, `These are debts that are accumulated over years. If one goes back to, say, 1988-89 as a reasonable base, in that year $95m was overpaid, $75m was recovered'. That is an extraordinary situation because what he is saying is that most of this money has been outstanding for years. But he does not tell us what attempts have been made to collect it and, if there has been a problem, what decision the Government has taken about that. Is it prepared to write off the amounts? If it does not have the legal power to write them off, why does it not seek that power? In other words, why does it not clean up the area? This money that is being owed going back to 1962 may well be technically owed by people who are no longer with us. That is simply a ridiculous state of affairs. It highlights the sort of slapdash approach that Senator Richardson has taken to this office since he assumed it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one would have to say that administration has never been Senator Richardson's long suit. He is more interested in knocking political heads together and strutting his stuff in every area except his own. One can well understand that he finds it much more interesting to weigh into the telecommunications debate to protect the union or to talk about how he might be able to fix various factional difficulties. The fact is that administration is not particularly exciting, but it is absolutely essential to the proper conduct of government. Yet what we have had here is a Minister who is not prepared to do any homework and who down plays the problem to the extent that he dismisses it by saying that there is only $20m owing in the 1988-89 financial year and that the Government has a phenomenal record in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to take that at face value, what are we conceivably to make of last night's announcement that the problems are so rife that we are going to have this massive clampdown that is going to recover something of the order of $120m in the current financial year and, over the next three years, something of the order of $900m? That is an appalling state of affairs that demands an explanation. Whilst I commend Senator Cooney for the work he has done in the technical area, I think by far the most important question overshadowing that inquiry is why we have had such high levels of overpayment in the first place and how we are proposing to avoid them in the future. Make no mistake about it: declaring an amnesty is really little more than getting down on one's hands and knees and hoping that somehow people will come clean. That is most unlikely to be the case, given that they have been prepared in quite a number of instances not simply to accept an accidental overpayment or two but to go on for a period of months receiving overpayments and then, of course, not to repay the money to the Commonwealth. I would have thought that an amnesty was little more than a public declaration of failure, and a lot more will be needed to try to straighten out this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Overpayments, I think, will be a running sore as long as Senator Richardson is simply prepared to say on one day that there is not a problem and then to say on another day that there is a massive problem and we will have an amnesty. There needs to be a lot more technical work done to ascertain why people are overpaid in the first place. Whether that is achieved by means of additional review teams or whether it is achieved by requiring people actually to come into Social Security offices and sign on an ongoing basis for receipt of payments so that at least some eye-to-eye check can be made as to the bona fides and entitlements of recipients, we are going to have this problem simply compounded over time. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the efforts of Senator Cooney's committee in grappling with a very difficult problem, but it is really not much more than a peripheral issue in terms of the magnitude of the sums that we are concerned about today. I invite the Minister to face up to the question and to make a proper statement to the Senate to explain how this situation comes about in the first place-indeed, how it came about that his Department provided those figures without any qualifications. In other words, there was no suggestion that somehow the bulk of this money had been outstanding for years. It was simply put forward as a sum of $214m in outstanding overpayments, which on the face of it, I would have thought, constitutes a very serious problem and which, by its actions, I think the Department also regards as a very serious problem. I would be surprised if it would view with equanimity the approach taken by the Minister to somehow push it under the carpet and suggest that the overwhelming proportion of this money was attributable to years gone by, the inference being that it was not worth chasing up now. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we are going to see a much more serious attitude adopted by Senator Richardson as long as he remains in the portfolio. We all know that he has done his level best by way of number counting for Mr Keating to pay back the Prime Minister for the reward that he got by being appointed to this portfolio. I just hope that he will be big enough, whilst he remains there, to take it seriously and to come to grips with issues in a much more effective way than he has done today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Debt Recovery Under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act. In commencing, I congratulate Senator Alston on his remarks to the extent that he pointed out something that this report does not highlight and, indeed, was not intended to highlight-that is, the massive problem of overpayment by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This, by and large, comes about in my view, not as a consequence of intention to cheat and defraud by individuals-although there is certainly a substantial element of that-but through the incompetence of the relevant departments and through the misunderstanding of the bureaucratic entanglement, if you like, that recipients of benefits from these two departments face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston is, in my view, 100 per cent correct when he points out in his own words that if the departments concerned, in particular Social Security, got their act together and if the Minister could bring his Department to order in that sense, there would be far less of this problem. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs may well then not have to deal with such a problem. Obviously, it would not if the problem did not exist, but if the problem were of a much smaller scale it would perhaps not invite the Committee's attention. But the facts are that the administration of the Department is such that this is a monumental problem. </PARA>
<PARA> That is of concern in two respects: firstly, the fiscal outcome, of not collecting these overpayments, is very substantial-that is the element that Senator Alston has dealt with; secondly, of course, it creates another problem of interface between government and individuals. I would like to think, Mr Deputy President, that government deals with all individuals equally but, if one were to vary from that view, surely governments should deal with the most vulnerable more carefully than they do with the least vulnerable. The recipients of these benefits are in a very vulnerable position. Therefore, I suggest that there is a higher responsibility on the relevant departments to deal with those people fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, I think, fair to say that that has not always happened in the past. I want no misunderstanding in relation to my remarks. I have no sympathy at all for people who want to cheat the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but I equally have no sympathy with a department that has been told again and again that the manner in which it is dealing with members of public is not up to scratch and that, having been told that again and again, does not appear to have listened to that advice and does not appear to have done anything about the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to, in particular, the tenth recommendation of this report. It is one that I want to concentrate on this morning. The recommendation deals with the standard letters and advice on overpayment from the Department of Social Security. It is a common problem that people who receive advice from Social Security as to an overpayment simply do not understand what Social Security is alleging. The letters are not written in plain English. They are frequently written in a somewhat overbearing tone with an assumption of guilt on behalf of the recipient of the benefit, when that easily may not be the case. The guilt, if there is any, is of maladministration by the Department. Consequently, I want to draw to the Senate's attention those recommendations in this report that deal with the manner in which departments, especially Social Security, deal with individuals. As I say, that is primarily recommendation 10. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other valuable recommendations in this report. Senator Alston describes them as technical. That may well be and in some cases clearly is the case. It is a very technical area. That is why people get caught up in it; that is why we have got the problem; and it has to be dealt with in a technical way to alleviate the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I point out that I have only briefly been on this Committee, having taken a place on it in May. I would like to express my thanks to the members of the subcommittee who prepared the draft of this report. Honourable senators may have heard Senator Cooney outlining who those members were and may have noticed that there was no coalition member on that subcommittee. Consequently, having taken my place in May, I asked the Committee whether it would hold over concluding this report so that I would have the opportunity to at least familiarise myself with the amount of evidence that it had taken and to work with the subcommittee on redrafting and settling the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I think some good work was contributed by everybody in the last couple of months in bringing this report to the stage that it is at today. I do want to thank the Committee for its forbearance in, basically, waiting for new members to be able to familiarise themselves with the evidence and giving new members the opportunity to participate in contributing to this report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>As Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I take this opportunity to commend the report entitled Australia-India Relations: Trade and Security to the Senate and, indeed, to all Australia in the absence of the Chairman, who is away from the Senate today, and also pending continuing contributions from members of the Standing Committee on this important report. It is a good report. It is a comprehensive, careful, well-informed summary with specific conclusions that address Australia's relationship with India and, to some extent, with the South Asian region as a whole. We had two terms of reference: the first, prospects for increasing trade between the two countries; and the second, the implications for the regional strategic outlook of India's enhanced defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, let me say that this is a report on which I would like the Parliament to judge the wisdom of our new title and general terms of reference to include trade along with foreign affairs and defence. Of course, these three areas are naturally entwined with each other. In this report the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has very constructively looked at all three aspects in this important relationship between Australia and India. </PARA>
<PARA> From the outset, let me say that the relationship between Australia and India is undeveloped. Indeed, it has suffered from benign neglect until the last three years. Even then what has happened between our countries has been the outcome of a minority interest by Australian business and, at a peak level, by Prime Ministers, foreign Ministers and a few other parliamentary representatives, such as some members, including me, on this Senate Committee. That is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia-India Relations</PARA>
<PARA> We are calling, in this report, for increased focus on India by Australian business and Australian government, for much improved information and much better coordination between the various government departments that are involved in this area. Indeed, we very explicitly call for the establishment of an Australia- India Council along the lines of the existing Australia-China Council, Australia-Japan Council and Australia-Indonesia Council. We call for a fourth major council to develop bilateral relations between Australia and India. I will return to that matter in a few minutes. We also call for focus to be given to Australian academic investments into the Indian subcontinent. We believe that whilst there exists in many universities some teaching and research presence with regard to India-whether it is in history, politics, economics, or even in anthropology, music and religion-there is an inadequate focus, and there are inadequate resources, to serve Australia well in terms of the need for academic expertise, the development of young graduates with the ability to be involved in business and government and to further the Australia-India understanding and relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> It was about three years ago that the then Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, visited Australia and was a guest in this Parliament. That visit marked for me the reawakening of an interest between Australia and India and in the full potential that could be explored between our countries. That visit was followed the next year by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) going to New Delhi, and subsequently by significant visits by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. Indeed, he was there just a matter of a few weeks ago, and a couple of days after this important Senate report on Australia-India relations was released. It is my understanding that the Foreign Minister was fully informed when he arrived in India-this report having just been published-of the report's findings. It is my judgment, as an Opposition senator, that this is an instrument to greatly fortify whoever is in government in Australia in the important development of relations with India. The Minister, I trust, heralded this report. I believe that in his study of the report and his Department's study of it, he should consider fully implementing the recommendations that are set out in it. It is the natural next step or series of steps for this Government to take in redressing the inadequacies of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps there is a $30m bill for the items that are set out in the recommendations of the Senate Committee. I put it to the Government that this is a small additional investment in relation to the $500m of trade between our two countries at the moment. Indeed, Australia has set itself a trade objective of $1,000m to be achieved by 1992. I note a general and initial finding of the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that India already is an important Asian power of the same general order as China, albeit with a less prominent international trading and strategic profile beyond its immediate neighbourhood. India's power will probably continue to consolidate over the next two decades and its economy will probably continue to open up. </PARA>
<PARA>India has 900 million people. A hundred million of them constitute what we would call a middle class. There is, then, a huge consuming public wanting goods that Australia is well placed to help to provide. There is the development of an infrastructure in India in which Australian expertise can play an important part. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, White Industries Ltd, for example, has gained a major contract in relation to coal development within India. Australia is well placed not only to have mutual economic relations in terms of joint ventures, infrastructure contracts and commercial trade, but also as a gateway for India to Japan and to the Pacific region. However, this potential has not been fully recognised, even by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Austrade does not have a sufficiently defined strategic plan in its relations with India. Yet that is all to hand. It is achievable. </PARA>

Are Australian hostages being used as human shields to protect military installations?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that other countries have negotiated for the release of hostages; but according to an announcement made on Iraqi television on 19 August, the national assembly of Iraq has decided that in some circumstances the citizens of five countries-Austria, Finland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland, which have not taken part in the `military blockade', would be allowed to leave Iraq. The status and precise intent of this statement is still not entirely clear. We understand that the governments of some countries concerned have been notified by Iraqi authorities of the arrangements being made for departure of their citizens, while other governments have so far been unable to obtain clarification. There is confusion about whether the basis for the selection of the countries whose nationals can leave Iraq relates to the application of sanctions or participation in the multinational naval force (MNF), or both. While the countries nominated can be characterised as being amongst those which are applying sanctions but are not participating in the multinational naval force, they are not the only countries with citizens in Kuwait and Iraq which fit that criteria. In other words, non-participation in the MNF would appear not to be the sole criterion for the apparent discrimination between countries. The Australian Government is doing all in its power to secure the departure from Iraq and Kuwait of Australian citizens who are at present trapped there. It has repeatedly called on Iraq to respect international law and to leave Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The number of Australians in Kuwait, I understand, is 72. The Australian consul has been visiting Kuwait and has, I think, made contact with 64 people. The previous figure of about 80 in Iraq is our best estimate at this stage. As much as possible, Foreign Affairs is trying to establish the whereabouts of all Australians and give them the appropriate advice, which Senator Gareth Evans went into yesterday. Some contact will continue to be established with those people by Radio Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I received the Wrigley report in early July, and I immediately ordered its printing and public release on 1 August. I think one of the key recommendations in the Wrigley report is that there is a need for a much more sustained debate in Australia about defence. His report, going into the many areas that it did, provides a basis for that. At the time of releasing the report, I indicated that a period should be available for full public exposure of the issues raised by Alan Wrigley and discussion therein. I have also authorised Mr Wrigley to canvass his views and the views contained within his report as widely as possible. That goes to briefing of press, briefing of Opposition, right through the academia, et cetera, to give it the widest possible exposure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I have indicated publicly that many aspects of the Wrigley report have an attraction for me as Defence Minister. It is a very well-written and well-thought-out report. It is not necessary that every phrase used in that report is accepted by the Department of Defence. Some it would regard as slightly gratuitous insult. However, getting away from those two or three minor objections-it is a report that may well see a reorientation of our approach to defence issues in the 1990s. It has much of value in it and much appeal to the Government in it; but the public debate and processes of debate must continue over the next few months and then the Government will give its response.</PARA>
<PARA> The alternative response could have been for the Government to have received the report, assess it for eight months and release its findings with it. If we had followed that particular process, everyone would have said, `Why haven't you released the report? Why are you sitting on it?', et cetera. I think we followed the proper process. The moment it became available we released it for public debate to get as much input back as possible.</PARA>

The Minister no doubt recalls that on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio on Monday, 13 August he told Paul Murphy that the rules of engagement for Australia's ships going to the Gulf region would be released on Wednesday-which was two days later. What, therefore, is the Minister's reaction to the statement on AM this morning by the Prime Minister that anyone who believed the rules of engagement would be made public would be making a stupid assumption, and if anyone suggested such a course of action it would show `how little, in fact, they know about these areas.'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. What grounds did the Minister have for saying categorically on August 13 that the engagement rules would be released, even if one accepts the absurd definition of `release' that he has now given? What grounds did he have on that day to say that they would be released on the Wednesday-two days later-when it has now taken a week or more for them to be released in his sense of the word? Secondly, if and when the Government ever makes up its mind about the final details of these rules of engagement, will the Minister make a statement to the Parliament-at least in general terms-as to what limitations are placed on the captains of those ships in engagement situations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second part of Senator Durack's question is, of course, based on a false assumption. He says, `if and when the Government makes up its mind'. The Government has made up its mind; it has issued the rules of engagement. But, if Senator Durack expects me to issue totally inflexible rules of engagement without amendment from now until the end of the year, given the fluid situation and our relationship with other naval groups operating in the area, he is putting forward a ridiculous proposition. So the second part of the question is based on a false premise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the first part of the question-and perhaps Senator Durack should cast his mind back and try to get over the political pettiness of his question-at that time we had strong hopes of United Nations involvement and that action would be taken under a United Nations flag. Had that hope been immediately realised, we would have been able to issue to our ships rules of engagement consistent with that operational command. That did not transpire, so we delayed the final drawing up and issuing of those rules on that basis. It has now become clear that it is less likely-one hopes it is not unlikely-that the ships will be under United Nations command. My hope is to issue the rules as quickly as possible because we all realise that the sooner they are out the more the ships' crews can practise according to them.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I want to make-and I intended to make it in answer to the first part of the question-is that I am quite happy to release the rules of engagement to the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Durack to study and for comment. That is in my brief. I already had that as a written part of my answer. I make that offer to them to read the rules of engagement and come to their own conclusions. I repeat that when I made that statement the rules would be released a week ago, it was predicated on my belief and hope that the matter would be under United Nations control. That has not yet transpired; we hope that it will. As the Chief of the Defence Force said to me this morning, rules of engagement are not the Ten Commandments; they can be amended according to circumstances. One should not be totally inflexible in one's approach to these matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be helpful if I gave a little more detail on the requirement for income support recipients to supply a tax file number. I believe that the thought that this amounts to an Australia Card enhancement will be found to be without proper foundation. One will recall that the Australia Card proposal was for a national identification system covering all Australians, with some exceptions. Its main intention was to prevent tax evasion and its use would have become an integral part of life in Australia, including employment arrangements, financial transactions and contractual arrangements of various types. It is a most comprehensive proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The measure announced in the Budget last night falls far short of this. Its purpose is to connect the revenue and income support records in a way which strengthens the income test requirements which surround most income support payments currently available in Australia. The measure does not apply to all Australians. It applies only to those people who are clients of the agencies mentioned in the Budget Papers. The measure is not intended to detect tax evasion, but rather to ensure that income support payments are based correctly on the amount of other income derived by the recipients.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security and the other agencies involved already undertake independent checks of these amounts of other income but the process is manual and very costly. The Budget measure takes advantage of developments in computing technology so that the necessary checks can be made at minimum cost. As I have indicated, the intended arrangements have been and will continue to be discussed with the Privacy Commissioner and will be subject to constant monitoring by him to ensure that the privacy principles are met in every respect.</PARA>

<PARA> I also alert the Senate to the fact that in the Budget last night the Government boosted funding to the old Parliament House fourfold. We have maintained-in fact we have increased-the amounts of money allocated for the continuing care and maintenance of old Parliament House. The allocation for this financial year is $700,000, an increase of $200,000 over last year's level. But we have also allocated $1.35m to develop detailed design options to return the old Parliament House to its 1927 configuration for use as a public building. This reflects the Government's commitment to continuing to maintain the building but also to its ultimately being a constitutional and political museum.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also in this context repeat and put on record the Government's decision that the old Parliament House will be used for a number of purposes within the broad definition of `constitutional and political history museum'. It will be used for the National Museum of the Australia and the Electoral Commission's Education Centre. It will also house a Government Information Centre. It will also house the Australian Heritage Commission and will be made available to the Australian Archives to display some of the most significant artistic and written records that the Archives has in its possession.</PARA>

That is a pretty miserable performance. This particular lawyer was giving advice on how income might be minimised so that non-custodial parents just would not have to pay up. The whole direction of the Child Support Agency and the Government's reforms in the last few years has been to make both parents contribute to the bringing up of their kids. That is the only way we can have a sane, sensible, sound social security system. People such as this lawyer deserve the condemnation of everyone in this Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Short knows full well and I guess finds unpalatable, this Government has had an outstanding record of restraint in government outlays-something which never happened in the entire period of previous governments. That has been over the last four years. What this Budget does, of course, is maintain the fiscal discipline of recent years at a time when there would naturally be a tendency for outlays to rise and revenue to fall as a result of the slowdown in the Australian economy: outlays to rise, as they are anticipated to do, for example, in relation to unemployment benefit; revenue to fall for a variety of reasons which are articulated in the Budget Papers. But the Budget surplus this year is larger than any on record and it has been brought about by both a fall in outlays to gross domestic product and a fall in revenue to gross domestic product. Outlays to gross domestic product this year are anticipated to be 23.5 per cent, down from 23.6 per cent last year. That is surely the most relevant measure of outlays. We have to look at the total economy and look at the pattern of Commonwealth government outlays as against the performance of the total economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not saying that in this Budget there has been fiscal slashing, if you like, of the same vigour as this Government has indulged in in previous Budgets. We are saying that we have maintained, over a period of years, a degree of fiscal discipline and restraint in Commonwealth government expenditure which is unsurpassed in the history of this country. We have done that for very obvious reasons of Budget strategy. Those figures are all set out in the Budget statements.</PARA>

There are also quite a few Australians who do not have as many kids as he does. For the rest of us, who are looking at attempting to increase those participation rates, there is a serious problem. Some time back the Sports Commission set up the Women's Sport Promotion Unit, which has been working away at lifting the profile of women in sport for quite some time, but recently the Government has developed two other initiatives to promote women in sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a meeting of sports and recreation Ministers in New Zealand last week, the Sports and Recreation Ministers Council established an official subcommittee which will enhance the coordination between the States and the Commonwealth on the role of women in sport. It will have representatives from New Zealand, from the Federal Government and from all the States and Territories to provide advice on the coordination of policies between all of those bodies. The Council also endorsed the principles and the policies of equity in sport and endorsed the work of the Women's Sport Promotion Unit in trying to achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA> As a complementary initiative, Mrs Kelly, our new Minister responsible for sport, is establishing the independent Sportswomen of Excellence Committee, which will be launched on 10 September. This Committee will have three purposes: it will act as a role model for adolescent girls; it will raise the profile of women in sport; and it will obtain media coverage and financial support for women's sport as a whole. The Committee will be made up of some very prominent women in sport from around Australia. Some of them will be, indeed, household names. It will not be an advisory committee, as that is what the Women's Sport Promotion Unit already is, but it will be a lobby group which will promote women in sport and get more publicity for it than perhaps the Women's Sport Promotion Unit will have been able to do. By doing that, we will continue to raise that profile and we will get the participation rate of women and, in particular, adolescent girls up to where it ought to be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I do not have any details on the exact proportion of drugs which could be evaluated over a series by the Drug Evaluation Committee, although I accept that Senator Reynolds would have had accurate information as the basis for her question. I believe that the question of drug evaluation is a matter of great importance to the Australian community, and one which is subject to some campaigns from time to time suggesting that the process be speeded up in a way which might lead to the entrance into Australia of drugs which are then found at some later date to have a deleterious impact on the health of those persons who might think that they could benefit from a drug that has been well publicised, perhaps, overseas and where doctors become aware through reading overseas medical journals of the claims being made about a particular drug.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that these wonder drugs are subject to considerable publicity and raise the hopes of those suffering from a particular disease or illness in a way which leads them, of course, to want the most speedy process of evaluation to take place. But I am sure that Senator Reynolds, as a woman, would be perhaps very well aware of the dangers that have faced women when drugs have been introduced in a way which has had a very deleterious effect on their health, whereas, of course, it was hoped that they would be beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA> The information which must be submitted by manufacturers wishing to market drugs in Australia is similar in both structure and level of detail to that required by other developed countries. Specific Australian trials are generally not required. That situation means that our regulatory process is in harmony with the best practice of those well developed overseas countries and that, while there may be opportunities for improving the regulatory process-and I believe dialogue with industry and doctors should continue to try to speed up that process-the evaluation system is a very vital protection for the public and cannot be speeded up in a way which could lead, as I say, to the entrance of drugs into the community which could, in fact, do damage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform Senator Reid and all honourable senators that both the Speaker and I are appalled at the wanton act to deliberately deface a painting by noted Australian artist, Fred Williams. My understanding is that the private dining room was booked by the Treasury Department as the venue for its annual post-Budget Treasury drinks, and I assume that that Department issued the invitations. At 2.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 22 August, the catering supervisor at the function called security staff to remove the painting after beer had apparently been thrown at it and food and cream had been smeared on it. The art curator is now assessing the damage to the painting, but the initial estimate is that it will cost at least $500 to clean. The final figure can be made only after a full examination has been carried out and a detailed assessment made.</PARA></TALK.START>

In addition to this, what other military exports, if any, have been made to Iraq since 1988 or to any other country in the Gulf region? I also ask whether it is true that the decision by the Department of Defence to allow the export of former Royal Australian Air Force Mirage aircraft to Pakistan caused great embarrassment to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on his recent visit to the Indian sub-continent. Finally I ask whether any of the companies which sold weapons to Iraq that are now likely to be used against Australian and allied forces in the Gulf, were present at the AIDEX `89 arms bazaar held here in Canberra last November with Australian Government support, and which companies are now being invited to take part in AIDEX `91 in November next year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the invasion of Kuwait there was one permission relating to goods and this involved a quantity of engine spare parts for Iraqi Air Force trainer aircraft being supplied by Hawker de Havilland. Military advice was given in accordance with procedures agreed by Ministers that the goods were not of major military significance. It was therefore consistent with Government policy that the goods be exported. The decision to allow this one exemption was made on 28 May 1990 and, as the honourable senator has indicated in the question, as part of our trade sanctions it was subsequently cancelled on the invasion of Kuwait. The answer to the second part of the question is basically no. The Department of Defence is not the sole authority to approve export applications. This is clear in the public guidelines, a copy of which was provided by my Department here last year, but the honourable senator may not recall what was in it. Government departments and authorities represented on the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports used the Government's seven criteria listed in those public guidelines. I assure the honourable senator that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is consulted in matters relating to exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the third part of the question, there have been no other military exports to Iraq since 1988. Approval for military exports during the same period to other Gulf countries include the following items: 7.62mm rifles and spares to Bahrain; demolition firing device to Kuwait in the United Arab Emirates; repairs and overhauls of T53 aircraft engines for Oman; one demonstration Land Rover to Oman; one indoor shooting range to Qatar; and radio equipment and spares to Oman in the United Arab Emirates.</PARA>
<PARA> On the final part of the question, I will leave it to my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to determine whether in fact he was embarrassed. I have to say though that the agreement of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is always obtained in regard to the disposal of surplus defence equipment and this included the sale of Mirage aircraft to Pakistan. The signing of the contract was the culmination of commercial negotiations that started in late 1988. Australia does value its friendship with both India and Pakistan and would not like to take any action that could in any way impair those relationships.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the last part of the honourable senator's question relates to the AIDEX and my response there is that the Australian Government is not necessarily aware of any foreign companies which have sold weapons to Iraq. However, we have to note that AIDEX is a privately run exhibition. No Australian companies whether present or not at AIDEX have sold weapons to Iraq since 1988, consistent with my previous answer. The only other company-not an Australian company-which may have had dealings there that we would know of is Aerospatiale which may have sold Exocet missiles prior to the AIDEX conference, not post-AIDEX.</PARA>
<PARA> May I say in conclusion, Mr President, that it is very easy to take cheap shots on defence exports, but I have often wondered why people distinguish between the morality of being able to export their defence items and being able to import them, therefore making those who export them to you immoral. I do not see anything wrong, and never have, in defence exports. But one must-and this country does as Senator Vallentine knows-debar exports to certain regions and countries of the world, and so we should. Those guidelines, as I say, are publicly available and I think we should stick to them.</PARA>

I used an example on 10 May to explain the nature of the Government investment in the project. That investment has not only been Government.

But as far as the Commonwealth is concerned it would largely be made through contributions to the research and education elements of the MFP in the same way in which we normally contribute to research funds to universities and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter raised the question of the Queensland site. The joint steering committee and the chairman of that committee, Mr Bailey, were concerned to see that there was not land speculation at the Queensland site. That was the point that they sought to ensure. The land being held by private owners, they were concerned that the price of the land be frozen and not be a subject for speculation. Of course, Commonwealth funds will be expended in completing the feasibility study in the next stage, to determine commercial feasibility, environmental assessment issues and social impact issues, and those are the matters in respect of which money has been allocated by the Commonwealth in this Budget for this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> The task of the management committee at present will be to identify the elements of public cost and how to handle that issue of public cost, particularly in relation to collaboration with the private sector. The funds will be the Commonwealth contribution towards the detailed feasibility work at the Adelaide site, and they will be concerned with international investment promotion efforts and, most importantly, community consultation issues. I understand that when Senator Coulter raised this question on the last occasion, he was keen that the community consultation process should start. Senator Coulter started his own consultation process. That has been done by him in Adelaide-by calling meetings and public rallies as a way of consulting. That is also being done in Melbourne by the League of Rights and one or two other bodies like that-the Rainbow Alliance-and Senator Coulter is doing it in South Australia.</PARA>

Is it not a fact that one of the reasons that South Australia has been landed with this project is that the land is already in public ownership, can be handed over to MFP, and MFP itself, again, can gain the capital improvement in that land value as a consequence of the development of the MFP?</PARA></TALK.START>

That issue is being considered now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shortly after the Government fortuitously fell over the line after the last election, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, managed to summon up enough courage to leak a letter to the Australian in which he outlined his proposals for urgent reforms in a number of major areas and once again pronounced that the benchmark for measuring the performance of the Labor Government would be micro-economic reform. Of course, he denounced that in relation to the third term, but here we were again with a clear acknowledgment that it had failed and a determination to do better next time. He actually nominated telecommunications as an area in which he saw a need for fundamental change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, these notions are highly susceptible to definitions that suit the speaker; and of course, the Prime Minister is no exception to that. What he defined as fundamental deregulation was confined really to the mobile telephone area, and of course that, as we well know, is an area that is bursting at the seams, an area in which Telecom has been patently unable to cope with demand and has been doing everything it can to keep the lid on any expansion of its activities. But Mr Hawke seemed to be bowing to the inevitable and at least acknowledging that that was an area in which there was clearly a need for deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> That is about as far as our brave Prime Minister has gone. Since that time we have had leaks and counter-leaks and all sorts of efforts at being hairy chested behind closed doors; but we have not had any sign of Mr Hawke being prepared to come out and say where he stands on the issue-which of course is par for the course, leading from behind. I suppose he has now got that down to an art form. It used to be described as consensus. I think we all recognise it as lowest common denominator politics. But the last thing it is, is good for the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> What a smorgasbord of petty intrigue and naked self-interest we have had in recent months parading as the national interest in this vital area. </PARA>
<PARA> Make no mistake about it. Even Senator Collins seems to be understanding the virtues of competition on the waterfront, and we are all anxiously awaiting the expiration of the first 12 months; but he should be very grateful he is not in this area, where there is absolutely no prospect of rational debate or discussion, let alone outcome. The reason for that is that the factions simply dominate the discussion. We never hear a skerrick of a suggestion about the national interest. We never hear about what goes on overseas, what the experience has been there, and what dramatic reductions we have had in prices and what improvements in quality of service in a whole range of areas. As Senator Collins well knows, one of the big lessons from the United Kingdom (UK) is that it did not go far enough. It simply allowed British Telecom to convert to a quasi private monopoly. It introduced a little carrier called Mercury, and it let it play around at the edges. As a result, some six years later it has about 5 per cent of the market. Six years later is pretty critical, because Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States all embraced competition at that time, and here we are, six years down the track, going backwards, with virtually no-one in there fighting for what I think every other commentator would regard as an absolute necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Mr Keating is the shining exception. He happens to be on the right track for the wrong reason. He sees it as his opportunity to differentiate his own product from that of his hopelessly compromised leader. </PARA>
<PARA> We can understand why he sees a marked opportunity in that regard. But let it be said, if he was prepared to come out and go on the record instead of having his office bruiting about the virtues of competition we might be able to take him a bit more seriously. We now know that what he seems to be standing up for is unlikely to get to first base and he has even thrown in the towel in terms of competition between OTC Ltd and Telecom-not for any logical or rational economic reason, but simply because he does not have the numbers. His acolyte, Mr Dawkins, came back from overseas the other day realising that his only hope lies with Mr Keating. He immediately went on the record in his classic manner of leaking off the record and made it clear where he stood. But, of course, when he went along to the Centre Left and gave it his view of the world, he was very quickly jumped on. Mr Dawkins, I suppose, will remain quiet as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is one of fundamental importance in the national interest. One of the most dishonest arguments that used to be paraded when anyone was interested in the merits of the argument was that somehow we needed to have a monopoly in Australia to compete with all those big bad overseas mega giants. Overseas, in Europe in particular, that sort of nonsense is scathingly described and dismissed as the national champion approach. It is a classic example of pretending that somehow, even if an organisation is inefficient locally, if it gets on the big wide world market as a monopoly, it will be able to make some easy money. Now, there is just no proof of that at all and, indeed, Telecom's international record, I think, leaves quite a bit to be desired. It may be early days, but it certainly does not have any big runs on the board and the last thing that it wants, or that the nation wants, is for it to be allowed to perpetuate domestic inefficiencies in the name of somehow competing better on the world stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review made it clear what it thought of that sort of rubbish. It said that water should be thrown on the Telecom argument, that it must be bigger to compete overseas, and it pointed out that a Telecom merger with OTC will add only 18 per cent to Telecom size and move it only one rung up in international ratings. Australia does not need more concentration in telecommunications. It is a vibrant and growing industry on the verge of a revolution which will make huge amounts of data available to every business and householder. This is the sort of fertile business atmosphere which brings forth innovation. But, of course, those words are simply lost on the power brokers in the Australian Labor Party (ALP). That is really what this argument is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give you the classic example of that. The gentleman who is prepared to poke his nose into every portfolio but his own, Senator Richardson, could not resist the temptation to weigh into this particular argument as he has weighed into so many others since the election, obviously because he is still totally dissatisfied with what was handed to him by the Prime Minister and is very anxious to get into any other area. But whilst he is in Social Security he is going to wander around causing trouble and supposedly putting out factional bush fires. What he said was, `I don't really think it matters whether Keating gets rolled. There are a thousand issues that crop up in the course of a particular parliament, and no-one from Bob Hawke or Paul Keating down wins on every single occasion everything he wants'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson also suggested that one of the trenchant opponents of the Beazley reform plan, the Australian Telecommunications Employees Union (ATEA), could actually do very well out of the changes. Well, if ever there is a cat being let out of the bag, it is that, because the ATEA is opposed to any form of competition whatsoever. It will not wear Monstercom; it knows that that is not going to lead to any form of realistic competition. What the ATEA wants is to simply maintain the network in public ownership and ensure that it therefore has almost universal union coverage. If what Senator Richardson is saying is that the ATEA will come out of the deal fairly happily, we can rest assured that there is no prospect of competition emerging. Of course, Senator Richardson would be the last one to ever intervene on the merits. So we can take it, I think, from his contribution that it is all about numbers; it is all about who is going to get on side with whom; and it has very little to do with what is in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where, of course, we are in stark contrast to the Government. Only yesterday did we finally announce in public the results of some very careful analysis of all the options and we have made it clear that we support full and effective and open competition, that we will proceed with the privatisation of Telecom, OTC and Aussat, that that privatisation will be managed so as to ensure that Australians retain majority ownership and control of strategic telecommunications assets. We will give employees preference in acquiring shares, and that is the very sort of thing that proved irresistibly attractive in the UK, where the union leadership of British Telecom demanded a boycott and yet there was a 97 per cent take-up. That will happen here, I have no doubt, as long as the ATEA leadership is not able to simply lord it over the membership. </PARA>
<PARA> So we will be on the record from now on as being the party, the coalition in favour of full-scale deregulated competition in an area that is bursting for competition and where it has been shown around the world that competition does deliver the goods. Do not let us be sidetracked by any nonsense that somehow one can come up with some example somewhere of a system that is working less than perfectly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose Senator Collins is going to trot out the UK, because he did not seem to be listening to me a moment ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The UK is not an example of the sort of competition we are advocating. The UK is an area where Oftel came on the scene too late and where a very one-sided duopoly has been allowed to operate for the last six years. But if we look at what can happen under competition and what has already happened in New Zealand, for example, we will see that there can be a dramatic improvement in things such as operator connected services, directory assistance, new connections, repairs and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose Senator Powell, who is trying to interject, has long been a fervent advocate of the total monopoly in this area and sings Telecom's praises at every opportunity. I get sick and tired of ringing up Telecom when my phone does not work at weekends and being told that unless I am a special customer I do not get my phone fixed on a weekend. I am classified as an ordinary domestic subscriber and that means I do not get my phone fixed at weekends. Every citizen ought to be entitled to have his or her phone fixed at a weekend. I am not asking for any special pleading, let me assure you. I am simply saying that the very basic requirement of a telecommunications carrier is to be prepared to fix up faults that emerge in the system and fix them up quickly. It is done within a matter of hours in the UK, in the United States (US) and in New Zealand; it is a matter of days in Australia. It is simply not good enough. In the US a caller will not wait more than 10 seconds if he rings directory assistance. Here he will be kept waiting indefinitely. It is a strategic ploy when someone rings 013 wanting information. Because Telecom has not been allowed by this Government to charge for directory assistance, it retaliates by queuing theory. That is very clear stuff, but it is not in the interest of consumers. So the Liberal Party is very much on the record as favouring competition that will be driven solely by the interests of consumers, and that is the last thing that is happening in the Government at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have all seen some classic examples in recent days of the sorts of mammoth leaks that only occur when a government is in dead trouble. The Australian Financial Review had almost nothing else in it last week other than Mr Keating's comprehensive leaking of his own submission, then his own leaking of Mr Beazley's submission, followed by a counter reaction on the part of the Keating faction-all designed to somehow jockey the position and influence. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of leak that we find in the media is one in the Age on 28 July:</PARA>
<PARA>The fracas is exposing once more the divisions of the Left. During a phone hook-up on Thursday night Left Ministers Hand and Bolkus told the faction's parliamentary executive that given the Left's present uncompromising line they would have to vote in Cabinet against both the Beazley and Keating plans. This they indicated would help the chances of the Keating scheme getting Cabinet support, that is, the option that the Left would like least. </PARA>
<PARA>This is Byzantine. I mean, what are they on about? This is all about playing games and ending up almost accidentally with a solution that they will not have a bar of. It is all about trade-offs. `Who are you for? Are you for or against the Treasurer? Are you going to stand up for Beazley or aren't you? Are you going to do a Ros Kelly and go public? Are you going to do a Dawkins and ring up Michelle Grattan and be quoted?'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. `Are you going to ring up Michelle Grattan and somehow get her to write a whole series of stories about how Mr Dawkins is reported to have told colleagues where he stands on the issue?' These are the sorts of games that are played at the moment. There is no interest at all in the national interest, only an interest in factional in-fighting and jostling for position. We on this side of the chamber regard this as a very sad commentary on the state of the ALP and certainly a very sad reflection on any commitment that there once might have been to competition in the telecommunications area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are seeing at the moment is a disgraceful abdication of responsibility-political harlotry, I suppose one could say-without any concern for anything but power and no corresponding responsibility attached to it. This sort of squalid factional jockeying will be played out no doubt at the national conference. We have been told time and again that there are those who want the national conference to be pre-empted by a Cabinet decision; there were those who wanted something put in the Budget Papers as a matter of principle; and there were those who thought that somehow the Party platform was sacrosanct. We had Ministers Crean and Ray going public and saying that there should not be any attempt to diverge from the platform, as though somehow this really mattered and the people of Australia were interested in these sorts of public statements about what faction is trading against what faction. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that people out in the real world do not want to know about the internecine squabbling within the ALP, they want to know what the Government will do to improve the telecommunications system and what it will do about effective competition. The notion of somehow merging OTC and Telecom and playing the resulting organisation against poor old Aussat, which is barely breathing, is a classic ant versus elephant exercise. It has nothing to do with what might have happened 10 years ago, as the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) well knows, because the Labor Party was never in favour of anything other than a 100 per cent monopoly controlled Telecom. At least there seem to be those in the Labor Party now who think that that is less than a perfect situation for the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us talk about the 1990s and what will work in Australia if the Government is to get the price of one of its most expensive inputs down significantly. If the Government wants to see subscriber trunk dialling (STD) rates fall by 40 or 50 per cent, which it can easily do--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, there is not long to go. The fact is that telecommunications in this country has been mollycoddled for years. That monopoly has been propped up by all the factional interests in the Labor Party, by the union movement in particular. The public sector of the telecommunications industry is something like 75 per cent unionised, whereas the private sector is only about one-third. That is reflected time and again in the sorts of deals that can be done. We get ex-Telecom employees standing up in Caucus, presumably pretending that they are being objective, and arguing time and again for some form of monopoly protection that will satisfy the union. I think that Senator Richardson's contribution said it all in that regard. If the interests of the ATEA will be what determine telecommunications policy in this country then, as Mr Keating said, `God help the country'. I can only say that I am not encouraged-nor is anyone who is interested in genuine reform-by what we have been subjected to in recent days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The timetable is urgent. The need for competition is great. We have already waited six years. The Government seems to have no conception of urgency; all it is interested in is playing little party games as though the Party platform is somehow what it is all about, as though somehow some factional compromise is what it is all about. I think most of us on this side know that it is about a lot more than that-it is about real competition, it is about service for the customer, it is about getting the systems right and it is about realising what will happen in the 1990s in terms of furious technological developments that will simply overwhelm any attempt to somehow keep the borders in place. As long as we go on with that sort of insular attitude, we will simply get the telecommunications system we deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by harking back to the terms of the matter of public importance, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's continuing refusal to put the national interest in a fully competitive telecommunications industry ahead of its own factional agendas. </PARA>

<PARA> I will make two points about just how fundamentally important this issue is-not to Great Britain, the United States or Japan, but to Australia. There are two areas of enterprise in this country of vital national importance in which overseas comparisons are always fraught with a great deal of danger-that is, transport and communications, and for obvious reasons. Senator Alston has a well-established record for his mindless, ill-informed and consistent attacks on Telecom Australia; in fact, he once described Telecom as a `sheltered workshop'. It is interesting to note the comments made by Senator Alston in Melbourne from time to time as to the attitude that is taken on the same issue by some of his conservative colleagues who represent areas of Australia that are outside the six capital cities. The one turn in this debate which I am personally delighted about is that after 12 months of ducking, weaving, prevaricating and lying on this issue, members of the Opposition have come clean, as Senator Alston has said, and finally admitted to the agenda which the Australian Labor Party accused them of having and which was specifically denied by their political representatives during the last Federal election campaign. </PARA>

What is wrong with that? I will tell the Senate what is fundamentally wrong with that. I have already referred to the great danger of the simplistic, mindless comparisons with countries such as Great Britain and the United States. In the area of transport and communications, we have to look for an effective Australian solution designed for the horrendous problems we have in this area. Australia has one of the most difficult transport and communication tasks of any country in the world.

What nonsense for Senator Alston to come in here and pontificate about the factions within the Australian Labor Party when the Opposition has produced, after at least three years in here of denying that it was going to do it, a policy requiring and committing it to the complete sell-off of Australia's telecommunications to private interests. </PARA>

The political representatives of Senator Alston's party go out on the hustings and tell the people who are voting for them precisely the reverse of the real agenda they are running. Senator Alston has got conservative colleagues who go out on the hustings, reassure the electorate that they are not going to sell Telecom and then, as a party, get together behind locked doors, engage in a debate that nobody hears about and produce a total about-face and a reversal of its stance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no difficulty at all in that sense with having all these issues widely broadcast, because I am pleased to belong to a political party that does treat an issue as fundamentally important to the entire nation as the disposition of our telecommunications carriers as we do.

As someone who has been a member of the relevant Caucus party committee on transport and communications for the whole time I have been in this Parliament and a member of other parliamentary committees dealing with this same issue, the reality-and Senator Alston's ideology would blind him to it-is that the position adopted in the various parts of the Labor Party is based on the fundamental concerns that the people expressing those views have for the outcome of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I may disagree with the particular position they are putting but all of the participants in this debate that I have dealt with as a Minister in this portfolio and as a member of the Caucus committee have not based their concerns on factional ideology.

In Australia we have very small volumes of cargoes by international standards, widely dispersed ports, 12,000 miles of coastline and only 17 million people. Even if maximum reform were introduced on the waterfront or into shipping, there would always be a natural monopoly. The same applies to telecommunications.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the light of that reform, minor by Opposition standards, the Leader of the National Party was provoked into putting out a press statement, getting stuck into us, and saying, `Any moves to privatise or amalgamate Australia's major communications systems must take into account the need to provide adequate economic services to rural and remote Australians'. Indeed, they are the Australians who are going to be flushed down the drain by what the Opposition has now finally admitted publicly it is going to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition's policy of completely privatising all of our major carriers in Australia will fragment the market in which a natural monopoly will, in my lifetime, continue to exist, despite the efforts of any government, because of the size of our population and the continent we live in, and hand that natural monopoly over to private enterprise to do as it will. Will private enterprise continue the $530m program that Telecom currently has in force for providing direct dial private telephone services to remote Australians? I think not. Will it provide all of the community service obligations that Telecom provides? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do we go to find assurances for remote Australians in what the Opposition is proposing? There is a little paragraph in its policy that says that that will be a direct Budget item. Well, good luck, folks! I know enough about the Budget processes and the tough negotiation that goes on among all Ministers and across all activities in the public sector to trust the disposition of telecommunications services to an item in the Budget. Remote Australians will suffer very directly from this outrageous proposition. I am at least pleased that the debate has been brought into very sharp focus by the Opposition, for once in this debate, being just a little bit honest. Australian taxpayers will miss out on the dividends that Telecom and the OTC Ltd currently return to them as shareholders. More importantly, telephone users will miss out on Telecom and OTC profits being reinvested into their networks. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston is continuous in his mindless attacks on Telecom. The facts do not stand that argument up to very good analysis. One measure of the effectiveness of an enterprise is the price to consumers. I have not time in this debate to go over the many other aspects which, particularly for Australians who live in remote parts of Australia, demonstrate the effectiveness of Telecom's operations. Telecom is the second largest employer in this country. It employs some 84,000 people. It operates a telephone service, very efficiently by international standards, across 3.5 million square miles of country. It handles 10 billion calls a year, with about eight million telephones connected and hundreds of thousands of others about to be connected. In addition, it has managed to bring about a progressive reduction in the cost to the consumers of those services despite the enormous difficulties and costs of providing them across our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Between Melbourne and Sydney STD charges have fallen in real terms by 45 per cent in the past five years, and by a massive 85.2 per cent since 1975. Senator Alston knows that that is true but chooses to ignore it. In the same time off-peak rates have plummeted by a massive 60 per cent and 89 per cent respectively. Currently, Telecom's plans, which are already being implemented, point to further substantial cuts in the STD rate. As a `remote Australian', I have to say that Telecom, with an organisation of its size and complexity, is not perfect. Telecom recognises that itself. In my view, it needs competition and constantly to review and update its services. But by and large it is not only an efficient organisation; it is a superb national asset which the Opposition has now nakedly and finally announced it intends to flog off to the highest bidders, who will then be able to use that natural monopoly in our telecommunication services not for the benefit of Australians, but for their own profits and to hell with the rest. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be some short term advantages for those Australians who choose to live in the half a dozen cities in which the majority of our population is concentrated. But to Australians who choose to live elsewhere-and one hopes that for the national good of this country more people will continue to live elsewhere in Australia-the Opposition's proposal is a disgrace. It is totally contrary to the national interest. It is completely a result of the blind, ideological pursuit of people such as Senator Alston who are not interested in debating or examining the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party (ALP) is committed basically to three principles. The first is that there will be competition introduced into the system for Telecom. Second is the principle that we will establish a fully publicly owned telecommunications entity that is capable of competing successfully and aggressively on international markets. Thirdly, and just as importantly, we are committed to ensuring that the ordinary consumers of Australia-all of us-benefit from the reform program that the Government will be introducing. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I say on behalf of the ALP and the Government that we will oppose as vehemently and as effectively as we can-and in my own case with some degree of heat and a considerable degree of commitment-the Opposition's outrageous proposition, despite the denials of its political representatives during the election campaign to the contrary, that there be a total sell-off to private interests of all telecommunications carriers in Australia. Such a policy is totally opposed to the national interest. On the other hand, the Labor Party is committed to a reform process which, while providing the best possible deal for consumers, will retain in the national interest and in national and public ownership the major telecommunications carriers of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Collins said, finally the Opposition has come out of the closet. It is interesting that it has done so during the Budget period with its plans, which we all believed were under the surface anyhow, to privatise Telecom Australia, hoping to bury it away. But it is not buried away. The Budget was such a ho-hum exercise that focus has been brought into particular sharpness today by Senator Alston having a go at his favourite portfolio-we all know what a reluctant shadow Minister for social security he is-by bringing this matter of public importance before the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition will totally privatise-that is official. The National Party of Australia has sold out its country constituents. This flows from the blind, unquestioning lip-service that is paid to mythical goals of competition and deregulation-lip-service paid not only, regrettably, by the Opposition, but also, particularly of late, by the Government. I hope that Senator Collins in this debate has not been engaging in any way in a similar sort of exercise to that in which we have seen the Opposition engaging on the question of telecommunications carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> I took Senator Collins to be saying that we should not put up the provision of community service obligations and its cost as a Budget item because that would be vulnerable. It certainly would be vulnerable under a coalition government at any future time. But Senator Collins did not say how those community service obligation costs would be met. He did not say that cross-subsidies would be retained. All he said was that we would retain public ownership. The question is: How would the community service obligation of our telecommunications carrier, which under a Labor Government will continue, as he has said, to be in public ownership, be met? It is a key question which has not yet been answered. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers Beazley and Keating have skilfully directed the debate from the question, `Do we need competition?' to `How much competition will we have?'. They have done so without providing any concrete evidence, any more than the Opposition has, as to why competition is necessary or even desirable, and avoiding the detail of where there is to be competition, what kind of competition it should be and, most particularly, in which regulatory regime that competition will be introduced. The two key questions that remain unanswered by Senator Collins's somewhat passionate speech are those: how will the community service obligation costs be met, and within which regulatory regime will competition be introduced?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats and many others, including significant sections of the Australian Labor Party, are convinced that deregulation will disadvantage the average consumer. We have already experienced deregulation of financial institutions. In 1983 we were promised viable financial institutions maintaining consumer-oriented practices. But what did we get? We got bigger profits for banks, higher charges and interest rates for consumers, and instability in the financial sector. As a Victorian I have seen some of the worst results of that instability, and I am sure that the Federal Labor Government is not terribly happy with the consequences for its Victorian colleagues of some of the results of that financial deregulation. It is our contention that we can expect for ordinary Australian consumers a similar result in the area of telecommunications. Therefore we remain implacably opposed to competition on the basic telecommunications network. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that it is not just the Australian Democrats and some elements of the Australian Labor Party who have these concerns. The term `telecommunications users' was used by Senator Alston in his speech. I point out that there is a national network of telecommunications users which has as its constituent member organisations the following groups, whose members represent the wider community and who are extremely concerned about the trend in this debate: the Australian Consumers Association; the Australian Council of Social Service; the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association; the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, some of whose members I saw in the gallery earlier today; the Communications Law Centre; Disabled Peoples International; the National Council of Women; the Rural Telephone Subscribers Association; and the Telecom Action Group. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's telecommunications system is, of course, our nerve centre. The nation's cohesiveness, its efficiency, its competition and its security are all dependent upon that system, a system which the Opposition wants to sell to the highest bidder. It is our contention that the system currently serves Australia well. Telecom bashing has become almost a refined national sport in recent years. The result has been the development of a public perception that Telecom is not serving the country's interests well. I must say that the spokesperson for the chief coach in that national sport for many years has been Senator Alston. He is doing it again today. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the fact that neither the Opposition nor the Government particularly likes letting the facts get in the way of a good argument, I think we should look at the facts in this debate. If we ever hear facts from the Opposition and lately from the Government, they actually tend to come from the same source. It is quite interesting that Professor Henry Ergas, one of the key advisers, first of all to the Opposition, and now to the Department of Transport and Communications and the OTC Ltd, at least seems to provide `the facts'. Those are `the facts' that are being used by the Opposition-and have been used for many years-and that now are being used in the argument between the Beazley model and the Keating model on the Government side. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are other sources of facts. I commend to the Senate and to all who are interested in this debate Mr Jack Keavney's book, Telecommunications: The Time for Truth. Jack Keavney is not exactly a public sector monopolist advocate. He is a former Director of the Freedom from Hunger campaign. His earlier book, Private enterprise the winning way, argued the legitimacy of profit and the benefits of competition. He has a long record in private industry. </PARA>
<PARA> He wrote this book because in his line of business travelling overseas he had so many bad experiences with these wonderful telecommunications networks that we are supposed to want for this country. He came back here and was so pleased with the contrast between what he has experienced here as a business person and what he has experienced overseas. I do commend this publication as an independent voice in this debate claiming that the information we are getting both from the Government and the Opposition is far from independent. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just put some examples on the record. In the 1988-89 financial year, Telecom Australia made a profit of $973m for all Australians. Senator Alston came here and kicked it around the head for doing that. The average charge to consumers for a basic service increased by just 1.2 per cent, well below the consumer price index. Telecom had an operating revenue of $7,977m. That was an 11 per cent increase over the previous year. Costs rose by only 9 per cent, reflecting efficiency in productivity gains. There was an improvement in labour productivity of 12 per cent, and between 1985 and 1989 Telecom trimmed full time staff numbers by over 10,000 workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, Telecom currently purchases around 90 per cent of its materials and services from other Australian companies, and 70 per cent of those materials and services are Australian made. The value that Telecom added to these goods and services in 1988-89 was somewhere in the region of $6.4 billion, a contribution of 2.6 per cent to Australia's gross domestic product, probably the largest contribution of any individual Australian enterprise, an enterprise which is owned by us, the general public. Out of this Telecom was required to pay to the Government payroll tax of $136m. So I claim it is a myth that Telecom is not serving us well, because the reality is different. Remember, it is owned by all Australians still. </PARA>
<PARA> OTC, our international carrier, is recognised as being internationally competitive and innovative, and its charges are the lowest in the world in purchasing power parity terms. Aussat Pty Ltd seemed to be the albatross around the neck of Australian telecommunications. As recently as yesterday in the Australian Financial Review, Professor Bill Melody, former chief economist to the United States Federal Communications Commission and now Director of the Centre for International Research on Communications and Information Technologies in Melbourne, called Aussat a potential goldmine. He believes it could capture 8 to 10 per cent of the total market using its own and Telecom's capacity. Why hand a goldmine over to private interests when it could make money for all Australians?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats propose to bring these telecommunications carriers together to allow a stronger base to compete internationally and ensure the best provision to the public. We need to beef up Austel and set in place a regulatory regime so that where we do introduce competition-and not on the basic network, in our view-it is seen to be and is, in fact, in the interests of the wider community and in the interests of genuine increased efficiency and not in the interests of some private corporate entity. We must always come back to the question of whether or not competition is valuable in the wider community context. We need to consider the effect deregulation will have on average consumers, those people that I listed earlier, both in terms of the costs of services provided and the equity of access to those services. Access must never be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> Proponents of deregulation on both sides are very selectively presenting overseas data to try to con the public. Again these are more facts that get in the way of a good argument. In the United States (US) in 1984, the ATT monopoly, which was a private monopoly, was broken up. In the 50 years prior to that, the average cost of the telephone service had declined by approximately 60 per cent. In the first year of divestiture, customers' telephone bills actually increased by an average of 17.1 per cent. The fierce competition is along the thick routes. That would happen here. Local calls would become more expensive. Subscriber trunk dialling (STD) zones would get smaller, so the higher charges would begin sooner. Big business would be the beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other facts which I am not going to have time to put on the record, but the end result is that many citizens in the end cannot afford telephones. There has been an attempt in the US to target the community service obligation payments, and it has failed. In Maryland, for instance, it costs $70 to disperse $42 of assistance. Yet we want to substitute cross-subsidy within an efficient public carrier making hundreds of millions of dollars for us Australians for something as inefficient as that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United Kingdom (UK), Mercury, the competitor, will not install phones in country homes. Mercury callers cannot access British Telecom phones, and 20 per cent of people in the UK now cannot afford phones. Canadians, of course, are required to pay for directory assistance, and within the metropolitan areas local calls are now timed. In New Zealand local calls are free, but STD rates are much higher than in Australia and they apply in a much smaller area.</PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, public monopolies maintained in such countries as France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands all have top quality telecommunications systems. The Australian Democrats reject this gung ho privatisation and deregulation introduction of competition approach. It has been taken on both sides. The only beneficiaries would be big business and those consumers on the thick routes, the Canberra-Sydney-Melbourne axis in the south-east corner of Australia. Cream skimming would leave Telecom to shoulder the burden of remote users and other less profitable sectors. We must ask the question, particularly of the Opposition but also of the Government-which would debilitate Telecom by free introduction across the board of competition-if Telecom had been on the market five years ago, who would have bought it? The answer is Alan Bond. Where would we and the consumers of Australia be now? He had to go to Chile. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just say that the Democrats are entirely behind the continuation of a strong and combined telecommunications carrier in this country, the retention of cross-subsidy and the retention of good, efficient service. We are not saying that there is not a need for further efficiencies-there is-but that that should be our goal through a publicly owned telecommunications carrier in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate says that he was right. Indeed, the Prime Minister was right, and ever since the election we have seen to whom that statement applies-the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and this Hawke Labor Government. Consequently, and sadly to the detriment of all Australians, we have seen this Government, ever since that March election, racked by bitterness, dissension and division across a whole range of issues, between a whole range of Ministers, and between Ministers and the back bench. As a result this Government is now quite unable to take decisions which are urgent, which are necessary and which are in the interests of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among the most important of these issues, of course, is the future of telecommunications as an industry in Australia. What we see in the words of the matter of public importance which has been proposed by the Opposition today is the Government's continuing refusal to put the national interest, in a fully competitive telecommunications industry, ahead of its factional agendas. The Government has sacrificed the national interest to the self-interested demands of its left wing factions. Despite its own acknowledgment that one of the key areas for micro-economic reform must be the introduction of competition in the telecommunications industry, it has heeded the self-interested howls of protest from the unions, and from its own factional opponents, and agreed to defer any decisions with regard to the future of Telecom Australia until it has been told what to do by the delegates at a national Labor conference next month. The result is that we have a duly elected government that is afraid to take hard decisions. It is afraid to govern without the say-so of its back room manipulators in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Government in total disarray, with Ministers making conflicting statements on telecommunications reform, and bickering publicly about which options should be adopted or, indeed, if any should be adopted. The monumental failure of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to make any provisions for micro-economic reform in last night's Budget is a tragedy of enormous proportions for the future of this country. It is yet one more opportunity which this Government has wasted to try to remedy some of the damage it has done to the Australian economy over the last seven years. None of the crucial issues of micro-economic reform were addressed in last night's Budget. Australians, in particular with regard to this debate, will still have to put up with an inefficient and costly Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue is up in real terms in last night's Budget, but it depends heavily on slugging provisional taxpayers, and squeezing government instrumentalities such as Telecom and others. The Treasurer should have used last night's Budget as a centrepiece for a three-year strategy of comprehensive structural reform. This of course involves an anti-inflationary strategy, as was outlined in the coalition's Economic Action Plan, industrial relations reform, transport reform, privatisation, taxation reform and most importantly, in the context of this debate, telecommunications reform. But none of these were addressed in last night's Budget. If one had listened to the Budget Speech, and read the Budget Papers, one would think that they were not important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the need for telecommunications reform the submission which the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, put to Cabinet, with regard to reform, analysed the benefits of competition to the consumers and concluded that telephone charges would be lower for most consumers. His submission drew evidence from a wide range of studies, and reports, to support conclusions which the coalition had already been advocating for a long time. The benefits of competition, which the Cabinet submission identified, include: greater productivity resulting in significant cost savings; lower tariffs and charges, especially on long distance calls; a wider choice of services and products; and an improved service to customers as management competed for customers. Despite all this evidence the Government cannot agree on what is best for the communications industry. It is no further towards implementing any changes than it was when it came to office seven years ago. It seems to have missed the point that competition is the key to improving service, and also to achieving lower costs, not only in telecommunications but in all areas of industry including service industries. </PARA>
<PARA> We have on the right-hand side Minister Beazley advocating a merger of Telecom and the OTC Ltd to form megacom, perhaps more accurately described by some as monstercom, presumably based on the `big is beautiful' theory, and to sell off Aussat Pty Ltd to form the base of a second private network. The whole of Mr Beazley's duopoly plan of combining Telecom and OTC and having only one other competitor in Aussat is seriously flawed. Austel pointed out in its recent report on mobile telephones that duopolies bring few benefits, but have real disadvantages. There can be no real competition when there are only two so-called competitors because they get together, rig the market, and deny the consumer the benefits that wider competition can bring. In the middle, of course, we have the Treasurer wanting to sell off OTC to form a second competitive network. On the left side we have the left wing factions of the Labor Party and the unions, most particularly the telecommunications unions, burying their heads in the sand and refusing to contemplate anything that remotely smacks of competition or privatisation, with their ideologically blinkered and self-interested arguments being applied to the issue. </PARA>

<PARA>If that is not a challenge to micro-economic reform, I do not know what is. The response that we have heard from Senator Collins has been interesting. It is also interesting that Senator Beahan is to speak for the Government later in this debate but Senator Childs, who is one of the most vocal opponents of any change to Telecom, is not speaking in this debate. He has been gagged by the Government because it knows of the division that racks it and it does not want that put on public display in this debate today. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we do not only have dis- agreement on the Government side as to which is the correct path to follow; there is also disagreement about when it will make a decision. Micro-economic reform, of which this major change to our telecommunications industry is a very important part, was supposed to have been a major goal of this Government during its last three-year term of office. Despite its re-election in March, and one would therefore presume with the support of the Australian people to belatedly proceed with some of these reforms, it cannot do so. That is because the Labor Party comes before the Australian people. The views of the Labor Party are given more prominence than the views of the Australian community. As I said earlier, the Government needs the approval of a special national conference of the ALP before it can do anything, if ever it can decide which path it will eventually follow. The Government did not act during its last term in government and, of course, after its re-election Ministers Beazley and Keating indicated that change was urgent and it would be detailed in the Budget. They acknowledged that an urgent decision was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as a fortnight ago Senator Cook agreed that it was important for telecommunications changes to be detailed and announced in the Budget. But the Government has allowed its hands to be tied by the unions and by factional disputes. We now see the decision is delayed to some indeterminate future time after the September special conference. Just look at a sample of some of the headlines in the newspapers, as a result of this indecision and brawling which are going on in the Labor Party, `Keating faces Telecom defeat; Dawkins concerned over Beazley's megacom deal; Telecom reforms anger ALP factions; Left warns Government: Keep to policy; Keating's ``arrogance'' riles backbencher; Beazley's grand plan clashes with Labor Party platform; ALP lines crossed in brawl over megacom; Reform urgent, PM tells Beazley'-that is a laugh and yet there is no sign of any reform. We see delay and procrastination despite the overwhelming evidence in favour of competition in the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> When New Zealand introduced competition and deregulation overall prices fell by 21 per cent, in real terms, between 1988 and 1989. In Japan, competition has resulted in lower charges for many services, including trunk calls, cellular phones and pagers; and, of course, there was no increase in the cost of local calls. Australia does not compare well with other developed countries in the areas of communication charges and productivity. Australia has the second most expensive local telephone call charges after Britain on a three-minute basis. Our local call charge is 21c compared to Japan's charge of 9c. Canada and the United States do not charge for local calls at all, although a local call area is admittedly somewhat smaller than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the improvements in the New Zealand telecommunications system after deregulation there. Before deregulation it took six weeks to get a telephone installed; now it takes two to three days. It used to take two days for a repair team to arrive; now it arrives within hours. There used to be 85 lines per employee and already their workplace efficiency has increased so that there are 98. Of course, there is scope for further improvement there. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the improvement in call charges. Where there has been partial deregulation of the Australian telecommunications structure in the international sphere, there has been a general fall in communication costs. These range from a 5.6 per cent fall in international telephone call charges to an 11 per cent drop in international telex charges in the last year. Telecommunications cost analysts, NUS International, which provided these figures, say that the partial deregulation of the industry with regard to its international aspect in July 1989 is responsible for Australia's improving position on international communications costs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the evidence for the benefits of deregulation, yet the Labor Party and this Government continue to refuse to act on this evidence and evidence put to its own Cabinet. Even if it was willing to ignore its ACTU masters, the proposals that it is looking at do not begin to go far enough and would not produce real and effective competition. I have referred to that earlier in my remarks. All that the Government's proposals would do would be to strengthen government control and deny Australian consumers the benefits of real competition. It would appear that it is only the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, which has a firm commitment to the degree of competition that is required. In this country we desperately need a telecommunications system that provides the best service possible to the whole Australian community, can be delivered at economic and affordable costs, is based on sound economic and investment decisions, will stimulate investment, employment, exports and technological advances, and meets the needs of customers on installation, maintenance and service standards. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is obvious that only the Liberal and National parties have a complete and consistent plan for full and effective competition in communications. Privatisation is a key aspect of ensuring effective competition and the benefits that that will bring to all Australians. Therefore, a coalition government will have, as its first priority with regard to telecommunications, full and effective competition. Upon election to government, it will proceed immediately with the privatisation of Telecom, OTC and Aussat within that framework of full and effective competition in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> The timing, pace and conditions of that privatisation will be determined having regard to all relevant factors and the capital market's ability to provide the funds. It will be managed to ensure that Australians retain majority ownership and control of strategic telecommunications assets. Of great importance in the privatisation process will be the opportunity given to employees of Telecom, OTC and Aussat in acquiring shares. There are other details of the Liberal and National parties' policies. But this Government refuses to act. Only a future coalition government will achieve the desired goal. </PARA>

They must be hard pressed in thinking up topics for matters of public importance, given, as Senator Collins has pointed out, their previous record in this area and their proposed policy-if a two-page press release can be given the honour of being described as a policy. I am happy to cross swords with the Opposition on this subject because it demonstrates fundamental differences between the Opposition and the Government, between the Liberal and National parties' approach to policy formulation and that of the Australian Labor Party and the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition have trouble coping with the concept of internal party debate or, for that matter, with the concept of community consensus. They very often criticise the concept of consensus in this place. They are a top down organisation. They have always been a top down organisation, and they are showing no signs of changing to fit a changing world. It seems to me that they are relating much more to some of the moribund nations of eastern Europe, which are now finding that the top down way of operating simply does not work and that community consensus is the way to go if one is going to get anywhere. In their parties the membership has no real say, nor have they ever had any. Coalition members of parliament in this place can ignore party policy. The coalition platform does not have the standing that a party platform of the Labor Party has. Labor's platform is binding on members. The rank and file of the Party have a say in the processes of policy making, have a say in the ultimate policy and bind their parliamentarians to follow the policies that are decided by a much wider group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties do not work like that. As I have said, they are top down. So their party conferences become meaningless, empty talkfests, with the television coverage focused on the bulky figure of John Elliott swaggering around, rather than with any substantial debate around any issue. Everybody, including the journalists, knows that ultimately it does not matter what is decided at those conferences, because the parliamentarians are free to do what they want to when they get here. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, the Labor Party takes its internal democracy seriously. I am not ashamed of that; I do not think that anybody should be. It has done this for nearly 100 years now. Members opposite need to be reminded that the Labor Party is not only the oldest party in continuous existence in Australia-it will be celebrating its centennial next year-but is also arguably the oldest social democratic party in the world; although there are some arguments about that with Germany. It has a structure which, whilst not perfect-and I would be the first to admit that-makes a genuine attempt to involve members and to involve through those members the broader community. It tries to achieve consensus between the various points of view on some of these fundamental and substantial issues. The fact that there is widespread debate, particularly on issues which go to fundamental beliefs of party members and, by extension, fundamental beliefs of the community that they represent, is an historical feature of the Labor Party. I believe it is a strength, not a weakness. I am certainly not ashamed of it. I am a lot prouder of that sort of process then I would be of the sort of process that drives both the Liberal Party and the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The factions are a part of that process. I am not going to mount a defence of factions, because I do not think I have to defend factions to members of the Opposition; it is really none of their business. But the factions are a part of this process. They are an informal means by which internal party debate is organised and co-ordinated. Factions have become the focus for various streams of opinion within the Party. The Party itself represents a wide cross-section of opinion. In the main, factions fulfil a positive role. Senator Alston's posed concern, and Senator Chapman's for that matter, about the role of factions sit uncomfortably with the views of the State President of Senator Alston's own Party in his own State-Victoria. Michael Kroger, the Director of the Liberal Party in Victoria, made it quite clear that he thought that it might be worth considering introducing into the Liberal Party a factional system similar to that of the Labor Party, because we seem to manage our affairs much better. He was sat upon fairly quickly and he has not said it too many times since, but he did say it initially, and I believe that is his view, despite the fact that he has been told not to express it because it might make it seem as though we are more successful than they are. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no problem with debate on this important issue. I think that is a healthy process; I think it is a process that the Liberal and National parties might copy; nor do I have a problem with the role of factions in facilitating this process. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion refers to the Government's continuing refusal to put the national interest in a fully competitive telecommunications industry ahead of its own factional agenda. It is because the Government is committed to finding a solution in the national interest that the debate is going on. It seems to me, given the two-page statement of policy that the press release from Neil Brown indicates, that the Liberal Party and the National Party would be well advised to go through the same process, because it is very clear from that document that there has not been very much thought given to the implications of the apparently very simple things that are expressed in that document. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the Opposition, the Government is not driven by blind ideology, as Senator Collins has already indicated. It is not quasi-religious zeal that determines our policies. The whole approach of this debate towards the telecommunications question recognises that the telecommunications industry is a strategic industry of considerable importance. It recognises that it is undergoing rapid change with almost exponential developments in the technologies that drive change within the systems at a national level. It recognises that the telecommunications industry must be positioned firstly to provide a modern, efficient, technologically advanced and competitively priced system for the domestic market; that that system should be a seamless system, where a phone call in a country area can get through to any part of the world with relative ease-not like the system that applies, for example, in America, which is often cited by the Opposition, where it is fine if a caller lives in New York or San Francisco or Chicago; but he should try making a call to Australia from Phoenix and see how he goes. If he can get anybody who even understands where Australia is, he will then be shunted from one company to another until he finds one that can actually give him a link through to Australia. That is not a seamless system; it is not an efficient system; but it is, as a result, an increasingly expensive system. It certainly does not compare with the system that we have here. </PARA>
<PARA> A telecommunications system needs to position itself, then, to provide that modern, efficient, technologically advanced system at the domestic level, and that system needs to be seamless. It also needs to position itself to be able to take advantage of the rapid growth in telecommunications around the world and particularly in our region. It needs to have a critical mass to be able to compete with some of the massive organisations at an international level in the region where this development is occurring. It needs to position itself to achieve the development of a domestic telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A telecommunications system also needs to recognise that the telecommunications industry must also satisfy certain social and economic imperatives. It must ensure, for example, the delivery of community service obligations (CSOs). It must ensure the fulfilment of regulatory requirements, including the setting of technical standards, for example. It must ensure that once adjustments are made for the costs of providing CSOs and regulatory requirements, it should earn an appropriate commercial rate of return on the funds it employs, and that it should earn that return not by pushing up prices but by creating greater efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite what has been said by the Opposition, much has already been done, because the current debate is part of a long process of reform, starting in 1975 in the Whitlam years. Nothing happened in the intervening period, but it was taken up again in 1983 by this Government. So Labor has a very good record, and one in stark contrast with the Opposition's record, which Senator Collins has already drawn attention to, with Aussat being the Opposition's only claim to fame-and a pretty poor one at that. Even the Davidson report was being dumped by the Fraser Government in the years just before we come to government. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has already been done. Telecom's regulatory function has been transferred to Austel. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has carried out detailed investigations into the identification and costing of Telecom's community service obligations. In all government enterprises, realistic figures of the value of their assets and of the total funds employed have been compiled so that, for example, through different accounting systems Australia Post found, when it revalued its assets, that it had to add $1 billion to the sum total of its assets. That has been done to Telecom as well.</PARA>
<PARA> The consumer price index (CPI), minus X formula has been applied. That is a formula by means of which increases in Telecom and OTC charges must, on average, be below the general rate of inflation by a defined margin. The margin is now at about four points below the CPI. There has also been more liberal access given for Australian users to Intelsat and other satellite systems. These have all been part of a whole raft of reforms to which these next stages are going to add. It is not simply a one-off thing, as to reform has never occurred before. We have been reforming telecommunications in this country on a consistent basis since 1975 with very little help from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Now there is a need to look at two issues in this reform process. One is enterprise structures, and the other is the sources of funds to maintan and expand these enterprises, not only in telecommunications but in other government business enterprises as well. The Government has been involved in a process of gradual reform, as I have said, not only in Telecom but in all government business enterprises, with the aim of developing-in telecommunications, in this case-a system which maximises the benefits to individual consumers and the nation as a whole through improved efficiency in the provision of services. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, the Opposition's policy, in so far as it can be called a policy, is predicated, as I have said, on a blind ideological belief in privatisation. This belief expressed frequently with almost religious tones by the Opposition is that privately owned enterprises are somehow superior per se to the publicly owned enterprises. That is simply not so and it is demonstrably not so. It is predicated on the faulty premise that privatisation is synonymous with competition. There are very good examples of that in England, where privatisation has not led to competition. It has led to a duopoly that is very highly regulated and which is being complained about by almost everybody there. A recent report by Professor Michael Beesley and Mr Bruce Laidlaw of the Institute of Economic Affairs is called `The Future of Telecommunications'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Major decisions taken when BT was privatised have tended to produce less competition than is now possible and desirable and unless modified will continue to do so. Mercury's-</PARA>
<PARA>which is the second carrier in England-</PARA>
<PARA>present strategy offers an insufficient direct challenge to BT on price, quality of service, or range of customers served. Although it has the potential to do much more, it is not likely to become a formidable alternative to BT in the long term without a change in policy. </PARA>
<PARA>There are other consumer responses which are negative in respect of competitive achievements as well. It is a policy which does not concern itself with benefits to individual consumers. It does not concern itself with the nation. It does not concern itself with the achievement of increased efficiency or of lower prices. To the extent that it shows any concern for CSOs, as Senator Collins has already pointed out, this is undermined by its system of funding. I would not trust our Treasurer to maintin CSO levels as a line item in the Budget year by year. I certainly would not trust the opposition if it were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I have no concern about the open debate that is occurring within my Party. I think that is a positive thing on an issue which is highly complex and which deserves that sort of attention. Finally, the Government can make its decision in its own good time, not when the Opposition says it ought to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This telecommunications debate is really about competing interests. It is the national interest versus the Australian Labor Party (ALP) political faction interests. What it is really about is who will succeed Bob Hawke. We all know that both Keating and Beazley want to be the next Prime Minister. Until now nobody thought that there was any competition for the current Treasurer (Mr Keating). Well, a victory for Beazley in this debate will help his prospects no end. It seems that Keating is staring defeat in the face on this issue and that the failure of Mr Dawkins, the Keating ally, to convince the Centre Left of the need for competition-and he has clearly failed to convince Senator Beahan-is bad news for the Treasurer. The Centre Left's faction convener, Senator Beahan, said that the faction's position `certainly would not be very close to the Keating position'. That is putting it on the line. There will be no support there for Keating. Even within his own faction Keating is losing out and Mr Beazley's aspirations are getting a shot in the arm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What about Senator Richardson's nice intervention in this debate? He is a good numbers man. When Senator Richardson comes out and says, `I don't think it really matters' you can bet your bottom dollar it matters a hell of a lot. But Mr Keating is bound not to take defeat on this issue lying down. There are reports that the Treasurer wanted to take Austel away from Mr Beazley's portfolio. He has been successful in these endeavours before; he was quite successful in taking the Industries Assistance Commission away from Senator Button and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Of course, when Michelle Grattan criticised the Treasurer in the Age the other day she said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he has also let his impatience and arrogance run free. He has acted as though he is the Communications Minister'.</PARA>
<PARA>So this debate is clearly about who will have the power when Bob Hawke goes. It is all about numbers. That is not the way to run a debate in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Beahan, who claimed not to be concerned with ideology, is a colleague of Senator Childs who managed this wonderful quote last week in relation to the proposed ALP conference on this issue:</PARA>
<PARA> We know we haven't got a majority at the conference, but we believe from the reports of other sections of the party that we can get something that is in conformity with the spirit of our platform and yet might-</PARA>
<PARA>note the word `might'-</PARA>
<PARA>satisfy the need to have a modern, effective telecommunications system. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not terrific? With a bit of juggling around the edges the factions might let Australia have an efficient and modern telecommunications system. Yet Senator Beahan tells me that this is not about ideology. We have heard from both Senator Chapman and Senator Alston, who outlined very successfully the arguments, the disagreements and the ructions that are running through the Labor Party on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston clearly outlined the desire of the trade unions to have total control over our telecommunication systems, come what may. From Senator Collins we got what I can only describe as an historical and hysterical contribution. It bore little relevance to the entire debate. He was simply trying to argue that the Opposition, by introducing a strong and powerful debate at this stage in the new Parliament, was somehow at odds with the position it had taken before the election. In case honourable senators had not noticed, this is a brand new policy; it is one that we will be promoting hard and strong; it has a lot to do with the interests of Australians and nothing to do with ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> These arguments were typical of a man trying to defend the indefensible-the Labor Party's lack of a coherent policy in the area of micro-economic reform which is highlighted by this telecommunications debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell made the usual confused Democrat contribution. As always, she was trying to be the lackey of the Government while trying to appear independent at the same time. When Senator Beahan, belonging as he does to the great party of nationalisers, gave us his apology for the faction system, he deigned to mention eastern Europe, which is finally throwing off the yoke of oppression of nationalised ownership of all those things which make up a free economy. Eastern European countries will be taking the bull by the horns and entering into free market economies and they will surpass us if we have this Government in control much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very positive things to say about this new policy of ours. First, Australia needs an honest and effective telecommunications system with true competition, which will result in our having efficient and cheaper services for consumers and better opportunities for exporters. We certainly do not need to repeat the error of the two-airline policy. Mr Beazley is advocating a duopoly. He would give us again the errors of the two-airline policy, with one government-owned entity and one free enterprise entity, resulting in a cost plus situation instead of competition to give effective lower prices to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to place Telecom into private hands in order to have a truly competitive system which gives benefits, as I said, to exporters and consumers alike in the domestic market. Very simply, we would have a system which would provide the best service possible to the whole Australian community, which could be delivered at economic and affordable costs, which would be based on sound economic and investment decisions, which would stimulate investment, employment, exports and technological advances, and which would meet the needs of all consumers on installation, maintenance and service standards. </PARA>
<PARA> What is wrong with the telecommunication system we have got? Let us take a look at the management objectives. In its August edition, the Business Council Bulletin considered the New Zealand experience, and defined the necessary elements. Management objectives were high on that list of priorities. At the moment we have a great problem with poorly specified and contradictory objectives for management. Managers require clear and unambiguous objectives to maximise the commercial performance of any firm. It should not be up to Telecom managers to assess non-commercial objectives; that is the role for politicians to be pursued in a cost effective way; that is our job. Managers require authority to make key decisions required to achieve efficient commercial outcomes. They must be free to make those decisions on recruitment, remuneration, dismissals and procurement of inputs. The sacking of George Maltby of the OTC Ltd reveals that managers in telecommunications in this country have little authority to make managerial decisions. But managers should be allowed to manage. </PARA>
<PARA> Under a government regime, reporting requirements are artificially set. The most appropriate form of stewardship is demanded by shareholders in the operation of the market. That requires true competition. Salaries need to be linked to performance. There must be a genuine attempt-and this was denied to OTC-to allow bodies to operate in an effective way. </PARA>
<PARA> From the New Zealand experience we have seen some salutary lessons. A whole new structure of Telecom has removed the costly controls imposed by old, centralised, bureaucratic structures. Very specifically, staff numbers have been reduced by 1,400 in the head office, while the total work force has been reduced from 25,000 to 19,000 and it is expected to fall to 14,000 by the end of the year. More efficient pricing is being achieved through the removal of cross-subsidies between local and long distance calls. Consumers have already benefited from 20 per cent reduction of toll rates and business rental reductions. Contracting out of services is being used extensively. The rate at which telephones are being installed has increased fourfold while the waiting time for the installation of telephone lines has been reduced from six weeks to less than 72 hours for 96 per cent of customers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has criticised the Hawke Government for its lack of sound telecommunications policies. The OECD has maintained that greater private sector participation and competition should be allowed. Specifically it proposed that repairs and installation should be open to the private sector. Competition between existing transmission modes could be increased and modi- fications to the structure of telecommunications prices introduced to bring them more in line with marginal costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has asserted that somehow we use privatisation as a credo. We certainly do assert that the private system produces more efficient results than does public ownership. But before anyone becomes involved in the privatisation debate for Telecom or anything else it is really necessary to get rid of a few myths. First is the point that privatisation needs three things to be viable: one, it needs to bring about an improvement for consumers; two, it needs to bring about an improvement for employees; and, three, it needs to bring about employment for managers. If we meet those three criteria the benefits are most valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> Very often the privatisation debate becomes confused with the need to reduce debt as though somehow the reason for privatisation is merely the retirement of government debt. But the efficiency gain is the primary role for privatisation. Secondly, it is a nonsense to assert that when a government has a so-called community service obligation, that government must somehow be involved in the production of that service. That quite clearly is a non sequitur. In most cases, social objectives can be pursued through far more efficient means of transfer payments than through the direct provision of subsidised services. </PARA>
<PARA> The most vital efficiency improvement can be derived only through the final step of private ownership. The Opposition has brought forward this policy which it will propound and propose in a most definite and determined way. Only with the full involvement of the private sector can there be provided the necessary incentives to provide Australians with a system of telecommunications that has been denied them. Privatisation will ensure that employees who buy into telecommunications will at last have a genuine stake in the performance of these firms. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time in this country we have one million shareholders and we have three million trade unionists. I look forward to the day when in this country we have more shareholders than we have trade unionists. I look forward to the day when we have more people who have a stake in Australia's future, who are willing to invest in Australia's future, than we have people who are simply an appendage to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has brought forward this policy at this time because it believes that it is important that if micro-economic reform is to be achieved it has to be put on the agenda at this time. The Government has fudged through two elections claiming that it was dedicated to micro-economic reform. And it fails every test. It failed in its last term and it will fail in this term. As I said right at the beginning, this debate on telecommunications is about who will succeed Bob Hawke, not whether or not Australia gets a better telecommunications system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(South Australia) (4.44)-In speaking in this debate, I first want to respond to Senator Bishop's comment about hoping one day to see more shareholders in Australia than trade unionists. If I am correct, Senator Bishop is a fully qualified lawyer and as such I believe she is probably a member of the New South Wales Law Society which would have to be one of the most effective trade unions in Australia. It is a trade union that has the luxury that no other trade union has. Not only does it act as a trade union in the protection of its member interests but over the years it has been given under statutory laws of various States the right to set its own fees, its own salaries and its own conditions. I hope that in the micro-economic reform debate that we are having in this country Senator Bishop does not always direct her attention at the blue-collar workers whom she seems to despise. I hope that she also looks at the professional groups such as the legal profession that she is a member of and that under any definition is ripping off people in this country, is inefficient and has more restrictive trade practices operating than any other professional interest group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to see decent micro-economic reform operating not just in the area of traditional industry but also in the area of the professions.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get back to the topic. I will get back to the topic of telecommunications. As a member of the Federal parliamentary Labor caucus transport and communications committee, I belong to a number of subcommittees which are debating and dealing with this issue of telecommunications. I have a long interest in telecommunications. During the Whitlam Government I was principal private secretary to the then Postmaster-General when the old Postmaster-General's Department was broken up into two commissions-the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Postal Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to point out to Senator Bishop and other Opposition members that since the end of the Second World War the only changes that have taken place in telecommunications and the communications industry have occurred under Labor governments. In the late 1940s it was the Chifley Government that established the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. For the next 23 years Liberal coalition governments did not do a thing in telecommunications except allow the then Country Party to rort the system of telecommunications. As someone quite rightly pointed out, under the policies of the then Country Party it would have been cheaper for the Postmaster-General's Department to buy a farm than connect it with a telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government established the two commissions. What did the Fraser Government do for the next seven years? Nothing, except respond to Kerry Packer's suggestion that we ought to have a satellite system in Australia. Kerry Packer woke up that it was going to go broke so he got out of it. The Labor Government inherited Austel which, at the last count, has probably lost something like $600m to $800m. So, a Labor Government has always bitten the bullet on making changes and reform in telecommunications. So when we hear the members of the Opposition bleating now about not enough change being made, that they are the only ones with the solution, we have to be more than a little cynical. </PARA>
<PARA> The only thing we have seen from the Opposition is a two-page statement released, I think, yesterday or the day before, by Mr Neil Brown, the shadow Minister for communications, outlining the Opposition's full privatisation program. I think that whether one believes, disagrees with or supports privatisation or deregulation, one aspect of this statement that has not been given the publicity that it should be-I hope it will be in the future-is paragraph 6 where the Opposition outlines how it is going to handle community service obligations (CSOs). How would the Opposition fund the loss making areas in telecommunications in Australia? Quite simply, it would put it in the Budget. I cannot think of any promise that the Australian public is more likely to treat with mistrust. </PARA>
<PARA> A coalition government may put the community service obligation in a Budget. But we all know that in a year or so, when things get a bit tough and the coalition is looking for a few savings, it will be the first to say, `Well, we'll cut $200m off the CSO and put it back on the consumers'. We know that is what would happen. The coalition certainly would not go and ask its mates in private industry, who would be running the private sector in a deregulated and privatised telecommunications system, to make a reasonable contribution when they are cream skimming against Telecom. I think that is going to become an important part of the debate. At least I can say to the Opposition, `I am glad you put it in writing; we finally know how you are going to try to fund CSOs'.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two months my colleague Senator Burns and I, as members of the Telecom working party of the Caucus committee, have sat through eight or 10 full days hearing ranges of submissions from all sides. I now have a stack of paper about five foot high of all these submissions. A couple of things came out of all these submissions, from all sides-from both the public and private sectors, from the carriers, from the private interest groups, from the pressure groups, from the public and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing is for certain: there is no Western country that has an open, freely competitive, free market system of telecommunications, and nobody proposes it. No-one says, `We want to have a free market'. When you say to some of the people in the private sector who want to have some competition, some opening up of the system, `Well, let's be fair dinkum. Let's have a complete free market. Let's have no regulation. Whoever wants to establish a system, go for it and do it', they are all absolutely horrified. When it comes to the bottom line they want only one thing: a duopoly, a triopoly or a quadropoly. All they want is the license to get a cut of the action. They do not want competition from other people. They just want to be given the license to have a section of the action, a section of the profits. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of these people made it quite clear that in a duopoly or a triopoly, or even under the regulated system that Senator Bishop and the Opposition are proposing in their document, even with a privatised Telecom, there will be only three or four operators. They will not want anybody else coming in competing in an open market. They will want us with regulation, with a tribe of regulators-100 or 1,000 more regulators than we have at the moment-to ensure that they are protected, that they do not get open competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States of America is used as the great example of open competition. The Chairman of Bell South-and I do not think he would mind my mentioning his name-came to Australia and gave evidence to our committee. I do not think that was the only reason he was in Australia, but he was certainly keen to give evidence to our committee. He explained that when American Telephone and Telegraph (ATT), the regulated monopoly in America in the early eighties, was broken up, the one big monopoly was replaced with about half a dozen regional monopolies. He said that as an executive in ATT he opposed the break-up. But once it was established he found that in the area of Bell South, covering the 43 million people of the southern States of America, it had a stronger monopoly than ATT had. It is able to buy up more of the small private telephone companies. No-one can compete against it; it controls the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The only area in which there is open competition in America amongst a number of competitors-but again it is regulated; there is a set number-is that of trunk calls between different regions of America. But in Bell South's area, the southern States of America, there is no competition on local telephone calls. There is a regulated, guaranteed monopoly for Bell South. There are similar examples all around the world where so-called competition is supposed to operate. There is not open competition; there is a regulated duopoly, quadropoly or whatever it is and nobody from the private sector wants it any other way. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Opposition should not go on giving us this hogwash in its statement about free competition. It does not want free market competition; it wants a regulated system that gives two or three private sector organisations the opportunity to get into the market with certain protections guaranteed to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the discussions that we had, as I say, I saw no evidence anywhere to argue that it is demonstrably true that competition against the network is going to provide any better service to the range of telecommunications consumers in Australia. I certainly agree that there is a case to be answered-and I support it-that in a large number of areas in the add-on services there should be competition and Telecom should not have a monopoly. In many of those areas I think we will end up with a better service to the public. I believe, for example, that the first telephone monopoly should end at the socket, not at the phone. I think we will get much better customer service from Telecom if there is competition between Telecom and other companies in providing the first phone. </PARA>
<PARA> When I asked one of Australia's biggest telephone manufacturers whether he would be worried about the ending of the first phone monopoly, he said, `No, as long as you give us two years notice and as long as you allow Telecom to compete in provision of the phone, we would be more than happy with it'. One of the members of the committee asked, `What about the import of cheap telephones from Taiwan, Hong Kong and so on?'. He said, `Look, you do not understand. Our company here in Sydney exports telephones to Taiwan. The phone that we provide to Telecom we sell in Taiwan. Why? Because technologically it is a superior phone. It will not break down if it is accidentally dropped. We use highly technical manufacturing procedures and so on'. He made it quite clear that he thinks that there are great opportunities for a more vigorous part of the market, and I think that is an area that certainly should be looked at. I find it interesting that a company in Australia is already exporting telephones to Taiwan-something I am sure Senator Bishop would support, because she at times tells us that she is very interested in trade matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that what the coalition has put before us in this document of two days ago is a very glib proposition. It will not work, it will create chaos in telecommunications, and above all else, the ordinary consumer will end up paying more. I agree that there is a great debate going on in the Australian Labor Party at the moment over what we should do with telecommunications and other micro-economic reform, but it should be remembered that the Opposition was in government for 30 of the last 40 years and did absolutely nothing in this area. It never had a debate about it. The only thing that was ever done when Senator Brownhill's party was in government and running telecommunications was to rort the system to make it inefficient to pay off a few old mates in the back blocks of Queensland for the Queensland National Party. That is the sort of policy we had under the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> We have tried to get all the rorts out of the system, to get an efficient telecommunications system and we have done much better. We are not perfect, I agree, but the proposals we are putting forward will mean we will get a better telecommunication system. But we will not, in the grip of some ideological mayhem, throw out the baby with the bath water and destroy a telecommunications system that, on balance, has done a good job in Australia. We certainly want to see it improved. I believe that the Government and the Labor Party in the next month or so will come forward with a proposition that will improve our telecommunication system, but we will not put it forward in the way the Opposition has, which is basically a recipe for chaos. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, in August last year there was a strike by the airline pilots of Australia, members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. They were after an increase of about 28 per cent in their salaries. This was resisted very strongly by the management. One of the arguments that was used at the time was that the productivity of the airline pilots was very low and some very false statistics were put out as to how few hours the pilots flew in a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us deal with the truth about the low productivity, if indeed it was as low as it was alleged. The artificially low figures were arrived at because the number of pilots who were involved in retraining programs was very high, because it was at a time when the 737s were coming into the airline inventories. The principal reason why pilots did so few hours on duty, up to the recent past in Australia, stemmed principally from inefficient practices of the Australia airline managements. Airline managements had not been in the business of trying to get productivity. They had given in to union demands on behalf of the flight attendants, the baggage handlers, the transport workers-the whole lot of their employees. Whatever they wanted the airlines always gave them, so at the end off the day they were getting less work than they should have got out of all their employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Airline Pilots Dispute</PARA>
<PARA> The legislative requirements imposed by the Department of Civil Aviation and, latterly, by the Civil Aviation Authority also limited the productivity of Australian pilots. While there is a theoretical maximum number of hours laid down by the regulatory authority that a pilot can fly, so many other conditions apply along the way that a company could probably get only about 70 per cent of the nominal hours that were allowed out of air crew because of excessive regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots went on strike. The management resisted and then the pilots resigned because they had advice that they would be subjected to legal action. The consequences of that for the nation were really quite tragic. Many lives have been seriously harmed and the careers of many people have been destroyed as a consequence of a dispute which was allowed by the government of the day to continue to the great detriment of the individuals and the nation. The government of the day failed to recognise its national responsibilities to mediate, to guide and to resolve the issue between the disputing parties. As the Senate inquiry showed, it could have been resolved from about the middle of September. At that point the Australian Federation of Air Pilots was ready to settle on any terms, but the Government and the airline managements conspired in a massive lockout. If the management alone had run a lockout, one can imagine the bleatings of a Labor government. We would have been back to the early days of the Industrial Revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences were that many people lost their livelihoods. Honourable senators only have to visit Cairns in my own State to see the empty shops and the tragedy there. People borrowed all the money they could to start businesses to support the tourist industry, and now those hundreds of families have lost everything they had and will never get restarted in business. It is the likes of Senator Collins and Mr Hawke that brought those people to the economic hardship and bankruptcy that they face today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now 13 months after the strike started and, sadly, the consequences are still with us. The airline services that exist in Australia today are not a patch on what they were 12 months ago. I was coming out of Darwin the other day and I said to the Australian Airlines booking clerk, `How long will we be in Mount Isa?'. He said, `Sir, we do not stop in Mount Isa now'. I said, `But you always went Brisbane-Mount Isa-Darwin-Mount Isa-Brisbane'. He said, `Since the dispute, Sir, we cannot afford to go to Mount Isa except for two days a week, perhaps'. The story is true. Cairns has probably about a quarter of the services that it had before the dispute. Of course, the damage to our international reputation as a tourist country simply cannot be quantified. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened when the strike started? The first thing was that the Government conspired with the airline management to totally destroy the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. As I have said continually in this chamber and in public meetings outside the chamber, I have never carried any brief for the Air Pilots Federation. I believe it is badly advised and made an enormous mistake, but it has paid for that mistake. In the conspiracy we saw the Government using the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy as strike breakers, running a commercial service with the Australian defence forces at rates that were ruinous for the Defence budget because they were very heavily subsidised. The figures probably reflected about one-sixth of the true operating cost of running the Boeing 707s and the C130s that were put on the line. It was a gross abuse and was something that the members of the Australian Defence Force felt very bitterly about. They are prepared to do anything in a national emergency such as floods, bushfires, cyclones, and instances of that nature, but they do not see themselves as tools in a political war, which is the position the RAAF and the Navy were put in when they had to fly services for paying passengers through last year. </PARA>
<PARA> We also saw the importation of strike breakers. It is one of the sad things of life that members of the Australian Labor Party today have no knowledge of their history and their ideals. The incumbents here-the minor union officials and the small time schoolteachers who inhabit the ranks across the chamber-have no knowledge of the ideals and the traditions of their great Party. For members of the Labor Party to support strike breaking, let alone strike breaking by the armed services and by importing workers from overseas, as they did and are still doing with airline captains and pilots, is just unbelievable. Overseas crews and aircraft were brought in. The Government used every resource it had to persecute the pilots, not to resolve the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against this background that the Senate resolved to set up an inquiry in the latter part of 1989. I was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute. I have served on committees longer than any other member of that Committee. But I must say that I have never served a committee that so acutely embarrassed me as that Committee did, because it was a blatant political ramp. I apologise publicly to those witnesses who appeared before the Committee and who presented submissions to the Committee for the way they were treated in such a blatant party political exercise as that Committee turned out to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins was one of the ringleaders. He got his reward in a ministry. He carried the can very well for the Government, defending the Civil Aviation Authority, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, and the airline management at every opportunity, hectoring witnesses and doing what he could to grab cheap publicity through the hearings of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to rehash the evidence that was given to the Committee, but I will repeat what I said earlier: from the middle of September the Pilots Federation was prepared to settle on any reasonable terms, but it was not allowed to be spoken to or negotiated with by the Government and the airline management. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened throughout the dispute? One of the things which concerned the Senate and which led to the setting up of the inquiry was the fact that many people were flying aeroplanes in Australia who did not know and understand the Australian safety regulations and the Australian air traffic control procedures. The evidence that was given to the Committee showed quite clearly that there were a significant number of serious breaches of air traffic procedures. People were carrying out illegal and unauthorised maintenance procedures on aircraft. We had a case with one of the foreign airlines of internal wrenching bolts in the nose-wheel landing gear being sawn so that they could be put in with a screwdriver instead of being put in with an Allen key and torqued up. We had evidence of inadequate familiarisation before licences were granted to foreign pilots. Even more bizarre were numerous examples of flight crews not being able to speak English and not being able to communicate with air traffic controllers on the ground. In one situation an aircraft was pushed back in Sydney-an air hostess gave us this evidence-and the crew jumped off as the aircraft was being pushed back. When next seen, they were arguing under the wing of the aircraft after it was pushed back from the terminal. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had incidents of charter operators from the European theatre using the techniques of European charter operators; in other words, they were operating very close to the bone, using minimal fuel loads when operating into places such as Townsville and Cairns where the weather systems are different from what they are in Europe and, more importantly, where there is not the availability of alternative airfields within five minutes flying time. It really is a long way to fly from Townsville to Mackay in those circumstances. Fortunately, we got through that situation without any accidents at all, but it was more by good luck than by good management. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also heard evidence that the Civil Aviation Authority could not have done more for the management of the airlines in the first phase of the dispute. It bent over backwards to facilitate the entry of foreign aircraft and foreign pilots and to waive and bend regulations. After a week or two of this it got frightened and, for the major part of the dispute, tried to apply its regulations as well as it could. But, sadly, we saw the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation operating as an instrument of the Government and not as a professional body. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are we now? We are in a position where we have got a very poor airline service in the country. The economic health of the airlines is considerably reduced as a result of this debilitating strike. The airlines are still in difficulty recruiting pilots. It is astonishing that the Australian Labor Party tolerates the persecution of the former members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. They simply cannot get jobs with the airlines now. The airlines are recruiting pilots overseas. They have recruited so many pilots from overseas that there are hardly any Australian nationals as captains of aircraft, and the managements of the airlines have had to instruct the crews on the flight decks that only people with Australian accents make the announcements to passengers on take-off because the airlines have so many American, British, South African and other foreign nationals flying as captains of Australian aircraft. The airlines are still running this embargo against employing Australian nationals. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, but in a very sneaky way, by regulation, the Government ran through an amendment to the migration regulations so that these pilots recruited from overseas and flying for Australian airlines are now entitled to Australian citizenship. As a senator, I do a lot of migration work, and every month I see a number of young people who come to Australia on work permits and working visas, who speak English well, who have skills that make them employable in the Australian community and who not only wish but are enthusiastic to become Australian citizens. I have to turn them away because they do not meet Australian migration requirements. Here we have a government conspiring with the airline managements not to employ our own capable pilots but to recruit pilots overseas. Ansett Airlines of Australia is still recruiting today. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, where are we today at the end of the dispute? The dispute started over a salary claim of about 28 per cent. We now have a situation where the pilots flying under contract are, admittedly, flying more hours-they are flying more hours because the Government's regulatory proposals and the management of the airlines has improved--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not double the salary, but the pilots are probably earning 35 per cent to 40 per cent more in salary than they earned before. So we had a dispute which resulted in airline captains and first officers getting around 35 per cent to 40 per cent more than they earned before the dispute. We have a national deficit because the country has lost billions of dollars as a result of the damage caused to the tourist trade. Many hundreds of innocent Australians involved in the tourist industry and elements of it have had their businesses irreparably destroyed because the Government failed to recognise its national responsibility to mediate and resolve the dispute when it had every opportunity to do so within about four weeks of the dispute starting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute. I was, and still am, a member of Estimates Committee B which deals with the civil aviation portfolio. I remember when arrangements were made for Estimates Committee B to be brought back for a special day's hearing in order to give the Opposition every opportunity to put before the Committee its views on what was happening in the dispute, particularly on questions of safety and management. The Opposition was also given the opportunity, at great length, to question the officers of the Department of Transport and Communications. The members of the Committee sat there for a full day. Nothing was brought forward-despite leaked documents, some letters and so on-that could prove that safety was being put at risk in any way that should concern the Australian public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because that one day hearing did not serve the purpose of the Opposition, we then had to go through the charade-and I remember it very well-of the performance of the former Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Fred Chaney, standing at the table accusing Senator Collins and me of being thugs, bovver boys, standover merchants and so on, because we had the temerity to ask witnesses who had leaked documents the background and details of them. When the witnesses could not answer properly, we had the temerity to make the point that the Opposition had not proved its case. Because the Opposition senators were able to convince the Australian Democrats, particularly Senator Sanders as he then was, that it may not be a bad idea, the Opposition won the vote to establish a select committee. So Senator Collins and I were called upon to serve again, this time on the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sat for days and heard evidence in droves from all sorts of people, including members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP). We heard piles of evidence about the so-called breaches of air safety. Senator Collins and myself, and other members of the Committee, knew more about every so-called safety breach in air regulation, about turning left at Corryong by 15 degrees rather than 20 degrees, about someone not speaking the right language or misunderstanding a direction-in some senses, the most extraordinary trivia that we went through day after day. At the end, we did not find one scintilla of evidence that safety had been compromised, despite the extraordinary efforts of Senator MacGibbon in particular and Senator Brownhill to exaggerate and extrapolate from the most baseless assertions that air safety and the people flying in Australia were at grave risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon, in his 15-minute speech today, made more errors than I have ever heard any other senator make in the 3 1/2 years that I have been here. It was an astonishing speech. Senator MacGibbon exaggerated and, although I know it is not parliamentary to say that he told lies-I know I cannot say that-when one compares his speech with the evidence and the transcripts of the Committee's hearings, none of the things he said today stand up one iota. It was just an astonishing speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The most astonishing thing of all is that Senator MacGibbon impugned the reputation of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. He said that it was the political weapon of the Federal Government. He said directly that it was carrying out the political instructions of the Federal Government in the way that it was investigating all these so-called breaches of air safety. Senator MacGibbon did not tell honourable senators that so many of those reported breaches were organised by the Federation of Air Pilots and its supporters in order to use every opportunity to lodge complaints of the most trivial nature. Senator MacGibbon did not bother to tell the Senate that members of the Federation of Air Pilots harassed pilots, that the Federation occasionally may have put air safety at risk by trying to jam radio messages and harass pilots as they were being briefed in their briefing rooms at airports. Senator MacGibbon made no mention of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say to Senator MacGibbon that in all the evidence before us, in all those interminable days, the only evidence that ever struck me as getting close to causing a problem in air safety was the activities of the Federation of Air Pilots in harassing those pilots who were still flying. Senator MacGibbon made no mention of that and it is clear-cut in the transcript. To then accuse the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI)-which openly made comments in the hearings explaining the background, comments which destroyed Senator MacGibbon's arguments as a supporter of the Federation of Air Pilots and of its evidence, and which knocked them for six-of acting as a political tool of the then Government is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon says that he is not a supporter of the AFAP. I am a member of the Australian Labor Party and my colleagues on this side of the House are all members of that Party. Many of us have close colleagues in the trade union movement. I do not think I have ever seen a member of parliament go to the wall or jump over the cliff so far to support any trade union as Senator MacGibbon did in support of the AFAP. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon did not once in all those days of hearing, particularly when we had the AFAP before us, ask one question or make one comment that would have suggested to the Federation that it may have made a slight mistake or misjudgment in its industrial tactics. No, there was not a word out of Senator MacGibbon at all. There was never any encouragement from Senator MacGibbon during those hearings at the time of the dispute for the Federation to withdraw from the strike. He was telling its members to keep boring on. He was after a political victory that he hoped would destroy this Government. Senator MacGibbon did not succeed. Perhaps that is why he is sitting on the back bench and not on the front bench, as he was before the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon never told the Federation, as Senator Collins did and as I did both publicly and privately, that he felt sorry for its members. For 30 years the AFAP had lauded it over management, and over other unions. The Federation had never suffered a defeat in an industrial dispute. Unfortunately, the Federation believed that it was unbeatable. It adopted the saying `How long can we last?-one day longer than the airlines'. That is what it believed and Senator MacGibbon did nothing to discourage its members from that view. Then Senator MacGibbon seeks to tell us about Labor principles!</PARA>
<PARA> The AFAP as a union has flatly refused to affiliate at any stage with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), because that means that it would have to be in an organisation together with people with lower qualifications and lower status. But when there were other disputes in the airline industry in the last 30 years-for example, when the Transport Workers Union of Australia and the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia had their members in dispute and it went to a strike-what did the glorious working class heroes of the AFAP do? Its members busted every picket line one could think of. They never gave one ounce of solidarity to any other worker in any other union in the industry. They were proud of the fact that they went against every other industrial dispute of those members. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They then had the temerity, as my colleague Senator Collins suggests, to call on working class solidarity when for 30 years they had never given one ounce of it. It is a joke for Senator MacGibbon to imply that members on this side of the House have forgotten Labor principles and tradition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon never at any stage tried to explain why the AFAP said, `We want 30 per cent or nothing'. He did not say, `Go and negotiate'. It was 30 per cent or nothing to start off with. Senator MacGibbon has not attempted to explain that the Federation members all resigned en masse. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked to a lot of old hands in the Labor movement, both blue collar and white collar union members. Every one of them has taken the view that industrial mass suicide took place the moment that 1,700 members of the AFAP resigned their jobs. When that happened, the dispute, in effect, it could be argued, was over. They were no longer in the industry; they were queuing up for their superannuation payouts. I hope that is a lesson that other union members will never forget. The view to be taken is that one should never resign. Was it not Jack Lang who said, `Never put it in writing, and never resign.'?</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly Mr McCarthy and the Federation made a dreadful mistake that led their members out into limbo and over the edge of the cliff. Once they were out and had resigned, how could any other union, even if it had wanted to do so, support them? They were no longer in the industry. I repeat that it is a joke for Senator MacGibbon to say that we have forgotten Labor principles. I only wish that we had had an opportunity before the Federation went over the cliff in starting this dispute last year to explain to its members what they were about to embark upon. We would have told them that their actions would not succeed because the Federation had broken every Labor principle. It went out unilaterally. It did not seek the support of the trade union movement. Indeed, it did not seek the ACTU's support when it first started. It said, `You can all go jump in the lake'. It called on the ACTU only after it had committed a number of industrial errors, including the fact that its members had all resigned. It then called on working class solidarity. It is a classic lesson of how not to run an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Labor Government at the time had given in after several weeks to the airline pilots, there would have been industrial anarchy in this country. Who would have been the first person to get up to criticise it? Who would have been the first person to cheer? Of course, Senator MacGibbon would have been, because he would have achieved his political objective. His objective was to destroy the wages system and the economy in this country for a political victory. He was hoping that at the forthcoming Federal election he would be delivered into government, because he had nothing else he was offering. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that it must have astonished Senator MacGibbon and other Opposition members to find that the Government stood firm and did not cave in. The ACTU did not cave in, but stuck to union principles and solidarity not to allow a rogue group of people, who up to that stage had acted unilaterally to destroy an industrial relations system which was to the benefit of the overwhelming majority of Australian trade union members. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I served on Estimates Committee B and on the Select Committee into this matter. I do not know how many hours Senator Collins and I put into that Committee, but it was a waste of time in every way. It was obvious from the first couple of days that the political objectives of the Opposition would not be achieved because there was no substance to what Opposition members were raising. Therefore, it was obvious that they would suffer a defeat. However, the hearing dragged on endlessly and it was similar to a fishing expedition. Opposition members were trying to find something, hoping that somewhere the evidence would turn up, and, above all else, hoping that a plane would crash-there is no doubt about that. They could then come in here saying, `We told you air safety was at stake'. That was what the political undercurrent was all about in this dispute. They wanted an accident.</PARA>

<PARA> We had the political exercise put forward to us. It failed-and I am very surprised here-in one last gasp, 13 months on from when the dispute started. I suppose one should admire Senator MacGibbon's gall or hide, in that he would still give it a run; he would still get up here in the Senate and give it a run when the Government puts down its reply to the report. In that sense, Mr Acting Deputy President, I admire Senator MacGibbon for his hide and his gall. I do not admire him for his remarks when he impugns such organisations as the BASI and made remarks that contained innumerable errors. But I hope this is the last time that we have to discuss this matter and waste the time of the Senate on a matter that should not have even been raised with us, because it was a political stunt and a political exercise that failed miserably. Overwhelmingly, the Government's position has been proven correct. Air safety was never at risk. By the firmness of the Government's action and in co-ordination with the ACTU we achieved the preservation of an industrial relations system that has delivered a living standard to a majority of Australians that is much higher and better than they would get under the system that the Opposition proposes to give us. I commend the Government's response and hope the Senate can support it unanimously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having just heard Senator Schacht speaking on this report, which is a Government response to the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute, I wonder whether he is really living in quite the same chamber as the rest of us here, because this is a reply by the Government to a report which makes me wonder why it has given a reply, because there were no recommendations made to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go any further, I think that it would be well for the members of the chamber here and others who may be listening to this debate to know exactly what this inquiry was about. Senator MacGibbon made some very pertinent points on why we wanted an inquiry. Let us look at what the terms of reference were. It was a select committee to be appointed to be known as the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute, to inquire and report not later than the last sitting day of November 1989. The matters that the committee had to look at were:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the nature, extent and legality of all changes to training, licensing, administration, employment and other organisational and operational practices during the pilots' dispute relevant to the operation of airline services in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the extent to which air safety may have been affected by any such changes;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the nature, extent and legality of the compensation arrangements entered into by the Government and the airline; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the economic implications of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>With all due respect to Senator Schacht, who, because of his work on that Committee, of trying to actually hide the problems of it, got rewarded with the Chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Committee--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Senator Collins, who was on that Committee, got rewarded with a front bench position, in aviation; but that is another story, because he has got plenty on his plate with looking after Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Basically the Committee was one of the most unpleasant committees that I have served on as a member of this chamber because the Government was never going to agree, right from the start, about the issues which were being raised and which I have just alluded to. Senator Schacht has just given us a dissertation about industrial relations and other things, but he has not alluded once, basically, to the terms of reference that we were asked to look into. He was completely off key. Actually, the whole of the inquiry amazed me. We had television cameras and everything else there the whole time, but the lack of media coverage of the inquiry amazed me. I believe the Government tried to get it off the agenda very quickly. It did not want the people out in the community to know the full facts that were being brought up at the inquiry and it basically kept the inquiry well under wraps. I do not think that there was much about the inquiry on the media at any particular stage. We were concerned at a lot of the aspects that were brought up in the terms of reference. As hard as we tried, we were so often frustrated in our attempts to get to the bottom of many of the points. </PARA>
<PARA> Before going through some of the comments that Senator Collins has made in his reply here as the Government's response and some of the other things, I would like to make a couple of points. Of course, we knew from the start, as I said, that the Government was going to agree with the report in this response here today. There was never any hope of a report other than one that was totally satisfactory to the Government right from the start. At that stage, Senator Collins was not a member of the Ministry, and I was amazed at the briefings that he and Senator Schacht were getting from ministerial staffers. This Committee is one of the few committees that I have sat on when I have seen a little track being beaten from the back of the inquiry room up to the table where the Government senators were sitting by people bringing notes and asking the members of the Labor Party on that Committee to ask certain questions. </PARA>

I think Senator Collins was living in the dark, actually, because I do not think he really got to the basis of some of the aspects of the inquiry that he could have got to in order to make it much better than it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of safety, we discovered in the inquiry, was and remains very hard to define. I think Senator Collins made that point in the report. I would like to give him one little bit of praise for about two or three words in his governmental response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it does not matter whether he had a big axe to grind or not. He is a person of good repute. Some of the points that he made as, he said, some essential features of the safety culture were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Priority be given to safety over commercial interests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Just think about that. Was priority given in the inquiry and during that pilots dispute to that? I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>Co-operative attitudes among all sections of the industry. Willingness to apply and abide by the most stringent safety regulations and career structure which encourage stability in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that he made some very pertinent points in the inquiry on those issues, which were definitely not completely dealt with to my satisfaction at that time. Senator Collins alludes in his report to the increase in incidents. He said they should be considered as minor. They were not minor, and it is a miracle and a good reflection on the skills of our air traffic controllers at the time that serious accidents did not occur. I am glad that Senator Schacht did apologise for what he said earlier about us on this side, or me, in particular, wishing something to happen. Senator Collins has said in his reply here, or the Government reply, that there was an initial increase in incidents; the number subsequently decreased to normal levels. Surely that is what we were meant to be doing as a committee-to see whether different things were happening, to see whether there was an increase in incidents. There was an increase in incidents, and now the Government says, `Oh, no, no, they are only minor'. They were minor because nothing happened. Thank God nothing happened! But the position could have been quite the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> We have evidence from the flight attendants, for example, in which the witnesses agreed that some of the Association's members had refused to fly with certain pilots and who quite seriously believed that safety had been jeopardised. I think that some members of the Committee from the other side of this chamber believe that they know more about flying than people who fly every day. For God's sake! Senator Collins does not fly every day. He sits here occasionally and sometimes makes some good remarks. Unfortunately, we sometimes have to give him a little bit of praise!</PARA>
<PARA> Witnesses from the Flight Attendants Association gave specific examples of how training and familiarity had been eroded during the dispute because of the dramatic increase in the number of types of aircraft their members were expected to fly. During the inquiry one member of the Flight Attendants Association said:</PARA>
<PARA>When it comes to operating these foreign aircraft we do not know which regulations we are operating under. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely that was a diminution of safety. Surely that was a lowering of the standards that have been so well maintained in Australian aviation in the past. The flight attendants admitted that they had not made more complaints about it because they feared for their jobs. Surely, if the inquiry had been a proper Senate inquiry, like those carried out by every other committee on which I have served in this place, it would have delved and got to the bottom of these complaints. Instead, the blockers came in from the Government, which made sure that nobody really got to the bottom of any of the complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the question of Government compensation? It was never tested and it was quite wrong for the Minister to say, as he has just said, that the Committee agreed that the compensation arrangements entered into between the Government and the airlines were legal. We do not know whether they were legal. That is why we gave a dissenting report. The blockers from the Labor Party came in again and we never got to the bottom of it. It is all very well for Senator Collins to say that we did not push it hard enough, or that we were not able to achieve it. How in God's name could we achieve it when the Labor majority would not allow us to get in independent legal advice? How could we do it? The blockers from the Labor Party were obviously rewarded for doing their job. I do not quite know about Senator Cooney, who was the Committee chairman. He was not rewarded as well as the other two. </PARA>

<PARA> Another point in the Government's response was that the compensation arrangements were part of the costs of the dispute which had to be balanced against the costs of yielding to the pilots' demands. When else has this Hawke-Keating Government given compensation and help to others who have been affected by industrial disputes? When has that ever happened in the past? There is a slight reference in the Government response to the effect that the dispute had on the community, and the Government has sought to address the damage caused to the tourist industry with the introduction of an assistance package to help the promotion of tourism. Senators should ask the people on the coast of Queensland whether anything could compensate them for the damage that was done, damage that was caused by two sides of an argument not getting together, and by a Government which has always talked about conciliation and getting people together, but which in this case pushed the two sides apart. The Government took one side of the argument right from the start and crunched the industrial wing of an organisation. I am not standing up for the pilots because they were just as bloody-minded as the owners of the airlines. This Government has a lot to answer for in the way in which it handled this dispute. It drove small businesses in the tourist industry to the wall and its actions have not made the airline industry all that much better since that dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I must agree with Senator Schacht. I have heard some concentrated drivel from Senator MacGibbon in the long course of debate, but nothing could even approach the nonsense he delivered here today. Having listened to it with some considerable degree of impatience, I have not the slightest doubt that when Senator MacGibbon was practising as a dentist, as I think he formerly did in Queensland, he would have had absolutely no difficulty whatever in extracting his own teeth from the inside. I am sure of that after listening to the contribution that he made to the debate this afternoon. As Senator Schacht said, his argument was so shot full of inaccuracies and nonsense that it was hard to take any of it seriously. He started off by asserting that the airline services to Mount Isa were discontinued because of the airline pilots dispute. The Darwin-Alice Springs, formerly Mount Isa-Brisbane-Sydney-Canberra route is one route with which I happen to be particularly familiar. The reality is that the services that formerly went through Mount Isa were discontinued for reasons that had nothing whatever to do with the pilots dispute. That might explain the fact that those services were not restored after the dispute ended, even though airline operations have returned to normal. That decision had everything to do with the loadings out of that port. It is said that one man's meat is another's poison: the discontinuance of the services to Mount Isa has advantaged the regional airline operators who operate out of Mount Isa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an interesting fact in terms of the current debate on airline ownership in Australia, that there is a view put occasionally that the government-owned Australian Airlines, for example, performs a real community service in operating to ports which are not viable or commercial. In fact that is nonsense. Australian Airlines currently services 25 per cent of the ports that it serviced in the mid-1970s. For the last 20 years Australian quite sensibly has been predicating all its decisions on straight commercial grounds. That is why it has discontinued the services to Mount Isa and that is why those services are now operated largely by regional carriers. It had nothing whatever to do with the pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that assertion is typical of the absolute nonsense that Senator MacGibbon has continued to contribute to this debate. The difficulty, as my colleague Senator Loosley has just said to me, is that members of the Opposition have never been able to live with the full-blooded and unqualified support they gave to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) at the time. They are still trying to get over it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon said that there were serious breaches of air safety procedures. The only thing that particularly upset Senator MacGibbon was that he was trying very hard to hunt for headlines and failed to get them. I can remember Senator MacGibbon standing up in the Senate and predicting that there would be a mid-air collision of jet aircraft over schools and houses in Sydney. He had no basis for saying it, but of course he was trying to get a headline. He failed. It was very difficult, of course, when he and Senator Brownhill were running the same stuff in the Committee. The only headline that I can recall-and Senator Brownhill was complaining bitterly about it five minutes ago-was one about something that was revealed during the Committee's investigations, and one that they found extremely embarrassing. That headline was about a flagrant breach of proper flying procedures by the then President of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, who was caught red handed during the dispute flying an aircraft which he was not endorsed to fly. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, and that is a very interesting interjection. As a result of that incident, an airline pilot did suffer, but of course it was not Mr McCarthy. To protect the President of the AFAP, his mate told an untruth-the officers themselves confirmed that-and accepted the responsibility for flying the aircraft. He copped a 28-day suspension of his airline pilots licence, so there was certainly some punishment meted out. Unfortunately, it was meted out to the wrong bloke, but that got a headline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon talked about major safety breaches. There were two major safety breaches revealed during the evidence given to the Committee. There was a whole string of trivial incidents, comprising the majority of the incidents reported to the Committee, dragged up by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and run dutifully for them by their lobbyist in here, Senator MacGibbon, on a daily basis in both this chamber and the committees of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the incidents were proved to be nonsense. There was just a whole host of them, such as the Air North Pty Ltd DC3 pilots, who were flying F27s for which they were not endorsed to fly. I remember that that interested me, of course, because Air North is a Northern Territory company. One should have heard what the operator of Air North, John Hardy, had to say about that when I contacted him. It turned out to be absolute rubbish, like most of the other things that were raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, two serious incidents were revealed during the airline pilots dispute, one of which was described by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) or perhaps the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)-one or the other-as being genuinely the closest we have ever come in recent times to a major airline disaster in Australia. As Senator MacGibbon knows full well, regretfully that incident involved an Australian Airlines Boeing 737 with an Australian crew on board that had nothing to do with the airline pilots dispute at all. It came within a hundred feet of landing on the Bruce Highway in Queensland, mistaking it for the runway. </PARA>
<PARA> The second incident, which was streets apart from the trivia that Senator MacGibbon raised during this inquiry, unfortunately also involved another Australian Airlines 737 operating, I think, into the Cairns airport. Both of those instances were described by expert witnesses to the Committee as being the two most serious breaches of safety that had occurred in recent times in Australian airspace. But, of course, no mention has been made of that by Senator MacGibbon. In fact, I can recall that Senator MacGibbon tried desperately at the time to prevent that evidence from being pursued in the Committee because it did not suit his purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon made a most outrageous statement during this debate. It was a contemptible statement. It is the reason I chose to speak. In fact, I did not intend to speak after Senator Schacht contributed to this debate because I think enough time has been spent on this subject. Senator MacGibbon said, and backed it up with a further interjection, that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation acted as an arm of the Government, not as air safety investigators during the dispute. That is a contemptible statement and Senator MacGibbon knows that it is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt with a great many people and organisations in my 14 years as a member of parliament. As a member of this Senate and the numerous committees on which I have served, I have dealt with many members of various Commonwealth government bureaucracies. Since being a Minister I have had extensive dealings with BASI. I say unreservedly-perhaps under other circumstances this is something I would not choose to say-that, as a result of close contact with any group of professionals associated with the Commonwealth bureaucracy in any sense at all, I have no greater respect for any officers than I have for the officers of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. They are as professional and as dedicated a group of public servants that this country has got. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that in all of the criticisms that were raised by Senator MacGibbon, Senator Brownhill and the other members of the Committee during the investigation, none of them were so low as that made today by Senator MacGibbon. I am sure that he will later regret what he said, although he has shown no signs of it today. He followed up what he said with an interjection, which I hope appears in Hansard, which supported his original statement. That is an outrageous and contemptible statement. </PARA>
<PARA> One can criticise the CAA, if one wishes, on a whole range of issues. One can criticise the Federal Airports Corporation, I have no doubt, on a whole range of issues. But, in terms of anything that has come before this chamber or its committees, I would like Senator MacGibbon to find just one incident that would justify that outrageous slur he cast on the officers of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation which, of course, is under my ministerial control. I refute that statement. I think he honestly owes BASI an apology-BASI acted as an arm of the Government!</PARA>
<PARA> Another piece of extraordinary nonsense that Senator MacGibbon contributed during the debate, which must have provoked a horse laugh from anybody who has heard of it and has flown on an airline recently, was that the airlines in Australia are so sensitive about the importation of overseas pilots that they have issued instructions that no member of the flight deck who has not got an Australian accent will communicate with the passengers through the public address system. </PARA>

This is your captain speakin'. We are passin' through 25,000 feet at this time. Thank you all for ridin' with us today'. Now, I am sure that was not an Australian accent. But I must tell Senator MacGibbon, through you, of course, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the `atrocious' American accent is an accent which has been noted, remarked upon, and enjoyed in recent times not only by me but by thousands of other passengers on both Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cast no aspersions on Australian pilots because, depending on the individual, some of them have very, very professional public relations attitudes in terms of their communications with the passengers. But the Americans do seem to bring a very special touch to it and their voices are heard on a daily basis on the public address systems of aircraft around Australia. But that does not stop Senator MacGibbon from delivering just one more piece of comprehensive nonsense to this debate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a fact. It is an industrial aristocracy, as my colleague Senator Loosley has just said. Who, of course, said that publicly apart from me? None other than the Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia at the time, John Elliott. He had a great many things to say. He said that the pilots of his own corporate jet `flew twice the hours of any Australian airline pilot and still spent most of their time sitting around doing nothing'. Senator MacGibbon knows that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the Australian Federation of Air Pilots went on strike for a 30 per cent non-negotiable pay rise to add to the already grossly unproductive nature of their flying regime. They would not negotiate. The proof in the pudding is in what is now happening. Senator MacGibbon is a great advocate for the defence in this matter. He defended the pilots again here today, saying, `Well, they are getting all this extra money now, even though'-he adds as a qualification-`they are flying a lot more hours'. I will tell you how many more hours they are flying, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the strategic nous of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is demonstrated by the fact that the airlines of Australia are now operating normal services-that is, the same level of services that they operated prior to the dispute with 50 per cent of the pilots they formerly employed; half the number. Of course, they are getting the pay rises that Senator MacGibbon has referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this Committee's deliberations the pilots of Qantas Airways Ltd, largely unheralded, went before the Industrial Relations Commission without any fuss, without dragging Australia's international aviation sector to its knees and breaking all of the people that operate in that sector, and very quietly and very happily negotiated a pay rise of between 14 per cent and 17 per cent for themselves. Bill Kelty went to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots on more than one occasion to try to help the pilots. I still remember his extremely graphic description of what happened every time he went to them with an olive branch and where he wore it after he left the room. </PARA>

As Bill Kelty said, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots-and it is probably a good thing it did not in retrospect-could have gone to the Industrial Relations Commission without the slightest industrial action, without one single dollar lost to the Australian economy, and negotiated a similar pay rise for its members on the same featherbedded and unproductive conditions that they were still operating under. Instead of that, the Air Pilots Federation destroyed the civil air operations of this country; it destroyed its members; and, ultimately, it destroyed itself. It is a pretty clever trade union that can accomplish all of that in six months. It sums up at a very direct level indeed when one talks to some of the members of that organisation whose lives and professional careers were destroyed by the Air Pilots Federation-which Senator MacGibbon seems to think is such a huge joke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of those members, a former Ansett pilot, had a conversation with me in Smith Street Mall in Darwin which was only typical of many conversations I had, not only with rank and file members of that organisation but with officers of that organisation during the dispute. He said to me, `I received instructions from the union leadership to send them an undated pre-signed resignation from my job'. This was a pilot of 25 years. He said he did so because the Federation had taken a collective decision that the union leadership ran the dispute and it was running the dispute. To quote him almost exactly, he said, `I knew it was stupid when I did it. The day the Federation officers from Brisbane rang me and advised me that they had handed in my resignation along with everyone else's I couldn't sleep. I went home that night and spent half the night sitting listening to records and drinking coffee. I went to bed at about three o'clock in the morning and I tossed and turned for three hours. I woke my wife up at six o'clock in the morning and said to her that that was the most stupid thing I had ever done in my life'. That is a real story, from a real pilot, word for word as he told it to me in Smith Street Mall. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only typical of dozens of conversations I had with members of the AFAP during that dispute. That really nailed down for me the true tragedy of that stupid dispute-without any question the most stupid industrial dispute that this country has ever seen. It was not caused-despite the cloud-cuckoo-land that Senator MacGibbon continues to live in-by the airlines; it was not caused by the Government; it was caused by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and chiefly its Executive. It was a tragedy. The entire country suffered, and is still suffering from it. The pilots deserve condemnation for it. But not one ounce of criticism of the AFAP, not even the mildest form, let alone condemnation, have we heard from Senator MacGibbon during this entire debate. Instead we have heard a continued parade of unsubstantiated nonsense and a condemnation and slur on an organisation which does in fact operate professionally and competently. That is to Senator MacGibbon's lasting discredit unless he has enough gumption, enough hide, enough remorse and enough honesty to get up in the chamber-and I am quite happy to give him leave if he wants to do so for five minutes now-and apologise to the Bureau of Air Safety officers for the slur that he cast on them during this debate. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to congratulate the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on this report on television violence in Australia. I believe that it is a very timely report and it is a subject which has received wide community concern. It is encouraging to note that the interest of the public in this inquiry was overwhelming, with 1,114 individuals and organisations making submissions. This can only go to emphasise the degree of concern about this issue in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Next to the family, television is probably the most important influence on child development in our society. Children view an average of three to five hours of television daily. By the time he or she graduates from high school the average adolescent will have spent more time in front of the television than in the classroom. The popularity of television is easy to understand: it informs us, it entertains us and it keeps us company. Television, to use its own cliche, brings the world into our living rooms. It is difficult to document the effects of such extensive television exposure on children, and adults for that matter. However, television viewing may be linked with violent or aggressive behaviour, obesity, poor academic performance, active sexual behaviour and the use of drugs or alcohol. I note that such programs have such a critical influence that the Chairman wrote in the preface:</PARA>
<PARA> The evidence which emerged provides compelling reasons for considering the recommendations in relation to other areas of the media: For example, pay television if and when it begins in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus it is essential that television is used as a positive, creative force and to avoid its negative influences. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to now television stations have been feeding the Australian community a steady and constant diet of violence and tasteless entertainment. This is not only in their normal programming but also in their so-called news and current affairs programs. Indeed, sometimes if one watches half of the television news all one has seen is violence. It has been estimated that by current standards an average viewer will see some 45,000 murders or attempted murders on television by the age of 21 years. This standard diet of violence is not only desensitising the community, and young people in particular, to violence, but also is encouraging an acceptance of violence as a norm of behaviour. It is no wonder that the incidence of violent crimes is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest batch of programs for screening on our televisions includes programs such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a show so popular that it seems to be the only subject in conversations and games with young people, including young children. Yet this show is violent enough that some pre-schools and kindergartens in this country have banned children from playing Ninja Turtle games and playing with those sorts of toys. Another program, Houston Nights, with 36 acts of violence in an hour, promotes the consumption of large quantities of alcohol, casual sex, revenge and the concept that good will win through violence. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, these programs are typical of those on our television screens. This is coupled with the output of television stations which increasingly see news and current affairs as entertainment and compete with each other for graphic footage of violent crimes. I believe that the standard of television stations must improve. I note that this fact is addressed when the report maintains that the best response to the acknowledged community concern about violence on television is by way of supervised self-regulation by television licensees. </PARA>
<PARA> I also feel that I should say that parents, particularly when their children are watching television shows that contain violence, ought to say to their children, `Turn the television off'. I think that that is one action that these days parents do not like to take: to stop their children watching television. </PARA>

The question is: What does the resultant 112-page report mean to those in Australia who have the task of regulating the environmental impacts of pulp and paper making and to those who produce the pulp and paper? In 1989, the Commonwealth Government developed a set of environmental guidelines for application to new bleached eucalypt kraft mills based on extensive study done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). </PARA>
<PARA> The director of the relevant CSIRO institute, Dr Roy Green, was asked whether there was any evidence in the Industry Commission report that had called into question any aspect of the government guidelines for new bleached eucalypt kraft mills. He replied, in a word, no. Dr Green explained that there was no scientific evidence presented to the Industry Commission which was not considered by the CSIRO in drafting its report on pulp mills or in advising the Government on the guidelines last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Bleached kraft pulp production is only one aspect of the industry, but it is the aspect that has raised the most concern amongst the public, due mainly to the loud media campaign against the construction of the Wesley Vale pulp mill. Although it has been pointed out before in the Senate, I will take this opportunity to again reiterate the fact that the Wesley Vale mill, as originally designed, would have complied with the Commonwealth guidelines. Dr Green's assessment, therefore, is important because it shows that the Industry Commission has not in any way called into doubt the correctness of the present Commonwealth guidelines for such mills. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the view of the actual producers of pulp and paper is concerned, the report is seen as being very mixed in its quality and accuracy. The choice of words found in this report is often not what would have been considered scientifically correct. For example, `Should chlorine bleaching be banned?' is one heading in the report. Under this heading is the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The community is justifiably concerned about discharges of organochlorines from pulp mills. But the levels of such discharges are hard to measure and their long term effects are largely unknown. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is difficult to conclude that discharge of organochlorines should be banned altogether, particularly in view of the cost that this would impose and the environmental impacts of the alternatives. Producers and governments have responded to community concern, and consumer demand for unbleached and non-chlorine bleached products is strengthening. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cole, the Chairman of the Industry Commission, has stated that the Commission concluded that chlorine bleaching should not be banned. To someone not familiar with the industry and this particular aspect, the sentence quoted may not seem to justify the conclusions stated by Mr Cole, at least not with any real force. Community concern is justified only inasmuch as it may be fuelled by the media and environmental groups, not by any scientific evidence. Where there have been true adverse impacts observed from the discharge of effluent from chlorine based bleaching plants, there is also very clear and well documented reasons why those impacts occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no cause to believe that similar impacts are automatically a feature of all chlorine bleached pulp mill discharges. Furthermore, there are very large amounts of evidence to show what the long term effects are. In short, there need be no such effects. In the vast majority of cases around the world, and in the case of any new mill built in Australia under new Commonwealth guidelines, there are no impacts expected or evident. In view of this, this evidence is worth considering, I believe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on this paper and to make several brief points. The Senate will recall that, when the Industries Assistance Commission was disbanded recently and we passed legislation to create the new Industry Commission, I moved-and, with the support of the Government, was successful-to have placed on the new Industry Commission a person who has knowledge and experience in environmental matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that this particular report which is before us is one which predates the positioning of such a person on that Industry Commission. Thor Handlo, from the Griffith University in Queensland is, I understand, the person who has been appointed to the Industry Commission. One looks forward to the day when one might not see the rather narrow types of report of which this is one example. </PARA>
<PARA> In picking up the point which has been stressed by Senator Watson, I note that in the report the statement appears that the acute and chronic affects of organochlorine discharge are not fully understood or quantified. Indeed, the effects of the effluents of bleached eucalypt kraft pulp mills are largely unknown. It seems to me that one rushes in where angels fear to tread when one assumes, in the light of such a statement, that large amounts of organochlorines can be discharged with impunity into the marine environment, which itself is very little understood, without the long term consequences being very damaging. </PARA>
<PARA> More fundamentally, there are two flaws in this report. Firstly, it assumes that the market will remain as it is and that within that market there is insufficient call for the use of unbleached, or less bleached, or bleached by other methods, pulp for the manufacture of paper. This is to argue that one should maintain the very unlevel playing field that we have at the present time. One of the things that the environmental movement has been saying for a long time is that, as a first step-not necessarily as a complete solution-to addressing many of the environmental problems one needs to put in the full and proper costs of environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA> When the market is adjusted and levelled by doing that, those costs are reflected in the marketplace in the price of the products. One then sees that purchaser decisions are affected and that the market itself shifts, which is, after all, the way the market is supposed to operate. We are seeing in this report the assumption that the market will continue to operate with the prices as they are at present and with choices being made based on those prices-prices reflecting insufficient call for paper which has been prepared in other ways and which, therefore, would not support the increase in the use of paper prepared in these other ways. We would say that a broader view which took into account the full environmental consequences and placed evaluations on them, which consequences would naturally be fed back into the price structure, would so change the market that indeed there would be a much increased demand for these alternative products. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to use this opportunity of making a few comments on the report. It is noteworthy that the Industry Commission's findings generally complement the paper recycling industry's position and underwrite its belief that while recycling should be encouraged manufacturers should be left to use recycled fibres in the manner most suitable to them, their products and also their clients' needs. In essence, there are seven main findings which arise from this particular report before the Senate today. Firstly, the report acknowledges that there is already a high level of paper recycling in Australia. Australia is in fact the sixth highest recycler in the world with 36 per cent of our paper products containing some recycled fibre. </PARA>
<PARA> In the areas of packaging, printing and writing papers, we already have a high level of recycling. The report saw the greatest avenue for increased recycling being in the newspaper and magazine grades of paper. The reason Australia is ranked sixth and West Germany fourth in the world for paper recycling is that West Germany recycles newsprint for newspapers and Australia does not. The report identifies economic, environmental and technical constraints to increased recycling. The huge land mass that is Australia and the sparseness of its population means that the collection of newspapers and magazine grades for recycling is often uneconomic. But this does not rule out, however, other uses of recycled paper such as packaging and insulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The environmental and technical constraints refer specifically to the de-inking of newsprint and how to deal with the sludge the de-inking produces. Whilst we acknowledge the de-inking problem, great progress in this area has been made over recent years and will continue. I doubt that not far beyond the year 2000 this constraint will be with the industry. The one finding which accords most praise from industry was the recommendation that there should be no mandatory standards for recycling for manufacturers or converters. This was not seen by the industry as allowing them to do what they like, but rather as the only commonsense approach. While some people may consider the legislation of mandatory standards desirable, the fact is that if the Government were to legislate that all copying paper was to contain, say, 20 per cent recycled fibre, there is no known test for determining whether there is 5, 20 or 40 per cent of recycled fibre in the finished product. So we can confidently say that while there is recycled fibre in the paper product, there is nothing to say about the quality of the recycled fibre. It is just a guess. Thus, to legislate on a point which cannot be policed would appear to me to be quite ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is interesting to note that on the matter of sales tax exemption for 100 per cent recycled paper the Industry Commission's comment is that such a tax is distorting and is unlikely to encourage efficient paper recycling. From my previous point I would ask the Senate to take note that there is no way of checking that paper which claims to be produced from 100 per cent recycled fibre does, in fact, contain 100 per cent recycled fibre. My second point is that artificially encouraging the production of 100 per cent recycled printing and writing papers, a product with severe technical limitations, would increase demand and price of a high grade waste paper and do nothing to encourage the use of waste paper which is in excess-and I refer to newspapers and magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that it is heartening to see that the Industry Commission, after very extensive study, has made findings with which the industry concurs and I believe this augurs well for future developments in this area. Whether the cost involved in banning the use of chlorine should be borne by the community or not, I think this is a different interpretation of the situation than that quoted from the Industry Commission's report but it is a more correct interpretation. The task assigned the Industry Commission was a very broad one and hard for lay people to come to grips with in the time allowed. As a result the report is very mixed in its quality and accuracy and thus its contribution to the question of bleaching and the environment, I believe, is negligible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek also to make a few brief remarks on this interim report on paper recycling and to pick up several of the points which Senator Watson has just made but in a somewhat different context. I agree with the remarks which he made that there are no objective tests by which one can judge whether a product contains 5 per cent or 50 per cent or 100 per cent recycled paper. Moreover, another point which he made and which is absolutely valid, is that at each step in the recycling process the quality of the fibre tends to degrade. The fibre is shortened and the quality of the paper one can manufacture tends to deteriorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But again I think the way of tackling these problems is through the price mechanism. I note that we do not, in this country and, indeed, in most industrial countries, place any value on trees which are in situ in the forest. They appear to acquire value as we chop them down and we turn them into woodchips, sawn timber, furniture, or whatever. They are given no value when they reside in the forest and the way to tackle this situation, very largely, is not through mandating fixed amounts of recycled paper but to put appropriate values on trees in situ so that the cost of that is then reflected in the use of new fibre, some of which, of course-I agree with Senator Watson-has to be used in manufacturing high quality paper. A certain amount of the paper bulk must always be made up with new fibre, good quality fibre, but the cost of that would be reflected then in the value which is put on the trees in situ and the cost of infrastructure to harvest those trees which at the moment in Australia is not adequately covered by the royalties which are paid. </PARA>
<PARA> That in itself would encourage the very high levels of recycling which are desirable for a whole multitude of reasons. Firstly, it would cut down the amount of forest which is cut for the manufacture of paper and also substantially reduce the amounts of pollution which occur as a consequence of the use of that paper in various ways. Senator Watson has also pointed out that at the present time we do not recycle newsprint in Australia into newsprint. One of the difficulties with paper recycling arises from that very fact that, while a certain amount of newsprint is recycled and manufactured into other products, the total volume of newsprint as a fraction of the total amount of paper is so large that unless some mechanism is found to encourage a substantial amount of that recycling we are faced with a very considerable problem. Again, I would simply point to the price mechanism which, through market forces, should be able to substantially encourage the recycling of that. If it were more expensive to use virgin fibre in newsprint because a higher price was put on that virgin fibre, then there would be a strong incentive to maximally use recycled paper in the manufacture of newsprint. If we could get a reasonable percentage of recycled newsprint back into newsprint, many of the environmental problems associated with the use of paper and the recycling of paper would disappear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One's vision of the future is bound to be an intensely personal one, built up over time and fashioned by a multitude of factors. My own is based on the `she' society-sane, humane, ecological. Such a society is achievable and we in this place have the task to bring it about. However, one cannot move into the future without taking stock of the past and analysing the present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I were asked to identify Australia's most significant achievement, I would not hesitate to nominate the essentially cohesive and harmonious multicultural society which is evolving daily with contributions from people who came here from 140 different countries. Without a doubt the essential basis for this multicultural society is the innate respect Australians have for individuals and for people who are different. This civilised tolerance stands in stark contrast to my childhood experiences in war-torn Europe. Somewhat parallel to the reaction of an adopted child, I can now confirm that while most of you were fortunate to have been born here, I chose well when I came here as a 17-year-old migrant in 1949. </PARA>
<PARA> I was born of German parents in a part of Poland which belonged to Russia when they were born there. During those two or three generations, ethnic differences often became a matter of life or death. The beginnings were peaceful enough. In an early example of skills migration, the then King of Poland contracted several hundred German spinners and weavers, including my forebears, to come to what later became the city of Lodz to establish a textile industry. It is a matter of great pleasure that a boyhood friend and member of one of that area's great textile families, Norbert Bernecker, is able to be here today. </PARA>
<PARA> I was seven when the German armies invaded Poland. Towards the end of the war I became part of the refugee trek zigzagging westward between the advancing Soviet and retreating German troops. Seventeen schoolboys, a small proportion of the original contingent, finally came to rest north of Berlin and, after finding my parents, I lived in Saxony, which became part of the Soviet zone of occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> During that time the jigsaw puzzle of hazy and fragmented childhood memories came together into a conscious realisation of the enormity of the Holocaust. It was this, more even than the personal experience of destruction and casualties in the refugee trek, which shaped then and informs now my determination to work for peace in its most basic sense-the development of an ethos between nations and between individuals which rejects violence as a means of conflict resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence my long and continuing involvement in the Australian peace movement and my support for a defence posture which is genuinely defensive. Australia needs weapons and equipment to defend its shoreline, rather than long-range aircraft and naval vessels on the assumption that we will rush into every conflict far from our shores. In the Middle East it is clear that Saddam Hussein must be stopped. However, the correct level of response for Australia is support for the United Nations economic boycott and a contribution of personnel to a peacekeeping force if requested by the United Nations. Such a request should go before both Houses of Parliament, where in this instance it should receive unanimous support. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia must turn away from the juvenile quest to compete in the sabre-rattling stakes, withdrawing badly needed funds which should be used for health, education and community development. Equally reprehensible is the continuing build-up of our armaments industry which is making us the weapons dealer of the Pacific. We need to build economic, cultural and social ties with the other nations in the Pacific and we need to integrate our armed forces with the economic and social development of the nation by giving them a role in natural disaster work and in the building of bridges, roads, railways and other infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> This philosophy has found expression in the Democrats' Alternative Budget Proposals published last week, in a proposed reduction of $798m in armaments expenditure and an increase of $430m in overseas aid, a continuing boost for our export trade, and an additional $477m for education, employment and training. </PARA>
<PARA> My early days in Europe are also responsible for my suspicion of chauvinistic prejudice masquerading as patriotism and for my intense opposition to all forms of totalitarian compulsion. No sooner had the simplistic propaganda of Nazism been exposed before our very eyes in those days as a corrupt sham hiding horrendous crimes, when the Iron Curtain descended and a new indoctrination attempt got under way-but not before we had been given a glimpse of the liberating notion of democracy when we attended school during the brief American occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> The first few years in Australia, when I came here at 17, revealed the significant extent to which a democratic, pluralist society mirrors the aspirations, both noble and crass, of its citizens. For the first time in years I could breathe freely and do what most migrants do-work to get an economic foothold in this new country where such aspirations made sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the good fortune to meet and marry a woman of exceptional quality. It was her selfless support and her commitment to our splendid children, Karen, Christopher, Linden and Rebecca, which enabled me to build a business and to pursue concurrently studies in law, business administration and political science, and later to become involved in politics. It is a matter of profound regret to me that these pressures led to a separation and that Julia is not here today. </PARA>
<PARA> My entry into politics was through the Australia Party where I took over from Dr David Smith as Victorian Convener, and my first contact with Don Chipp was in 1972 when I called on him with a friend suggesting he should take a leading role in the Party. This finally occurred in 1977 when the Australian Democrats were formed to challenge the two-party system. I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to both Don Chipp and Janine Haines, who, as Party leaders, articulated so well the message of social and political reform in the face of the converging policies of the old parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I became Senior Adviser to Don Chipp in 1981 and later moved into the same position with Senator Janine Haines. My work included policy development and liaison between the Senate team and the Party organisation, and here a tribute is due to the scores of committed members who work day in and day out to achieve a better future for Australia. Janet Powell, Sam Hudson and Heather Southcott are just a few whose work in those days ensured the survival and growth of the Party and still continues to do so today. </PARA>
<PARA> But before that, there was a year at the Alice Springs Community College and a youth needs survey for the Northern Territory Government. Both involved work with Aboriginal communities, and this experience has given me an abiding respect and affection for Aboriginal people. More than that, it has generated a strong and continuing interest in their quest for justice and a place in our community which takes account of their cultural and spiritual heritage which can and should enrich our own. </PARA>
<PARA> United Nations consultancies in Tonga and Western Samoa reinforced my strongly held view that we must adopt a global approach to the challenges facing Australia today and that we must share resources and knowledge with Third World countries as a moral obligation which ultimately equates with enlightened self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most important formative experience was the five years spent as Administrator of ACCESS, the Outer Eastern Regional Council of Social Development. It was a funded pilot region under the Australian Assistance Plan and the task to establish a decision-making process which the community could use to allocate funds to community projects, was a practical and exhilarating experience in effective participatory democracy. It reinforced similar experiences in the Australia Party and in the Australian Democrats where it is one of the major factors in ensuring the Party's survival and growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Writing some 15 years ago, Carole Pateman demonstrated in her book Participation and Democratic Theory that effective participation is an educative process, leading not only to greater personal autonomy but also to increased concern for the common good. </PARA>
<PARA> A nominally democratic system will not necessarily realise its potential as Schumpeter showed when he characterised a `democracy' as a model where two elites compete for the support of an apathetic mass. </PARA>
<PARA>First Speeches</PARA>
<PARA> Australians have been suffering from the dead hand of such a two-party system for decades. It is bad enough when members on either side are forced into the ritual of meaningless confrontation and the systematic denial of their intellectual and moral integrity. It is little short of a disaster for the country when both parties adopt policy positions which coincide in their disregard for social and economic justice and a sustainable future for all Australians. In years to come, the contribution the Democrats are making in changing this stultifying system into an open participatory process will be seen at least as important as the growing list of successful amendments and the increasing number of reform groups which now acknowledge the Democrats as their parliamentary representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have now been recognised as the Party offering a vision for an alternative future. It is a vision for a sustainable society based on social equity, environmental sustainability, economic sovereignty, democratic control and international responsibility. To pursue such a vision people must have hope-hope that is grounded in the belief that it is possible to realise that vision or at least to move towards it. In 1986 I had a hand in drafting a notice of motion which listed a range of urgent social justice measures. When Senator Janet Powell moved it, that motion earned us the tag `the fairies at the bottom of the garden'-something of a badge of honour since the light on the top of the hill had grown very dim indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990-91 the Democrats' alternative Budget proposals are the first step in a continuing process not only to cost policy priorities, but also to show where the money is coming from. The proposals indicate a direction rather than a complete prescription and do not include all the additional measures the Democrats would fund, nor all the additional revenue options we would like to see pursued. However, it is urgent to make a start and while many of the alternative Budget proposals are starting points only, further action will follow in subsequent Budget years. In the macro-economic context they offer an alternative strategy to the high interest regime of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) which has hit families trying to buy a home and squeezed small business to within an inch of its life. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in turning to fiscal measures the Democrats reject the only strategy Mr Keating and Dr Hewson can conceive, and one that has been continued in this Budget-further cuts to badly needed health, education and welfare services. Instead we have shown that a surplus can be achieved not by cutting services but by making tax avoiders pay their fair share of tax just as pay as you earn taxpayers do. We have proposed a range of measures which will make our tax system more effective and more progressive, advance social objectives and raise more revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on community services is increased by $4 billion, while revenue is increased by $7.1 billion, yielding a potential additional surplus of $3.1 billion and opening the way for an accelerated reduction in interest rates and a lower exchange rate for our dollar to boost exports and reduce imports. We have included Landcare, forestry, energy conservation, habitat restoration and other conservation programs essential for a genuinely sustainable future. But this is not going to be achieved unless we enable all Australians to meet their basic needs and to participate fully in the social and political life of the nation. Accordingly, we have proposed to increase and extend young homeless and disability allowances, to provide concessional benefits for all pensioners with an income below $15,000 and to double the funding for grant-in-aid workers for ethnic communities-all of them neglected in the Treasurer's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Democrats advocate these and other urgent remedial measures to lift people out of poverty, we do not ask for institutionalised charity. Australian citizens are entitled to a level playing field, this time not just for large corporations, but for ordinary Australians. Hence there are increased resources and powers for the Foreign Investment Review Board, the Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Bureau of Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is additional funding to ensure local content programming at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and to protect the Special Broadcasting Service from commercialisation. There is increased funding for legal aid and more judges to make access to the law a reality. There is also a strong boost for public transport and a truly national railway system to be financed by higher excise on petrol and diesel fuel and a road freight levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased by two headlines which identify correctly the thrust of the Democrats' Budget proposals: in the Melbourne Age `Democrats propose tax-avoidance crackdown in alternative Budget', and in the Ballarat Courier `Democrats aim to tax rich to help poor'. In essence, it is a choice between allowing tax rorts to continue, maintaining low prices for health damaging products and allowing so-called entrepreneurs to rip off Australian families, or turning our country around with better research, better transport, an efficient and well supervised financial system, better education and a fair deal for homeless and unemployed people, pensioners and children in poverty. I know the choice which should be made, and look forward to working with you towards achieving these goals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first Australian Democrats were elected to Federal Parliament in 1977. Don Chipp and Colin Mason took their places in the Senate in July 1978. It is hard to believe that was 12 years ago-12 years of magnificent highs, terrible lows, and a great deal of very hard work. I know what it has been like for the Democrats in parliament over those 12 years because I have been working with the Democrats' parliamentary party since its inception all those years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With our very first try at an election, we achieved the election of two senators-both of them were men. That figure rose to five senators-one woman and four men; then to seven senators-three women and four men; and now eight senators-four women and four men. If we keep growing at this rate-and I see no reason to suppose that we will not-by the year 2002 the Democrats will have 16 senators, all of them women. It would probably be prudent to mention here that I have done similar calculations on the numbers of women elected by the other parties represented in this Parliament, and have discovered that although it will take us a lot longer to take over in those parties, by the turn of the next century-not the coming century but the next-the entire Senate will be composed of women. </PARA>
<PARA> Back to the Democrats. When we first arrived we were treated with fairness, enthusiasm and good will by the officers of the Senate, the library staff and all the others who work so hard to make sure this Parliament runs smoothly. We were treated rather warily and I must say in some cases with a bit of disdain by many of the other parliamentarians and their personal staff. If one was a Democrat in the building in those days one felt a bit like an Edwardian curiosity-put in an alien place and left to fend for oneself. I hasten to say that not all parliamentarians and their staff treated us that way. Some-many of them are still here today-were kind enough to be helpful and friendly. Many others ignored us and just hoped we would go away; we did not. Over the years, and through successive elections, we have consistently increased our representation in the chamber and we are now an accepted part of the Parliament. Some Democrats have been here so long that we are almost part of the furniture. </PARA>
<PARA> I worked in the old Parliament House for 10 years and I was very familiar with its faults. The building was small. It was very cramped and very inconvenient. Most of us spent our 15-hour working days sharing an office about the size of the average kitchen. But even though many of the old facilities did not work and despite it being a cold and draughty place with plumbing of Third World standards, I loved working there. I felt at home. I was as inconvenienced as anyone and I realised that the building had reached the point where it was becoming an embarrassment to Australia, but I did not want to leave. Its very inconvenience engendered a spirit of camaraderie with every person who worked there. The building was cosy; it was frenetic and infuriating, but it was cosy. For 10 years I watched the old Parliament House gradually deteriorating around us and I moved with reluctance. </PARA>
<PARA> This new building has a great deal more room, more public space, more marquetry, more artwork, more facilities-in fact, more of everything, which is a good thing. But this very abundance of space makes it less friendly. Looking back, I believe that those crowded, cramped and inadequate conditions of the old House had an advantage for our system of government. When we worked so closely together, we simply had to make the effort to get on with everyone. We faced people not just across the floors of the chambers but also in the corridors and bathrooms. We all had to be civil to survive in that rabbit warren. In fact, we made life much easier for ourselves if we were not just civil but also made the effort to be friendly as well-and it was not that difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> The ghost of that camaraderie still inhabits this building, and its influence is beginning to be felt. Obviously, it is in the interests of all Australians that we strive to make this as special and as cooperative a place as many of us remember that old building down the hill to have been. I should add that the new building is growing on me. Every time I come here, I feel a little more at home. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now accepted by the Australian public that the Australian Democrats represent a valid point of view, different from those of the other parties, and that we should remain a part of the political scene in this country-not just remain, but grow. Like all honourable senators here, I stood for election because I have strong views on the way Australia should be run and the way we should attempt to have an effect on the rest of the world. Sometimes we cannot just sit still and let things happen around us when we know those things to be unjust or threatening to the well-being of people we love. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that around me in this chamber are many people who feel the same way, even if they disagree with my priorities. The vast majority of us are here because we genuinely want to make Australia a better place in which to live-and we all believe we know the best way to do that. I believe that way is to protect as much of the natural environment as we can, to protect the basic human rights of not only every Australian but also, if possible, every human being, and to move towards the achievement of a sustainable economy for Australia and a sustainable environment for the world. </PARA>
<PARA> What is left of our natural environment all over the planet is a vital resource, a potential source of habitat, of medicines, of sanity and, above all, an essential element in the delicate web of interconnected ecological systems which the human race is currently attempting so assiduously to destroy. The earth is an intricate and precariously balanced network, and we must stop playing with it. Every fragment of the natural environment which is left on this planet should be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, as you know, each Democrat senator is given the responsibility of shadowing several portfolios. Mine are foreign affairs, energy and resources, arts and heritage, and housing. On the matter of energy, my basic priority, and that of the Democrats, is to increase Australia's use of and contribution to renewable energy sources. We are all only too aware that our major energy resources are finite and that we have no guarantee of their automatic availability even in the short term-and particularly at the moment. In the past, Australia has led the world in this field and we continue to produce extraordinarily talented and dedicated scientists and inventors. Their discoveries and inventions must be nurtured and given high priority in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> On heritage, we applaud the moves over recent years to preserve Australia's natural and built heritage. I am particularly pleased to see the increase in awareness and appreciation of that heritage. It is a remarkable development and one which I have been delighted to observe just in my short lifetime. We can all only benefit from it. </PARA>
<PARA> When we discuss arts, we have to ask ourselves: do we want to be a civilised nation or not? If we do, then we must move to preserve and foster our culture and an awareness of all those diverse areas we group under the heading of arts. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing is a very difficult and heart-rending subject for many people, especially in my home State of New South Wales. As parliamentarians whose responsibility is the welfare of all Australians, we should be striving for a basic change in that area. If we are ever to bring housing prices to a reasonable level, this change should include stronger restrictions on foreign ownership of Australian property. </PARA>
<PARA> We all have our favourite quotations, and I believe that they reveal a lot about us. I would like to use one now which is indicative of my attitude to foreign affairs. It comes from John Donne's Devotions XVII, which was written around 1620, hence the rather feudal tone. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> No man is an iland, intire of itselfe; every man is a peece of the continent, a part of the maine; if a clod bee washed away by the sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a promontorie were, as well as if a mannor of thy friends, or of thine owne were; any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankinde; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. </PARA>
<PARA>We live in revolutionary times. Never before have we been so aware so fast of what is happening to our fellow humans all over the world. What is happening is to a great extent exciting, liberating and literally a cause for dancing in the streets. But we cannot forget that we also live in a world where starvation and torture are still the norm in many places. We have every right to share the jubilation of those in eastern Europe whose lives and expectations are changing so dramatically; to share the optimism and hope of the majority of South Africans that apartheid is at last coming to an end. But we must never forget that we also have an obligation to do everything in our power to try to alleviate the suffering of those who are still living in poverty, slowly and inevitably starving to death, of those living in terror of brutal regimes and of those whose lives are constantly threatened and disrupted by war. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with most of the world, Australia really is a very lucky country. We live in a democracy where we all get a say in the composition of our Parliament, and where we need not worry that the local military junta will roll up to our door at any hour of the day or night and abduct one of our family by force, never to be seen or heard of again. We never have to contend with nightmares about the treatment of our children by a vicious, vindictive military power. </PARA>
<PARA> We are a relatively rich country, but that does not mean that we do not have to contend with the problem of Australians living in poverty. In particular, the conditions under which thousands of our children exist are unacceptable to a civilised society in the twentieth century. I was shocked to read that four years ago Sydney was the fourth most expensive city in the world in which to live; it is now the eighth most expensive. It is no wonder that so many Sydneysiders are living in abject or hidden poverty. Too many Australians are malnourished, but in world terms we are still fortunate. We do produce enough food for all of us, so no Australian need face the lingering torture of death by starvation. </PARA>
<PARA> Very occasionally, some blatant human rights abuse will take place in Australia and we will all be up in arms, inquiries will be held and the subsequent public outrage will eventually lead to some preventative action. The Australian belief in a fair go is never to be underestimated. But in far too many countries around the world human rights abuses occur with monotonous regularity. Even so, the world is going through a momentous period. I consider myself fortunate to have been elected at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to turn this first speech into an academy award speech, but I do feel a real need to put on record my special gratitude to my family and those friends from all political parties who supported me in the course of my preselection and election. They put up with a lot of long phone calls, fed me, did my shopping and washing and looked after me when I was ill. Without their love and support, I would not be here. </PARA>
<PARA> I especially thank all those Democrats who worked so hard to make sure that I was elected. No-one knows better than we do in this chamber how much hard work is involved in an election campaign and how much we require of our members and supporters. I can never thank them all enough for their hard work and their goodwill. </PARA>
<PARA> One in every eight people in New South Wales voted for the Democrats. They put their trust in me to represent them and do the best I possibly can to make Australia a better place in which to live. It is a demanding prospect. In Jonathan Swift's book Gulliver's Travels, Gulliver describes the Lilliputians' criteria for public office in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Since government is necessary to mankind, they believe . . . that providence never intended to make management of public affairs a mystery, to be comprehended only by a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born in an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to be in every man's power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by experience and a good intention, would qualify any man for service of his country. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not imagine myself to be one of those three geniuses born in our age. But I do have a healthy respect for and knowledge of our parliamentary system and, in particular, of the way the Senate works. I do have the very best of intentions. I imagine that if Swift had been writing in this century those qualities would also have qualified women for the service of their country. I hope that they, and my genuine desire to improve the lot of my fellow humankind, will be enough to allow me to acquit myself well in this place. I look forward to the challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I have looked forward to this moment with great anticipation, but now I find myself with mixed emotions. The honour of being elected by the people of Queensland to represent them in this chamber is immense and goes without question. To have the opportunity to serve beside such talented Democrat colleagues is also a great privilege. The increased Democrat presence in this chamber I see as a great benefit to Australia and to future generations of Australians. But the obvious excitement I feel at being on my feet in this chamber for the first time is tempered by a strong sense of responsibility and some concern as I consider the tremendous responsibilities entrusted to us by the people of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The German sociologist Max Weber has said, `True politicians should be characterised by (1) passion, (2) a feeling of responsibility and (3) a sense of proportion'. How many of us here tonight have as our motivating passion or cause the simple desire to leave the world a better place than we find it? If my child and grandchildren in later years are in a better world than that in which we find ourselves today, and I have done my utmost to secure their future during my time in this chamber, then I will have realised my political passion. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I am only the fifth woman since Federation elected to the Senate to represent Queensland. I come to this position tonight as the result of a chain of events which began when I was a teenager. Current affairs debates with my father were a regular occurrence in our family, but politics was first mentioned to me by my local Liberal member of State parliament, Mr Milton Morris, after I had made a speech at an official function at my high school. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Bell, in his first speech, told the chamber of his success in handwriting competitions. I want to place on record the fact that the Ringarooma Kid is now joined on the Democrat benches by a Lions Club Youth of the Year-1965 vintage. I mention this because that experience, in the second half of my teens, clarified for me an understanding of my desire to contribute to society and to have a say where decisions which affected me were made. The particular shape of that contribution came in 1979 when I joined the Australian Democrats. I had found the Party for me and, I might say, for over a million voting Australians at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the 10 years that I have stood as a Democrat candidate many people have expressed a disbelief that I would choose to move from a profession which enjoys some respect to become a politician. It concerns me greatly that Australians consider most politicians to be self-serving, dishonest and isolated from the real world. I know that is not the case. Nevertheless, recent events in Queensland resulting in charges being laid against former National Party Ministers, and some of the evidence presented to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, must cause us all to reflect on the public perception of our role. </PARA>
<PARA> An endearing quality of Australians is the way in which they call a spade, a spade; many Australians tell me they find it hard to accept that their local member of parliament tells them privately that he supports their cause, but then has to vote against it because of party discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are a natural part of a worldwide movement demanding participatory democracy and greater accountability and they will in the next 50 years, I believe, demand an end to rigid party line politics. Issues and political decisions are no longer black or white-or even grey. There is an increasing need for dialogue and for a multi-partisan approach. The old rhetoric and labels of the past are unconvincing. The short term focus of successive governments has put our country in what many Australians regard as a perilous position. </PARA>
<PARA> We as a House of review will, I hope, place greater emphasis on the long term effects of our decisions. Such decisions made over the next 4,000 days by governments around the world, including our own, will either guarantee our children a safe and sustainable future or will ruin forever this fragile planet we have so long abused. It is rather sobering to reflect that we have only 4,000 days to the next century-4,000 days to get our house in better order. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining I want to touch on a number of subjects important to me, to my portfolio responsibilities and to the people of Queensland. I want to begin with my passionate concern for the increasing foreign ownership of Australia's best and most beautiful land. </PARA>
<PARA> For 40,000 years or more our economy, in the hands of the original Australians, was totally sustainable. But in the blink of an eye-in the last 200 years since Europeans landed, and more especially in the last decade-control of Australia's economy has been passing out of the hands of Australians and into the clutches of foreign banks and financiers. In the name of short term economic solutions we are ceding control of this country's assets to overseas privateers and, at the same time, we are paying those foreigners some millions of dollars per hour for the privilege of their control!</PARA>
<PARA> It does not stop there. It really concerns me that both the Government and the Opposition would have us believe it is in our children's best interests to sell freehold title to the best parts of Australia to foreign speculators. But let us not blame only those foreign speculators who can spot a brilliant investment. Let us not lose sight of the number of Australian developers who get local government approval to impose on unsuspecting communities a hideous form of urban development ranging from a multifunction polis to a `mini city', and then sell off those plans overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> This, I believe, is where Australia is really being betrayed. Just think of an Australia 20 or 30 years from now where every headland boasts a high-rise development; where places we used to go fishing with our mum and dad are denied to our grandchildren because a tourist resort has been built for the sole use of foreign holiday makers. Think of an Australia without the unspoiled beauty of clean beaches, virgin rainforest, clear, clean tropical waters and old growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have tried to deflect genuine public concern by attempting to confuse foreign ownership with foreign investment. They would have us believe that the majority of Australians-those who oppose selling this country out from under us-are racist and anti-foreign investment when nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we need foreign investment. We are, and continue to be, a developing country. But we do not need foreign investment at the expense of our birthright. If our country is so attractive to overseas investors-if we represent a desirable investment target in international terms-well and good. But if foreign investors want Australia, then let them lease it. With majority Australian equity and the benefit of leasehold we can still enjoy title to what is ours, while the foreign investors and their Australian partners are free to enjoy the commercial success or otherwise of their venture. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor in this equation is the role played by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). Currently, part time directors virtually rubber-stamp foreign investment proposals, which are very rarely blocked. Although there is a power of forfeiture of an asset, there is no investigation into acquisitions by foreign buyers to ensure compliance with the law. I do not think that is good enough. The 1986 change in FIRB criteria for approval of acquisitions from `economic benefit' to `not contrary to the national interest' is an attempt to defraud the people of Australia. `Not contrary to the national interest' to the Treasurer simply means anything which will attract currency to Australia in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, the long term effects of such a policy are already being seen in the vertical integration of both the tourist and beef cattle industries in Queensland. It is not in the national interest for around 85 per cent of profits from these industries to flow from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, much of the business of this chamber over the last seven years in particular has focused attention on privatisation, on deregulation and on all the benefits that allegedly flow from these things. The deregulation of our airline system is imminent. As a matter of fact, I have to speak on the relevant Bill first thing in the morning. To blindly follow the United States example is, I believe, a grave mistake. Already, fares which initially came down in the United States are spiralling upwards again. The megacarriers, through a process of natural attrition, have control of the industry again and what may have initially been perceived as benefits to consumers are fast being eroded. In fact, the United States is now looking at some form of re-regulation. Our governments do not seem to wish to learn from the mistakes of others. Once they have set a course, no deviations are allowed, no matter how compelling the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The safety standards of Australia's major airlines are internationally renowned. Australian pilots are second to none in terms of both training and professionalism. That our safety standards are the world's best is a tribute to the dedication of pilots, engineers, maintenance and safety staff and cabin crew. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I am not convinced that de- regulation will result over time in major benefits to the consumer, my major concern with deregulation of the domestic airlines is the potential erosion of safety standards. The United States carrier Eastern Airlines is facing 60 safety related criminal charges at present, including faking maintenance records. This, I believe, is what competition at its very worst can bring. The unfortunate part is that it attracts unsuspecting passengers who can pay with their lives. It is imperative that the Government, the Civil Aviation Authority and the airline industry cooperate to the fullest to ensure that no similar erosion of standards occurs here. </PARA>
<PARA> The head of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Dick Smith, has been promoting a concept of affordable safety. We should note that this concept is nothing new; affordable safety is what has always been practised throughout the industry, from the design of a wing spar at Boeing's Seattle plant to passenger loads on small Australian commuter aircraft. Every day the level of affordable safety is being revised by competent professionals who have dedicated their lives to aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Smith has shown himself to be an extremely competent businessman with an ability to lead by example. His adventures, his retailing and his publishing efforts have attracted a great deal of attention and he is now a well-known and admired Australian. But Mr Smith is a new arrival on the professional aviation scene and his attempts at redefinition of what is affordable in terms of safety are not being done by a worldwide consensus of aviation professionals. This is a matter which I intend to monitor closely. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a proposal which encompasses a number of issues of concern to the people of Queensland especially-the proposed Cape York spaceport. What a grand dream it is: Australia reaping hundreds of millions of dollars annually through provision of facilities, utilising technology from the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It all sounds easy when one says it quickly, so it is not surprising that the whole issue has snowballed until we find an attitude not of `if' the project will proceed, but `when'. As far as I and other Democrats are concerned, the spaceport is not a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia need some specific answers to some very pertinent questions: first, what is the real purpose of the base? Will it be used for military purposes? Any possibility, no matter how remote, that such a facility may be used for military purposes is totally unacceptable. Second, will the establishment of such a project really be of long term benefit to the nation as a whole? Or, on the other hand, will the tremendous costs environmentally, socially and financially outweigh any possible benefits? Is there any evidence that Essington Developments, as promoter of the spaceport, is living in a commercial dream world? The Comalco-led Australian space group dropped its plans for a spaceport on Cape York last year after it concluded that the project was `tenuous' and `unacceptable by general private commercial standards'. And Comalco is not alone. In a recent edition of the respected science magazine Search, Dr Sam Paltridge of the Centre for International Research on Communication and Information Technologies said that the Essington proposal was surrounded by `several myths'. He observed that most existing domestic satellite systems were characterised by `poor financial performance'-and we need look no further than Aussat for confirmation of that-and that these domestic satellite systems were already victims of substantial overcapacity. Dr Paltridge also stated that the onset of competitive fibre optic technology would greatly increase the capacity of telecommunication networks in direct competition with satellites. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not stop there. The world leader in commercial satellite launches, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, concludes that `the longer term demand for commercial launches of satellites was weak at best'. So there we have it. The international industry leaders say no and Essington says yes. </PARA>
<PARA> What of Essington itself? Honourable senators are no doubt aware that Essington's financial dealings were the subject of much interest in the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union as recently as 1985. It has been predicted that Essington will maintain a stake of only 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the spaceport venture, with most of the remaining equity falling into Japanese and American hands. In other words, we are being asked to sacrifice an area of international, ecological and environmental significance to allow a company with a dubious financial and management track record to make a tentative venture into one of the most sophisticated industries in the world, with little or no hope of commercial success, according to the international experts, for a measly 10 per cent of the deal. </PARA>
<PARA> The spaceport will decimate a 200,000 hectare site and we will lose forever at least 10 per cent of the portion of north-east Cape York registered as national estate. Mr Deputy President and honourable senators, surely, as trustees of this country for future generations, we have an obligation to do more than pay lip service to protection of this area of unquestionable international significance. </PARA>
<PARA> Before leaving this issue, I wish to raise the question of dislocation of the local Aboriginal inhabitants. Ninety years ago the Wathooti and Cuckoo Yu tribes were driven at gunpoint from their homes at Cape Grenville. Do we simply continue to perpetuate this unforgivable behaviour by once again denying the traditional occupants title to their homeland in the name of progress and to benefit a foreign backed conglomerate?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, because to me people are ultimately much more important than portfolios, I too wish to place on record my thanks to all of those who worked so hard to secure my election, which was never a certainty: my parents, for teaching their three daughters in the 1950s that females could achieve success equal to males; my husband, Gavin, for his generosity of spirit and unflagging support; our daughter, Sian, who is only seven years old, for her loving acceptance of a role which means that we spend more time apart than we would like to as a family; and the West End Uniting Church congregation for their moral support and confidence in me despite their own political persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to single out two people who have made extremely valuable contributions to my success and who are unable to be here tonight. The first is Stephen Tyler, a former State Secretary of the Democrats in Queensland, who died last December at the age of 35. Stephen had such a passion for reading Daily Hansard that it was noted at his funeral. I think we would have to argue that this is an unusual passion, and so I thought it a fitting tribute to him that his name be recorded within these very pages. The second person, John, is, I hope, listening to this broadcast in a hospice in Brisbane. I thank him especially for his spirited debates. It does not matter, John, that I was not won over. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I am absolutely delighted to have made it to this place at last. I thank Mr President in his absence; I thank honourable senators from across the political groupings in this chamber, and I thank the staff of the Department of the Senate for their warm welcome and assistance to No. 76 on the pecking order. To achieve and maintain the passion, the feeling of responsibility and the sense of proportion of Weber's true politician is my challenge in this place. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>There are three volumes to this final report from the National Drought Policy Review Task Force, which I would like to just make a few comments about. I believe that information on drought is very important to rural Australia. Queensland is a very big State; some parts have good weather and other parts are very susceptible to drought, and I believe it is very important that we look at the contents of one or two of the report volumes that are here before us today. The Task Force has certainly put down quite a lot of information about droughts and tells us in chapter 22 what its policy objectives are:</PARA>
<PARA> Our terms of reference require the Task Force to identify policy options to encourage primary producers and other segments of rural Australia to adopt self-reliant approaches to the management of drought. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 5 million people live in rural and provincial areas. Though most are not primary producers, the agricultural sector is a vital part of the rural economy. </PARA>
<PARA>This is indeed true. There is in the report a part which says that the task force recommends against the reinstatement of drought within the natural disaster relief arrangements. That really is a very big worry, I believe, to many of our people who over the years have been assailed by drought-and when one lives in the country one really knows all about drought. I lived in the city until I got married and went to live at Kingaroy. In the city one just turns a tap on to get water and, if it rains, we think it is a jolly nuisance. In the country we do not get the rain and we do not have the water to turn the tap on for, and it is a very big problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, you lived at Gallangowan in the Barambah electorate for quite some time, I believe, while you were teaching there, and you would know from those years just what I am talking about. I believe that this is something that we as senators really have to give consideration to. I do not believe that we want to go along with the Task Force recommendation against the reinstatement of drought within the natural disaster relief arrangements. I believe drought is something that demands help from governments, but when one reads this report one almost feels that drought is going to disappear from the vocabulary of natural disaster. The Government says, and the Task Force more or less indicates, that people should manage their farms better-`Do not worry about the drought but manage your tasks better'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us think back to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and the problem that that company had: the Government was willing to give it money to help it to manage its business better. And I believe it is very important indeed that the Government continue to help people in rural Australia who are the primary producers and who are the export earners. We need to be sure that we are able to continue to give them the help that they will need at the time of drought. </PARA>

The first is made up of Australians trapped in Kuwait and Iraq, and the second is made up of people in Australia of Iraqi background now subjected to some unhappy pressure. We are moved to the depths by the plight of our fellows in Iraq and Kuwait locked in, as they are, with horrible threats. All decent people moved by compassion will do all they can to free them. They are the innocent victims of a ravaging force which arose and encompassed them with fearful speed. They deserve all the help we have in our power to give.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are residents in Australia subject to harassment by parts of the media. Stuart Littlemore's Media Watch on Monday night's Australian Broadcasting Corporation television was stark evidence of that. It showed a section of the media pursuing people of Iraqi background to wring from them confessions of support or opposition to this country's part in the Gulf conflict. We must see to it that residents of Australia are not subjected to subtle persecution because of the views they hold. If they articulate those views in a reasonable way, they act within their rights. Australia is a tolerant, enlightened and fair society. It is fundamentally different from the harsh and oppressive countries all too numerous around the globe. Gross prejudice arises through a perverted view of the qualities of another's race, language, heritage or beliefs. It is to be discouraged. As long as a person obeys the laws of the land, he or she should be able to walk freely abroad unharassed by people who exhibit their nationalism from the safety of these shores. </PARA>

From those papers it seems clear to me that the Government, through the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, has abused the parliamentary provisions covering the disclosure of budgetary expenditure. In my view, the Advance to the Minister for Finance has been illegally used to make special payments to favoured States at the expense of others. These payments are over and above those publicly revealed at the recent Premiers Conference. They total no less than $72m, and they were made to three Labor States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Drought Policy Task Force</PARA>
<PARA> I will just explain the reason for my concern. The Advance to the Minister for Finance is, in effect, the Government of the day's reserve funds for use to meet purposes that were unforeseen at the time of Budget Appropriations and for which there is an urgent requirement for expenditure. The legal provisions relating to this are that the money is available for expenditure if the Minister for Finance is satisfied that the expenditure is urgently required and `was unforeseen until after the last day on which it was practicable to include appropriation for that expenditure in the Bill for the particular Act before the introduction of that Bill into the House of Representatives'. Departments are able to apply to the Minister for Finance for funds which are urgent and which are unforeseen at the time of the Budget Appropriations and the Minister for Finance can then authorise that one-time payment or he or she can reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> In some instances agreement will be made for departments to later reimburse the amount to the Minister for Finance.  There is no limit to the number or amount of advances apart, of course, from the overall budgetary constraints. There is also no legal requirement, other than that which I have just read out and, in fact, that does make it a legal requirement for the Minister for Finance to demonstrate the appropriateness of the words `urgent' and `unforeseen'. </PARA>
<PARA> Advances to the Minister for Finance do not appear in the Appropriation Bills, nor are they passed by the Parliament in the way that other money Bills are. Advances to the Minister theoretically are scrutinised through members and senators carefully examining the advances when they are tabled in Parliament, through the Senate Estimates committee process and through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. However, because of their relative obscurity, such scrutiny rarely occurs. Labor has developed into an art form the use of the advances to the Minister for Finance by disguising payments for purposes it wishes to shield from open and public knowledge and scrutiny. More and more, Labor has made its sensitive political payments through the advances to the Minister, instead of through special or other appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In June of this year the Advance to the Minister for Finance showed a number of special payments to three Labor States. These were, firstly, a payment of $40m to Tasmania for a capital grant for restructuring the public service; secondly, a $20m payment to Western Australia for a capital grant for transport improvement; and, thirdly, a $12m payment to South Australia for a capital grant for water treatment projects. All three of those payments were highly political and controversial. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Tasmanian $40m, the special payment was controversial because it was announced subsequent to the Premiers Conference even though the payment, as disclosed from the papers tabled in the Senate today, had been approved by the Minister for Finance before the Premiers Conference. That payment should have been fully disclosed at the Premiers Conference to ensure a fair understanding and fair treatment by all parties participating at the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Western Australian payment of $20m for a capital grant for transport improvement, that payment was made on 29 June, the final day of the Premiers Conference. The payment was never publicly announced until its appearance in the documents tabled in the Senate today. The timing of the approval- that is, the final day of the Premiers Conference-would indicate quite clearly that a special deal was made at the Premiers Conference after Premier Lawrence had met with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The third payment to which I referred, the $12m to South Australia for a capital grant for water treatment projects, was another deal that was not announced publicly until today. However, this payment follows three consecutive payments for water treatment projects made in 1986-87 and onwards from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Those payments now total more than $100m. Quite clearly, with four annual payments now, there is no way in the world that anyone could suggest that that payment was either unforeseen or urgent. Again, this last payment was approved after the Prime Minister and the Treasurer had met with Premier Bannon on 29 June, the final day of the Premiers Conference. I wonder why that Premiers Conference was extended against everyone's expectations for that second day. Was it, as it increasingly appears likely, simply to enable these secret political deals to be done with the Labor States? I suggest that it is no coincidence whatsoever that Premier Bannon was also the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of these secret payments through the Advance to the Minister for Finance are very important because they impinge on all the States of the Commonwealth. These payments undermine the fairness of the existing Commonwealth/State funding arrangements, particularly with regard to the distribution of the pool of funds available to all States. That flies totally in the face of the Prime Minister's recent call for a mutually fairer system of Commonwealth/State relations. </PARA>
<PARA> These advances tabled today show that this fairness is not in evidence. It does not occur. Labor is giving special payments to favoured States controlled by Labor governments. It is no coincidence that these payments also take the form of capital grants, rather than recurrent grants. The significance of that is that it means that the Commonwealth Grants Commission will not take the payments into account in its formulation of recommendations on the appropriate distribution of payments to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing payments, those to South Australia in particular, represent quite a clear abuse of the whole purpose of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The payments were purely political and cannot, as I said earlier, in any sense be seen as unforeseen. One of the intentions was quite clearly to hide the payments from the other States at the time of the Premiers Conference and, therefore, to the very grave financial disadvantage of those other States. The other intention was, of course, to limit parliamentary scrutiny of a quite massive secret deal, amounting, as I said, to $72m, done between the Labor Party cronies. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of this important budgetary tool, the Advance to the Minister for Finance, is being undermined in this way by unscrupulous, devious and, I believe, illegal use of the Advance for political purposes. It is no less than a prostitution of the basic parliamentary principle that the expenditure of public moneys should be subject to freely accessible public scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Department estimates that in June 1990 there were some 44,400 nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC) temporarily in Australia, most of whom would have arrived as ELICOS students. Of this number:</PARA>
<PARA> - some 19,400 were here on 20 June 1989 and have not since departed or been granted permanent residence (eg through marriage);</PARA>
<PARA> - the balance of 25,000 is the net number of arrivals after 20 June 1989 less departures and change of status cases. This figure is based on actual numbers to February 1990 and estimates for arrivals for the period March to June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment, Education and Training advises that as at the end of April 1990, some 9,200 Chinese students were studying in Australia under the ELICOS program. Other PRC nationals would either be in other non-formal course studies, formal course studies, or be dependants of students or in other temporary entry categories.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Latest figures available on student overstayers in Australia are as at 31 December 1989. Of all Chinese ELICOS students who arrived in Australia between July 1987 and December 1989, some 4,000 were still in Australia as overstayers on 31 December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that earlier this year the Government offered all PRC nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 whether here legally or illegally an opportunity to remain until January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The number of ELICOS overstayers has been studied by an Interdepartmental Committee which has recently reviewed non-formal student entry to Australia. As a result of this review, the Government announced on 30 July 1990 a major overhaul of policy. The new provisions which are to be implemented on 1 January 1991, are aimed at ensuring that only genuine students enter Australia and that the ELICOS industry is properly regulated via Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced its detailed response to the specific issue of PRC students seeking to remain in Australia on 27 June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) Australian Minerals and Energy Council (AMEC) does not have a full time Secretariat or staff. The service arrangements for each meeting are provided by the Department of the host Minister from existing Departmental resources. This practice was instituted following the eighteenth meeting, held in Adelaide on 27 May 1988. Prior to that the Commonwealth provided a secretariat service for all meetings, although this was provided through existing resources of the Department of Resources and Energy and its predecessors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Forestry Council is serviced by a Secretariat of two staff, located within the Forestry Branch of the Land Resources Division (Department of Primary Industries and Energy).</PARA>
<PARA> Costs associated with the Secretariat include salaries, travel (this varies according to where the meetings are to be held), printing of resolutions and general administration costs.</PARA>
<PARA> Secretariat services for the MDBMC have been provided by the Office of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission (MDBC) since 1 January 1988. There are no discrete secretariat staff as the secretariat function is performed within the overall activities of the MDBC while discharging its responsibilities under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> Operating costs of the MDBC are apportioned between the four Contracting Governments in accordance with the Agreement. There is no discrete allocation of funds for the Secretariat function within the Commission's estimates.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1 January 1988 Secretariat services were provided by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) and the former Department of Resources and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Secretariat for the Australian Water Resources Council (AWRC) and its Standing Committee is provided by the Water Branch (DPIE). The total staff resources allocated to the Secretariat is approximately 1.5 staff which includes administration of the AWRC publication program.</PARA>
<PARA> A recent audit report (1989) estimated that the total staff costs (including estimated on-costs) were $78,017 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Agricultural Council (AAC) is serviced by a Secretariat in the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE). The Secretariat consists of three officers and is financed by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.

<PARA> (1) With regard to the Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women's submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology Inquiry into Small Business which recommends that: (a) the Small Business Association be used by government to disseminate information to members; (b) access to the conciliation and arbitration system be granted to small business representatives; and (c) a review of Federal and State Governments' taxation of small businesses be undertaken, particularly provisional tax and prescribed payments, what action has the Minister taken to address these matters to help women in small business.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Can the Minister advise how many women are proprietors of small businesses.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Report on Small Business in Australia prepared by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and released in February 1990, addressed many of the issues for small business in Australia. Many recommendations of the report respond to concerns raised by the Federation of Business and Professional Women, including taxation reform, a review of finance for small business, superannuation, and industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> Business associations, including the Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women, have been involved in consultations and have provided input helpful to the Government in formulating its response to the Report. The Minister for Small Business and Customs expects to be able to table the Government's response to the Report in the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the particular areas of concern raised by the honourable senator:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (a) The responsibility for the delivery of most small business programs is at State and Territory level through relevant small business agencies. Most communications will therefore take place at that level. The Commonwealth, for its part, will be examining the particular recommendations raised in the Report about improved communications.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) In respect of access to the conciliation and arbitration system, I am advised that under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 employers, including those operating small businesses, are entitled to appear before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) either as an individual employer or as part of an organisation of employers registered under the Act. To register as an employer organisation, the applicant members must employ, on aggregate, at least 1000 employees unless the designated Presidential Member is satisfied that special circumstances justify the association's registration.</PARA>
<PARA> Any small business may gain access to the AIRC by way of a right to notify a dispute under s.99 of the Act; and/or participation in the award making process in settlement of the dispute. In addition, a small business which is not a party to a proceeding may, under s.43 of the Act, seek leave of the AIRC to intervene in the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (c) In relation to the matters of Commonwealth taxation put forward by the Federation, this also will be the subject of Government consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are 248,700 female business proprietors according to Australian Bureau of Statistics 1988, Small Business in Australia 1983-84 to 1986-87, ABS, Canberra. These women represent more than one third of all business proprietors. An update on this information is currently being prepared for publication by ABS and should be available later this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status for Women, upon notice, on 12 December 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Minister aware of the fact that women make up only 5 per cent of the total number of Commonwealth car drivers in Australia, with only 22 out of a total of 489.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it that there are few female applicants for these positions, or is this inherent in governmental procedures that discriminate against women either by dissuasion or in the interview process.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is it that the Government's internal procedures do not promote women into these positions, or is it that there are no equal employment opportunity guidelines in place for Commonwealth car drivers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As the Minister responsible for the Status of Women, has the Minister given consideration to implementing a campaign to recruit more women; if not, why not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The latest figures available from the Transport and Storage Group (TSG) of the Department of Administrative Services are that at 9 August 1990 there were 479 male and 22 female Commonwealth car drivers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have been informed by the TSG that female car drivers were first employed in 1984 following press advertisements around Australia. They advise that since 1984, 66 males and 4 females have been employed as car drivers from within the Department, and 79 males and 19 females have been employed from outside TSG.</PARA>
<PARA> The number of women appointed over that period was proportionally higher in relation to the number of their applications than for men.</PARA>
<PARA> The selection criteria do not discriminate against women and TSG has continued to appoint women as and when vacancies arise. It should be noted that the number of vacancies which arise is very small.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) TSG follows the Equal Employment Opportunity guidelines of the Government and has ensured that women are given every opportunity for employment when vacancies arise.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been, however, a few occasions when the need to redeploy longstanding employees from other areas of TSG has meant that males have been placed as car drivers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Given that the number of Commonwealth car drivers to be recruited in the near future is unlikely to be significant, it would not be appropriate to conduct a campaign to increase the number of female drivers.</PARA>
