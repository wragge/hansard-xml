<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to various bounty Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's major purpose is to amend the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 to continue the computer bounty scheme for a further five years to 31 December 1995, but with some programmed changes to the bounty rate to align it with other general reductions in protection. The other amendments in this Bill to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984, Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 and Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Act 1990 are of a minor technical nature and are explained in greater detail in the clause notes to schedule 1 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed extension of the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 reflects this Government's strong commitment to encouraging the development and utilisation of computer based technologies as outlined in the Government's information industries strategy announced in September 1987. In fact, the bounty is a significant factor supporting the thrust of the strategy which is to foster the development of internationally competitive and technologically advanced industries which pay greater attention to product research and development, innovation and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> The OECD estimates that the information industries account for some 14 per cent of world trade and are growing much faster than world trade generally. The Australian information technology market was valued at $10.8 billion in 1989 and is forecast to more than double by the early l990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous bounty scheme as provided for by the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 expired on 5 July 1990. This scheme in turn succeeded the ADP equipment bounty scheme introduced in 1977. The original bounty rate of 25% on the value-added in local production was reduced to 20% in the 1986 Budget and this is the rate which has operated since then. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this historical fact of a bounty being paid on computer based equipment to demonstrate that successive Australian governments have supported through means which have included a bounty, the development of an internationally competitive manufacturing industry and the need to improve the productivity and the competitiveness of all industry sectors by the wider application of information processing technologies. Indeed these objectives are central to the continued bounty scheme which this Bill provides for. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty will continue to be paid to eligible producers of computer based equipment, covering mainly computers, microprocessor based controllers and regulators, modems and multiplexers, hybrid circuits, integrated circuitry, and systems software associated with eligible items. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty has been instrumental in the development of a number of industry sectors including computer manufacturers, manufacturers of engineering, medical and scientific equipment incorporating microprocessor based programmable controllers, application specific integrated circuits, hybrid circuits, and electronic funds transfer point of sale equipment, this latter area being one in which Australia is a world leader. </PARA>
<PARA> The bountiable items are incorporated into a wide range of user applications in almost all industry sectors, including automotive, telecommunications, consumer electronics, scientific and medical, banking and finance, transport and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the expiry of the previous computer bounty on 5 July 1990, this Bill provides for continuation of the new bounty scheme from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The computer bounty addresses, in particular, two key areas of the information industries strategy. Firstly, the need to continue Australian industry's efforts in information technology product research and development. Successful commercialised research and development in Australia provides manufacturing with an edge necessary for exploitation in a highly competitive market. The high technology nature of the information industries makes reliance on research and development imperative to compete effectively in the major markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Industry Economics (``BIE'') in its ``Program Evaluation Report No. 8-The Computer Bounty Scheme'' released on 22 February 1990, pointed to the high proportion of research and development undertaken by the bountiable goods sector. The sector is a strong R&amp; performer with an average R&amp; intensity (the ratio of R&amp; expenditure to turnover) of 9%, far in excess of the manufacturing average of 1%. </PARA>
<PARA> The BIE concluded that the bounty has contributed to the substantial level of R&amp; expenditure occurring within the sector which it assessed had increased from $13 million in 1985/86 to $33 million in 1988/89. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is recognised that Australia is at the forefront with other industrialised nations in the taking up of computer based technologies, a judgment as to whether a diffusion of the bountiable technologies to user industries is satisfactory must remain subjective. It would be impossible to attribute increased usage totally to the bounty scheme, nevertheless the Government is satisfied that the bounty has had a major positive impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The BIE's analysis has found that the sector involved in the manufacture of bountiable equipment had, on average, experienced a 25% sales growth per annum since the bounty's inception. This compares with sales growth in manufacturing as a whole of around 10% per annum over the same period, suggesting that the bounty has been influential in encouraging the development of new products which have sold very successfully on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, movements in the Australian dollar have also been a factor as the sector is very sensitive to competition both here and overseas. However, in the absence of the bounty it is certain that the industry would be much smaller and less vibrant than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA> The second key area of the information industries strategy in which the computer bounty plays an important role is the enhanced international integration of these industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The sector's primary orientation lies in the production of goods for niche markets rather than for the mass market. These goods, therefore, have a degree of customisation which allows production volumes to be smaller and marketing more directed in a fiercely competitive market environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The BIE's analysis shows the computer based equipment industry to be an outstanding export performer. Its export propensity has averaged between 39 and 51 per cent over the past four years. This is more than double the export propensity of manufacturing as a whole which is about 21%. The sector's exports increased from some $66 million in 1985/86 to $141 million in 1988/89.</PARA>
<PARA> The coverage of the bounty has been seen by some as a potentially problematic area, both in terms of its budgetary impact and perceptions about who should benefit from the bounty. Suggestions to limit eligibility have included:</PARA>
<PARA>. restrictions on the types of products eligible for bounty</PARA>
<PARA>. excluding foreign multinationals on the basis that Australian taxpayers should not subsidise them</PARA>
<PARA>. removing from eligibility those ``screwdriver'' operations where product development is not carried out in Australia, or where manufacturing activity is based only on assembly of imported built-up components</PARA>
<PARA>. putting upper limits on bounty claims to exclude those larger operations which should not need assistance</PARA>
<PARA>. putting lower limits on bounty claims to exclude smaller firms and thereby reduce administrative costs; and</PARA>
<PARA>. qualifying entry depending on export and/or R&amp; levels</PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no economic justification for such restrictions. Restricting eligibility to Australian owned firms would distort commercial decisions as many transnational subsidiaries operate no differently from their Australian counterparts, and are faced with the same tariff input costs on imported components. To base eligibility on firm size would create anomalies associated with the degree of specialisation in bountiable products or the degree of in-house manufacturing. Uneconomic behaviour would most likely result as firms attempt to regain eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, administration of such restrictions would become increasingly subjective and administrative costs would increase substantially due to additional requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the rate of bounty to be adjusted under the new bounty scheme to:</PARA>
<PARA>. 7% from 6 July 1990;</PARA>
<PARA>. 15% from 1 July 1991;</PARA>
<PARA>. 13% from 1 July 1992;</PARA>
<PARA>. 11% from 1 July 1993; and</PARA>
<PARA>. 9% from 1 July 1994 to 31 December 1995</PARA>
<PARA> This phasing down of the bounty rate will maintain the relationship between the effective rate of assistance for the bountiable goods sector and that of manufacturing generally (excluding the passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear sectors) and takes into account the general tariff reductions program announced in the Government's 1988 May statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have previously highlighted, the computer bounty is a significant element of the Government's information industries strategy; and industry, both locally and foreign owned, closely identifies the Government's decision to continue the bounty with its commitment to the development of this important group of industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuation of the bounty for five years to 31 December 1995 effectively demonstrates this Government's commitment to these industries and provides a time frame for industry to adjust to the decreasing levels of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, continuation of the bounty as provided by this Bill will effectively mean that Australian manufacturers and users of computer based equipment and technologies will continue to have access to these at close to world prices, and thereby will be encouraged to continue the process of transition to increased levels of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of extending the computer bounty is estimated to be, at current prices:</PARA>
<PARA>. $37.6M in 1990/91;</PARA>
<PARA>. $38.0M in 1991/92;</PARA>
<PARA>. $36.0M in 1992/93;</PARA>
<PARA>. $34.0M in 1993/94;</PARA>
<PARA>. $32.0M in 1994/95; and</PARA>
<PARA>. $25.0M in 1995/96</PARA>
<PARA> The other proposed amendments in the Bill have no direct financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate, and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>I object most strongly to the further attacks made on May 25, 1990 by Senator MacGibbon with the benefit of the full protection of Parliament. The right of freedom of speech of members of Parliament, to which Senator MacGibbon referred, carries with it special responsibility to ensure that the privilege is not abused. </PARA>
<PARA>It is intolerable that any citizen should be the subject of repeated unsubstantiated allegations made under the protection of Parliament and, more particularly, when the allegations are repeated and expanded upon in the context of a recommendation by the Committee of Privileges that a response to earlier remarks be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>I categorically deny:</PARA>
<PARA>1. That I set out to intimidate, bully or to force Senator MacGibbon into silence;</PARA>
<PARA>2. That any part of my response to the earlier remarks of Senator MacGibbon was misleading, lacking in courtesy or dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA> In my first response, I did not seek to quote from the second or third letters which Senator MacGibbon received because he had previously tabled those in Hansard. I incorporated the first letter in my response because Senator MacGibbon had referred to it in his remarks about me but declined to table the letter. </PARA>

<PARA> 1. Clause 7, page 2, lines 28 to 32, leave out the definition of ``provisional tax uplift factor'', insert the following definition: `` `provisional tax uplift factor', in relation to a year of income, means, until the Parliament otherwise provides, 10%.''</PARA>
<PARA>During the debate last night I commented on the principles relating to standing charges by virtue of examples of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill and the Income Tax Amendment Bill imposing those taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> I now advert to this particular matter of the provisional tax uplift factor. This has been at 10 per cent for the last five or six years. Clearly, this level has been generally accepted. It simply wastes the chamber's time to impose a particular level each year. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment also rejects the Government's proposition that we give the Government authority to be able to amend the level by regulation. If the Government wants to change the standing charge of 10 per cent, we think it must come back to Parliament. The amendment clearly states `until the Parliament otherwise provides'. </PARA>
<PARA> All other taxes are introduced and legislated for in a similar manner. The sales tax, the fringe benefits tax, the withholding tax and income tax rates are all there as standing charges until an amendment is moved. If the Australian Democrats and the Opposition wish to move amendments to tax legislation, there is ample opportunity. Many tax Bills come in each year. There is no substance in the argument that this imposition of a particular rate of withholding tax uplift must be brought in by a separate Bill each year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As I mentioned last night, the coalition is deeply concerned about the Australian Democrats' change in philosophy since the days of Don Chipp and Janine Haines. Those people thought that standing charges bypassing the Parliament was somewhat abhorrent. After all, it was the Democrats who came here with that great slogan that swept across Australia and gave that Party some credibility-`we are here to keep the bastards honest'. Nowadays, the Democrats are here as the lap-dogs of the Australian Labor Party. For years and years the Labor Party has been trying to introduce Bills to impose standing charges. That is the purpose. The Democrats are now doing the work for the Government; they are no longer an independent, vibrant force looking at the rule of Parliament, upholding the sovereignty of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night I mentioned that two Democrat members, Senator Janet Powell and Senator Coulter, have in the past abhorred that practice. To their credit, they are not in the chamber listening to this debate today. No doubt they are squirming; no doubt they feel somewhat embarrassed by the predicament in which Senator Spindler has put them. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it quite outrageous that the Democrats say that this is the acceptable level of the past. Are they so divorced from the problems of the Australian community nowadays that they cannot see that this economy is in recession? Yet, henceforth they will put a standing figure of 10 per cent on all provisional taxpayers. Are they not aware that business profits are declining and that small businesses are going to the wall and becoming bankrupt?</PARA>
<PARA> True, they say, we can go back and apply for a variation of provisional tax. Dear oh me, have they not heard about the problems of taxpayers' rights, the problems of incontestability, the problems of retrospectivity and the problems of reverse onus of proof? They are not worried about these issues any longer; they are just going along as the lap-dogs of this Labor Party. They should be ashamed of themselves. I make an apology to the new members of the Australian Democrats. They are new; they are not aware of the consequences that they are being led into. Perhaps, with the passing of time, they may change next year. I can assure honourable senators that the coalition will be ever vigilant to ensure that these matters are not enshrined either in regulation or put in the form of standing charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler even had the temerity to say that parliamentary scrutiny is a waste of time. Is that not an absolute disgrace? We have heard comments about the irrelevance of Parliament and parliamentarians. Yet the people who are supposed to be the watchdogs and keep people honest are not prepared to be the watchdogs any longer. They believe that this parliamentary process is a waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will certainly be voting against this Bill. We deplore the fact that the Democrats voted against our amendment last night. </PARA>

I did not think that I would ever listen to a debate encouraging the bypassing of parliament, especially from Senator Spindler, who should have learnt many things in his time in Australia that he may not have known before. He is probably used to places where parliament is bypassed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government wants to bypass parliament because it has egg on its face from last year. It decided on an uplift of about 10 per cent or 11 per cent-it may have even been 12 per cent-but, unfortunately, in its haste to run out to the electorate and get itself elected in the few weeks that the figures were looking somewhere near right, it forgot to put it through parliament. So it was not able to enforce that uplift last year. It is as simple as that. </PARA>

If this Bill is passed we will have a fixed uplift every year until Parliament changes it again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that, and I am coming to that. I am glad that Senator Spindler interjected. There will be an uplift whether the business has gone backwards or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Spindler comes in with the great argument-and this privilege has been around for 30 years that I know of personally-that one can ask for a provisional tax variation. One can do that; but what he does not tell us, and what the Government does not spell out either, is the penalty if one miscalculates. </PARA>
<PARA> I saw Government members and Senator Faulkner smirk last night in here when this very argument was canvassed, I think, by Senator Short. Senator Faulkner had a smirk across his face because of penalties which may apply if the calculations are incorrect. I suppose that Senator Faulkner was smirking because he was thinking that the taxpayer should be able to forecast the likely income pretty accurately. The taxpayer can do all the calculations he likes-and provisional tax has to be calculated, if one wants to get a variation, by the end of March of every year-and do accurate figures up to date of provisional tax pay date, but his calculations can be thrown out by one event. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the Democrats, not being very well represented in the remote areas, would not know this, but I can give an example. Most income can be controlled-one can control wool sales and income from other sources-but the Australian Wheat Board could make a payment to growers that has not been announced in March. That has happened-it has come in with a payment on 28 June, throwing the calculations out of kilter, but that is no defence against penalties for understating or miscalculating provisional tax. The Democrats never considered that one. Because of what I heard last night, I am glad that Senator Spindler made that interjection. </PARA>

<PARA> I do not criticise the fact that union organisers-which a lot of my colleagues in the chamber are-academics, teachers or public servants, all of whom are in very honourable professions, do not pay provisional tax if they get a regular wage. They get their wages whether the economy is good, bad or indifferent. Their wages do not have to rise and fall with the economy of the day, and their income does not depend on how much they produce for Australia. Those of us who do make produce for Australia, and who do, in fact, contribute to Australia's overall wealth, are those running their own businesses-small business men-who have to pay provisional tax. It is those people whom this sort of legislation affects. I just wonder how many of the Democrats have ever paid provisional tax, and how many of them-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume. It is okay, I suppose, when things are rosy, but not when things are difficult. If this rate is set at 10 per cent and it is not under the scrutiny of Parliament every year, we will find that small business men have this extra charge every year automatically. The taxation uplift should be related to the state of the economy at the time, and a real estimate of what the income is likely to be in the next year for small business men. I challenge anyone to suggest to me that next year small business men will be getting 10 per cent more in their taxable income than they are getting this year. If this year they get the same as they got last year, it will be a remarkable event, with the way the economy is at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is outrageous for the Democrats to want to enshrine this in legislation. I can understand members of the Australian Labor Party doing it, because I suspect that none of them have ever been in a position where they have had to pay provisional tax themselves. But it is amazing and incredible that the Democrats should be supporting this legislation, taking the rate away from the scrutiny of Parliament, at a time when the real incomes of those working in small businesses are falling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; First of all, I would like to assure Senator Macdonald that certainly I, having been in small business for 20 to 25 years, have paid provisional tax on a regular basis. I have not found it beyond my faculties to ask for a variation when that was necessary. There seems to be a clear implication that people cannot manage their own financial affairs. The provisional tax is a tax like any other tax, and why should it not be certain for business planning so that one knows, well in advance, what one is likely to pay? Why should one not have to make one's own decisions and arrangements to vary it, if circumstances require it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to put clearly on the record what this debate on clause 7 is all about. The Government's Bill provides in clause 7 that the:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`provisional tax uplift factor', in relation to a year of income, means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the percentage, not exceeding 12%, that is declared by the regulations to be the provisional tax uplift factor for the year of income; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) if there is no such declaration-10%;</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is in the Bill now. The coalition, for reasons that have been very eloquently and articulately described by Senator Watson and others last night, some of which have been repeated today, objects violently to that proposition because, as I will come to in a moment, it takes away the basic right of this Parliament to be required automatically to give a decision on a tax rate from one year to another. That is why last night Senator Watson moved on behalf of the Opposition that, instead of the definition of `provisional tax uplift factor' that is now in the Bill, we insert the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA>`provisional tax uplift factor', in relation to a year of income, means the percentage (if any) declared by an Act other than this Act to be the provisional tax uplift factor for the year of income;</PARA>
<PARA>That amendment was clearly designed, and would have done if accepted, to require the government of the day-this is not a matter of party politics; it is the government of the day whether it is a Labor government or a coalition government-honestly and openly to say to the Parliament, `We are proposing to strike a rate of provisional tax uplift', following which it would be a matter for the Parliament to decide, openly and in the full gaze of parliamentary and public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> That amendment of the Opposition was defeated last night by the Australian Democrats supporting the Government, for reasons I will come to in a moment. We are now debating a Democrats' amendment which is basically along the same lines of principle as the Government's provision. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>`provisional tax uplift factor', in relation to a year of income, means, until the Parliament otherwise provides, 10%. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it locks us into a figure of 10 per cent unless something or other is done by the government of the day to suggest another change. Far from what Senator Spindler was saying in his remarks just a moment ago, the Democrats with that amendment are putting absolutely into the Government's hands-not the Parliament's-the decision as to whether there shall or shall not be a variation of that rate of tax. That has exactly the same effect in principle as what the Government has proposed; namely, it takes away from the Parliament the automatic right and requirement each year to take a decision on the tax uplift factor. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be clear; that is what this debate is all about. The Government's proposal takes away from this Parliament the  automatic requirement each year to take a decision on a very important rate of tax. The Democrats' amendment is no more than a variation on that. It does not vary the principle at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I object to that very strongly for two reasons. The first reason I object to it so violently is that the Bill as it stands, or with the Democrats' amendment, denies the automatic right of elected members of Parliament to do their job; that is, to look at perhaps the most important matter that parliamentarians are required to look at-the rate that is struck for the taxpayers in this country to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned in this case, in the area of the provisional tax uplift, because it is an extraordinarily difficult job-an almost impossible job-for provisional taxpayers to calculate accurately what their income situation will be 12 months in advance. Over the life of this Government increasingly stiff penalties have been put into the Income Tax  Assessment Act for failure to calculate provisional tax correctly. Those penalties basically apply regardless of whether the taxpayer has consciously or with the best will in the world tried to calculate his provisional tax correctly. The fact that the penalties have gone up to such an extent-I am not necessarily complaining about that-adds great weight to the requirement that the Parliament ought to be looking at the uplift factor each year as of automatic right. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Watson has said, the Democrats when they were first formed set themselves up as the custodians of the moralities of the taxpayers and the electors of Australia. I had never heard such hypocritical nonsense in my whole life, and the whole record of the Democrats has confirmed that it was hypocritical nonsense. Less than three years ago, on 4 November 1987, when a virtually identical provision was being debated in the Senate in the old building, the Leader of the Australian Democrats at that time, former Senator Haines, said-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is, except that the Opposition's proposal last night was defeated by the Government with Democrats support. Now we are looking at an amendment proposed to the same clause by the Democrats. The Democrats are purporting that this is based on some great difference in principle from what the Government's Bill is about, and that is absolute nonsense. Senator Haines, the former Leader of the Democrats, said in an identical debate to this one on 4 November 1987:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>One of the arguments that we are making here is that to give this sort of legislation and, for that matter, the next Bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, standing status instead of annual status is, in fact, to deprive this Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA>she was referring to the Government's proposal at the time-</PARA>
<PARA>of the opportunity of challenging the Government from time to time on a range of taxation, Medicare and other related economic matters, and prevent it from doing it on an annual basis, restricting its opportunities to those years in which the Government is going to make some change to the rates and needs to amend the Income Tax Act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say in the next paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is a matter of the rights that honourable senators have to raise issues of importance to all of us and to the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the important point of principle in this Bill. I could not say it better myself than Senator Haines said it less than three years ago. I think I am right in saying that the vote that was taken on that amendment three years ago showed that the Democrats then supported the coalition's view on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Now what the Democrats have done between then and now, for reasons that absolutely escape me, is a 180 degree turn from that very correct expression of principle that was outlined on 4 November 1987. I find that extraordinary and inexplicable. I must say, without being too much of a critic of the Democrats, that it is absolutely in line with their whole approach to this Parliament. They will blow hot one day on one issue and the next day they will be 180 degrees different. The impossibility of the Democrats as a party seemingly being able to pursue a consistent line of principle in this Parliament is doing this country a great deal of harm, which is enshrined in this amendment that they are proposing. I join Senator Watson and other members of the coalition in rejecting the amendment outright. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I wish to take the opportunity of this debate to refute some outrageous statements made by Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats (ADs). I believe that the actions that the Australian Democrats have taken both this morning and last night will have done more to destroy their credibility and their status in the Australian community than any other position that they have taken since their elected representatives have come to this Senate. It is a day of intense shame for the Australian Democrats. It is a disgrace for the Australian Democrats to assert that they have now acquired a degree of confidence or perhaps rapport with the Australian Labor Party, that they can put up these sorts of statements, and that they can lead the ALP into certain areas. It indicates an impression that a lot of us have had for a long time, that they are an appendage of the left wing of the ALP in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They have lost their right of being an independent. They have lost their right and credibility of being a watchdog of the people. They have lost their credibility of upholding the sovereignty of Parliament. They have lost their credibility of being concerned about this fundamental principle-the need for the rule of law to prevail. We have lost that, because as Senator Haines and others in the Democrats have said, not on one occasion but constantly year by year, `This gives us the opportunity'-they are the operative words-`to examine on an annual basis'. </PARA>
<PARA> They are denying themselves that opportunity to say that they have acquired a new found confidence to be able to bring in and have passed legislation or amendments. This indicates that all they are doing nowadays is siding with the ALP. I do not mind that, so long as they uphold the rule of law. I have a great respect for a lot of people on the ALP side. The former Senator Georges, a great parliamentarian, was always concerned about upholding the rule of law. As soon as we lose sight of that essential principle we might as well not belong to this place, because we are not truly representing democrats. We are not truly representing the people of Australia. We are obfuscating our real responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it strange that perhaps the natural constituency that the Australian Democrats look to is small businesses which will be significantly affected by what has been suggested today. Because there should be, according to Senator Spindler, a degree of confidence in their ability to manage their affairs. What this really does is put an additional cost on small business, because if the Democrats are going to have this uplift factor fixed at an unrealistic rate, too high-and we are in recessionary conditions-then business people are going to have to go off to their tax accountant, and they are going to have to apply for a variation in relation to their provisional tax. Most of these business people are unlike Senator Spindler. He was a good businessman. He was lucky. He must have had pretty constant profits from year to year not to have a problem with provisional tax and so it was not a problem to him. </PARA>
<PARA> But most small businesses are going to have to race along to their tax accountants, and fill in a variation for provisional tax. That is going to cost them money because advice does not come cheaply. This action is during a period when business people should be spending their time on getting extra revenue. But they will need to spend their time meeting their obligations to these income tax proposals. They are spending extra time as a result of something that has been imposed on them by the Australian Democrats. Shame on the ADs. Let small business be told. The Democrats will not be writing out to small business mentioning their stand on this issue. </PARA>

That is the essential point. It has been an issue that has been sacrosanct, so far as the Don Chipps and the Janine Haines are concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is only one thing that the Senate can ask of the Democrats in this situation, and that is to explain why what was right and proper and supportable and, indeed, supported in 1987 has somehow magically become wrong and insupportable in 1990. If there are no reasons, one can make one's own judgments about what has prompted this change of heart. Perhaps there is some other deal that we are unaware of that the Democrats have made with the Government in respect of some other matter, which happens so often in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One continually wonders, in the absence of any coherent, rational explanation, what is the reason. If there is a reason, it would be kind of the Democrats to give it to us. If the Democrats can reject, destroy, deny the power and strength of Senator Haines's comments on this matter three years ago, let them do so. Otherwise, we see the situation where I suppose the Vicar of Bray is the appropriate person to refer to here. The Democrats have done what in that song was described as `a cat in the pan once more', although they have not become Whigs in this context. They have lurched even further to the left as part of a desperate attempt to find some kind of political base, as the Australian Labor Party has lurched further to the right. If the Democrats have a coherent case to argue against ex-Senator Janine Haines's position, I would be very grateful to hear it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to return to the provisional tax provisions and the Government rather than the skirmish between the Opposition and the Democrats. The Democrats have shown today that they have no sense of reasoning whatsoever. Provisional tax, even the Government must admit, is a taxing of the future- not necessarily 12 months of the future but at least 3 months of the future. Provisional tax used to be payable by 31 March and now it is payable quarterly for companies paying more than a certain amount and once a year for partnerships. So it is definitely three months into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this provision has been extended by the Government in other ways in superannuation. When this Government came to power in 1983, superannuation was taxed at the end. When one received one's superannuation, a certain amount of tax was payable and then that was turned around and things were taxed along the way. Now we have taxation of the future also with public companies. The bigger public companies have an option of either paying income tax by 28 July with the balance in March or they have the option for the present moment of paying it all in August. It is an ongoing method by this Government to continually tax the future. The Government has taxed Australia out of its brains for the present and now it is taxing the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Government has been helped by the Democrats. One may vary provisional tax if one's business has not been doing so well. I have covered that point before, and the penalties which surround it. Senator Watson made a remark that, to vary provisional tax and to be as accurate as the Australian Taxation Office and the Government want, one has to do a full set of accounts. There are no two ways about it, one has to do a full set from 1 July to the middle of March, when one generally does it. Then, of course, one has to project to 30 June. One is doing a full set of accounts, even though one is not putting in a set of returns. Of course, everyone knows these days how much accounting fees cost. Even Senator McMullan, as I mentioned the other day in the Parliament, said on national media last week that Australia pays 12 times more than our trading partners in accounting fees. </PARA>

But he has said that it costs so much and now, if a variation is required, there must be a full set of accounts, and that costs. That is something that the Democrats should think about before the Democrats let the Government, with an open hand, charge a maximum uplift without coming back to parliament. If the Government has 12 per cent, it will charge 12 per cent. If it is reviewed by the Parliament every year, there may be some sense in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to disagree slightly with my colleague, Senator Michael Baume, who said that he wanted the Democrats to answer one question. I briefly want to ask the Democrats to answer three questions, then I will sit down and take no further part in the debate. The questions that I want the Democrats to answer, and answer very specifically, are: why the change in heart, why the change in voting, in what was right two or three years ago under Senator Haines? Why is that now wrong? If it was consistently right then, why is it wrong now?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot accept as credible the answer that has been given that suddenly the Australian Democrats have found a new ring of confidence and are going to display this confidence by getting up and moving an amendment to a Bill. If that is the answer, firstly, I cannot understand it and, secondly, I find it absolutely incredible. I ask the Democrats to answer the first question: Why the change; why is the situation different?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I ask: What has the Government offered the Democrats to make them change their mind? As I see it, that can be the only reason they have done so. I know they went with the Government over the election of the Deputy President. I thought that would have given them plenty of brownie points for the rest of this term, but they must have a few others to pay back. I want to know what the pay-back is all about. Let the Democrats tell the people of Australia what they are getting for their support of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Possibly the ALP is going to make the Democrats its official fourth faction of the ALP. That may be what the Democrats are looking for. Maybe that is the deal the ALP has done with them so that next time they can run for the election as the fourth faction of the ALP, because they support the ALP on all the real issues. All the funny little things that they move, when we end up voting with them or they vote with us, is pure theatre-pure theatre on technicalities in this place. But on the real issues that we debate, such as the rights of the small businessman and people's attempts to make this country work again by producing things-by getting out there, working and risking their own lives, money and health to try to get this country going-they always side with the other three factions of their Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question I would like an answer to is this: Where are those couple of Democrats who are still left from the days when they used to vote the other way? Why are they not sitting in here so they can tell us why they have changed their mind? You four say, quite rightly, that you were not here then. </PARA>

I simply wanted to put it on the record, and I do so again, that the Opposition has voted with the Government on a very critical amendment to tax legislation which went through the House yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to state-Senator Macdonald having raised a question to which only I could supply the answer, at least for myself, which was: Where were the three senators who voted one way several years ago and who are still senators? -that I for one was on my way to a Minister's office; Senator Coulter, who has portfolio responsibilities in five other areas, is in conference in his office; and Senator McLean is somewhere in Europe. That is the answer to the first question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I would like to make concerns Senator Spindler's comment last night that in the intervening three years we, as a responsible party in this place, have done what all other parties in this place do from time to time-if they are doing their work correctly-and that is to review legislation, even to review our own position. Everybody has a chance to do that. We have done this over a period of three years. I could ask the Opposition, in turn, where the amendments are that it moved to this legislation in the House of Representatives-arrangements that I know Senator Watson for one was not very keen on. The Opposition has changed its mind even since these Bills were in the House of Representatives. Why has it changed its mind on important amendments in just a few days-amendments that were important enough to hold up these Bills in the House of Representatives? It has changed its mind virtually overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point to an example of a situation-I will give only one-where less than two years ago the coalition voted against its own amendment to the privacy legislation. That is probably enough said about the relevant behaviour of the various parties in this place. We all make different decisions at different times for different reasons. In this case we have considered the position. As Senator Spindler has said, there is ample tax legislation coming before this place, the situation can stand as far as we are concerned, and the Bills regarding the rates of tax are the ones that should and will come before this chamber. So to that extent, all the questions that Senator Macdonald asked are irrelevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Powell) has attempted to portray to this chamber that in substance there is any difference in thrust between the amendments moved in the House of Representatives and those in this chamber. They achieve the same ends, the same purpose. What we sought to do in this place was provide, in a few lines, a simple amendment that encompassed all the objectives of the House of Representatives. We have achieved that very admirably. I am surprised at the Australian Democrats' lack of interest in not seeing they were of the same intent. They were not able to discern this. I am disgusted that they have attempted, quite dishonestly, to distort our point of view. The amendment is essentially the same as that in the House of Representatives; it achieves the same purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Haines had style, status and principle, but she would not allow an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny to slip by. Under Senator Powell's leadership, the Democrats are now losing that opportunity. It is an opportunity that they might never be able to retrieve; they are letting opportunities slip away. The Australian Democrats say that they have a new-found confidence. I am afraid that we do not share that confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that Senator Powell is one of those people who have changed their votes, and changed their principles. As Leader, she is changing the direction under which the Party was founded and was led, which gave it some distinction in the eyes of a quite significant number of people.

I thank him because it demonstrates, as does this debate, a dramatic change in the nature, structure and objectives of the Australian Democrats.

If the Australian Democrats recall correctly, last session they defeated one of our amendments, an anti-avoidance amendment affecting losses. You refused to agree with it.

I am not minimising the significance of that and I will refer to it in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax rates are the matters that fundamentally determine the obligations of the taxpayers. They are determined by the Parliament. They are open to variation by the Parliament. To my chagrin, the Democrats will try to change one of them this morning. I intend strenuously to oppose their attempt. Although, not in so many words, the legislation sets the rate `until the Parliament determines', the Democrats are exercising their parliamentary prerogative to try to change it which I am confident they will fail to do. But it does not take away the Democrats right to scrutinise it, to raise it, to review it, to debate it. Let us get that part of the debate into perspective. It is a wildly overstated proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> A related question concerns the Bill, although not the Opposition amendment. It deals with the use of regulations in the setting of obligations for taxpayers. Quite clearly, that is not a matter that ought to be taken lightly. I will come back to that in a moment. The Government sought, and would prefer, the power to be able to do that. I understand that honourable senators have raised concerns about that. </PARA>
<PARA> In this instance I do not want to minimise the fact that using regulations to change the provisional tax uplift factor has implications for individual taxpayers. It affects how much of their tax obligation they have to pay at a particular time. It does not affect their ultimate obligation as taxpayers to pay tax on their income as finally determined and in accordance with the rates as set. I do not dispute that it affects them because it affects the time at which taxpayers have to pay and how much they have to pay at that time. It has revenue implications for the Government. The corollary of that is that it has expenditure implications for taxpayers. I accept that. It is not a matter that is to be taken lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> Principally, the Government was seeking-and had I been able to get agreement in discussion I would have moved a Government amendment-to have the capacity by regulation to be able to reduce that level; that is, for the Parliament to set the cap so that we could not, by regulation, without parliamentary approval increase the level of the obligation but we could, by regulation, reduce it. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent some time as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I found it a valuable and educational experience. As a result of being on that Committee, one of the attitudes I developed-which I think is shared by many people in the Parliament-was a concern about proper use of regulation as against legislation. Where the regulation is being used to the benefit of the citizen or the taxpayer, rather than to their detriment, we have a fundamentally different situation. There, the capacity of the Parliament subsequently to disallow can be effective, were a policy question involved, because it gives the Parliament the effective scrutiny that is required. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that any moves in the taxation area by regulation ought to be taken carefully. In this instance what the Government proposed was the preferable course of action. By definition it is the one that the Government would have preferred. We would however prefer the Democrats amendment to that which was previously proposed by Senator Watson, and against which we voted last night. </PARA>
<PARA> In agreeing to that amendment, I reiterate that it is not our preferred position but it resolves one of the two problems with which we are trying to deal. One is the impasse into which we were thrust last year, not as Senator Panizza said, by the failure of the Government to introduce the Bill-it was introduced-but by the failure of the Senate to pass the Bill. That would have had the result of having the uplift factor properly introduced and legislated for that financial year. That was a problem which caused significant inconvenience to the Government, of course, but to many taxpayers as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We often hear passionate expositions in this place about the need for certainty in tax. It is a bit of a mirage. We will never achieve absolute certainty. The most uncertain situation was generated last year by the failure of the Senate to pass that legislation and there being no underpinning situation so that there was a continuing uplift factor when the Parliament failed so to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> That was one of the two things we were trying to resolve. The Democrats' amendment will deal with that. If the Parliament fails subsequently to resolve, we will have an ongoing uplift factor. It does not give us the flexibility to reduce that in response to economic circumstances should the need arise without legislation. That would have been an appropriate flexibility and was properly protected. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the options before us are the Democrats amendment or an uncertain and time-consuming process by which this Bill goes back to the House of Representatives-the Government has to decide whether it will accept the amendment or whether the legislation comes back to the chamber for further debate and we will have to put up with this committee stage debate again; and that, I think, would give rise to another revolution from my colleagues-the Government has decided that, in the interests of passing legislation that will achieve its primary purpose but not all of its purposes and which will not be in a preferred form but in a workable form, it will accept the amendment moved by Senator Spindler. </PARA>

<PARA>The provisions in the schedule, to which my amendments refer, represent the Government's proposal to reduce the medical expenses rebate from 29 per cent to 25 per cent this year, falling to 21 per cent in 1991 and 1992. It is a cost cutting measure which will eventually yield $50m in the final year. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is rather fortuitous that the amendments I am moving, which would remove these reductions in rebates, are coming up after the previous debate. It is now a good opportunity for members of the Opposition to show their concern for taxpayers in this country, particularly for the sick and the chronically sick who have large medical expenses. No doubt, having expressed their concern to the Australian community and, in particular, for Australian taxpayers, they will support my amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the rebate is a safety net for those who may have the misfortune to incur extraordinary medical expenses. This is precisely where the Government should assist and not penny-pinch. In effect, this is a social justice issue. I call on the Government and the Opposition to support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the Government will not be supporting the amendments either. We share the view of Senator Watson that it is not an appropriate course of action for the Senate arbitrarily to pick the eyes out of revenue measures. I will not reiterate that point, which has been made many times in this place. But I essentially share Senator Watson's view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to respond to the so-called social justice implications of the amendments. I think Senator Spindler actually misunderstands. There is a false sense of equity in this because the beneficiaries of this rebate are not the people for whom Senator Spindler is expressing concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of taxpayers claiming the medical expenses rebate goes up as income goes up. This is not surprising, when one thinks about it. Fewer than one per cent of taxpayers earning below $20,000 a year claim this rebate. Of taxpayers over $50,000 a year, approximately 4 per cent-3.99 per cent-claim this rebate. When one thinks about it, it is perfectly logical that this should be so. </PARA>
<PARA> A false sense of equity is driving the Australian Democrats' amendments. The Democrats will not be serving the purpose which I expect they are setting out to achieve if they call them social justice amendments. The redistributive consequences of the amendments will be regressive, not progressive. When one thinks about it, that is not surprising. Low income people are, in the main, protected from a certain level of cost by Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> Hospital patients under private care are principally the ones who generate this level of costs over and above the rebates. They are, therefore, required to claim this rebate which, appropriately, ought to be there for them. I am not disputing their right to the rebate; I am simply saying that increasing the rate of the rebate, reducing the amount that they have to pay and, therefore, reducing the government revenue available for other purposes is in fact not a social justice initiative at all in its redistributive impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing to remember is that the value of any rebate, and of this one, is affected by two things-the rate of the rebate and the threshold of the rebate. Although the rate of the rebate will be reduced by this amendment because, over the years the $1,000 threshold has not varied, with inflation the real value of the $1,000 is declining. So more and more people are coming within the threshold limits and are, therefore, getting access to the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be possible for the Government to index the threshold. If it did so, the argument about the rate would be different. But I think such a step is messy and would have no particular merit. The figure of $1,000 was not established originally on some such scientific basis that it ought to be continually indexed. It was a convenient figure. The fact that it is stable compensates to some extent for the value of the rebate declining. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take any more time on this point, except to say that I think the level of the rebate is appropriately set. It is locked into the lowest tax rate-the 21 per cent rate-as it should be. This is the rate at which about half of taxpayers pay tax on their marginal dollar. I think that is also probably the appropriate rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Principally I want to say that there is a false sense of equity and an illusion of social justice in the amendments. The outcome will actually be otherwise. Therefore, the Government will not be supporting the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two things to be said about what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) has just told us. First, there are a number of medical expenses, such as dental expenses, that are not covered by Medicare. Therefore, people on low incomes who would normally have their needs attended to through the Medicare system are very much at a disadvantage if they are hit by illnesses of that kind. Clearly, the Minister is prepared to ignore them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Australian Democrats take the view that if people are chronically ill, whether they are on low incomes, middle incomes or upper-middle incomes is a secondary consideration. I must express, again, my disappointment that members of the Opposition are not prepared to fight for those people whom only half an hour ago they claimed that they were acting for and concerned about. If that is not a change of mind, I do not know what is. This is just another example of how agile their thinking can be. </PARA>
<PARA> A further example is legislation which came before the House last year concerning the early remittance of pay as you earn tax by high taxpayers. The Democrats and the Opposition combined to amend the legislation to exclude public hospitals, universities and public benevolent institutions. Yet, when it came to the point, the Opposition changed its mind and allowed that legislation which would hit those institutions to pass. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Opposition has demonstrated a number of inconsistencies in respect of the position that it takes. During the last couple of hours the Opposition has tried to attack us-ineffectually, I am happy to say-and in so doing has wasted the time of the Committee. I express my disappointment again that the Opposition is not prepared to help those people whom it professes to be concerned about. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to introduce a new marginal rate of 60 per cent for that part of incomes that exceeds $100,000. I wonder whether this time the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) will not quibble about this being a social justice amendment. In our society capacity to pay should be taken into account. The tax rate has been depressed to such an extent that our public utilities are starved of funds and our public services cannot look after the most disadvantaged members of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised that the Government will not support this amendment. I have also been advised that the Opposition will not support it-and not surprisingly, given that Senator Watson has stated that he feels the Government should be allowed to do as it wishes and that the Senate should not interfere with what the Government is doing on taxation Bills that are part of its general thrust. Senator Watson acknowledges that it is the Government's general thrust to look after high income earners. Certainly, the evidence is there by virtue of the fact that the tax rates have been reduced from the progressive state to the current state. This amendment makes the tax scale progressive where it can afford to be progressive. Yet both of the old parties choose to ignore the social justice implications of this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning we have wasted an inordinate amount of time at the Opposition's instigation. As a result, I will not call a division on this amendment but allow it to be rejected on the voices, since I know that the voices will be equally strong from both of the old parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say right here and now that we in the National Party of Australia do not support-as no thinking member of this Senate could have even the slightest intention of supporting-this absurd amendment. Senator Spindler says that he moved this amendment on the basis of a social justice concept-the social justice that comes from the Australian Democrats, who say, `We need to find somebody to pay for all the excessive spending that we would like to do. So let us take it by increasing the marginal rate of tax from 47 per cent to 60 per cent'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday we heard Senator Coulter talking about his grand vision for the future of this country, yet if Senator Coulter was fair dinkum in his comments yesterday about a grand vision for the future of the country he would have to accept the fact that the high rate of tax that we are currently suffering is squeezing the life out of this country. It is taking away incentive. It is reducing the reasons for people wanting to go out and earn an extra dollar, an extra $100, $10,000 or whatever, to provide for their families. He has absolutely no conception of what high interest rates and high taxes do to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Right now we are talking about this group of Australian Democrats wanting to further squeeze incentive out of Australians who are working very hard for their families and for the future of this country. All we hear from Senator Coulter is the bleating that these people are rich and they can afford it. Unfortunately, somebody has to earn some money in this country. Somebody has got to produce. Somebody has got to provide the prosperity and the economic base for this country. It certainly is not Senator Coulter, nor is it any of his bleating friends over there, because all they have managed to do is hold up the proceedings of the chamber all morning on absurd amendments. Now we come to an amendment that is so absurd that, frankly, if I was an Australian Democrat I would be embarrassed to be in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot has been bleating all morning about her trip to Roma. I think being amongst the sheep must have rubbed off on her. I would be surprised if Senator Kernot had the guts to send to the people of Roma the Hansard of today's debate on this particular Bill, or if she had the guts to go out there next weekend and say, `Look, I voted for a higher tax regime in the Senate this week. Aren't I a great person?' Senator Kernot would be torn apart not just by woolgrowers in Roma or wheat growers in Dalby but by the people on the Gold Coast where she is so busy trying to curry votes at every possible opportunity, twisting somersaults, running round and round in circles and jumping on any band wagon she can. Now she jumps, unfortunately for her, on Senator Spindler's social justice band wagon which is a throw back to the bad old days of socialism in the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> To show how left wing and how out of touch with the real world Senator Spindler is, not even the party of the Left-not even the Australian Labor Party-would be fool enough to support this absurd amendment. The Labor Party has already indicated to Senator Spindler that it does not support what he intends to do. Even the left wing party in Australian politics is not left wing enough for Senator Spindler. This is the truth. In Senator Spindler we find the old-fashioned communist, the old-fashioned socialist, who says, `Let us just increase the taxes-let us just push up the taxes-because we are jealous.'</PARA>
<PARA> The argument that underlies everything that the Democrats are saying is one of jealousy. They cannot make the money so they want to take it off somebody who works that little bit extra hard and has the initiative to make it. Ultimately, what will happen, if anybody is stupid enough to support this amendment, is that we would stifle the incentive that drives this economy and, ultimately, we would reduce this country to a lower standard of living. I said this yesterday of Senator Coulter and his absurd idea that, somehow, we need to have an optimal size for the economy and everything beyond that is unnecessary so that as the population grows we would all suffer a lower standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen over and over again the falsity of the arguments that the Democrats have put. Today we have seen the rub of their high spending policies and, finally, they have recognised that if they want to give money out willy nilly, they have to get it from somebody. The point is that if we start at $100,000 what is to stop Senator Spindler coming in next week, or the week after, and saying, `Look, we think $100,000 is a bit high, let us take it down to $80,000 or $60,000'. The next thing we would know is that we would all be paying 60 per cent tax. That is why we in the coalition absolutely reject Senator Spindler's amendments, and that is why I believe every thinking Australian would do so as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I listened very carefully to the wording used by Senator Spindler for this particular amendment. Given the limited powers of this chamber in relation to taxation-particularly for the raising of taxes-I put it to you: Has this been put in the correct form to meet the requirements of the Australian Constitution? If you will give me the nod I will then continue. I think, perhaps, it exceeds constitutional propriety in the way and in the wording that it has been put. It is certainly not in the nature of the request, according to the words, that was put before the chamber this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal and National coalition parties in this Senate will not be supporting the Australian Democrats on this proposal for a number of reasons. It lifts the maximum tax rate by 13 percentage points to 60 per cent. We have heard of bracket creep; for more and more Australians-particularly average wage earners-the marginal tax rate is already 40 per cent. The Liberal-National Party coalition, therefore, rejects an increase in the maximum tax rate from 47 per cent to 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a clear policy that taxes must come down. Firstly, a Liberal-National Party coalition has undertaken to reduce the total tax collected by government. We have also undertaken to reduce the personal tax payable by individuals. With that sort of policy, with that sort of direction, with that mandate, we could not support this proposal. Mr Chairman, I seek your consideration on the matter of constitutionality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to make a small contribution in support of this amendment before the chamber. I recall, for instance, that in 1986 when these marginal tax rates, formerly at this level, were reduced, in the same Budget session and, indeed, the same week, both parties-Government and Opposition-also delayed consumer price index increases to aged pensioners and other measures which adversely affected people at the lower end of the income scale at the same time as the top marginal tax rates were being lowered. This amendment seeks to redress that inequity, an inequity which is being reflected increasingly in the wealth distribution in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have brought into the chamber with me the Australian Society magazine of July this year in which there is a substantial article addressing the problem of wealth distribution in this country. According to a graph appearing in this magazine, the top one per cent of the population in this country owns 19.7 per cent of our wealth; the top 10 per cent, 55.2 per cent; and the top 50 per cent, 98.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> A redistributive measure of the sort that this amendment proposes is certainly one of the measures which must be introduced to stop this inexorable increase in inequity in our society and the inevitable social consequences that are flowing and will continue to flow from that. I also take this opportunity to exhort the chamber to support the moves that the Democrats are making, in support, I might say, of Labor Party members in the other place, to have a full inquiry into the whole question of work distribution in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I say that in addressing a measure such as this amendment, which proposes to put the top marginal tax rate for the wealthiest in this country at 60 per cent, we should ask the question: what is taxation after all? It is surely an opportunity for all of us to make our contribution towards the sort of society in which we want to live. I think our opinions of the sort of society we want will be judged by our contributions in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that we should encourage the view in this community that taxation is something to be avoided and minimised at all costs. It ought to be considered an opportunity for those of us who are in a position to make a contribution to our society to make that contribution. That is certainly the way that I view it, and I think it is regrettable that the `them and us' approach-`Tax goes to government and therefore it is going away from me'-is the wrong approach. It ought to be, `This is my contribution, through the Government, to the kind of society that I want'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not always agree, of course, with what government does, and obviously we play a role in here in trying to make our impact on what government does do. Nevertheless, I think the principle of paying taxation and making a contribution in the best and most equitable way we can as individuals ought to be underneath our consideration of an amendment such as this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they do. They pull this one every broadcast day. But to me this is just a jealousy amendment moved against those who do something to produce in this country. Anyone who earns that amount or nets that amount in Australia has certainly paid enough tax already. Not only have such people paid their personal income tax but they have paid a lot of secondary tax along the road as well. So they certainly have paid. The Australian Democrats talk about social justice. Let us get on to some justice. Where in this amendment is there any justice for the people in Australia that risk capital? To earn $100,000-unless you happen to be a Minister, for instance, or something like that, and even being a Minister takes a certain amount of effort- one has to get oneself into that place; one has to be worthy to be a Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Outside of that, whether one is in business or in a profession, one does a lot to get oneself into that position. Honourable senators cannot deny that. In business one has to risk a lot capital to get oneself into that position. So where is there any justice when honourable senators are trying to put this sort of top tax rate on?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government needs any extra income-and obviously this amendment by the Democrats is simply there to give the Government more revenue-above what they wanted to raise in the Budget, well the Government is doing pretty well anyhow. Thanks to the Gulf crisis it is doing pretty well. By this extra levy on fuel, the Government is raising $2m a day extra while the oil price stays at around $US35 a barrel. That is $167,500 for every United States dollar that is above $US23 a barrel. The Government is doing very well without the help of the Democrats. If more is needed than the Government forecast or budgeted for last August, then it can take that amount out of this extra revenue, instead of through the Democrats bringing in this jealousy amendment. It is simple. If the oil price were to go to $40 a barrel then the Government would be raking in, in windfall profits, in excess of $2.285m a day extra. Whatever the Democrats have got on their wish list, I am sure it could come out of that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not laugh at these figures. They are there on the public record. They show the extra that they are bringing in. Yet Senator Spindler comes in with an amendment like this and he has not given us one figure to back up his argument in order for us to even think about supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have got a great wish list. In the last Federal election Senator Walsh roughly costed what their wish list would be. It would have given the Government a $20 billion deficit if all of those things were put into action. This is nothing but a cheap political stunt on a broadcast day for the Democrats to pick up a few cheap votes around the country. It is certainly not going to work because, as we have been told already, the amendment is not going to be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats idea is to hit those who are high income earners. They have put themselves in that position. They are there to hit them. But it is taking away incentive. As Bernie Fraser of the Reserve Bank of Australia said yesterday, in order to get Australia moving properly we need lower overall tax rather than higher overall tax. That is where the coalition, in government, will certainly fix that problem with a goods and services tax. Then the situation will be more even and the incentive is not knocked off, which obviously the Democrats are trying to do. </PARA>

<PARA> Can I ask them why they happened to pick the figure `$50,000 but not exceeding $100,000'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I apologise for not speaking through the Chair. I am just trying to point out the absolute hypocrisy of the Democrats' arguments. They can blame someone in a category that they are never likely to get a vote out of, but they do not want to do anything that may in any way attack the constituency they are trying to appeal to-that is, the yuppie group that does not work for a living and that gets a regular income, which someone else pays, in that $50,000 to $100,000 group. They can all feel good about the Democrats' Green policies-that is, the Green policies that the Labor Party has given up-and about all sort of things, but they do not have to pay. They can make someone else pay. They can ask someone else to do it, but none of their lot-neither themselves nor their colleagues in this Senate-want to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in the Liberal Party of Australia are against high taxes and increases in taxation in any form. For any party to bring forward to this Parliament any sort of regulation or proposal suggesting that income tax rates should be increased is to us absolutely repugnant. We want to reduce interest rates all around by many different proposals, most of which were mentioned at the time of the last election. A majority of Australians showed that they also wanted this by supporting us with more than 50 per cent of the total vote. But the Democrats want to try to increase taxation, but not in any way that might affect them or the people they are appealing to. </PARA>

<PARA> But on the substantive issue raised by Senator Panizza-and I am rather sad that he has hurried out of the chamber rather than waiting for the substantive answer-the gain to revenue of that measure would be $600m. If Senator Panizza had bothered to read our alternative Budget, he would have seen that figure there. Now that he does know that it is $600m, maybe he will change his mind. Maybe he will change his mind if he knows that it could, for instance, provide $180m for public housing, $200m for public hospitals, 10,000 child-care places and shelter for the 40,000 homeless youths that, to the nation's shame, we still have in our midst. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my brief remarks on this amendment, I wanted to comment on precisely the social justice point that Senator Spindler gave as the reason for this amendment in the first place. Let me say at the outset that neither I, the Liberal Party of Australia, nor anyone on this side of the chamber gives any moral high ground whatsoever to Senator Spindler or the Australian Democrats when it comes to the question of social justice. In my book, social justice is about having a large enough cake for everyone in our society to be able to participate in the eating. There can be no true social justice in our country if there is no economic growth, development or rising living standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of the policies of the Democrats, since their inception, have resulted in the antithesis of economic growth, rising living standards and development. When they talk about social justice, they deny the whole thrust of what their policies in the end result in because their policies result in a lower amount of cake and lower living standards for every Australian. Therefore, the social justice that Senator Spindler speaks so fondly of cannot be achieved. If he were really serious about social justice in this country, he would have an economy which was dynamic, vibrant, growing and allowing living standards for all Australians to rise. What Senator Spindler is proposing in this amendment is contrary to that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enormous number of problems facing this country. We have the largest economic morass and the biggest danger of economic recession in this country since at least the 1930s. The reasons for that are numerous, but they include, very importantly, the burden that government has put on each and every Australian, particularly Australians who want to save, to invest and to get on with the job of productive investment and growth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Domestic savings are at rock bottom in this country. The fall in domestic savings is one of the major sources of our problems. As a result, investment is falling like a stone. We have soaring unemployment-we have just seen the start of that. We have falling output. Everything in this country is going the wrong way at the moment in terms of achieving the growth and development that are required. To say that putting a 60 per cent tax on incomes above $60,000 is going to suddenly compound that problem dramatically-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, it is $100,000. Of course, this is not going to make a difference between solving our problems or compounding them- I am not suggesting that- but it is a very important symbol of what we stand for and it would be the impression given to the community as to the necessary and desirable approach on policy in this country. I think it gives absolutely the wrong signal. It would have detrimental effects because the people in this country who are going to make the cake that provides the social justice which Senator Spindler so fondly talks about are the people in that category, along with a whole lot of other people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sum Senator Spindler mentioned is not a high salary, for a start. He said that $100,000 is something like six times the average weekly earnings. That is simply not true. The figure of $100,000 is about 3 1/2 times the average weekly earnings. Less than 20 years ago the maximum marginal tax rate in this country cut in at a figure of something like 15 to 18 times average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great problems we have had in this country and the reason why incentives are so rock bottom is that we have increased the burden of tax on each and every member of our community so much that we now have the higher bracket income earners in this country paying the maximum rate of tax which cuts in, at the moment, at 15 per cent higher than average weekly earnings. Twenty years ago it was 18 times higher than that. Again, the whole direction of what the Democrats are proposing in this amendment is contrary to providing, through the tax system, some of the incentives that are so desperately needed if we are to get this country out of the dreadful hole that it is in. </PARA>
<PARA> I join Senator Watson and my other colleagues, both from the National Party and the Liberal Party, in opposing this amendment. I think it gives absolutely the wrong signal. It is undesirable in that sense, as well as the practicality of what has been proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Powell said a bit earlier that it is good that we can debate these things. I think Senator Spindler was saying that we were perhaps wasting the time of the Senate. But I am sure that that is not the case because we really are getting to the quintessence of the essence of the difference between the collectivist redistributionist social `justice' policies of the Australian Democrats versus the very liberal approach of the coalition parties. My colleague Senator O'Chee slipped the word `communist' into the debate. There is a lot in common between the terms collectivist, redistributionist and communist. They all share the philosophy that bureaucrats and politicians can take money away from free men and free women and redistribute it to where they figure is the best place to send it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Powell has suggested that the fact that the top one per cent of income earners in Australia control 19.7 per cent of the wealth-and I would say that some of these figures might have gone a bit awry in the last few months-that the top 10 per cent control 55.2 per cent of wealth, and that the top 50 per cent control 98 per cent of wealth is something that is wrong. She has said that it requires an inquiry and that the situation should be changed by taxing people who earn, taxing people who put in effort, ripping off the reward for that effort and redistributing it. If that is not collectivist, if that is not redistributionist, and if that is not very close to communist, let the Democrats do some more explaining because that is what it is all about. There is not very much difference in the philosophies. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating a very significant difference in philosophy. Senator Spindler has suggested that he would raise $600m from this measure. I think it was Senator Panizza earlier who asked what the figure was and what the motivation for bringing in the amendment was. Of course, the motivation is to try to balance what has become known as the fairies at the bottom of the garden Budget. I must say that during the election the fairies might have been at the bottom of the garden, according to Senator Walsh. But it would seem it is not the Bogong moths that have come into the Senate chamber in the last few days, I think the fairies have come into the Senate. These sort of ideas are fanciful, they are crazy. Even the Labor Party, to its credit, over the last seven and a bit years in Government, has come to realise that ripping more and more money out of the productive side of society and redistributing it to the non-productive side is not the way to get this country on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Democrats: Can they honestly say that they could rip money out of people who earn and work for the good of this nation, and for their own personal good as well, take that money away and redirect it to all of the social areas that Senator Spindler has gone through-areas like Aboriginal welfare, single mothers pensions, nature conservation and so forth-and spend that money efficiently? That is the question. I think we are all coming to realise, especially those of us who have seen the welfare state in most of the free world being totally rejected as a way to achieve an efficient economy and, indeed, to achieve efficient delivery of welfare to people in real need, that that is what we really have to talk about. If we look at the money we spend on Aboriginal welfare, on single mothers pensions, on nature conservation, on health and on education we realise that most of the money goes to highly paid bureaucrats. The money does not get down to the people who need it. That is what we should be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative that the coalition proposes is to allow the spirit of charity, to allow individuals to earn and to achieve, and to look at different ways of delivering these services so the services and the welfare--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do have a responsibility to society. What I am suggesting to the Senate, as Senator Short has already said, is that we should allow them to work and to get reward for their work and their effort. We should let them earn $100,000, or $200,000, or $500,000 or $1m. Good on them! Let them do that. Let us not see these redistributionists, these collectivist fairies try to rip that money off.

It is moving to try to make things a little bit freer, it is moving to privatise some of the Commonwealth trading entities. We have to congratulate it for that.

<PARA> Do not let it be said that I am sticking up for high income earners. I protect their right to earn high incomes, to invest, to create savings and to help Australia. But what we want to do is ensure that low income earners, people who are on the low tax scales, through freedom in the industrial area, through incentive, can become middle income earners; and middle income earners can become high income earners; and that people who rely on welfare, people who cannot help themselves, through no fault of their own, can get off the tit of government and become less reliant on government. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about caring for the unfortunate people who rely on welfare. How much dignity can people have who have to rely on the whim of government welfare policy from day to day, from month to month? All senators have had inquiries at their electorate offices from people who have been messed around by the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs and who feel, obviously, a great lack of dignity having to go through the bureaucracy to argue about why they did not get an extra $20, or whatever. What sort of dignity can those people have?</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is in favour of ensuring that as many people as possible can look after themselves. The only way we can do that is to create incentive for people to earn, to stop ripping them off as soon as they start achieving and to stop knocking down the tall poppies. Let us see thousands of tall poppies in Australia. Let us see what that does for this nation. Let us make the economic cake bigger and let everyone have a fair share of it. </PARA>

I ask the Minister: Does he believe that the poor performance by Mr Hawke at the South Pacific Forum has played any part in this new American approach to the region? Does he believe that this meeting signals an increased interest by the United States in having expanded bilateral relations with the Pacific Island states rather than the traditional path of drawing on Australia's diplomatic resources in the area?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no remotely legitimate conclusions, of the kind that Senator Hill is intimating, that can be drawn from the decision of President Bush to take advantage of the trip that he is otherwise making to Hawaii to have a round table meeting with a number of Heads of Government of Pacific Island countries. It has been widely felt within the United States Administration that such contact with the smaller Pacific Island countries is overdue in the light of the number of policy issues that have arisen in recent times, which have been of some sensitivity obviously within the region. It is a development that we highly and wholly welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not a matter of feeling neglected or left out. We have very regular access at the highest levels to the United States Administration. Prime Minister Hawke, of course, has been a regular visitor with regular access over the years. I have had regular access, as has Senator Robert Ray at our ministerial level, and there is no question about the nature of the relationship there. We were, in fact, asked how we felt about this meeting taking place, and we said that we wholly welcomed it and thought it extremely appropriate that it occur.</PARA>
<PARA> As to Prime Minister Hawke's carriage of the policy issues at the South Pacific Forum, I believe they are deserving of nothing but praise. There were very difficult and sensitive issues involved concerning the chemical weapons destruction facility and, in particular, the outcome of that was a thoroughly satisfactory one, as has now been confirmed by subsequent deliberations and discussions involving Forum leaders in visits to the United States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 October, the United Nations General Assembly in its plenary session adopted a consensus resolution on Cambodia introduced by the President of the General Assembly. Australia very much welcomes the adoption of this consensus resolution, which underlines the now universal international consensus for an end to the Cambodian conflict. The resolution itself welcomes the agreement by all Cambodian parties, which occurred in Jakarta on 10 September, to form the Supreme National Council as the unique and legitimate body and source of authority throughout the transitional period. The resolution notes, importantly, that the SNC is to occupy the seat of Cambodia at the United Nations. Through the Supreme National Council, it is intended that all Cambodians be represented at the UN and that this will put an end to debate over which party or rival government should or should not be entitled to represent Cambodia at the UN.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the state of play in the internal negotiations as to the composition and chairmanship of the SNC, the SNC itself has been formed, I think it is important to appreciate, by agreement of the parties in Jakarta on 10 September, and it met again in Bangkok a week later, but there is yet to be agreement on the question of the chairmanship, the vice-chairmanship and the delegation to the UN. Agreement, I have to say, is not immediately in sight in that respect. We hope that these matters can be resolved quickly to enable the SNC as a result to actually occupy the UN seat.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia endorses the call in the consensus resolution for the Cambodian leaders to cooperate in assuming their responsibilities in order to achieve national reconciliation in this first step in particular. I think we all have to accept, however, that such a process will not be easy as the Cambodian parties have been fighting a very bitter civil war for 11 years now and there is a high level of mutual suspicion and distrust. What we and the rest of the international community can do to assist the process is to simply not place too much emphasis on transient alarums and diversions, but work for and continue to support efforts to put the comprehensive settlement together.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the comprehensive settlement itself and the movement to put that to bed, it is hoped that at the end of this month or the beginning of November there will be a working group meeting of relevant countries in Jakarta to elaborate the present framework document and to work it up into a final negotiating text. The intention thereafter is that that then be the subject of debate and hopefully acceptance by a full-scale reconvened Paris Conference, meeting at a ministerial level we hope some time early in December, to put the comprehensive settlement to final endorsement.</PARA>
<PARA> If all goes according to schedule, there could well be a UN presence in Cambodia as early as the beginning of next year. As to Australia's contribution, I have indicated on a number of occasions that we intend to make a substantial contribution to the UN presence in Cambodia. What precise form that takes will depend on the provisions of the final settlement and on the requirements of the UN, as determined by the Secretary-General. As to a military contribution, Australia would be prepared in principle to make such a contribution but it is not possible at this stage to define what that might be or to define with any precision the numbers that might be involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been provided with the following information by the responsible Minister, Mr Robert Brown: the Federal Government is taking a leading role in improving bus and coach safety throughout Australia. The Vehicle Standards Advisory Committee has been working since July 1987 on a package of safety improvements for buses and coaches. Australian design rules (ADRs) have already been introduced covering speed limiters, tyres, rollover strength, seat belts for the driver's seat and unprotected seats, and requirements for seat strength and seat anchorage strength. The ADR relating to tyres came into effect on 1 July 1990 and all others will come into effect between 1 July 1992 and 1 July 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further regulation on seats and padding has been urgently developed, based on a recent international regulation. This provides a second stage of improvement on seat strength, seat anchorage strength, and padding on long distance coaches. This regulation was endorsed by the Australian Transport Advisory Council at its last meeting and will come into force between 1 January 1992 and 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Office of Road Safety, the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority and vehicle and seat manufacturers are cooperating on an urgent test program to evaluate current coach seats. Information obtained from this will assist the Federal Government in its consideration of the question of seat belts in all coach seats as well as the case for even stronger seats.In addition, work is also being done in other important areas, such as anti-lock brakes and emergency exits. This would follow as a further stage of improvement as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is working with the Queensland Government in investigating the bus crash in Queensland and the conclusions drawn from the investigation will help guide further work in the area of bus safety. The introduction of these standards has brought Australia to the forefront of bus and coach standards in the world.</PARA>

In the first instance, I am aware of an article in which it was claimed that a geological survey conducted by the Mines and Energy Department of the South Australian Government found serious problems with the multifunction polis site in Adelaide, but as the Federal Government has not seen the report in question, I cannot comment further on the accuracy of a newspaper report.</PARA></TALK.START>

The State Government saw the environmental difficulties involved in the site as presenting an opportunity to develop new ways and means of rehabilitating degraded land.</PARA>
<PARA> The management group of the MFP will shortly be overseeing a site assessment study aimed at determining whether the site is capable of being rehabilitated at reasonable cost. A preliminary outcome of that study should be known by the end of this year. Until the results of that study are available, we will not know in any scientific sense the true nature of the site. The results of the site management study will be central to any decision by the Government on the MFP. I interpose here that is the answer I can give to the first of the six questions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator who asked this question will be well aware that, during the Estimates committee process, these questions were posed to the members of the Australian Securities Commission who were available for cross-examination by honourable senators at that time. The answers which were forthcoming will be found in the Hansard of that Estimates committee meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that there will be a requirement for the provision of a particular number by various businesses around Australia; indeed, I think the compliance date is 1 January 1991. It is hoped that businesses will be able to comply by that date, though I am not absolutely sure of the sanctions, results or consequences of non-compliance by that date and what effect that might have on their participation in the ASC scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact-I think this came out at the Estimates Committee; quite obviously it is a statement only of fact-that there is only a short time between now and 1 January 1991. The witnesses before the Committee made it very clear that the various businesses throughout Australia would need to be given timely advice of their obligations in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the honourable senator's question, when asked, led to the response that the number was not required to be put on the full range of stationery that he mentioned, but I would have to check on the exact range of matters which would need to have the stamp of the particular ID number.</PARA>
<PARA> Businesses throughout Australia recognise the huge benefits that will flow from their participation in the corporate life of Australia in a situation regulated by the Australian Securities Commission. In fact, for far too long under the National Companies and Securities Commission company life in Australia, corporate life in Australia, was not regulated in a way which was helpful to businesses because it led to a situation where investor confidence in various businesses was undermined by the practices that were indulged in without sufficient surveillance and enforcement activity being undertaken by the joint operation between the Federal Government and the State governments and their various parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA> After 1 January 1991, where there will be a simple structure with clear ministerial responsibility, parliamentary responsibility and a well-resourced Australian Securities Commission, I believe that most businesses throughout Australia would recognise that very substantial benefits will flow simply from the change in confidence that will be engendered in the various markets of investors both domestically and around the world and, therefore, some small cost of printing up their stationery with certain numbers will be infinitesimal compared with the benefits that will flow to those businesses from the operations of the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the statement made by his predecessor, Senator Don Grimes, in respect of family allowances as distinct from family income supplement, to the National Economic Summit Conference in 1983. Senator Grimes said on behalf of the Government:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is often forgotten, however, that family allowances are not and were never meant to be a welfare program in the strict sense. Rather, they are designed to achieve a broad measure of equity in the tax transfer system between those with and those without dependent children. They recognise that at any level of income those with children face higher costs than those without.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it a fact that the Government's family assets test proposals represent a back down from the long standing policy based on principle to one which, in effect, imposes a higher tax on families with children to the advantage of those without children and with identical assets? Is it a fact that the family allowance assets test has no regard to income received nor the number of children of a family dependent on that income? Is it also a fact that many families, particularly farm families and those engaged in small business, might be technically asset rich but income poor? Finally, is it a fact that the Government's proposal will affect 100,000 mothers; that 80,000 mothers will lose allowances due to the assets test; that 13,000 mothers will lose allowances due to the removal of the taper or shade-out of allowances; and that 4,000 mothers will lose the family allowance supplement receipts? Are those figures correct?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do remember the statement that Senator Grimes made at the time that the family allowance was not meant to be-nor is it meant to be now-a welfare payment in the traditional sense of the word but rather an attempt to gain equity for those with children as against those without children. No step that the Government has taken in the course of the last few months ought to be interpreted as moving away from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tests that we already had in place on income for family allowances suggested that the Government did not believe that there should be no limit on those who were to receive that payment. Once any kind of means testing is introduced, as we did with family allowances, the acknowledgment is that while one is trying to bring about broader equity it is not possible to suggest that that requirement means that every person must receive those allowances. So it was never intended that every mother in Australia would be receiving allowances for her children. The very well off were not to receive them.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Government then did in the Budget was to make sure that we introduced some more targeting. This was to make sure that our welfare payments were going to those who needed them. So we had a series of more targeting in the welfare area. When it came to family allowances, we also made sure that people at the top end of the scale who did not need to receive the allowances ceased to receive them. So, if you like, there were some minor changes at the top end.</PARA>
<PARA> Because we are mindful of the original statement about broader equity, the assets test was set so high that it does not affect huge numbers of people. I think the numbers that Senator Harradine gave are basically right. Although I did not write all of them down, I will assume, for these purposes, that they are right.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government was of the view that when we get to a figure like $300,000 net-which means that they can be much bigger assets and one can take off mortgages and the like-people in that situation are really pretty well off and are not in need of this payment. I would regard that as fine tuning, not as the tearing up of the original ideal. That was the intent of the Government at the time and I do not believe that it represents a back down.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator mentioned in particular the plight of those on farms. I think we have to look at both the payment of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement in this respect because changes have been introduced which affect both. As far as those changes are concerned, I think I have indicated in this place that the Prime Minister saw a delegation from the National Farmers Federation which raised this problem. He indicated to members of the delegation that the Government would be prepared to consider a submission from them on this. I am, therefore, hopeful that we will be having that consideration within the two weeks that the Parliament is up. I am pretty sure that they are going to supply it by the end of this week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a rash of horror stories about air safety linked with deregulation since the Government announced its intention to terminate the two airlines agreement at the end of this month. I assume that Senator McKiernan was referring to the current affairs program last night, which was a wonderful piece of tabloid television. I did not see it last night; I saw it earlier this morning. It is unfortunate that program, which contained 15 minutes of end-to-end pictures of aircraft being fished out of the Potomac River, aircraft on fire, and dead passengers and broken bodies, did not even attempt to make some sort of realistic comparison between the aviation market of the United States of America and that of Australia. It is something that I have spoken about here in the Senate on many occasions, and will obviously have to speak about on many future occasions. It is very difficult to validly compare the two situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also relevant to point out-I will do this now before I go on to talk about the major differences in the Australian deregulation approach-how incredibly safe aviation is in the United States of America. What is constantly left out of the argument are the extraordinary number of miles flown and aircraft movements on a daily basis in the United States where, because of airline deregulation, the percentage of Americans who regularly use air transport has risen from somewhere around 20 per cent to somewhere in excess of 60 per cent because of the benefits that deregulation has brought to the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> I give just one brief comparison of the huge difference between the two markets. The amount of traffic conducted by airlines is measured in things called RPKs-revenue passenger kilometres. This year, to give the most recent example, the entire combined domestic fleets in Australia-all single airlines combined, with every single aircraft operating in Australia-flew an average of 33 million RPKs a day. In June this year, one American airline-United Airlines Inc.-flew 460 million RPKs in a day.</PARA>
<PARA> There are scores of airlines operating in the United States, all of which would rate the adjective `significant' by Australian standards and most of which would be bigger than any domestic carrier we have got. One airline-United-flew 460 million RPKs compared with 33 million for the entire domestic fleet in Australia. That is the difference between the two markets.</PARA>
<PARA> The major difference is that what this Government is doing is moving away from economic regulation of the aviation industry, not moving away from safety regulation of the industry. In fact, I must say that a far more relevant country for A Current Affair to have compared Australia with would have been Canada. The Canadian authorities have taken an approach to deregulation very similar to our own.</PARA>
<PARA> After deregulation commences on 31 October this year the Government, through the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), will continue to play a role in the safety regulation of airlines in Australia. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will continue to operate as it does now, reporting directly to me, not through the CAA. A major and comprehensive review of all the regulations governing Australian air safety prior to deregulation is currently being conducted by the CAA in order to make the system more efficient and, if possible, even safer than it currently is. One of the major differences between the United States aviation industry and our own, of course, is the age of the fleet. It is a significant factor in respect of air safety. There are aircraft operating--</PARA>

I do, but I think it is about time that the Fourth Estate started giving Mr Mansell a little less attention every time he delivers this stuff, because he does not represent anybody. He certainly does not represent the Aboriginal people that I know and have known so well. In fact, honourable senators ought to be around in my house and have a listen to my wife when Mansell appears on the television. Funnily enough, she was talking to me about this latest outburst last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Mr Mansell has said on this occasion is that it is a disgrace for Mr Mandela to accept an invitation from the Australian Government, when in fact it is entirely appropriate for Mr Mandela to do that because the Australian Government has played a major role-and Mandela has acknowledged it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade-in assisting the African people of that country to get some sort of justice in their own country. It is entirely important and entirely appropriate for the Australian Government to act as a host of his visit.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Mr Mandela's hide, according to Mansell, of considering the plight of black South Africans as greater than his own-that is Mansell's own-I would point out without going into gory detail and speaking at length just one salient factor that seems to have escaped Mr Mansell. Nelson Mandela spent more than 30 years of his life in prison-30 of the best years of his life-because he wanted the majority of the citizens in his own country to have the same rights as the minority have.</PARA>
<PARA> Nelson Mandela released a statement which really got to me after his release, and I thought he put the matter very succinctly indeed. He went to prison 30 years ago and what he said was, `Don't think it is all fixed yet, folks'. Nelson Mandela was saying, `Because I am out of prison don't sit back in your straps and think that the good times are ahead, because I went to prison more than 30 years ago and spent 30 years of my life deprived of my liberty and deprived of my normal contact with my friends and family for the right to vote. Thirty years later I came out of prison and I still do not have the right to vote'. Nor do the 70 per cent of black South Africans have the right to vote that Nelson Mandela went to prison for 30 years ago now. I have got to tell the Senate that Michael Mansell has got an enormous hide and an enormous arrogance to suggest that the plight of the South African people is in fact not greater than his own. I do not think Michael Mansell personally has had a hard day in his life-certainly not in the 10 years I have been listening and watching him.</PARA>
<PARA> I would, I am sure, enjoy the support of not only all of my colleagues on this side of the house but also on the other side in saying that it is entirely appropriate for the Australian Government to be the host of Mr Mandela's visit. We look forward to his visit here with a great deal of anticipation and welcome. We support the struggle of his fellow South Africans for some rights in their own country and particularly to enjoy the basic right of being part of the democratic process of their own country. I totally reject the outrageous statements made by Michael Mansell.</PARA>

I congratulate Senator Macdonald on finally asking it. That is a pretty slow reaction time. The situation in the port of Cairns is unsatisfactory and it has to be resolved.

They include the fact that in all States the powerlifting association affiliated with the APF was recognised and/or funded by the respective State government department responsible for the sport.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Sports Drug Agency has indicated that it is satisfied with the steps taken by the APF to cooperate with its program and endorses the APF as the recognised powerlifting body. The Australian Sports Commission has previously funded the APF up to 1989-90 and its performance in acquitting grants and reporting on projects funded by the Commission was satisfactory.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, outrageous Telecom capture, if I may pick up the interjection. Certainly it has dramatised the fact that once again the Government has given way to pressure from a major union, the union in Telecom, which will now swallow up a much more rational and reasonable union in OTC Ltd which, as I understand it, was providing greater levels of productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate should be aware of some interesting elements which emerge from the annual report of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation, commonly known as Telecom. The report indicates the clear beginnings of recession in Australia. One of the indicators of recession is low demand for new telephone services. In the year to 30 June 1990, even before the Government's current economic disasters had their most significant impact, there has been a decline in the demand for new telephone services of about 40,000. Perhaps the media will recognise that as another indicator of problems. It is the same order of decline as that which took place between June 1982 and June 1983 when Australia suffered its worst drought for 50 years and the economic consequences of it. We remember the Australian Labor Party making much of that economic downturn. It is about time it faced up to the fact that it has created a similar economic downturn, at least in the fall-off in the demand for new telephone services. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, while this has happened Telecom, supported by its enthusiastic union, increased its staff numbers from 84,104 to 86,728. This is a matter of some concern. While it is true that the connection of new services as against demand increased, there is supposed to have been-according to the annual report-a very large concentration on increasing productivity. The annual report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Full time staffing levels averaged some 86,700 during the year. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In line with business directions and economic trends, early 1990 saw a tighter staffing profile. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of us would consider that there is a need for an even tighter staffing profile if we have a downturn in demand for telephone connections, at a time when allegedly greater efficiency is supposed to be taking place and particularly when Telecom will swallow up OTC Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to be convinced that there has been a level of improved productivity within Telecom that would merit the remarks made in the annual report. It seems unfortunate that we do not have appropriate productivity indicators within the report when these matters are being raised by OTC. I stress that the difference between the demand for new services and the connection of new services-where connections went up and demand went down last year-represents a clear delay factor in the meeting of demand for new telephone services. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom obviously has a task in front of it to improve that situation. That type of lag is a clear indicator of a failure to meet demand, which is now falling. If demand is falling, Telecom should be much tighter in its approach to staffing levels, particularly as it goes into the new megacom arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak only briefly to the 1990 annual report of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation, or Telecom as it is commonly known. As I said several days ago when I spoke to the report of OTC Ltd, telecommunications in Australia is of significant social, economic and strategic importance. The annual report of Telecom this year contains some most impressive financial results. For example, Telecom's trading profit increased to $1,291m. Its return on assets was 12.3 per cent. It made a dividend payment to the Commonwealth of $185.5m. It invested $3 billion in new capital works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time as returning these financial results, Telecom's basic tariffs have been maintained at the same level as 1989, effectively meaning a real price reduction of 9.1 per cent for Telecom's standard services. Further, Telecom Australia has achieved one of the highest connection rates in the world with around 95 per cent of all Australian households currently connected to the basic network. From these results we can see that Telecom Australia is indeed a highly efficient and profitable asset-an asset which the Australian Democrats believe must be maintained in public ownership. What is often forgotten in the debate over the profits Telecom makes is that we are all shareholders in the corporation and, when Telecom runs at a profit, all Australians are the beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> It must not be overlooked that because Telecom invests heavily in capital works and research and development to come up with technological developments this will ultimately drive down the cost of telecommunications. It is certainly true to say that in telecommunications costs are much more likely to be driven down by technology than by the much vaunted competition, which in the United States of America has resulted in 20 per cent of Americans being unable to afford a telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become something of a national sport to knock Telecom and because of this there seems to be a commonly held misconception that Telecom is not serving the Australian public well. This annual report, I believe, shows quite clearly that this is not the case. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its courtesy in calling me into the chamber. In dealing with the motion that the Senate take note of the document, I have observed in the very short time I have had to look at the paper that it appears to be an excellent report, by and large, of the activities of Telecom Australia over the last 12 months. However, I think it is important to set down a couple of matters of which Telecom should take account and which I cannot see in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to know what Telecom is likely to be doing with its Discovery service. I believe that some aspects of what Telecom has been doing with Discovery have been undertaken without due regard for community standards or, indeed, its responsibilities to the community under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is to decide early next month whether it will contract out part of its Discovery service to a Canberra-based porn merchant, with loose guidelines, setting a precedent for the transmission of pay television porn direct into Australian homes. I believe that the Federal Government has not been aware of or has turned a blind eye to the use by the Canberra porn merchant, Mature Media Group, of Telecom's Discovery service to provide computer porn services to subscribers. </PARA>
<PARA> The names and addresses of those subscribers are now held only by Telecom. Under the proposals to be considered in the first week of next month, as I understand it, by Telecom the names and addresses of new subscribers would go direct to the porn merchants, enabling them to undertake promotions by mail et cetera amongst subscribers for video material, the sale and hire of which is prohibited by law in all of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is pressing to become a major player in the provision of pay television and so is the Mature Media Group, Canberra's chief porn merchant, which has publicly announced that it is gearing up to provide pay television pornography. If Telecom decides to contract out what it terms the `adult' sector of its Discovery service, the likely beneficiary will be the Mature Media Group or an associated company. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's response to complaints from other service providers of 0055, the Discovery service and subscribers is that a review of standards is currently being conducted by Janet Strickland and Associates. However, it was the same Janet Strickland who, as the former Chief Film Censor, presided over the classification of hard-core pornography for the first time in Australia into a legal category for sale and hire. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) should have regard to this possible situation and to the situation so far as Telecom is concerned with its Discovery service. Telecom is obliged, in my view, to tighten up on that area. I believe that Telecom and the Government owes it to the Australian public to declare that if pay television comes in there will be no provision for the transmission of R-rated violent or pornographic films and videos or X-rated pornographic films and videos direct into Australian homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom itself has the major responsibility-and I believe that this is a view widely shared in the community-to tighten up on what is now occurring with the Discovery service and the 0055 service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly about the 1990 annual report of the Australian  Telecommunications Corporation. I believe that the report is an excellent one. The achievements of the Corporation are outstanding in the context that it must provide a basic network service across Australia to all Australians. It has to provide this service in a continent that has only 17 million people. We do not have the advantages of the density of population of similar countries such as the United States of America. Despite that, the telecommunications service provided by Telecom Australia more than match those in other countries, particularly those in the Western world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom is not without its faults; any organisation that is as large as Telecom and has to provide the range of services that Telecom has to provide will have difficulties from time to time, will make mistakes and will have inefficiencies. But the consistent improvement in Telecom Australia in recent years is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the recent announcements by the Australian Government to merge Telecom and OTC Ltd to form the largest public enterprise in Australia's history will further enhance the ability of the new carrier to provide even more efficient, more effective and cheaper services in telecommunications to the Australian people. Establishing a competitive model in which competition will be allowed will encourage Telecom to improve its efficiency in both management and work practices without destroying the overall nature of the organisation in providing a basic service to all people. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to the debates on telecommunications that will take place in this chamber in the next 12 months relating not only to the merger of OTC with Telecom to create a new carrier but also to the rest of telecommunications such as matters dealing with the competitor, with cellular mobiles, with the arrangements of how the interconnect fee is paid, and how community service obligations are charged effectively and properly to the existing carriers and the new carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, all the people-both the employees and the management-of Telecom and OTC will obviously have some apprehension about the new carrier to be created, about their opportunities and their career prospects in it. I do not think they have anything to worry about. They will be able to work in a stronger, larger telecommunications organisation. They have an opportunity to create a new carrier with a new culture of efficiency, one with a dynamic outlook that will further enhance the service to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> People do not realise that by the turn of this century 25 per cent of gross domestic product in Australia will be in telecommunications and information distribution. It will be the biggest industry in Australia, and the new carrier will be the major provider of that service. It will be a publicly owned carrier and it will be able to provide the service that this country, as a modern industrial technologically based country, will need. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I look forward to the debates that will take place during the next 12 months. Though this will not be the last annual report of Telecom, it will probably be the last report based on its existing structure as we know it. The next report will probably be an interim report as the process of change takes place. The management and workers of Telecom should be congratulated on its improved performance over the last 12 months. The report should be commended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make just two or three points on this annual report today. I find it quite intriguing that only recently have we received the final Government response to the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee reports. A number of recommendations and the Government's response to them appear to be in some conflict at least with the material included in the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to draw attention to advocacy in the Veterans' Review Board. The Government decided, in its response, that there was no real need to increase the resources to the returned servicemen's organisations to give them additional advocacy assistance, and that a new scheme of outreach to veterans would be sufficient to do the job. Yet we find in the annual report that the Veterans' Review Board is saying that some advocacy organisations and individual advocates still have long delays before their clients can appear before the Board, and that those advocates have not been able to prepare sufficient cases and present them for hearing quickly enough to meet the Board's capacity to hear them. It points out that it is vital to the Board's operations that advocacy organisations maintain both a level of representation and sufficient cases for hearing to match the Board's listing capacity, otherwise delays to applicants in finalising their cases will continue to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seems to think that would not be a problem. Clearly, in the experience of the Board it is still a problem and I urge the Government to look, once again, at providing proper resources to the ageing veterans who are advocates and to the organisations which have ageing membership, who are expecting to continue to do the job that they did when they were young on behalf of their comrades and their comrades' widows. It is important that we improve the resources available in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to draw the attention of the Senate to the decreasing military knowledge on the Veterans' Review Board. We are now facing the situation in which civilians are hearing cases on which they have no background expertise. Certainly there are doctors, but they are not doctors who have any military experience themselves and, in many cases, they have not had any detailed experience of treating servicemen or returned servicemen. It is very important, wherever it is possible, to get members on the Veterans' Review Board who have themselves had military experience. One deficiency that has been pointed out to me is that people who lack air crew experience hear claims made by former members of the Royal Australian Air Force. That is something which, in all humanity, should be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> There also is clearly a need for very careful choice of personnel. In too many cases I hear claims of excessive legalism in a system which was designed to be outside the court system. I urge the Government to be exceedingly careful in appointing people to this Board, because often there is very real resentment of the system and the Government by veterans who have served their country and expect, in their old age, at least to get a fair deal when finally they come to the repatriation system for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice also that the cost per case has gone up quite dramatically this year-by something in the region of 30 per cent. I question why should this be so. The numbers on the Review Board have been cut back quite substantially. The number of cases going through has also gone down. The system has had a thorough going-over to try to do it as efficiently as possible, and still we find that the cost per case has gone from $711 last year to $918 this year. It seems an unsatisfactory jump in costs and I question why this is so. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, one of the recommendations of the monitoring committee to the Government on the Veterans' Entitlements Act related to the reference of questions of law from the Veterans' Review Board. The recommendation was that they should be enabled to go directly to the Federal Court. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphries) said, in his response, that he supported this recommendation, but when it came to taws he went to the Attorney-General who said he did not support it. That looks as though that is going to be that. I ask: Why is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs so low in the pecking order that his responsibility to the veterans in this country is as nothing in the face of lack of support from the Attorney-General? Can he not go and find powerful patrons, as seems to be the situation in the current Government? What will the Government do about this matter?</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is entitled Government Funding of Academic and Related Research in Australia. It is a report of the Australian Science and Technology Council to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It presents statistics on government expenditure on academic and academically related research in Australia for the period 1984-87. In doing that, it compares that expenditure with spending in several European countries, notably the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United States of America and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very significant report in the sense that it looks at government expenditure over the early years of the Hawke Administration and compares that with expenditure by other technically advanced and industrialised countries. It says something that we all knew in this place but I think is worth underscoring. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, whichever means are used of allowing for variation in country size, government spending on academic and related research in Australia emerges as rather low in international terms, particularly relative to the continental European countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on to look at overall expenditure. In terms of overall expenditure-government expenditure in addition to expenditure by private industry-Australia comes out very poorly indeed. On page 53 of the report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, in 1987 Australian GERD-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, gross expenditure on research and development-</PARA>
<PARA>at 1.24% of GDP was substantially lower than the other countries, which ranged from around 2.32% for the Netherlands-</PARA>
<PARA>almost twice as much-</PARA>
<PARA>to over 2.7%-</PARA>
<PARA>considerably more than twice as much-</PARA>
<PARA>for the Federal Republic of Germany, US and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government since that time has been progressively attempting to encourage more private investment in research in this country. That is having several quite disastrous consequences for research in that in this country we have among the industrial giants many multinational companies that carry out research overseas, and the Government is simply running down its input into research without a reasonable expectation that private industry will pick it up. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I think needs to be stressed is that as long as this sort of effort goes on it has to be recognised that in a country in which interest rates are very high it is extremely unlikely that private industry will participate in that sort of long term research which in the longer term will be of supreme benefit-the more important parts of research which need to go on. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's effort in fundamental research has been quite good, and this report points out that our expenditure on environmental research is the best of all the countries in the comparison. That should be welcomed and emphasised. We spend $US4.3 per head on environmental research compared with the next highest country, the United States of America, at only $US3.5 per head, and Japan at only $US1.1 per head, so we are doing very well in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the amount of effort going into fundamental research which in the longer term will address both the environmental problems and the long term industrial and economic problems which this country faces is likely to be jeopardised by the practices of this Government, and this report underscores the likely failure of the Government's present practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to outline a case of an innocent illegal immigrant that I think is of particular importance and something that worries me greatly. It concerns the case of a young man called Boris Yip. Boris migrated to this country illegally with his parents some nine or 10 years ago. At the time Boris was a young boy in primary school. Boris lived those nine or 10 years in this country growing up as an Australian. In fact if one talks to Boris one will notice that he thinks and talks like an Australian and his heart is here in this country. Yet, earlier this year, Boris was forced to leave this country by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs which said that Boris was an illegal immigrant and, in spite of the fact that he did not come here of his own free will, he should nonetheless be forced to leave.</PARA></TALK.START>

Here the problem arises, because although Boris was studying part time and getting exceptional results, and in spite of the fact that Boris was working at the age of 19 as an assistant contract manager for a very large construction company in Queensland, the Immigration Department believed that Boris was not the sort of person that we want in this country and it required him to leave. </PARA>
<PARA> One might think that is where the matter ends but, unfortunately, that is where the matter just starts. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations in its hearings earlier on this year heard that had Boris been picked up after the date on which he was, he in fact would not have been required to leave the country at all, because the Department has changed its guidelines. So one might think that that would entitle Boris to come back. But no, in fact the Department's treatment of this matter continues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, I understand, requested the production of Boris's file at the Department of Immigration. For that purpose, I contacted Boris and got him to provide to me a letter authorising me to request production of his departmental file to any person for any purpose, and Boris signed that letter and sent it to me. I forwarded that letter on and it was received by the Joint Parliamentary Committee. One would have thought that after all of that the Department would have come clean and produced his file. But it did not. In fact I understand the file is still outstanding. I am told that what happened was that the Department wrote to the Ombudsman and said it had produced a file to the Committee. Yet, just yesterday, I received a letter by facsimile from a departmental officer saying that it was not possible to produce the file because certain parts of the file related to his brother and sister and his parents, and that those parts of the file could not be produced without their consent. That consent is now being made available to me, and in due course I will make that available both to the Committee and to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> But the question has to be asked, why did the Department, as I am told, say to the Ombudsman that it had made the file available when the file was still in fact in the Department's possession? I believe that this matter requires further investigation. What also requires further investigation is what I think may be a case of victimisation by the Department against Boris Yip. The Department has sent a letter to Boris saying that he is required to pay $13,000 before he will be allowed to apply to come into this country again. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does this $13,000 come from? Well, $10,000 is supposedly the cost of Boris's university education in spite of the fact that he grew up in this country for nine or 10 years, and even under the strictest recommendation made by any member of that Committee Boris would have been allowed to stay and in fact would have been given permanent residence. But there is another $3,000 that the Immigration Department wants from Boris before he is even allowed to apply to come into the country again. That in fact relates to the education of his brother and sisters. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that is wholly unsatisfactory. It is administratively unsound and begs the possibility of some sort of victimisation by the Department of Boris Yip. I am not soft on illegal immigrants. We must make that point very clearly. Australia has a sovereign right to determine who comes into this country and who does not. But we also have to have some sense of compassion and every single requirement laid down by every member of that Committee would justify Boris being allowed to stay in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, he was deported to Hong Kong. He lost his job in this country-he was progressing in an incredible fashion for a person his age-he lost his university place and will have to start a course all over again, he has lost the country where he grew up, the country that he feels a part of, and this is all because of the attitude of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The really shameful thing about it is this: Boris's younger brother, who was born in this country prior to 1986, is still here. He is a minor, being looked after by friends. He is still here and he is an Australian citizen. But Boris, the elder brother, is not allowed to stay in the country to look after his younger sibling. That, I think, shows the incredible absurdity of the attitude of the Department to this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to highlight here and now the importance of compassionate conduct by the Department; the importance of fairness in dealing with people instead of treating them like animals; and the importance of giving Boris Yip a chance to come back to the country that he feels he belongs to, that I feel he belongs to, to come back to the country that I believe he would make a great citizen of. Boris Yip grew up as a fine Australian. Boris Yip will be a fine Australian. Boris Yip will always remain a fine Australian in spite of whatever the Immigration Department might try to do to keep him out of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the luncheon adjournment, we were discussing this particular amendment which seeks to impose a 60 per cent marginal income tax rate on that amount of income which is above $100,000. I wish to advert particularly to the remarks made by Senator Campbell. I must say that I found the picture of a society that he was painting somewhat nauseating. It was a combination of a free-for-all for the rich and powerful and charity crumbs for the rest. He was not ashamed to use the word `charity' and he linked it to two groups of people which I did not mention but which, in his perception, the people who were listening to the broadcasting of this Parliament would somehow find obnoxious, and that is lone parents and people in the Aboriginal community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to remind the Opposition and in particular Senator Campbell once again that a society, a community, is judged by the way in which it treats its most disadvantaged members. I wonder whether the honourable senator heard the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, recently in a speech in Darwin detailing the severe disadvantages that the Aboriginal community still suffers. After 200 years of dispossession and deprivation, we still have not managed to make Aboriginal people full and equal members of our society who can enjoy the privileges and the services that we take as a matter of course. I think Senator Campbell's perception of this situation, as throwing charity crumbs to the poor, indicates the lack of vision, the lack of responsibility and the lack of the concept of development which, rather than charity, is underpinning the Australian Democrats' concept of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer once again to our alternative Budget. First of all, let me explain that the strategy of the Budget does not simply consist of a wish list. Yes, we do have $4 billion worth of expenditure items which go towards urgently needed community services. We also have, though, $7 billion of revenue items which create a $3 billion surplus which is in addition to the one achieved by the Treasurer and which would have much earlier than is now happening reduced our interest rates and reduced our dollar to help our primary producers and to help industry and prevent the sort of slide into unemployment that we are now having. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, our concept is one of development-not only of human development but of development of the economy towards a sustainable society. I will just mention some of the items which would be financed in part out of that 60 per cent marginal income tax rate which, as I have said before, would yield $600m. There is risk sharing support for industry, with particular emphasis on export industries, of approximately $50m. There is research and development, mainly for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), of $100m. There are education initiatives, with strong emphasis on trade training, of $477m. There is international aid of $430m to underpin our global aspect of development. There is a savings incentive providing a rebate of 39 per cent on the first $1,000 interest, which would cost approximately $600m. That in itself could be paid out of that 60 per cent marginal income tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish Senator Campbell and the others on his side would take a look at how we view redistribution, that it is a strategic matter increasing the capacity of people and of business to create a stronger Australia and to create individuals who can master their lives so we can move together towards a more just and sustain- able society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity of responding to the Australian Democrats on the question of the power of the upper House in relation to increasing the burden of taxation. I wish to remind the Senate that the proposed amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990, Schedule 1 of the Bill, by clause 3 of the Bill, will amend the tables in parts I and XI of Schedule 7 of the Income Tax Act 1986. These refer to rates of tax on certain amounts of taxable income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that I think has completely escaped participants in the debate does not surround the word `imposing', although I will come back to that later in terms of the High Court's modern interpretation of giving the widest scope possible to words, but the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the word, `burden'-</PARA>
<PARA>on the people. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendment to the schedules, putting a rate of 60 per cent onto taxable income exceeding $100,000-in the words of the amendment-therefore would be deemed to infringe section 53 if proposed in the manner in which it was done in the Committee. The Committee may be able to request the lower House to make such an amendment, but it was not in that form when it was presented to the Committee this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that Bills imposing tax and fixing the rate of tax are separate because of section 55 of the Constitution which provides that `laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect'. Surprisingly, I feel that at this point the Government's argument is on this proposal of imposing a tax, because there is some doubt about that-I concede that-according to past interpretations. </PARA>
<PARA> One looks at the High Court's interpretation of current taxation legislation, which gives the widest possible scope of meaning to words, as it has done in terms of its interpretation of capital gains taxation. It gives the full intent of the Parliament or the Constitution to these words. But the argument, I submit, need not be on the more difficult point that I am suggesting could be addressed by the High Court in terms of the meaning and scope of the word `imposing' basically on section 53 because, essentially, it increases a burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this matter, which is obviously of considerable interest, ought to be debated around academia for quite some time. But it is an issue that I think the Committee should come to grips with, particularly in light of the fact that the Government does not have a majority, and that we could see a repetition of such Bills. In the interests of clarity I would welcome a paper on this. I certainly intend to pursue the matter further because I think it is of interest to not only this chamber but also constitutional lawyers and certainly academia. I hope this might close the debate. </PARA>

I would be perfectly happy to have the matter further qualified.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I go back to the substance of the argument which was being debated before lunch when the Opposition in particular attempted to beat the Australian Democrats about the ears because we chose to attempt to impose an increase in the taxation to the extent of a 60 per cent marginal rate on those with incomes over $100,000 per year. As Senator Spindler has pointed out, that involves some one half of one per cent of the Australian population, and would raise about $600m indicating, of course, the extent of the skewing in incomes among Australians-a point which has been made several times by both Senator Spindler and Senator Powell in calling for an inquiry into wealth distribution in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we heard repeatedly before lunch from many members of the Opposition was really an argument for financial elitism. They were arguing that those who had high incomes were indeed in some sense those in the community to whom one had to look up to. One had to offer them even greater incentives-using the Opposition's term. One had to hold out before them greater incentives so that somehow or other they would get the economy going. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is precisely the part of the economic pattern which the Hawke Government has been pursuing. There has been increasing inequity in this country since 1983. There has been a wider distribution of incomes and that is indicated by the sharper rate of skewing in income distribution. The hope that the greater income and wealth flowing to the already wealthy would somehow lead to more investment in productive enterprises has simply not occurred. That wealth has been used predominantly, as we have seen, to speculate in paper shuffling. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks we have seen some spectacular crashes among those who have been the paragons, presumably, of the Opposition. Indeed one of them was for a time the President of the Liberal Party and recently lost, in a spectacular fashion, large amounts of money. I for one see many other people in the community whom we should look up to. We should not use as a criterion of excellence a criterion of a need for support, a criterion for the need for incentive, those who have already, and often by rather dubious means, made large amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short said that somehow we needed to make the cake grow so that out of a bigger cake we could more equitably share that cake and address the problems of social welfare and justice and also the environmental problems which beset us. Senator Short specifically attacked several speeches which I have made in recent days calling for a sustainable economy, an economy which will not grow in those terms used specifically by economists, which seems to be something that the Opposition does not understand. By growth, economists mean growth of gross national product in constant dollars-that is, taking out the inflation factor. Apparently, they do not understand that included in gross national product are all those expenses which are borne by a community to avoid the inevitable environmental health and other consequences of the growth which has been pursued. As we spend more out of our income on cleaning up the environment, as we spend more on the provision of social services to benefit those who are being left behind by this scramble for growth, those amounts do not appear on the debit side of gross national product. Those amounts are entered into gross national product as an addition. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one can have a growing economy. I point out to the Opposition that throughout most years recently the economy has been growing. But I think it is self-evident that, even with a growing economy, the majority of people have started to become worse off, so that even while the cake has been growing, we have started to become worse off. I think the empirical evidence simply shows that Senator Short really does not know what he is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that I made in opening. The Opposition, as I said, is holding up for veneration those who have made a large amount of money in saying that our tax structure needs to provide more incentive to those who have already made more than $100,000. Senator Panizza said they are the people who are risking their capital. There are a large number of people in our community who are risking a great deal more than their capital-people on low incomes who are going out after social goals from a very poor base indeed. I can tell this Committee, from my work over many years in the environment movement, that many of those people are living on the dole or on very poor incomes but they regard the protection and their work for the environment as far more important than going out and making more dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people risk a great deal and are contributing an enormous amount to the long term welfare of the Australian community. There are people who work in the social welfare area on little or no incomes because they believe that social justice is very important. They risk a great deal, and I find it quite reprehensible that the Opposition holds up risk of capital as the criterion by which people should be judged as worthy of more incentive. I thank the Opposition for taking that line because it clearly delineates between those who hold up greed as the incentive which needs to drive our society and those, certainly on the Democrats benches, who hold up social justice and equity as the criteria which should guide us. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would point out to the Opposition that it is a matter of record that as inequity increases-and inequity has been increasing in Australian society for quite some time-so do a lot of the other concomitants of that inequity. Crime, for instance, increases, as do the problems of ill health and drugs. Therefore, the costs on the community as a consequence of that inequity also increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to members of the Opposition that even out of self-interest it is better for them to support a greater degree of equity and fairness in a society than simply pursue the increasing divergence of incomes and wealth in the Australian community. Eventually that increasing disparity in wealth and income will be borne home on them in inability to live safely, to live securely, and to live in a healthy and desirable environment. The amendment moved by my colleague Senator Spindler deserves the strong endorsement of this Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that the Australian Democrats may not want to hear this contribution, but unfortunately it is inevitable. At least I will keep it brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first refer to the very important constitutional points raised by Senator Watson. I acknowledge their importance, even though they are not important with regard to any impending passage of this amendment; nevertheless, they are issues of substance. I have asked for a paper to be prepared by the Clerks for distribution to all senators on this important question. That may fuel further discussion, or it may be such a comprehensive paper that it concludes the discussion. Senator Watson has raised an issue of importance which requires serious consideration. I have asked for something to at least commence that discussion and we will see where it goes from there. I thank him for raising the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to my fundamental point on behalf of the Government with regard to this amendment, which goes back to the response I gave in regard to amendments Nos 2 and 3. The Government will not agree to the Senate, rather than the Government, setting the tax rates in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I make only two other brief comments. One is that tax rates are not only distributional issues. They also have fundamental macro-economic consequences and, therefore, the Government will reserve its right to set macro-economic policy, and I believe it must. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one point about the progressivity of the tax system. Although the top rate is a factor in that, one of the things that is too often neglected is that the spread of tax rates is not significantly different now from that which it was when the 60c rate was the top rate because then the lowest rate was 30c. We have now a spread from 47c to 21c. So the progressivity in terms of the relationship between the rate paid by low income earners and that paid by high income earners has barely changed. In one statistical sense one could say that it has expanded, but in literal terms of the number of percentage points in the spread it is essentially the same as it has always been. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons we will not be supporting the amendment. There were a certain number of things said in opposition to the amendment which are not views that I share, but those views were entitled to be put and I listened to them with interest. I would refer Senator Campbell, in view of some of his remarks about the charity model of welfare distribution, to an answer given in the House of Representatives today by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on that issue which I thought summed it up-not exactly succinctly, but effectively. Therefore, for those reasons the Government will not be supporting this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>I have moved this amendment because the Opposition desires the proposed amendments to the Child Care Act contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for investigation and report to the Senate. The Opposition is particularly concerned at the cost implications of the proposal relating to guidelines and desires that the matter be fully investigated by the Committee with a view to ascertaining the need for such guidelines and the nature and extent of the Government's proposals in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also desirable that the Committee should investigate the implications of the removal of any mention of guidelines, as it is suggested that this would simply give the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) carte blanche to have regard to any matters which he considered relevant and to link fee relief to compliance with any such matters. The Government has repeatedly intimated that fee relief will not be linked to compliance, but as there is no such provision in the Bill or the accompanying statements, it is desirable that this matter be tested further in the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our desire that the Committee should require evidence to be provided by representatives of the commercial child-care sector, community-based centres and local government and other interested parties, including representatives of organisations such as the Australian Early Childhood Foundation. I believe that the Senate will be in a much better position to judge the merits of this legislation once the full ramifications of these proposals have been carefully investigated and reported upon, and I have therefore moved accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Arts, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 amends eight Acts; it is a compendium amendment. Three of these Acts relate to the area of my responsibility as shadow Minister for the arts, heritage, sport and youth affairs. They are the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973, the National Gallery Act 1975 and the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1976. Other matters, particularly tourism, covered by these amendments will be dealt with by my colleague and friend Senator Newman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in the Opposition have basically no disagreement with the amendments, particularly following the Government's sensible decision to accept some of our recommendations about how these amendments could be improved. I appreciate the cooperation from the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Simmons, and his staff and officers of the Department in making these improvements to the Bill. It is a pleasant situation when one can, in fact, discuss these issues with officers of the Department and with the Minister in a friendly and cooperative way so that procedures of government go on in a coherent way without unnecessary confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that, despite impressions that one would gather from the media, the procedures of this place probably involve agreement about 90 per cent of the time in terms certainly of the thrust of legislation. This chamber is not a place of continual confrontation, but a place where senators seek to do what they believe is right and proper in, hopefully, a cooperative way so that we end up with the best result. In this case, I believe we are ending up with the best result. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act simply rectify a minor wording error that took place in last year's amendments. I do not want to go on too much about it, but it would be nice and more efficient if the Government could get its amendments right in the first place without having to bring in this kind of amendment; nonetheless, we certainly believe that the error should be corrected and corrected retrospectively, as this legislation does. Clearly the wording errors merit correction from the time the amending Act came in on 19 June last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Act in my area, the National Gallery Act, is being amended to introduce flexible, workable and responsible disposable mechanisms for works of art from the national collection in line with recommendations made in the review of the Australian National Gallery in July 1989. These involve removing the requirement that two independent experts be consulted, but leaving ministerial approval as mandatory and, I believe, leaving enough safeguards to ensure that there will not be wrongful disposal of works of art. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, no works of art have yet been disposed of by the National Gallery. It has been totally acquisitive 100 per cent of the time, but there is a prospect that it may well run out of space or facilities as a result of its acquisition program, and there may well be judgments that some works do not justify their being held in a national collection. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons for changing the system, which has never been used, was the requirement that a report was needed from two independent experts on the importance of the work of art to the national collection before it was disposed of, because it could well be that the fees paid for such advice could exceed the value of the work, especially if the only relevant expert happened to be overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition feels convinced that the changes are appropriate, particularly now that the Government has accepted my request to it that any such disposal should be listed in the annual report of the Australian National Gallery to allow public scrutiny of the list. I thank the Government for its sensible decision to include that in the amendments that were made to this Bill in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing I would mention in this context is that the Government, in this instance, is implementing recommendations of the review of the Australian National Gallery by Mr Gerard Early. This report was presented in February 1989. It seems to me that it is a sensible and detailed report. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, the Opposition will be moving an amendment to the second reading motion along these lines:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the motion, add: ``but the Senate is of the opinion that in the absence of any public reasons to the contrary, the Government should implement the other major recommendation of the Early Report into the Australian National Gallery that its private sector fund-raising activities be transferred to the Australian National Gallery Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, this is a fairly detailed and well argued report. I understand that there are pragmatic problems related to implementing the Early report. But I should say, without making too much of a pun, that not only has the Government failed to provide any sensible reasons for not proceeding with the recommendations but its response has been more late than early. </PARA>
<PARA> The response from the Australian National Gallery to this report of February 1989 is contained in a letter dated 13 September 1990. The letter from Mr Whitlam, the Chairman of the Council, comments on fund raising, which is the matter I refer to in my amendment. As I say, it is dated a year and a half after the report came out. Mr Whitlam says this:</PARA>
<PARA> Council has resolved that fund-raising activities, including sponsorship, should remain the responsibility of the Gallery and not the Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no rational explanation of why the Early proposals have been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a big ticket item which involves millions of dollars. It is recognised that the Australian National Gallery, being centred in what is relatively a small town, does not have the same sorts of immediate and ready access to those private sector people who may well wish to assist galleries that are closer and in larger centres where the offsetting public relations benefits might be more readily available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> What Mr Whitlam did say in his letter-and this obviously does give a clue to the pragmatic problems surrounding the Foundation-is this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman and Executive Director of the Foundation have recently resigned.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Council is currently reviewing the structure of the Foundation and its Board of Directors. To date the Foundation has raised $3.07 million (including the Nomura scholarship). It is an important adjunct to the Gallery which must be supported and maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that I totally agree with that. But I am concerned that the Council has failed to explain why, when it is to be supported and maintained, it is not to be given the job which the Opposition believes is the most appropriate job, and that is taking over the private sector fund raising activities. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons that the Foundation is in some difficulties in terms of staffing is that the Executive Director, Mrs Carol Haslem, has been very unwell. I am certain that all of us in this chamber would wish her a speedy recovery. She is, of course, well known to members of the Opposition in particular because her husband, John, was the member for the Australian Capital Territory in the late 1970s-and a very good member too. </PARA>

<PARA> But the fact that there is no chairman and executive director may be a temporary reason for not maintaining the Foundation as the appropriate body. But I should mention that quite shortly there is going to be a change in the position of chairman of the Council of the National Gallery itself. In other words, the absence of a chairman or the impending departure of a chairman does not necessarily render a body inanimate or incapable of working. </PARA>
<PARA> I should just say in passing, of course, that the question of who is going to become the new chairman of the Australian National Gallery is a matter of some public debate. I will come to that later. I want to mention the recommendations of the Early report which I believe should have been either implemented or dealt with in the correspondence from Mr Whitlam or in the Government's response to it. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the Australian National Gallery Foundation in September 1987 was a major initiative which should significantly enhance the capacity of the Gallery for fund raising. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for fund raising on behalf of the ANG is currently split between the . . . Foundation (which seeks donations) and the Gallery itself (which seeks sponsorship). As both these activities require similar skills and coordination of effort, the sponsorship function should be transferred to the Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the success of the ANG in raising off-budget revenue, it has not reached its maximum potential in this area given a rather uncoordinated approach and constraints created by the overall financial and staffing strictures on the Gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANG's entrepreneurial activities (excluding entrance fees) would be better coordinated and be more effective if devolved to the Australian National Gallery Foundation under a licence arrangement. These changes would remove the funding of some ANG staff from the Federal budget and, by eliminating inappropriate constraints, help to maximise opportunities for off-budget revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Separating the Gallery's fund raising and entrepreneurial activities from its core heritage functions would facilitate the focussing on the clear objective of maximising off-budget revenue. It would assist the establishment of funding targets and strategies to meet them. It would also impose a commercial test on decisions which are sometimes currently made on an ad hoc basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Donations and business sponsorship are more likely to be received for specific projects than for recurrent general expenditure. Potential donors would be reluctant to donate if they believed their gifts would serve merely to relieve the Federal Government's financial responsibilities for the Gallery. Opportunities to raise off-budget revenue can be maximised therefore only against a secure base of Federal Government funding for the ANG's administrative and core heritage functions. </PARA>
<PARA> All revenues raised by the Australian National Gallery Foundation should be retained and used by the Foundation on behalf of the Gallery. There should be no reduction-</PARA>
<PARA>and I want to stress this-</PARA>
<PARA>in the Federal Parliamentary appropriation for the ANG as a result of successful revenue raising by the Australian National Gallery Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to stress that one of the key points of the Opposition policy for the arts is that one should not penalise success in arts areas by in fact automatically reducing government support for those organisations that have either proved themselves to be efficient or competent in the area of raising money. Unfortunately, far too often we find success being penalised and incompetence being rewarded by increased funding when there is pressure on government support for the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the National Gallery Foundation needs to be considerably strengthened at the moment. In view of the fact that it has been some time since the Executive Director unfortunately suffered ill health, I think it is a matter for regret that measures have not yet apparently been taken to restore the strength of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Early report has been accepted pretty thoroughly in other areas. In fact, the letter from Mr Whitlam, the Chairman of the Australian National Gallery, outlines the places where that report has been put into effect by the Gallery. For example, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Gallery Council has reviewed the Acquisitions Policy and priorities for the National Collection. It has been agreed that emphasis should be placed on Australian art (including Aboriginal art) and the arts of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>A successful major sponsorship was concluded recently with Nomura Securities, Tokyo, which donated $2 million for the construction of an Asian gallery. For the first time the Asian collection will now have a permanent space within the Gallery for display.``Nomura Court'' is expected to be completed in March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I am glad to see that he also responded to the Early report by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>While reviewing the Acquisitions Policy, Council reaffirmed its resolve to continue to maintain and develop a national collection of works of art across all geographic boundaries for the enjoyment, education and stimulation of all Australians. The finest Australian works in all media will be exhibited against the finest examples of Western art and other traditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, however, on the next matter, public access, there has been a glitch-not a glitch of the Gallery's making but a glitch relating to the structure in which it has to display its art. As Mr Whitlam says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Gallery has continued to develop its public access and promotional programs through its exhibitions drawn from the National Collection. The travelling exhibitions program has been expanded to include a minimum of three exhibitions each year to tour all states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA>He points out the success of the British Museum exhibition, which, when in Canberra, attracted 190,000 visitors. But here comes the problem: because of the requirement to spend $3.5m fixing the roof, the Australian National Gallery will not be able to have any blockbuster-I think that is the appropriate expression-exhibitions this year, such as the British Museum exhibition. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Newman" NAMEID="BE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a blockbuster exhibition might well have brought in some money to help contribute to repairing the roof. The fact is that $3.5m is being spent on what is basically a pretty new building to replace, in effect, the real cover of that building. A new roof is being built over the existing roof because the existing roof is no good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I look around the new buildings in Canberra and wonder what kind of design, construction and supervision went into them. So shortly after the National Gallery has opened, in relative terms, it has to have its roof replaced. Major government offices that have leaked at, I think, Belconnen have cost multimillions of dollars to fix. A major building in Civic had to be vacated, at enormous cost, by the Public Service. What on earth is happening to the standards of construction here, particularly in public buildings? When multimillions of dollars such as this are being wasted, there is some imperative to find out what on earth is going wrong. To my knowledge, that matter has not received any attention within the Parliament. I believe it should. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that Mr Whitlam raised was that the Gallery is investigating possibilities of high resolution new technology in relation to public access to imagery of works in the collection. A collection study room will shortly be available to students and researchers and members of the public on written request. A review of the Gallery library will take place in October this year-it is obviously taking place now-as part of the public access review. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this report by Mr Early was of great merit. It should have been more seriously considered in respect of this vital question of raising money. The Opposition's clear policy on the arts is to encourage private sector support and funding. The solution Mr Early has recommended, whereby the funding by a foundation is separated from the body itself, will remove the reluctance of potential donors to donate so that they will not believe that their gifts will merely relieve the Federal Government of its financial responsibilities and that the Government will substitute private sector funding for government funding. The people who like to donate to these bodies like to feel not that they are letting the Government off the hook, but that they are doing something worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> I encourage the Government to steal another of our policies. After all, it steals most of them. It does not implement them too well, but it steals the policies. This might be an appropriate policy for the Government to steal because it would be to the benefit of the Australian National Gallery and to the benefit of the Australian people, particularly those who come to Canberra in their millions not only to look at the National Gallery but also to visit this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also disappointed at the suggestion that someone for whom I have the highest regard-that is, Mr Lionel Bowen-is being widely tipped as the expected new Chairman of the Australian National Gallery. Mr Bowen, the former Deputy Prime Minister, is a highly qualified, competent, able and charming man who has qualifications for a great range of public positions. This is not one of them. As a retiring Council member, Mrs Seidler, said last week-this is quoted from the Sun-Herald of last Sunday:</PARA>
<PARA>The first necessary qualification for a council member-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a member of the Council of the Australian National Gallery-</PARA>
<PARA>is a demonstrated knowledge of and commitment to art and art museums. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bowen has at no stage demonstrated that first necessary qualification. When I saw in the paper the other day that he was entering a beginner's course in art appreciation, I felt that I should commend him for his enthusiasm, but I regret that he feels that that will provide the necessary background to take on what should be one of the most significant roles in the Australian arts community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not snobbish; it is practical. It demonstrates the incompetence of this Government's approach that the Minister for Industrial Relations would interject in that way. If his view is that it does not matter a damn whether the person who is the Chairman of the Australian National Gallery has the first knowledge or touch of enthusiasm or interest in art, it demonstrates why the National Gallery has been having so much trouble with this Government. While we have an outstanding new Director and an outstanding new team at the National Gallery, if they are to be burdened with the lead weight of retired Labor politicians whose appointments are justified on the grounds that it does not matter whether people on the Council do not have any interest in art whatsoever, then the National Gallery will be in for a bad couple of years before we get into office and fix it up. I thank the Minister for interjecting in that way. I feel now confirmed in my view that this Government has an arrogant disregard for what is in the best interests of the Australian National Gallery. Turning to the next--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are a snob.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prepared to give the Minister another serve any time he wants to interject. The next point I want to make concerns another element in the Bill before us which is of some moment, and that is an amendment to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act to overcome administrative difficulties which have arisen in the operation of the heritage export control scheme. The amendment will enable a principal public collecting institution, but not private collectors, to apply to the Minister for a general export permit and so avoid the present requirement of individual export permits whenever lending Australian material overseas, as long as it is for research, exhibition or a similar purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because these collections-that is, in principal public collecting institutes-are already controlled and protected by Acts of Commonwealth, State or Territory parliaments, the administrative cost and inconvenience of individual permits is considered unnecessary. The amendments will also exempt from the Acts all cultural heritage objects temporarily imported into Australia under a loan agreement from foreign governments or collecting institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of my representations to the Government, it is agreed that the Act is now to be further amended-and, in fact, was in the lower House-to exempt private overseas collections on loan to Australian exhibitors because, clearly, not only was it unfair but it also imposed an unreasonable burden on the Minister in the event that such a private collection coming here could have been subject to court action by some other body or country, which may have claimed that the collection or the works of art may have been improperly obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, there could be some disagreement with the Greek Government if the Elgin marbles came to Australia. This arrangement will now protect those bodies. I put this view to the Government after discussing it with various State gallery directors, and I am grateful to the Minister for his sensible recognition of the need to cooperate and end up with the best possible result. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that in the absence of any public reasons to the contrary, the Government should implement the other major recommendation of the Early Report into the Australian National Gallery that its private sector fund-raising activities be transferred to the Australian National Gallery Foundation''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, that is strictly in line with Opposition policy. It is strictly in line with good sense. It is strictly in line, I believe, with giving the Australian National Gallery the maximum opportunity to raise as much funding as possible from the private sector without damaging its capacity quite properly to seek funding from the public sector. In all other respects we totally support the amendments affecting three of the eight Acts now being amended, and my colleague Senator Newman will deal with other sections of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to part 4 of the Arts, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. Part 4 deals with the change in the size of the Australian Tourist Commission Board by an increase of one member. The Opposition does not, in fact, oppose this measure although we are critical of the Government that it should be necessary. We believe that the problem is not currently with the numbers who are on the Board, but with the composition and that, of course, lies within the Government's prerogative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his second reading speech the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) said:</PARA>
<PARA>Amendments . . . will allow for the addition of one extra member to the Board of Directors of the Australian Tourist Commission, which will make it possible for a more broadly-based representation of persons with relevant skills, experience and background to be on the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>There, in a nutshell, is an admission of failure by the Government that the appointments which it has made to the board have not provided that necessary broadly-based representation of persons with relevant skills, experience and background. If the Government does not have the people on the board that it needs, then whose fault is that? People do not self-nominate; people are appointed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we agree with the intent of the Minister. We do believe that that is exactly who should be on the board. We feel it is the Government's failure that the board does not currently have that representation. I do not wish to be offensive and to canvass individuals on this, but it is the appointments which have already been made and those which have been made in the past of people who have now left the board that we criticise. We do need a mixture of experience and new blood at regular intervals on the board. </PARA>
<PARA> We face, within a short period of time, changes to Qantas Airways Ltd which will make it yet another airline operating in the commercial sector. One would query whether Qantas, for example, has a God given right to permanent representation on the board. If other Australian airlines are interested in bringing tourists to this country and have expertise in the tourist industry, surely it should be envisaged that there could be a rotation of representation from the airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need people appointed to the board primarily because of their friendships in high places. We need commercial expertise and we need a proven track record in either the tourist industry or marketing. For example, we do not need a special environmental expert on the board. We question why the Government has seen fit to provide such a limited area of expertise as a permanent board position. Important though the cross-flow of information that may come from such a member may be to the board of the Australian Tourist Commission-and I acknowledge the impact of tourism on the environment, and the importance of the environment to tourism-it is surely unnecessary to provide special affirmative action, if you like, for the environmental community on the board of the Australian Tourist Commission. The Government can obtain the information that is needed for the board from its own resources, from its own environmental department. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a vital industry to our economy. I do not think there would be a member or senator in this Parliament who would not recognise its vital importance. It has never been more important than it is now. I and my family have been in the tourist industry for a number of years now. I suppose, therefore, we have a greater interest than many in how well this industry progresses, but it is not just a personal involvement that makes me concerned to see that this industry is well operated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely critical for our economy that our export income is increased and if ever there was an industry which gives us enormous potential for increasing our export income it is tourism. We are looking at something like $6.5 billion in income from tourism. It is the biggest hard currency earner that this country has. It employs half a million people now-and that makes it the biggest private sector employee-but it has enormous potential to increase employment in this industry and to increase export earnings for this country, yet the Government's investment is only $40m. </PARA>
<PARA> Forty million dollars is a large amount of money in the average person's calculation, but how much did we give to Kodak to keep it from leaving the electorate of Wills? When governments talk money, it is big money, and $40m for government tends to be but a spit in the bucket. </PARA>
<PARA> That $40m, I remind the Senate, must be placed in the context of an industry which is struggling to recover after probably one of the most devastating blows that any industry could have suffered. I refer, of course, to the airline dispute which decimated the tourist industry and which sent many entrepreneurs broke. It will be some years yet, I think, before we see the final wash-up of the effect on the tourist industry in Australia of that devastating strike. It has not only done long term damage to the individuals in the industry now, but also it has affected our reputation overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week on my return from the visit by the parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union, I stopped overnight in Singapore, and I was appalled to find how many people talked to me about our bad record in strikes. Taxi drivers would say, `It's not much use going out to meet Qantas when it is supposed to be scheduled.  You never know when they will get here because there will be strikes back home in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> We talked to people in the tourist industry, who said that people do not want to travel on to Australia; they do not like to think they will be marooned when they get here. And here we go with yet another fuel strike that is likely to affect the confidence in our industry, even if it does not directly affect the industry physically. The long term effects of our reputation of bad industrial relations has enormous ramifications for the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area in which I would like the Government to make a greater commitment concerns the opening of our airports to more carriers and more foreign flights; in other words, opening up our skies. We have but one service a week to Korea, yet I believe that we could multiply that six or seven times with the volume of business that is going backwards and forwards between the two countries, usually on somebody else's airline. There is the Soviet Union. There is an enormous opportunity to provide for direct Moscow to Australia flights. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the nonsense and the long delays in trying to negotiate deals with Taiwan; and Lauda Air in Vienna, a vigorous company, is trying to provide more direct flights to Australia. The airlines in those countries, if encouraged, if given an open skies treatment, would bring travellers to this country. It is in their interests as entrepreneurs to keep their aircraft filled and to sell Australia for us. If we were smart, if we were truly the clever country, that is the way we would be thinking, instead of engaging in these miserly, mean-spirited negotiations and the haggling that goes on year after year-`You give me a bit of this and I will give you a bit of that'. It is no way to expand an industry that is so important to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great impression in Europe that Australia is a long way away. People will travel from Europe as far as India. They might even get as far as Thailand or Singapore, but the extra distance on to Australia seems to make us geographically impossible. We have to be able to make it easy, quick, trouble-free and direct to get here. We have to improve our record in industrial relations so that people will feel that if they come this far they will be able to get home again; there will be reliable travel. It has to be easy so that they can come all the way with one airline, from wherever their home might be. If we opened up our skies these things would make it possible for foreign travellers to come here in greater numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, it is absolutely vital for our future as well as for the industry that we increase our visitor numbers to this country. It is clearly an industry of entrepreneurs, people willing to have a go, people of energy and vitality, and people often flying by the seat of their pants because their ideas are bigger than their capital and their bank balances. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole these are not people with their hands out looking for protection. They are pretty much vigorous independents who want less government regulation and less interference by government. But they do want to see first-rate people appointed to the Australian Tourist Commission. They want to have confidence that where government of any type is involved in the tourist industry it understands the ethos and the needs of the industry and has no passengers on government instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some good people on the Board of the Commission now, but what is needed is a board that is totally committed to the industry, packed with marketing skills and with proven expertise in business. There is no room for tokenism of any kind on the Board. If the Government had always in the past appointed people with the necessary backgrounds and skills there would not have been any need to expand the Board as we are being asked to do now. One additional position on this Board is not the answer, but the Opposition will not oppose the Government's amendment to the Australian Tourist Commission Act. </PARA>

I apologise to the Senate for not tabling it at the resumption of the second reading debate. I understand that it was anticipated by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been two speakers on this Bill, Senator Michael Baume and Senator Jocelyn Newman. On behalf of the Minister I congratulate and thank both of them for their participation in this debate. I do not propose to canvass the issues that they raised in speaking to this Bill other than very briefly to say that the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen, was mentioned in the contribution to the debate by Senator Michael Baume. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that there is journalistic reporting that Mr Lionel Bowen is attending art classes is being burlesqued in the public media as some sort of indication that he may not be the ideal choice, if indeed choice he be, for the Chairman of the Australian National Gallery. I think it is poor form to pick up on that and try to lampoon the appointment for those reasons. The fact that a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia chooses to do that is an indication of his dedication in the area, and it is in no way meant to be a comment on his knowledge and appreciation of art and his fitness for such an appointment. I think that if appointed he would be an excellent representative, having served this Government and this Parliament over many years. I think he would serve in great distinction. </PARA>
<PARA> The only comment I make on Senator Newman's speech, which contained many relevant points, points that I would support, concerns her reference to the damage inflicted on the tourist industry by the pilots dispute when she sought to draw some conclusions about the problems with industrial relations issues in that dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, no government welcomes a dispute of the dimensions of that one. It was unfortunate in all respects. The impact it had on the tourist industry was a measure of the arrogance of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in conducting a dispute in which they, as a highly skilled and highly qualified small technical elite, held up the whole of the airline system in Australia in order to get a 30 per cent wage increase and prosecuted that with a mass resignations campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the measures resorted to by the Government in that dispute were entirely appropriate to bring about the quickest cessation of it for the restoration of the tourist industry and normal air travel and traffic within Australia. On the basis of the allegation made, I simply say that the Australian Bureau of Statistics published on 2 October the latest figures on industrial disputation, which show, on a comparison of the 91 months to the end of June of the Hawke Administration to the 88 months of the Fraser Administration-almost the same durations of time-that industrial disputation under the Hawke Government is some 61 per cent less than that under the Fraser Government, which is an indication that the Labor Government handles industrial relations matters more proficiently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 proposes a number of important changes to the Child Care Act 1972, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. I will confine my remarks to the health related aspects of the Bill, whilst my colleague Senator Alston will address the proposed changes to the Child Care Act. Whilst not opposing this Bill, on behalf of the Opposition I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) calls on the Government to allow patients to insure against the `gap' which is the difference between the scheduled medical fee and the Medicare benefit;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) condemns the Government for providing automatic CPI increases to the maximum patient contribution which will remove the opportunity for public and parliamentary scrutiny and debate of these increases;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) calls on the Government to implement an education program on its minimum pricing policy and on the use of generic drugs;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) condemns the Government for abolishing Medicare cover for those medical expenses incurred by Australians while travelling overseas;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) condemns the Government for its attempt to usurp free market forces by establishing the Pharmaceutical Restructuring Authority to make recommendations on applications for new pharmacies, and on the amalgamation and closure of other pharmacies''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill seeks to widen the maximum gap between the Medicare benefit and the schedule fee from $20 to $26. This is an overnight jump of 30 per cent-not too harsh, some might say, considering there has been no increase since 1986, but in 1986 the gap widened from $10 to $20. So in less than five years we have seen a 160 per cent increase in the size of the gap. As usual, this indexation infatuated Government initially hits us with a hike that is many times the consumer price index (CPI) and then has the gall to legislate so that all further increases in the fee gap and the safety net will be indexed to inflation. The Government will benefit to the tune of $11m annually from this proposal. The taxpayer must bear the cost because this Government stubbornly denies it the right to insure against this ever widening gap. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will maintain the unfair situation whereby Australians have to pay a 1 1/4 per cent Medicare levy and, if patients want to avoid the long hospital queues and not be subjected to waiting for what is euphemistically called elective surgery, they have to insure themselves privately and also have to pay the gap. This was brought home to me only this year when I had a condition that, had I not had private health insurance, would have been considered elective surgery. I had to have a cartilage removed and I would have joined those hospital queues. Fortunately, I am one of the few people left who have private medical insurance but I had to pay for the gap. What will be the result of a continuation of this triple whammy to which many Australians are subjected? It will continue the acceleration of the flight from private health insurance schemes that has been going on since this Government has been in power and that will be coupled with the ever increasing hospital queues. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech in the other place, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) announced that the minimum pricing policy will commence on 1 December 1990. This policy is estimated to net the Government $16m in 1991 and $47m annually thereafter. Whilst recognising that this policy will result in significant cost benefits for the Government, I have my doubts whether the Minister has given sufficient thought to how this change will affect doctors, pharmacists and patients. Despite Minister Staples' promise that he would provide the shadow Minister, Dr Bob Woods, with lists of the present and planned education programs relating to the minimum pricing policy, I am informed by his office that to date these lists have not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, in my opinion, the Government has failed to demonstrate that it has any comprehensive plan for the implementation of this policy-a comprehensive plan that would educate doctors, allay the fears of patients, and minimise the financial costs borne by pharmacists. Within six weeks-I remind honourable senators that this is to be introduced within six weeks-the Government thinks it can educate the medical profession to prescribe cheaper alternatives in every case. Patients will have to be weaned off their familiar brand name drugs, which some have been taking for many years. Come 1 December, the beleaguered pharmacist will have to cope with yet another Government enforced change. </PARA>
<PARA> If this yet to be sighted Government education campaign fails to be 100 per cent effective, who will suffer? If in six weeks the Government cannot educate the doctors and cannot allay the fears of patients who will suffer? It will be either the patient, who has to pay the difference between the drug that has been prescribed by the doctor and the generic drug, or the pharmacist who must explain the system to the patient, get the prescription amended by the doctor and convince the patient of the efficacy of the unfamiliar drug. Here we have another task the pharmacist has to do. The patient who comes in, who has been used to getting a particular drug, is now not able to get it or has to pay the extra; or the pharmacist has to spend time explaining to the patient that he will have to ring the doctor and that the patient will have to deal with a new drug. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 103 of the National Health Act prevents pharmacists from substituting the cheaper generic drug. They must get the doctor's prior approval before dispensing the generic alternative. For various reasons, the doctor might not be available when the patient comes into the pharm- acy. The patient may come in after the doctor has left his surgery. This means that sick patients will be kept waiting until the doctor can return the pharmacist's call or the pharmacist can get in touch with the doctor. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether Minister Staples has a skerrick of pragmatism in his bones, having regard to the way he has introduced many of these changes to this and other community services and health Acts without thinking those changes through. In practical terms, this hastily implemented change has the potential to inflict mayhem in pharmacies, especially when two or more patients who have different doctors and who require changes to their prescriptions enter a pharmacy one after the other or at the same time. The pharmacist has to try to deal with a patient who is sick, and that is why the person is there. The patient either has to wait until the pharmacist gets approval from the doctor or the pharmacist will have to tell the patient to return at some later stage. Some pharmacists, in their generosity, have the drugs delivered, especially to elderly patients. This is of no benefit to the pharmacist, except that he is delivering a service. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, I believe it will be quite messy. For this thankless task, what is being bandied around? A $2 compensatory payment for the pharmacist who may in fact make two or three phone calls to the doctor, who has to spend time with the patient explaining the changes, and who may even end up, because he is concerned about the patient, delivering the drug to the patient, especially if the patient is old. As we all know, about 80 per cent of people who have pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) drugs are over 65. </PARA>
<PARA> This looks like another of this Minister's hastily conceived and poorly thought through policy initiatives. Not as hastily conceived but as poorly thought through is the Government's latest attempt to ostracise from Medicare those Australians who are temporarily overseas. Ever since the inception of Medicare in 1984, one has been able to claim for medical services whilst temporarily overseas. Honourable senators in this chamber will remember in 1988 the toing-and-froing of an amendment when the Government was thwarted in its attempt to try the very same thing. When it came back to the chamber, having gone from the Senate back to the House of Representatives and back to the Senate again, the Government said words to the effect, `The reason we are taking away the Medicare benefits of people overseas is because people are very confused about whether they are entitled to Medicare benefits when they are overseas. We will help them. This nanny government will help them by letting them know that they have no entitlements because we will take them away. If they do not know what their rights are, the easiest way to deal with that is to take those rights away'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what the Government plans to do in this Bill. It is doing exactly what it said then and is giving similar reasons: people are not aware of their entitlements so they should not be covered by Medicare at all. Many members of the general public who are travelling will find it most interesting that they are still required to pay 1 1/4 per cent of their salary by way of Medicare levy and will not get back any benefits. But this time the Minister did not give a very good explanation in his rushed second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The people to whom this Bill refers are those who are continuing to pay their taxes, including their Medicare levy, in Australia. They are being told that they cannot claim a rebate for medical expenses incurred while temporarily overseas. Who does this discriminate against? It discriminates against those whose work entails them being called overseas. It discriminates against those who are negotiating the all-important export contracts that are needed to save us from the Argentinean road. Let me give an example. Only last Saturday, I think, a group of 11 women from Western Australia called L'Entrepreneuse went to Indonesia to negotiate export deals for small businesses, particularly small businesses run by women. In future, if those women get sick in Indonesia they will not be entitled to any benefits. But the Government does not worry about them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill discriminates against those who carry the Australian flag overseas: our entertainers and our sports people, many of whom are young-especially our sports people-and living on the smell of an oil rag to achieve excellence and to represent our country. They will be denied Medicare benefits. They will pay their Medicare levy, but if they get sick while overseas they will not get any assistance from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also discriminates against academics. I mentioned in a speech when the issue was raised before that many academics borrow money to take study leave, to go overseas and get experience to bring back to Australia so they can contribute to research and teaching. Let me say that I have benefited on two occasions from study leave in the United States and, for a period, in Great Britain. Those people make enormous sacrifices, taking their families. If those people go overseas for 11 months they will pay $600 or $700 in Medicare levy, but they will get nothing in return, because the Government says that they are too stupid to know what entitlements they have. If they are in America they will have a bill as long as their arm. The Government says that it will help those people by taking away their Medicare benefits: they will be aware that because they do not have benefits they will take out private health insurance. I hope that the academics who have supported this Government realise how caring, how considerate, it is and how stupid it thinks the academics are for not knowing what their rights are. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also discriminates against humanitarian and voluntary workers, people in missionary organisations and those working for organisations such as Interserve, which I have had a lot to do with. Volunteer workers illustrate to the world the generosity and compassion possessed by the majority of Australians but, unfortunately, not by this Government. Those people working in some of the remote regions of the world will not be entitled to any Medicare benefits, despite the fact that they will be earning an Australian salary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that Medicare is a universal, comprehensive health insurance scheme. I tell you what, it is not universal for the people who will be travelling, as I said, representing Australia, working to get exports for Australia and learning in academic institutions and other organisations to bring back research and teaching skills. I hope the public realise what this Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The restricting of Medicare benefits or rebates to services provided in Australia will save the Government $5m annually. This is petty cash compared with the wastefulness that this Government condones in a myriad of other areas. This change is unfair and uncalled for. Not only do I urge the Government to reconsider but also I remind it of its obligation to outline the reasons behind its decision, which discriminates against the very people that Australia should be encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important part of this Bill is the setting up of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority which will make recommendations relating to the initial approval of pharmacies, the payment of essential pharmacy allowances, and the closure and amalgamation of pharmacies. In the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, the Government is admitting that its policy of over-regulation and constantly disrupting market forces in the pharmacy industry has driven pharmacists to the wall. By setting up this Authority, and at the same time virtually eradicating the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, this Government has achieved its objective of becoming the puppeteer of pharmacists from when they set up until when they sell up. </PARA>
<PARA> For over half a century, market forces have provided us with an efficient and viable pharmaceutical dispensing industry. The public only have to tell us that. We only have to find out where pharmacists are on the social acceptability scale and look where politicians are to find out just what pharmacists do in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that the intrusive tinkering of the Minister has nullified the effects of market forces, he is telling those pharmacists who have survived the battering that they must finance those who have been less fortunate or those who have been downright inefficient. It is a strange thing to have to do. If I were a pharmacist who had managed my business and had made a good choice about where to put my pharmacy, I could not understand having to subsidise those who were getting out of the pharmacy industry. Paying to do this? It is a bizarre concept. </PARA>
<PARA> This Authority will do precious little to improve the efficiency of the system. It will not mean the writing of fewer scripts overall. That problem has to be addressed in another area-medical education. When I look at the report of the Doherty Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce, I see that the Government has hardly addressed the many issues that arose there. In fact, when it introduced its vocational registration scheme, it went against the recommendations of the Doherty report. </PARA>
<PARA> The move that the Government is making with this Bill will be another impediment to the operation of a free market and it will hide inefficiencies from the scrutiny of market forces. It will not address the problems faced by isolated pharmacists who are unable to close or amalgamate and who will derive insufficient solace from an essential pharmacy allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation brings Big Brother into the pharmacy industry like never before. Any aspect of pharmacists' premises can be scrutinised before they set up shop. If the premises are not located where the Government desires, pharmaceutical benefits can be refused. Have honourable senators ever heard anything like it? Having done research into the matter, I may want to set up a pharmacy in a certain place, but if it is not where Big Brother thinks I should put it, my pharmaceutical benefits might be refused. Amalgamation, closure and the payment of essential pharmacy allowances will only apply to approved pharmacy premises. And who in essence is Big Brother? It is not the restructuring authority, but the Minister, who sets the guidelines, and the Secretary of the Department, who has the power to veto all the decisions of the authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite concern within the pharmacy industry about the Government-Pharmacy Guild agreement, the guidelines for this restructuring have virtually been set in concrete by the agreement. If clause 9 of the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill is passed, it is doubtful whether this Parliament will have any real say in relation to the contents of the guidelines. But I suppose that is not a problem for this Government, which would prefer Parliament to disappear so that nothing is scrutinised. </PARA>
<PARA> For one, I know that there is already concern that the redundancy package does not properly reflect the number of years a pharmacist may have put into his business before it is forced to close down. If the guidelines have already been rubber-stamped by the tribunal in accordance with clause 9, Parliament may have little power to properly scrutinise this and other aspects of the package. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the Government has extended the privacy provisions of the health insurance and national health Acts to those who knowingly disclose, solicit or receive personal information. However, I wish to make two points. First, it is pharmacists who will be affected most by these new provisions. The Government has an obligation to ensure that they are properly informed about them. Secondly, the Health Insurance Commission has a duty to make its own databases far more secure than they are at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may be interested to know that in the recent Senate Estimates hearings-and my colleague Senator Walters was present for those hearings-the Commission admitted that the present claims transmission system between pharmacists and the Commission was probably the easiest type of system to hack into. A pharmacist may transmit data to the Health Insurance Commission by computer via the telephone-indeed, it is planned to have a black box with a dedicated line-but next year all pharmacists will be expected to link up with the Commission through the claims transmission system. In a Freudian way, I kept calling it the compulsory transmission system. Now I know why I was giving it that title-next year it will indeed be a compulsory claims transmission system. The Senate Committee was told, with not a blush on the Minister's face, that it is the easiest system to hack into. Senator Coulter knows, and I know, that there are particular drugs prescribed for people who would be very embarrassed if the community or a local high school hacker knew about them. People would not want it to be known that they were being prescribed AZT or some sort of drug for a fungal infection, for example. Some people know enough about drugs to know the diseases for which they are prescribed, such as drugs used to treat genital herpes. That sort of stuff will be available if people hack into the system. Not only that, but no effective tracking systems are in place to trace the perpetrators of these crimes. There is no point in saying that something is illegal if there are no systems in place to prevent people from breaching the law and to catch them when the law is broken. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to honourable senators that it is an appalling state of affairs that the Health Insurance Commission and the Minister at the Estimates Committee hearings showed not one skerrick of embarrassment at the fact that this was the easiest system to hack into. Innocent people are having scripts filled for very confidential treatments, and any high school hacker is able to get into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is another example of hastily contrived, poorly thought through, short term fixes-in this case, short term fixes on pharmacists. We have seen similar examples in this chamber. Likewise, the changes to Medicare that I have outlined are not only uncaring and unnecessary, but demonstrate again that this Government is ill equipped to resurrect our failing health care system. The people who will be affected are those who travel overseas, people who are representing our country in industry, sport and academia. They will be the people who will get hurt when they find that they are not insured. They will pay the Medicare levy and receive no benefits. Honourable senators will know that earlier I moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading, and I give notice that at the committee stage I will move an amendment to subclause 31 (b). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, which, as Senator Patterson has already pointed out, seeks to amend several other pieces of legislation. I shall be addressing only those parts which relate to the medical aspects and Senator Lees will later be speaking to other aspects dealing with child welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth while reflecting on some of the history of the pharmaceutical aspects of the Bill-aspects to which Senator Patterson alluded, but which it is worth while dealing with in some detail. Senators will recall that over about 18 months there has been a great deal of consternation among pharmacists throughout the country because of the actions of this Government in seeking to impose on them for pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) drugs conditions of repayment which were totally unsatisfactory and would have led to the demise of many pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> During the time leading up to the last election many senators will recall going around the country and seeing a large number of pharmacy windows plastered with anti-Government and anti-Hawke statements in relation to the attempted imposition of a Remuneration Tribunal determination which would have contained no element of mark-up on drugs and in which the dispensing fee was quite inadequate. At that time we dealt with the Remuneration Tribunal's determination proposal, and I believe I pointed out-and it is worth repeating-that the Government seemed to be mixing two quite independent factors. The first was the factor of the increasing costs of the pharmaceutical benefits system and the other was the problem it perceived of having too many pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Patterson has rightly pointed out, the size of the PBS is determined by the number of prescriptions written and dispensed, and really has nothing whatever to do with the number of pharmacies. If there was only one pharmacy in Australia, if the same number of prescriptions were written and if that pharmacy dispensed all those prescriptions, the cost to the PBS would remain exactly the same. The number of pharmacies and the cost to the PBS do not relate sensibly to each other. In the legislation that we have before us there is still confusion between the increasing cost to the PBS and the number of pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak first to this element of the creation of a pharmacy structuring authority. The Government seeks to put in place an authority to make payments to those pharmacies that choose to amalgamate or to go out of business and reduce the number of pharmacies. As Senator Patterson has already pointed out, the parts in this legislation dealing with that aspect also relate to clause 9 of the pharmaceutical benefits legislation with which we will be dealing later. Clause 9 in that legislation seeks to set in place a mechanism by which, if the Guild or a body representing the majority of pharmacists agrees with the Government over a set of conditions, there is a possibility that that mechanism is frozen out for pharmacists who disagree with the Guild or pharmacists who are not members of the Guild and who are appearing before the tribunal. The mechanism which that agreement seeks to put in place relates to the closure of pharmacies and to the creation of this restructuring authority.</PARA>
<PARA> It seems passing strange that a Government which is committed to a deregulatory approach to industry in a general sense should in this particular case be seeking to very tightly regulate the pharmacy industry in an attempt to control the number of pharmacies. It is abundantly clear that the Democrats are not given to an unregulated free enterprise system. Nonetheless-I make this observation in passing-the Government seems to be given to a deregulatory approach. Yet, in this instance, where one has a free enterprise system which has been operating, the Government seems to be seeking to impose on that a system of control to close down a number of pharmacies and then to set up a restructuring authority on which the Guild will have representation in order to manage pay-outs and conditions of retirement of those pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> In a rather anomalous way, we support the sentiments of the words in subclause 5 of the second reading amendment which Senator Patterson is seeking to append to this legislation. We do this for quite different reasons to the Opposition, because it seems to sit rather peculiarly with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of this legislation which we are dealing with relates to the Medicare benefit gap. As Senator Patterson pointed out in her speech immediately before mine, the gap is increased from $20 to $26. That seems to be a very large increase in the gap over a very short time. However, the idea that this gap should then be indexed seems quite a good idea. If we index that to the consumer price index, we find some difficulty with clause 2 of the Opposition's second reading amendment in which Senator Patterson seeks to condemn the Government for providing automatic consumer price index (CPI) indexation. She has been critical of the increases occurring so far and yet she objects to the gap being indexed to the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with the other aspects of this legislation, in particular the aspect which relates to the inability of those who are overseas to claim Medicare benefits, it has been explained to me by government officers as a device, not so much to deny Australians who go overseas the amounts to which they would be entitled were they still in Australia, but to make them well aware that in many countries-to take two examples, the United States and Japan-medical costs are extremely high. Those people may well go overseas with a false sense of security thinking that they were covered by Medi- care but finding that if they had a need for hospitalisation in either of those countries the Medicare repayments would be very meagre. </PARA>
<PARA> I can see Senator Patterson's point that while people are continuing to pay the Medicare levy they should be entitled in fairness to whatever amount they are entitled to under the levy. If even a few Australians are caught in countries such as America or Japan with very large medical bills and very small recompense from Medicare, because they believed that they were more extensively covered, it may well be safer to remove that and to run an education program such as the Government intends to run. Senator Patterson, in subclause 3 of her attachment, has alluded to running a more extensive education program to explain to the people who go overseas that they are not covered and that it is absolutely necessary that they take out private cover. That cover would be related to the countries they were visiting; in those countries with very high medical costs, the costs of the cover would be correspondingly high. At least under those circumstances those people would have adequate cover. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a certain ambivalence in that aspect of this legislation. There are arguments of a justice type which would support the position taken by Senator Patterson, and presumably by the Opposition, and there are arguments in terms of clarity and of attempting to ensure that patients, who become ill in high medical cost countries, are adequately covered. It is difficult to make a judgment between those two approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> The other clauses which Senator Patterson has sought to place in her second reading amendment relate to subclause 1 in which Senator Patterson is calling on the Government to allow patients to insure against the gap-the difference between the scheduled fee and the medical benefit. In the past the Government has sought to maintain this gap for two reasons. One was quite strongly supported by some sections of the Opposition, and that is, to make patients aware of the costs of medical treatment and to place--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and to place some inhibition in the way of overuse of the system. Again I find it passing strange that it is now the Opposition which seeks to remove that impediment. Bearing in mind-I think this was also in the Government's mind-if we allow insurance to go into that gap, at once we remove that awareness of the cost and we also immediately give an advantage to those who are better able to insure themselves against that gap. The imposition of a rule which prevents people from insuring against that gap puts everybody on exactly the same level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another motive in the Government's mind is that as much as it possibly can it is attempting to get doctors to charge the schedule fee and to bulk bill. That may well be an argument which was not raised by Senator Patterson but with which she might have some complaint. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance, and bearing in mind that the second reading amendment to be moved by Senator Patterson will not have force in law, I think I would probably support it because I think there are several items in it which are useful in bringing home to the Government the inconsistency of its approach between deregulation in some parts of industry and strong regulation in the pharmacy industry. The very good paragraph (3) calls on the Government to increase its education program; paragraph (1) relates to the allowance, in this instance, of gap insurance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 before the Senate deals with three separate Acts-the Child Care Act, the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act. I will deal with them one at a time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Child Care Act is aimed at subsidising all those parents who are at present being forced into the work force by the Government's high interest rates and the resulting low living standards. A survey used by the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that 53.3 per cent of women with preschool children have been forced to take a second family job to save their home and to make ends meet. Only 17.3 per cent of those women work because they enjoy it. It is no wonder when we get an article in the Sydney Morning Herald with the headline `Hawke era ``worst since WWI'' '. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Living standards of Australian wage earners have fallen further during the period of the Hawke Government than in any other decade since World War I, according to a new study. </PARA>
<PARA> The study, conducted by the dean of economics at Murdoch University in Perth, Professor Keith Norris, found that the fall between 1982 and 1988 varied for average income earners between 2.2 per cent (for single adult female) and 10.2 per cent (for a household with two children on average male earnings). </PARA>
<PARA>When we have that situation there is a need for child-care places. Because women have been forced into the work force by this Government's policies amendments to the Child Care Act have been seen as necessary. Quite frankly, due to this Government's policies and the increase in demand there are just not enough child-care places. Till now government assistance to child-care centres has been limited to those run by so-called eligible organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will allow government assistance in the form of fee relief to be provided for eligible child-care centres operated on a commercial basis by commercial organisations, be they private or government operated. Other financial assistance, such as recurrent grants, et cetera, will be available only to non-profit organisations as they are at present and local government authorities. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA> My main area of concern is what is meant by proposed new section 4C. I would like to read it because it is of great concern to me. Proposed new section 4C. (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may make guidelines, not inconsistent with this Act, with respect to the exercise of any of the Minister's powers under section 4B. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed new section 4B. sets out who will get the money. Proposed new section 4C. (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> A guideline is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>It sounds innocuous enough, but what on earth will these guidelines contain? There has been a report to the Government. That report recommends that there should be an accreditation system for child-care centres. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spoke about this at the time of the election. Does proposed new section 4C mean that the commercial centres that pass this accreditation will get funding under this fee relief for their clients, and only those centres which have the accreditation system?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the need for an accreditation system. The principle of an accreditation system is motherhood stuff. Accreditation would set certain standards that child-care centres would have to abide by. We all agree that the best possible standards for our children are necessary at an affordable rate. I would like to stress that. However, presently the responsibility for these standards is at State government level. All those State governments jealously guard these responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> If on top of these State government standards the Federal Government inflicts its own requirements, then we will be falling into that age-old trap of double banking and all the associated costs that incurs. I believe that we should leave the standards to the States, where they rightly belong. I will just give one example of States sending round their inspectors to make sure that the child-care centres are abiding by their standards, and the Commonwealth sending round its inspectors to make sure that its standards are abided by-a field day for bureaucrats and a tremendous additional cost to the Government and, therefore, to the taxpayer. I believe that we should keep these sorts of double banking costs to a minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> Let the Commonwealth look at the standards of all the States. If it believes that any State is below par, let the Ministers get together and thrash it out. I believe that is the way it should be done. Additional costs should not be imposed by sending out inspectors one on top of the other. We have that in other legislation, and nursing home care is a typical example. </PARA>
<PARA> If section 4C does mean accreditation, why is the Government not coming clean and saying so instead of just referring to standards? Why are we asked to pass legislation which refers vaguely to guidelines? What is this disallowable instrument that could stop certain child-care centres getting fee relief for their clients? This is one of the many questions I will be putting to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) when he comes before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. As I say, this is one of the benefits of the new committee system that the Senate is working under. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the amendments to the Health Insurance Act. The Government has increased the maximum contribution the patient pays. The gap between the schedule fee and the Medicare benefit was $20 and will be increased to $26 from 1 January 1991. It will also be indexed. Again, that safety net has been treated in the same way. This is another area of the Medicare benefit being increased. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now move to the restructuring of the pharmaceutical industry in the Health Insurance Act. This Bill introduces a system that has been agreed upon by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to set up a pharmacy restructuring authority. The Government believes that there are far too many chemist shops in many areas of Australia and it is prepared to give those pharmacists who no longer want to carry on with their pharmacies or who are not viable a subsidy to close down. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the subsidy which the Government has offered. This buy-out is based on the number of years of ownership. I believe that the buy-out is something that we must look at very closely. If one has owned a pharmacy for up to three years the buy-out is $45,000; between four and five years it is $50,000; between six and seven years it is $55,000; between eight and nine years it is $60,000; between 10 and 11 years it is $65,000; between 12 and 13 years it is $70,000; between 14 and 15 years it is $75,000; and between 16 years and over it is $80,000. The Government is going to pay half of these amounts. </PARA>
<PARA> A pharmacy which has been running for 16 years and over will be paid $80,000 of which the Australian taxpayer will pay half. The pharmacists throughout Australia pay the other half. In the first year pharmacists will be charged a levy of 1c per prescription. In the second year they will be charged 2c, in the third year 3c, in the fourth year 4c and so on until the debt is paid. </PARA>
<PARA> To what extent should country pharmacists who have been very viable and looked after themselves be responsible for funding the closure of pharmacies in the suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney? It is quite beyond belief that this arrangement should have been agreed to. But this is the agreement that the Guild and the Government have come to. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no intention of allowing market forces to work. The Government will just say who the pharmacists are and pay them for closing down. On the other side of the coin, any pharmacist who wants to open up in an area will have to register with the new authority before he can sell pharmaceutical benefit drugs which attract a patient subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the independence of this authority. It is pretty important that we know who are making these decisions. According to the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA> The membership of the Authority will be made up of Government and industry nominees with an independent Chairperson, all appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will make its recommendations in accordance with criteria determined by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The Pharmacy Guild will be able to suggest four nominations. The Government will take its pick and two of those nominees will be appointed. The restructuring authority will be made up of government members and industry nominees. The Government will appoint the lot. It will appoint the chairman, it will choose two members from the four nominations put up by the Guild and, of course, it will appoint its own officers. That is how independent that authority will be. It will be interesting to see just what occurs as a result of that so called independence. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the National Health Act prevents the release of data on pharmaceutical benefits scheme products held by the Department of Community Services and Health where a product category attracts fewer than three suppliers. This has been done in the past so that data cannot lead to the identification of a manufacturer. The Government is doing away with this secrecy provision. It is allowing data to be made public if fewer than three manufacturers are involved. As a result, very confidential information will be made available. I believe that that is totally wrong. It is something about which the Opposition will be moving an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate is something that I could not even find in the outline of explanatory memorandum. I refer to a matter relating to clause 17 about which Senator Patterson spoke at great length-that is, the Government's decision that people who go overseas for a length of time are not entitled to Medicare cover. People in this category pay their taxes in Australia. They pay their Medicare levy. Academics who go overseas for 12 months, or perhaps for even a shorter period, are not entitled to Medicare cover. Although these people pay their taxes, they are not entitled to Medicare cover if they happen to be overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has told us that it is making this change to clarify the situation. The Government says that people who go overseas are not aware that they are entitled to Medicare cover. Because of this, the Government says that it is going to scrub the Medicare cover that these people receive when they are in Australia. The Government is not going to stop the payment of their Medicare levy. Oh, no-that goes straight into the Government coffers. But it is stopping them getting any benefit from the Medicare levy that they pay while they are overseas. There is absolutely no justification for that at all.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has tried to hide its intention in this respect by not mentioning it in any of the literature that it has put out. This provision is tucked away in clause 17 of the Bill. If the Government is desperately trying to prop up Medicare because it is going broke and sending the country broke, it has to look at other means of doing so than shonky ones such as that. As Senator Patterson has already indicated, the Opposition will be supporting the general thrust of the legislation. Senator Patterson has already moved an amendment, which I support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a number of points in supporting the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. I hope to refute some of the claims that have been made by Opposition senators who have spoken during the debate on this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I read a community services and health legislation amendment Bill that amends the Child Care Act 1972, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 I have to sympathise with the community which has to try to understand exactly what is happening. While I can see the rationality for the legislation and why the Government has introduced it-and members of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills have made this point from time to time-I think this practice adds confusion to an understanding of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the way that legislation proceeds in this place, it is understandable that an attempt is made to group together matters in the one portfolio area or matters that relate to each other, even if they occur under different Acts within that one portfolio. But this does make it difficult for the community. I sincerely hope that people are aware of the very significant changes encompassed in this amending Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular-it would be no surprise to my colleagues opposite-I wish to make some comments about the child-care changes under this legislation. Honourable senators opposite would certainly know of my continuing interest in child-care and of my real pleasure in being able to support the proposed changes to the Child Care Act contained in this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Faulkner for that comment. I accept that. I also accept this Government's truly great contribution to child-care. When the Government came to office there were only 46,000 funded child-care places in the country; there are now 122,000. The numbers have nearly tripled. When the Government came into office there were no systematic means of fee relief to support affordable child-care. It is interesting to note that from 1 October this year, at best guess, an estimated 90,000 families using non-profit community based centres will benefit from the more generous targeted fee relief system. It is estimated that a further 35,000 families will enjoy those benefits come 1 January next year, when they will be using commercial centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commitment to child-care in this legislation incorporates the needs-based planning for 80,000 new child-care places in the community based centres. We have continuing government commitment by its extending the number of community child-care places, by its increasing and extending fee relief into the non-profit and commercial child-care centres, and by its providing affordability and accessibility to many more places. Clearly the demand in the community is huge. The Government has implemented these mechanisms to try to extend the child-care so as to best meet the demands and the needs of men and women in the community who clearly indicate that they want to use it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is committed to making child-care affordable and accessible, with principles of equity and standards of quality. There is no point in providing child-care with no regard to quality. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly take issue with Senator Walters's points about the setting of standards and accreditation. In times past she and I have crossed swords about how we split words, and no doubt we will do it again. Those of us who are old enough-I will put Senator Walters and me in that category-can remember when child-care in this country was an absolute disgrace. Many people raised concerns about child-care because they had the opportunity to visit and see for themselves some very insufficient provisions of child-care that were available in various communities. That is one of the reasons that publicly funded community based child-care was instituted. It has set the standards and it continues to maintain the standards of what is regarded as optimal child-care; that is, affordable child-care that, at the same time, has quality. We do not want to revert to times when children were drugged and kept asleep all day in some kind of sleeping arrangement so that the one or two people caring for them could cope with up to 30 children or more, as we can remember from years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We also know that the standards in a child-care centre need to be given very serious consideration. We have heard it said, and we have certainly seen it quoted, that any caring person-indeed, some people would say even a 15-year-old girl; although sometimes a boy-is able to look after children. Most of us would appreciate that nobody would settle for insufficient or woofy guidelines requiring only `a caring person', particularly for all-day care or for child minding or baby sitting in the evenings. Indeed, I do not think anybody in this chamber would support the notion that child-care could be adequately undertaken by a 15-year-old. We need to look at standards. We need to look at the accreditation process so that those minimal standards of acceptable childcare are either instituted or maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters claimed that we would be adding a second tier of bureaucrats and that Commonwealth inspectors would be traipsing around from child-care centre to child-care centre, hot on the heels of the State inspectors. Good stuff, but entirely unsubstantiated, and certainly not the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to tackle this issue in cooperation with the State and local governments. I do not have any understanding that the Commonwealth Government intends to take over what is properly and reasonably the responsibility of State governments. Standards of child-care currently differ from State to State. It is not unreasonable to look at making sure the standards-when we use the expression `minimal standards'-are sufficient and fairly equal. We need to offer to the citizens that kind of guarantee. If, in talking to the States, we can come up with an agreed set of minimum standards and an agreed way that that inspection or accreditation process will be optimally carried out, I am quite sure that Senator Walters will find that that is the way it will happen. Commonwealth inspectors will not be traipsing around after State inspectors. Certainly this Government, in this legislation, is looking to cost constraint. It will not be implementing a crazy, extravagant process of that sort. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that in her heart, Senator Walters would have agreed that some kind of minimum standards for child-care are necessary. Certainly I would argue it very strongly. The challenge for all Government senators-particularly me-over the last year or so has been to grapple with a change in Party policy to allow the extension of public dollars to the private sector in child-care. It seemed to us, as a matter of equity, that people should not be denied access to child-care places in the private sector because of cost. We certainly saw that, if as a matter of equity, fee relief could be reasonably extended to people using private childcare centres, then as a quid pro quo or a trade-off, we would say that we wanted the sorts of minimum standards in those private child-care centres that occurred in the commercial child-care centres. I am glad that Senator Patterson smiles; I take that smile to be an assent to that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson does not wish me to interpret her smile; I stand corrected. The community has not yet properly become aware of just how extensive and useful the extension of fee relief to the commercial and non-profit community based centres will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only have we extended the fee relief to people using private and not-for-profit child-care community centres, but also we have increased the level of income at which fee relief cuts out. Previously, fee relief cut out at about $35,000. I cannot give an accurate figure on that, but it was around $35,000 or $36,000 for one child. That ceiling has now been extended to $56,200 for one child and $68,600 for two children or more. They are the levels at which fee relief cuts out entirely. Many people currently using the government child-care centres will find that they are eligible for extensive fee relief. In other words, the cost to users of child-care will drop considerably for people within this family income range. </PARA>
<PARA> In a number of ways-by extending its commitment to the number of community based child-care centres, by extending fee relief to the non-profit child-care centres and to the commercial or private child-care centres, and by increasing the family income up to which users are eligible for fee relief-this Government has made absolutely beyond any doubt its commitment to affordable child-care of adequate standard. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe there is any dispute with the thrust of Government policy. More importantly, not only can we say that there is no dispute, but there is a very clear statement by Government in this piece of legislation of its commitment to child-care and to those people in the community who, for whatever reason, decide they would like to use it. I am really very delighted to be able to stand in this Senate tonight and speak on behalf of the child-care changes coming into law, I hope, very soon under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other points on which I would like to take issue with Senator Walters is her-I expect, entirely predictable-whack at Medicare as she was concluding her remarks. If I remember, she said that it is Medicare that is dragging this country into massive debt. That is a fair claim for our health system, being, as it is, something like 7.9 per cent of gross national product! If it is all happening in that 8 per cent of expenditure, that is doing very well indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the heavy irony of my remarks makes it clear that I do not accept one line or one word of Senator Walters's claim. Medicare is not an outrageous cost to the community. The challenge for the Government has been, with the introduction of Medicare, to maintain that balance between the delivery of an adequate quality health service and at the same time to set some kind of ceiling, for cost restraint reasons, against the delivery of health care. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody reading in this area would know that that debate is alive and very well in the community at the moment. Also, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) is indicating that his Medicare inquiry would appreciate that they are some of the dimensions he wants to be looked at, that is, the balance of quality health care and matters of proper cost constraint. I do not understand that the Minister has ever indicated any dissatisfaction with Medicare. Indeed, he is on the record as strongly endorsing it, and I would like to put my support of those remarks, too. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not Medicare but the many complexities of the health care system we have in this country that are pushing at costs. It is properly the responsibility of government to try to manage that balance between the demands for health care, the demands for hospitalisation, the demands for new hi-tech innovative systems of treatment and methodologies of management of health care and at the same time to properly put some kind of ceiling on the cost to the taxpayers of this country of that health care. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments made by, I think, Senator Patterson and Senator Walters in objection to the restriction of Medicare payments to people travelling overseas need to be qualified. First, let me say that any person travelling overseas to a reciprocal health care country--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Patterson" NAMEID="LI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator Patterson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many are there?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, that is a very good question, and I can tell the honourable senator. Of the something like two million travellers that leave this country's shores each year, about 600,000 go to reciprocal health care countries. That is quite a large chunk of people whose Medicare payments will cover them entirely for the health costs they would enjoy-if not have to accept-in a reciprocal health care country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those reciprocal health care countries include the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Malta, Sweden and Italy. The Government is currently in the process-indeed, well advanced in the process-of negotiations for arrangements to include the Netherlands in a reciprocal health arrangement. Denmark and Hungary are also in the process, but at an earlier stage, I believe, of negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to say that I was able to discover that any Commonwealth public servants who are required, as part of their work, to live overseas are having their health care provided for by special arrangements through their departments; that is, instead of Medicare making the payments against costs that those public servants might have, the department for which they work will be picking up that cost. Anybody from the Public Service working overseas for a long time also needs to be added to that number of 600,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point-and I can appreciate why Senator Patterson would want to argue the way she has-is that it is also true that people leaving this country may have a false sense of security in the understanding that Medicare will cover their costs overseas. Indeed, it does not. I would endorse the remarks made by Senator Coulter that there could be a false sense of security, particularly for people travel- ling to a country with which we do not have reciprocal health care arrangements and which has very expensive health care. In particular, I endorse the countries named by Senator Coulter-America and Japan-both countries likely to be visited by a number of people leaving this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If one gets a very significant bill for health care-and one certainly would not like to consider the hospital costs that one might get from a hospital stay in America-Medicare does not cover that and, certainly, the return under Medicare for visits to the doctor would be but a fraction of an average cost of a visit to a doctor in those expensive health care countries. In providing this kind of re-arrangement and in urging travellers to appreciate that their health costs are their own while they are out of the country, I think the Government will be assisting to protect people to make sure they do not find themselves saddled with extraordinary health liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish by making some points about the claims by the Opposition that it was pretty outrageous to extend the gap from $20 to $26. `This is a very rapid increase in no time at all', I think Senator Coulter said, but he failed to tell the Senate that that $20 figure was put in place in 1986 and has not increased since then. I suppose that, if one compares today with yesterday, that is a short time space, but if one compares 1990 with 1986 one would have to say that a $6 increase-even to over $20-over four years is not as outrageous as Senator Coulter might lead us to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, though, I endorse his points made in defence of not allowing insurance to cover the gap. The Opposition quite often in this place has argued strenuously that, if people were able to enjoy what they could call a co-payment or a patient contribution, that would focus their minds on what health care costs and would encourage them not to contribute to overuse of the system. I do not believe the Opposition can argue that way and then say, `Yes, but we will fix it up by allowing people to insure against the gap'. That is a very contradictory argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that Senator Patterson is not alone in presenting it. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) is very hot in adding that little contradiction from time to time, too. The advantage of having been thinking about health for a long time is that I have been at meetings-in 1982, I can particularly remember-where the AMA was amongst those who agreed that a gap of 25 per cent was reasonable. That would be the assessment, it said, of administrative costs in a general practice and it would not be unreasonable to have a 75 per cent return. The AMA conveniently forgets to remind people that it was in agreement with those figures at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is perfectly within its rights for the AMA to change its argument as it goes along, but I think the AMA and the Opposition are in a log jam if they want to argue that some kind of constraint on the use of services will be put in place by allowing patients the opportunity to pay a gap but then to go around the corner and completely insure against the cost of it. The only thing that that will do is increase the price of private insurance and negate the effect of there being a co-payment. In particular, it will do nothing to constrain the costs of expenditure on health. Senator Walters wants to say that Medicare is blowing out, but she does not seem to want to oppose this little measure from the Opposition that will exactly and directly increase the push on costs and expenditure in the health area. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot let that kind of contradictory argument go without putting some comment in objection to it. It is the logic of it, in particular, that is offensive: we can have one thing and we cannot have another thing, but that is all right. That is not on, and I would urge Senator Patterson to rethink that part of her contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much more that could be said about this package of legislation. As I started, so I would like to conclude. It is of great satisfaction to me to be standing in this Senate supporting this new extension of child-care and fee relief so that many more Australians who indicate that they want child-care will find it not only more available and more accessible but also more affordable. On behalf of those who have been lobbying for that, I am very pleased to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only to that part of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill which deals with the Child Care Act 1972. I begin my remarks by stressing that the Australian Democrats have always had and will continue to have a very strong commitment to the publicly funded child-care system. While we certainly acknowledge that the Government has done a considerable amount in this area, we are concerned that the extension of fee relief may lead down the track to a lack of interest in and lack of support for the publicly funded system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has assured us that this measure will not take financial support away from the community based centres but instead is allocating additional funds, and, of course, this is the case. It is true that this move does not take any money at all from public centres, but we believe that it must ultimately have some impact on the level of funds available for the non-profit sector. After all, it will cost the Government, on its figures, some $28m this financial year, and this is likely to increase to $100m by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA> I just wish to put our concerns on the record now. Once the size of the cake is stabilised-indeed, it may decrease in the future-the pressure will be on the most expensive option. If people are cost cutting, they will cut into the public sector. After all, the measure that we have before us tonight creates a cheaper option. These places will be a lot less expensive for the Government to fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation fee relief for child-care is extended to commercial child-care centres. Certainly, this move will go quite a long way towards addressing a real and growing problem, and that is that many parents face long and difficult waiting lists to place their children in community based centres. The result has been that many parents are forced to place their children in quite unsatisfactory care arrangements-backyard services and in some cases with individuals who do not have the best interests of children at heart. They may in some instances have been forced to travel a considerable distance from their home and from their workplace in order to take the odd place that came up in a community centre. </PARA>
<PARA> For some this has meant having to rely on friends and relatives. While this is often not a problem, particularly with elderly relatives, the long term care of very young children can be a considerable burden. For a significant number of women and, I believe, a growing number of men, the difficulties have meant that they have at best been able to re-enter the work force on a part time or temporary basis, and many have been unable to move into the work force at all-and I stress in particular the needs of single parents. </PARA>
<PARA> However, despite the reservations I have mentioned, I commend the Government on broadening the definition of child-care centres and on the proposed changes in the fringe benefits tax legislation, which will mean that employer provided facilities are now encouraged. I hope that we will see a very rapid rise in the number of work based child-care centres. At present these centres are not widespread. However, I hope that, as this legislation provides some incentive, as more become available and as employers begin to realise the financial benefits of work based child-care, these services will rapidly spread. </PARA>
<PARA> I pause to mention one concern that has been brought to our attention. I just sound a warning that there is already evidence in Melbourne of commercial interests obtaining community based child-care places to establish work based programs. One instance occurred because a community based centre was forced physically to relocate, but there are other instances where commercial interests and businesses have been moving around the community centres attempting to find vacant places-places which have in some instances occurred because parents can no longer meet the gap between what they are refunded and what it costs the commercial centres to operate and therefore what they have to charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, while we applaud the move to the work based centres, we stress that the Government must ensure that these centres are not established at the expense of community based places. They must, in fact, provide additional places. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill means that, in effect, a privately operated centre can claim fee relief if the Minister for Community Services and Health determines that it is eligible for that purpose. Private centres will continue to be ineligible for capital or operational subsidies. We have some concerns along the lines expressed by some members of the Opposition as to exactly what the guidelines will involve. The Minister is empowered to make these guidelines, to be used in determining whether a commercial centre is eligible for fee relief. It is of some concern to us that we are simply not able to comment on these because we have not seen them to this point and we do not have them before us as we debate this legislation tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate, however, that any guidelines formulated by the Minister under these new provisions will be a disallow- able instrument but, because of their potential significance and their link to the provision of fee relief, I believe that it would have been preferable if we could have had at least some real indication in writing before discussing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are of the view that the extension of fee relief must be accompanied by a commitment on the part of the Government to a set of national standards, and we will not be supporting any moves to omit or overlook this aspect. It has already been stated that many State regulations set out very clearly what a child-care centre needs to have before it is able to be licensed. However, previous experience at trying to regulate from State to State is enough to ring some alarm bells as to how long it would take to move from State to State and to get a real guarantee of uniform standards across all States. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we believe that national guidelines can and should be linked in some way to the funds that are being made available by the Government. I am not in any way suggesting that the Government should duplicate existing State licensing requirements. Currently State regulations relate primarily to input, particularly to physical requirements, building codes, record keeping, health and hygiene requirements, insurance obligations, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> We see that the Commonwealth's role in establishing national guidelines should be focused more on developing a set of quality of care standards for centres. These issues are certainly not addressed by all States and frequently not addressed at all for State licensing regulations. We would see these guidelines as involving such matters as policy consistency, the fact that affordability must be ensured with the fee relief and that there should be no rise in the cost to parents-in other words, no inflation in prices-and the need for priority of access to the service for low income families, particularly those most in need of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> Any national accreditation scheme will need to go a long way beyond just the physical standards set out in most State regulations, as I said earlier. We believe that the national standards must involve outcomes: the benefits to the children; how they will benefit from their time in child-care. It is of considerable concern to us that some should suggest that these national guidelines are not necessary. I particularly make note of the length of time that some children spend each day in child-care. It is no longer just a brief couple of hours to give mum respite while she does some shopping. As Senator Walters pointed out, a vast number of working women now rely on child-care and children are in child-care centres for eight or nine hours a day. Therefore, I think it is essential that we keep track of how they are treated and the types of programs and stimulating activities they are offered. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has now been part of the consultative process. It has been apparently a very involved period of discussions in looking at accreditation. I believe that the industry generally recognises that there are some operators whose standards need to be questioned. The industry itself generally recognises and accepts the desirability of an accreditation program. I understand from information received just yesterday that the Committee is in fact looking at a self-support model rather than at a system whereby there is external monitoring from some government department. I certainly look forward to seeing the draft proposals, and I hope that the close consultation with the industry and those involved will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we all recognise the importance of child-care to Australian families, and therefore the desirability of ensuring that not only is the quality of child-care adequate but also that it is affordable. I think in many ways the debate comes down to the priorities that ought to be accorded to those two desirable goals. Therefore, I think the Government has belatedly recognised-albeit in an election context-that it is indeed desirable that if we are to accord fee relief it should be across the board and at least be extended to the private sector in the way that the Government is proposing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The non-commercial sector still gets very significant assistance that is denied to the private sector by way of exemptions from sales tax, capital grants, recurrent grants, establishment grants and the like. But we certainly support the principle of the extension of fee relief to the private sector. We are very conscious of the fact that the Government had to be dragged screaming and yelling to the barrier on this issue. It was in the face of trenchant opposition from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) over a period of years, and indeed from the Department of Community Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is very much an undercurrent or hidden agenda in a lot of the debate that goes on in this area. Nonetheless, the Government finally, in desperation at the thought that it might lose the last election, did a Faustian deal with the ACTU, which involved allowing the ACTU going quiet on the extension but in return getting a promise that a national accreditation system would be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the most serious concerns about that concept, because the starting point ought surely to be that one does not need a national system-which the Government chooses to describe as complementary but which we would describe as a classic case of duplication-unless one is able to demonstrate that the State system is not working effectively. There will always be variations in quality, and I do not think that the Australian Democrats would pretend for a moment that even if one had the most exhaustive and expensive system of quality control one could somehow guarantee that all child-care centres are going to measure up to the same uniform standards, or indeed provide the same uniform outcomes. It is a nonsense proposition and I am sure very few would try to defend it. </PARA>
<PARA> But that, of course, has not stopped people aspiring to what I think is a quite unrealistic goal. It is in that context that I think we need to understand why this whole accreditation system is being put in place, because it seems clear to me that one cannot expect to set out standards in terms of quality, and then expect to deliver certain outcomes. The most one can do is to ensure that there are not abuses in the system and that people are very much aware of what they are getting for their money. That means putting the onus on the parents. There is nothing particularly heinous about that or indeed, I would not have thought, controversial. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary in this area that one actually gets child-care specialists saying such things as, `Child-care is too important to be left to parents'. Senator Walsh, in an excellent article recently, quoted from another such hysterical statement. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Talkback radio reflects the view that anyone who is nice and motherly can look after children. This is a fallacy. </PARA>
<PARA>That view does permeate the industry and indeed I think it also permeates the bureaucracy at a number of levels. So, one has this extraordinary notion that somehow we cannot trust parents to look after their children as though parents are indifferent. What we have to do is bring in some bureaucrats to make sure it all happens for them, and in the process create whole new career structures and indeed inevitably add very significantly to the cost of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have much doubt that this debate at the present time is being driven by those sorts of considerations in reality, even if they are not confessed too openly, and that is a matter of great concern to us. We do not see the need for an accreditation system, and nor have we been made aware of any significant deficiencies in the State system. Each State has an exhaustive set of regulations-I have not bothered to bring in the wad of material which would demonstrate that-but there is no doubt at all that there is another easy doctorate of philosophy to be gained by doing an assessment of the comparative requirements of State and Territory regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> If there are some problems-and they cannot be significant or else we would have heard about them-then it is a very simple matter for the relevant Federal Minister to convene a meeting of State colleagues to consider the matter at a ministerial council. That could be done, and no doubt the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), will go through those motions at some later time. But it certainly should not be used as an excuse for somehow justifying this whole new system that the Government wants to put in place. I suppose what makes one most suspicious of all about this is that the Act itself says absolutely nothing about accreditation, and it says only the vaguest things about guidelines. If one looks at the principal Act, it actually provides for fee relief to the non-commercial sector to be granted in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> But yet, when we come to this Act, we find that the Minister may make guidelines not inconsistent with this Act with respect to the exercise of any of the Minister's powers. That is in relation both to fee relief and to capital and recurrent grants. What that means is that the Minister is absolutely at large. In other words, he can proclaim any guidelines he likes on any topic that he likes and he can then totally ignore them if he wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that an extraordinary and preposterous proposition. It fortifies the concern that we have that the second reading speech makes absolutely no mention of any accreditation system. The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill itself makes absolutely no mention of any accreditation system, and yet we know that it is all going on behind the scenes. It has been exhaustively documented, and I think Senator Lees made mention of the final meeting of this mickey mouse outfit called the Committee of Child-Care Industry Representatives on a National Accreditation System for Child-Care Services. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever one has seen a loaded gathering, it is that one; it has as a very clear minority a couple of almost token representatives of the private sector and it is totally dominated by people who have a very serious antipathy towards the concept of extending fee relief to the private sector, let alone wanting it to blossom. Their whole aim is to restrict it as much as possible. I give the Senate one example of the sort of thinking that tends to dominate in these areas, and to show that the cost of services and the choice of parents is absolutely the last agenda item. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Association of Children's Services wrote, I think, to quite a number of members and senators seeking support for an accreditation system. It starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The position of our Association is that `accreditation is essentially a process of quality control and quality improvement'. </PARA>
<PARA>No mention at all of the cost; it is simply a matter of keeping tight control over the system and then raising the standards. In themselves I suppose they are laudable aspirations, and indeed in one sense we would hope that over time all of society improves in terms of quality, but we cannot pretend that somehow bureaucrats are able to deliver quality control and quality improvement simply by promulgating endless regulations and rules. The latest little effort which came to my attention yesterday is a 28-page document which is supposed to provide instructions on how fee relief entitlement is calculated for each eligible family, the process for recording fee and fee relief details, and the claiming of reimbursement from the Commonwealth. These are supposedly details of the proposed administrative arrangements, including a draft recordkeeping system and associated instructions. </PARA>
<PARA> Endless opportunities exist for those who want to make a career out of regulation, but it has nothing to do with quality control. All it will do is lead to an increase in costs. We only have to look at the report to the Minister by that Committee of Child Care Industry Representatives which, as I say, is very much a one-sided selection. I do not regard that as a true Committee of Child Care Industry Representatives; it is just part of this entirely disingenuous and misleading exercise that the Minister, Mr Staples, has been engaging in for some months now to try to hoodwink the public into thinking that somehow nothing much is on the agenda other than the proposal to extend fee relief in accordance with some guidelines that he might proclaim down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Lees rightly pointed out, the high watermark of the absurdity of all this is that, in order to qualify for fee relief, the commercial centres will have to undertake to comply with guidelines which are not yet in existence and centres will have until the end of the next calendar year to do that. That again is an extraordinary situation. The centres are being held over a barrel, told that they will not get their money unless they undertake to sign up on something which at this stage is sight unseen. </PARA>
<PARA> One can understand the degree of concern in the commercial sector, to the point where centres have been talking seriously about not even wanting to accept fee relief. I suspect that parents will share the concerns of the centres when they see what this will do for costs. Despite some of the assurances that one is given that these guidelines will be fairly limited in scope and will perhaps only apply to some matters which we would all regard as desirable, such as the level of insurance cover to be taken out and whether centres comply with State and Territory regulations, whether they provide proper priority of access rules and whether they provide for proper accounting and audit standards, the fact of the matter is that these guidelines will range far and wide. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very concerned to hear the Democrats, through Senator Lees, suggest that somehow this was what it ought to be all about, that we need a national accreditation system so that we can have these so called quality standards in place. If ever there was a false dawn, it is that. I cannot possibly see how anyone can have any confidence that we can guarantee quality control at the Federal level any more than we can do it at the State level. Nonetheless, if we look at the report of the Committee, these are some of the gems that we find:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that while feedback was generally supportive, there was concern and some opposition from State based child-care associations. A small number of these associations opposed the establishment of a national accreditation body or system while others simply wanted a role for State branches of the proposed national body. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a grotesque understatement of the level of concern. The private sector is bitterly opposed to any such accreditation system or to making fee relief conditional upon adherence to those standards. </PARA>

The tragedy of the matter is that instead of letting users like Senator Collins and me and everyone else make some sort of subjective judgment of the child-care centres that we use, what is going to happen is that these careerists in the industry are the ones who will decide whether the standards are high enough for Senator Collins' children, no matter whether Senator Collins might be satisfied with the standard of service that he has received or happy with the price he has paid to date. The Government will tell him that the standards have to be jacked up and it will not give a damn whether that means that the fees rise accordingly.  So Senator Collins and others in the community who regard themselves as consumers of the service will have virtually no input and no choice. Those people will simply be landed with something that someone else regards as an improvement in the system at considerably greater expense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the first proposition, that the private sector is so adamantly opposed to this that it is seriously talking about rejecting fee relief. Senator Collins's close colleague, Senator Walsh, at a meeting in Sydney last week urged it not to reject fee relief despite a strong inclination to do so. That is the first sort of canard we get in this area. The report also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of State child-care associations also expressed concern at the link between accreditation and fee relief eligibility. The Committee considered all views carefully, but in formulating final recommendations has acknowledged the weight of community support for both accreditation and a mechanism that can provide assurances of quality in all services attracting fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA>That is preposterous hypocrisy. There is no weight of community support for accreditation. There is indeed very strong self-interest amongst the industry professionals and the child-care careerists who see this as a wonderful opportunity to expand their horizons. But to pretend that somehow there is a weight of community support out there for accreditation is preposterous nonsense and it flies in the face of the report's later call for a very substantial major public awareness campaign to increase community understanding of the value of a new national accreditation system. It is complete and utter nonsense. It is self-serving rubbish. If we look closely at what the report says, it does not deny the link between accreditation and fee relief eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> It says that a number of State child-care associations also expressed concern at the link, but it does not pretend that there will not be a link. Yet there is not a skerrick of suggestion in the Bill that there will be any such nexus, nothing in the second reading speech, nothing in anything the Minister has ever said publicly on the record. Yet we know, by reading this report of the Committee, that it is a fact of life. This is the hidden agenda, this is the Trojan horse. The Government is going to wheel in accreditation after it has given the Minister a carte blanche entitlement to introduce any guidelines that suit the Minister and then ignore those guidelines when it suits him as well. We will end up with the best or worst of all possible worlds, and that will depend entirely, I suspect, on what view we take of consumers' rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that parents ought to come first, not the professionals; that this is not an area that is too important to leave to parents. Indeed, parents ought to be the primary concern. For all that it does not say about this major agenda item, in many ways that is what the Bill is all about. Our concern is simply heightened by the exclusion of references to this scheme. That is why we have to turn to reports like this, which certainly are not widely available to the public and could not possibly have led to any community support for the concept. This is where the report laughingly uses terms such as, `We are in favour of a complementary system to State/Territory licensing regulations'. Who knows why there is a need for complementary regulations? What is wrong with State and Territory regulations? If there is something wrong with them, the Government should convene a meeting of the ministerial council and do something about it. It should not wheel in this whole new system, this new layer of regulation, that can do nothing but add to the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to talk about quality factors and it identifies a number of these which it says include: quality and safety of building, health and safety of indoor and outdoor environment, group size, staff : child ratio, qualifications of staff, award pay and conditions. These are all matters regulated at State level or in the Industrial Relations Commission. There is not a problem about any of those. Then the report goes on to talk about how much further it would like to go:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee examined and nominated a number of conditions for fee relief which it recommends should operate for child-care centres from 1 January 1991. These included a stipulation that centres must be child-care centres as defined-</PARA>
<PARA>that is all right-</PARA>
<PARA>and thus must meet requirements to open a minimum number of hours and weeks per year-</PARA>
<PARA>that is all right-</PARA>
<PARA>and compliance with the kind of legal requirements outlined in the first list of quality factors above. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all about workers rights in many ways, and I think it is simply again self-serving nonsense to pretend that there is some level of staff : child ratio or group size that is appropriate across the community. It is all a function of how much we want to spend on the system. We can have a 1 : 1 arrangement if we want it, but everyone else knows it is prohibitively expensive and we will not do it. As Senator Walsh pointed out to that very interesting Sydney meeting, it makes little sense to require four-year-olds to be supervised by one staff member per group of 10 and yet a year later, when the children turn 5, to be looked after at school in groups of, say, 25 cared for by one teacher.

<PARA>Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill is the Government's next major piece of anti-avoidance legislation. It contains provisions to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to the proposal, as announced in the Economic Statement of April 1989 and subsequent press statements. It will introduce an accruals system of taxing foreign source income that has been derived in low-tax countries by Australian controlled entities and has been accumulated offshore, avoiding Australian tax. Exemption proposals in the Bill will also simplify the existing foreign tax credit system (FTCS). The Bill will generally have effect from the 1990-91 income year. </PARA>
<PARA> An exposure draft of this Bill was released in June of this year following release of an initial draft in December last year. This Bill before the Senate is essentially the same as the June draft Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Many taxpayers and tax advisers who have an interest in the proposed legislation have provided constructive comment in response to the various policy documents and drafts of the legislation released over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of this consultative process quite a number of significant changes were made between 1988 and 1990 to accommodate legitimate major concerns. For example, the control rule and active income exemption provided in the Bill were not policy features of the consultative document released in May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> These and other policy changes have added considerably to the length and complexity of the Bill but in general they have been made to take account of the genuine concerns expressed by those Australians to whom the legislation will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some proposed changes that the Government could not accept because they would have left untouched tax avoidance opportunities the Government is seeking to close, or were inconsistent with the policy underlying the existing foreign tax credit system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is firmly committed to these measures which will help significantly in the fight against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> For the great majority of Australians, those who do not have investments in offshore trusts and controlled foreign companies, this legislation will have no direct impact. There will be some beneficial effects for business in the exemptions and simplification of the FTCS. </PARA>
<PARA> Development of a comprehensive system for taxing foreign income has been under way for some time. Under the law as it existed before this Government introduced the FTCS Australian residents were exempt from tax in Australia on their foreign source income provided that income was taxed overseas, even if the income was subject only to a nominal rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As a first step towards removing the bias that had encouraged Australians to invest in offshore tax havens rather than in their own country, this Government introduced the foreign tax credit system commencing from the 1987-88 income year. The system enables foreign income to be subject to Australian tax when it is remitted to Australia, with a credit being allowed for any foreign tax paid. </PARA>
<PARA> It was acknowledged in the 1985 tax reform papers that the tax leakage through the use of tax havens would be closed off only if the FTCS was supported by a regime for taxing foreign source income derived in low-tax countries and being diverted and accumulated offshore in foreign companies and trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand have already introduced similar measures to tax foreign source income on an accruals basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the more detailed aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Controlled Foreign Companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The main feature of this Bill is the controlled foreign company measures. Their aim is to attribute to Australian residents, with some exceptions, certain income derived by a non-resident company that is controlled by Australian residents, unless the company is subject to a tax system comparable to Australia's or is predominantly engaged in active business. </PARA>
<PARA> A foreign company will be a controlled foreign company, or CFC, where five or fewer Australian residents own, or are entitled to acquire, 50 per cent or more of the interests in the company. The interest of a resident for this purpose will include both the direct and indirect interests of the resident and those of the resident's associates. Alternatively, a non-resident company will be a CFC if five or fewer residents have actual control of the company regardless of their shareholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a difference between the treatment accorded to non-resident companies in listed (i.e. comparable-taxing) countries and unlisted countries. Even where a non-resident company in an unlisted country is controlled by a small number of Australian residents its income or gains will not be attributed if the CFC's ``tainted'' income is less than 5 per cent of its total income. In other words, the measures will not apply if the CFC is predominately engaged in active business. However, if it fails the test, the tainted income of the CFC will be attributed to the relevant Australian residents. The other income is not attributed and will be subject to Australian tax under the FTCS generally on remittance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> With CFCs resident in listed countries, low-taxed income may be attributed to certain of the CFC's Australian shareholders where:</PARA>
<PARA> - it is tainted income that benefits from a tax concession of a kind that is to be prescribed by the income tax regulations and fails the active income test;</PARA>
<PARA>-- in other cases the income is from sources outside the country of residence that is not taxed by any comparable tax country; or</PARA>
<PARA> - the company derives certain categories of trust income. </PARA>
<PARA>The countries that are to be treated as comparable tax countries, and the concessions that are to be treated as designated tax concessions, will be listed in the income tax regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Tainted income includes the types of income that are readily able to be shifted to a foreign tax jurisdiction. These consist of passive income (such as dividends, interest, royalties and most kinds of gains on the disposal of assets) and business income from transactions with Australian residents and related parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The assessable income of a shareholder who is an attributable taxpayer will include the taxpayer's share of the attributable income of the CFC for an accounting year of the CFC that commenced on or after 1 July 1990 and ended during the taxpayer's year of income. </PARA>
<PARA> In most cases the residents who will be taxed are those who, alone or with associates, directly or indirectly hold an interest of 10 per cent or more in the CFC as at the end of the CFC's accounting year. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Tax Credit System</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the accruals tax measures provides an opportunity to simplify certain aspects of the existing FTCS. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, with effect from the commencement of the 1990-91 income year, an exemption is to be provided for non-portfolio dividends received by Australian companies from companies resident in comparable tax countries. A dividend will be a non-portfolio dividend where the Australian company that received the dividend has a voting interest of at least 10 per cent in the foreign company. It will not be necessary that the foreign company be a CFC. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Bill provides that a dividend received by an Australian company from a company resident in an unlisted (non-comparable-tax) country will be exempt where the dividend is paid out of income that has been comparably taxed in a listed country or income that has already been included in assessable income in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, other dividends are to continue to be assessable and subject to relief measures along the lines of the existing FTCS. </PARA>
<PARA> The FTCS will also be modified to exempt from income tax, with effect from the commencement of the 1990-91 income year, the income or profits of a resident company derived in carrying on a business at or through a permanent establishment located in a listed country, except to the extent that the income or profits was not taxed (or is concessionally) taxed by any listed country. </PARA>
<PARA> Income of a resident company derived at or through a permanent establishment that is not located in a listed country is to continue to be subject to income tax, as is any branch income derived by a non-corporate taxpayer. Where foreign tax has been paid on branch income which is still assessable, a credit will continue to be allowed under the FTCS. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of technical amendments to the FTCS will also be made generally to accommodate the interaction of the accruals tax and the existing FTCS. These relate mainly to the definition of the classes of income, exemption of dividends paid out of attributed income, carry-forward of excess credits, and quarantining of losses and credits. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-Resident Trusts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Another significant feature of this Bill is the transferor tax measures. These attribute income of non-resident trusts in low-tax countries to Australian residents who have, either directly or indirectly, transferred property or services to the trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a discretionary trust that was in existence on 12 April 1989, an exemption from these measures will be available to a transferor if neither the transferor nor an associate of the transferor was able to control the trust on or after 12 April 1989. In this context, the term``control'' is given a wide meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> The attributable income of a non-resident trust estate that is not a resident of a listed country is to be the whole of the net income of the trust. In the case of a trust that is a resident of a listed country the attributable income will be limited to that part of the net income of the trust that benefits from a designated tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA> In both cases a deduction will be given for certain amounts that have been, or will be, subject to full taxation in Australia or in a listed country. </PARA>
<PARA> A deemed rate of return based generally on the value of property or services transferred to an offshore trust will be included in the assessable income of the transferor where the Commissioner is satisfied that the transferor is unable to obtain the information necessary to compute a trust's income according to Australian tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> Attributable income of a trust estate that has been included in the assessable income of a transferor will be exempt from tax in the hands of a beneficiary to whom that income is subsequently distributed. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional tax on certain trust distributions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that a resident beneficiary's assessable income for the 1990-91, or a subsequent income year, includes a distribution by a non-resident trust estate of income of previous years that has neither been attributed to a transferor nor taxed to the trustee or a beneficiary at tax rates comparable to Australia's, the beneficiary is to be liable, in certain circumstances, to pay an additional tax in the nature of an interest charge in respect of that amount. This measure will achieve a parity with resident trust estates, the net income of which is liable to tax either in the hands of the trustee or the beneficiaries in the income year it is derived. The charge is to be formally imposed by the Taxation (Interest on Non-resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional tax in respect of income that accumulated in a non-resident trust prior to the beginning of the 1990-91 income year of the trust will accrue only from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Certain family arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The transferor tax measures will not apply in relation to an offshore trust that is solely for the benefit of family members in necessitous circumstances or is a family arrangement established under a court order following a divorce or separation. The beneficiaries of these trusts should all be non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA>Winding up of existing trusts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As an incentive to wind up non-resident discretionary trusts that were in existence on 12 April 1989 and to which a resident had transferred property or services prior to that date, a rebate of tax will be available so that the rate of Australian tax on distributions of income made after 12 April 1989 and before 30 June 1991 does not exceed 10 per cent. The rebate will apply only if all of the trust's accumulated income and corpus are distributed, and the trust is wound up before 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Keeping of Records</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An attributable taxpayer in relation to a CFC or a non-resident trust will be required to keep records that show how the CFC or transferor tax measures apply to the taxpayer. Generally, the records must be maintained for five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Information held Offshore</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to issue an offshore information notice in respect of information or documents held offshore. The proposed measures give 90 days to comply and the Commissioner can extend this time limit in special circumstances. Where the information or documents is not supplied there is no provision for a penalty or prosecution. Rather, the information or documents may not be used by the taxpayer as evidence to dispute an assessment. The approach adopted in this provision is similar to that taken in the United States and Canadian tax laws and is aimed at ensuring the timely provision of all the information and documents needed by the Commissioner to get the full and correct picture of the transactions being examined. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the significance of such a provision, the operation of proposed section 264A will be kept under review to ensure that its objectives are met and that the rights of affected taxpayers are adequately protected. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes from Draft Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that the Bill varies in some respects from the draft that was released in June 1990. The broad thrust of these changes is to remove tax avoidance opportunities and provide relief in certain circumstances where double taxation could have occurred due to the application of the proposed measures. Some of the amendments relate to cases where double taxation could have arisen on a change of residence of a CFC or in relation to transfers of profits between companies. The amendments reflect the willingness of this Government to address genuine taxpayer concerns on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government is committed to the measures contained in this Bill as they will ensure a more equitable tax system. The Government is also committed to ensuring that these measures operate as intended. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all of the announced changes have been included in the Bill. The Government intends addressing the most urgent of these in an amending Bill to be introduced late in the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the amendments are the result of the close monitoring of avoidance techniques that are being developed to frustrate the intent of the proposed measures. An example of this type of amendment is the redefinition of a non-resident family trust that is to be exempt from the accruals tax measures. Similarly, the exception from the deemed dividend provisions provided earlier for the investment by a CFC in the share capital of a wholly owned subsidiary is to be withdrawn if that subsidiary is being used to provide designated benefits to its associates. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, implementation of these measures will require consequential amendments to two other Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as a consequence of the changes to the classes of income that are to apply for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation Administration Act 1953</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to ensure that a person cannot be prosecuted in respect of a statement made in a document produced to the Commissioner in response to an offshore information notice or under the active income test substantiation provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The likely direct revenue gain resulting from the introduction of the accruals system of taxing foreign source income is difficult to determine. This is particularly so in the initial years because of the variation in CFCs' accounting periods and taxpayers' years of income; the branch exemptions; and the tax exemption for non-portfolio dividends received by resident companies from a company that is a resident of a country with a tax system comparable to Australia's. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimating is made more difficult because it is not known to what extent non-resident discretionary trusts will be subject to the transferor tax measures or to what extent resident controllers will take advantage of the 10 per cent final tax liability by winding up before 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> While the revenue gains in 1990-91 are not expected to be significant, it is anticipated that the direct revenue gain will increase to within the range of $60 million to $70 million in 1993-94 after the full impact of these measures takes effect. In addition, the domestic tax base is expected to increase but the revenue impact cannot be quantified at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the consolidated Explanatory Memorandum for this Bill and the Taxation (Interest on Non-resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation (Interest on Non-Resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill will impose an interest charge on non-resident trust distributions that are included in the assessable income of a resident beneficiary where the trust income has neither been subject to tax on a current basis, nor on an attribution basis under the transferor tax measures of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990. The interest is to be calculated by reference to the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes three substantive changes to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. </PARA>
<PARA> The first will provide the facility for the determination of different Volware prices for different oil producing regions, which is consequential on proposed amendments to the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 which are contained in the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The second will incorporate into the Act a previously notified excise tariff proposal which alters the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) with effect from 1 April 1990 . </PARA>
<PARA> The third will effect a technical correction to the definition of `new oil', to ensure that oil which has been produced from two reservoirs in the Bass Strait since 1 July 1980 and which has been excisable at the `old' oil rate, does not inadvertently become `new oil', and thereby subject to a free rate of duty. </PARA>
<PARA>Volware Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the proposed amendments in clauses 4 to 8 and clause 10 of the Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act to enable the calculation of different prices for sales of crude oil from different oil producing regions. These prices are required for the purpose of determining excise liability for excisable oil. </PARA>
<PARA> As from 1 January 1988, when the decision to deregulate the oil market and to terminate the import parity pricing basis for levying excise was implemented, crude oil prices for the purposes of calculating excise liability have been determined by the Minister for Resources (or his delegate) under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 on the basis of the volume weighted average of realised (Volware) prices of sales of crude oil in a calendar month. </PARA>
<PARA> As the principal Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act applies to offshore areas producing excisable petroleum, its application has effectively been confined to the Bass Strait producing region. The second reading speech to the principal Act in 1987 noted that production from areas onshore would become excisable in the event that production exceeded the 30 million barrel excise exempt limit, and that the price basis for excising such onshore oil production would be considered at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> Indications are that cumulative production from the Jackson oilfield located in south west Queensland will now exceed 30 million barrels, and hence production above this limit will become excisable. </PARA>
<PARA> The calculation of separate Volware prices for different oil producing regions is necessary to prevent inequities in excise liability. These inequities arise from the fact that the realised prices of crude oil from different sources have been observed to differ and hence there are direct implications for the excise payable. In effect, those producers with lower realised prices would pay relatively more of the excise liability than those with higher realised prices if a combined Volware price were used as the basis for excise liability. This is the case for Jackson and Bass Strait production.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore provides for an effective and equitable system of collecting excise on crude oil production by enabling the calculation of different Volware prices for different oil producing regions. </PARA>
<PARA>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The excise duty for naturally occurring LPG is adjusted six monthly on 1 April and 1 October each year in accordance with the LPG excise policy announced in april 1980. The excise rate is calculated as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 a tonne. The realised price is calculated as a weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG during the immediately preceding 6 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the petroleum excise arrangements introduced from 1 July 1987, LPG produced from onshore fields is exempt from excise, so the excise now only applies to offshore fields in production in August 1977. On this basis Bass Strait is the only area that attracts excise on the production of naturally occurring LPG. No excise is payable on refinery-produced LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 of the Bill will amend the excise rate with effect from 1 April 1990 to $5.78 per kilolitre, an increase from the previous free rate set on 1 April and 1 October 1989. The increase reflects the higher export prices obtained for this product over the six months to March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>`New' Oil Definition Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendments in clause 3 of the Bill is to correct an anomaly in the definition of ``new'' oil from the date in 1984 when amendments made to the excise tariff act 1921 relating to ``new'' oil classifications were first introduced into the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the 1984 amendments were enacted, the Government had intended to preserve the effect of decisions made prior to 1 July 1984 under excise by-law number 78. That by-law contained provisions that were used to determine whether an oil discovery was eligible for ``new'' oil status, and hence concessional excise treatment on any crude oil production. This intention was clearly indicated by the Government when it announced in June 1983 that it intended to amend the ``new'' oil excise arrangements with effect from 1 July 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recently become aware that the amendments introduced in 1984 do not legally preserve the validity of decisions on ``new'' oil applications made prior to 1 July 1983. The effect is that in one case, a decision made prior to 1983 to refuse a ``new'' oil classification on certain reservoirs could now be effectively reversed, with the effect that the companies could receive an unintended windfall, possibly up to $200 million. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to avoid payment of refunds on that oil, and not provide an unintended windfall to the companies concerned, the legislative changes proposed in clause 3 of the Bill have retrospective effect to 1 July 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The retrospectivity will legally remove any Commonwealth liability to refund any duties paid in respect of production from the reservoirs. In effect, what has been paid will, by force of the amendment, be the correct amount of duty payable. </PARA>
<PARA> All producers had accepted the pre July 1983 classification arrangements and associated decisions and paid excise at the appropriate rate without protest from that time up until 1 March of this year. For that reason, the Government considers any changes made now to the ``new'' oil definition that have the effect of ensuring that the oil classifications made prior to 1 July 1983 remain binding should be seen as `declaratory' in nature that is, the changes will only ratify what the industry and Government had always expected to have been the legal position. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Volware Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will enable excise to be collected from a field in an oil producing region that will become subject to the excise regime after that field has produced more than 30 million barrels of crude oil. The Jackson field is expected to exceed that limit in 1990/91. Other fields, including the Saladin field in Western Australia and potentially the Wanaea and Cossack fields on the North West shelf could become excisable in future years. No specific figure however can be put on the additional excise revenue that might be collected from oil producing regions subject to the excise regime in 1990/91 as that figure is dependent on both the level of production and the price received for that production, which are unknown. </PARA>
<PARA>LPG Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the excise rate for LPG (from free to $5.78 per kilolitre on and from 1 April 1990) is estimated will result in the collection of about $9m in excise receipts in the 12 months commencing 1 April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>`New oil' Definition Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The correction of the `new oil' definition will remove a potential liability of the Commonwealth to repay some of the duty which has been paid on oil produced from the tuna field in the Bass Strait since 1 July 1984. But for the amendments, the extent of that liability might be in the vicinity of $200 million. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs Tariff Amendment Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1990, which is now before the House contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. I will briefly outline those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, Clause 11 of the Bill is an administrative requirement to ensure that certain amendments contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1989 have due effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedules One, Two and Three contain minor administrative amendments. Schedule One is operative on and from 1 July 1988 and amends Note 4 to Chapter 28 to align it with the international harmonised system. It also provides a free rate of duty for certain articles of rubber apparel. This rate was previously applied by the Customs Tariff (Rate Alteration) Act 1988, as a result of the Government's 1988 May Economic Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule Two, having effect from 1 March 1989, contains an amendment to the text of subheading 5212.12.20 and also extends the coverage of Item 40a in Schedule 4 to include lightweight wool fabrics of headings 5111 and 5112. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule Three validates a rate of two and a half per cent for certain straw and fodder balers of Canadian origin and amends Item 44 in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to ensure that the provisions of this item encompass goods of New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Forum Island and developing country origin. These changes operate on and from the 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule Four to this Bill removes Items 36c and 38b in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 as sunset entry provisions of this legislation expired on 31 December 1989. The changes take effect from 1 January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule Five operates on and from 31 March 1990. These amendments:</PARA>
<PARA> are made in the context of the post-1988 assistance arrangements for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries and insert new quota tender and tender extension duty rates for TCF goods for the period 1 March 1990 to 28 February 1991 following the determination of rates under the 1990 tender quota scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> delete New Zealand rates of duty for certain plastic coated fabrics of heading 5903 under the accelerated arrangements of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement; and</PARA>

<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The value of the tender quota allocation for 1990/1991 has been raised by twenty per cent above 1989/1990 levels and the increased imports are expected to raise an additional $101.6 million in customs duty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to predict the amount of customs duty which will be foregone by allowing protein concentrates to be imported duty free as separate import figures were not kept for the current financial year. However based on past figures and applied pro rata to current imports it is expected that the amount of customs duty involved will be about $350,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Reducing the duty rates to free on pitch and coal tar will reduce revenue in a full financial year by $700,000 and $127,000 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of Commonwealth departments paying the equivalent of customs duty is budget neutral. This change places public service managers on the same footing as private enterprise managers whereby purchasing decisions will be made on the full duty paid price. Australian industry is expected to benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect of other changes contained in this Bill are not considered to be significant. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA>PETROLEUM EXCISE (PRICES) AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to enable the calculation of a volume weighted average of realised prices of sales of crude oil, referred to as the VOLWARE price. This calculation is required for the purpose of determining excise liability for excisable oil produced outside of the Bass Strait producing area, including the Jackson oilfield located in south west Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers of this Bill are integral to the collection of crude oil excise under the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and Excise Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> As from 1 January 1988, when the decision to deregulate the oil market and to terminate the import parity pricing basis for levying excise was implemented, crude oil prices for the purposes of calculating excise liability have been determined by the Minister for Resources (or his delegate) under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 on the basis of the volume weighted average of realised (VOLWARE) prices of sales of crude oil in a calendar month. As the principal Act applies to offshore areas producing excisable petroleum, its application has effectively been confined to the Bass Strait producing region. The second reading speech to the principal Act noted that production from areas onshore would become excisable in the event that production exceeded the 30m barrel excise free limit, and that the price basis for excising such onshore oil production would be considered at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> Indications are that cumulative production from the Jackson oilfield will exceed 30m barrels early in 1990-91, and hence production above this limit will become excisable. </PARA>
<PARA> The calculation of separate VOLWARE prices for different producing regions is necessary to prevent inequities in excise liability. These inequities arise from the fact that the realised prices of crude oil from different sources have been observed to differ and hence there are direct implications for the excise payable. In effect, those producers with lower realised prices would pay relatively more of the excise liability than those with higher realised prices if a combined VOLWARE price were used as the basis for excise liability. This is the case for Jackson and Bass Strait production. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to facilitate the calculation of a VOLWARE price to determine excise liability for the Jackson oilfield, it is necessary to widen the definition of producer in the principal Act to include onshore producers. Amendments are also required to enable the calculation of a separate VOLWARE price for the Bass Strait and Jackson producing regions and for the description of each producing region to be prescribed in the regulations to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments have been framed in a way that will enable regions additional to Jackson and Bass Strait to be listed separately in the regulations in the event that production from within other regions becomes liable for excise. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill therefore provides for an effective and equitable system of collecting excise on crude oil production at Jackson. The amount of excise that will be generated from the Jackson oilfield will be dependent on the level of production. If production were to be maintained at current levels, excise of about $0.35m might be expected in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequential changes of a minor nature are required to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. These are incorporated in proposed amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

I now intend to reveal where the money ended up.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before proceeding further, however, I should comment on the statement tabled by Senator Richardson on Tuesday. There are a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the statement which clearly show that either Senator Richardson or Mrs Kelly still do not understand the issue or are deliberately trying to hide the full implications of Senator Richardson's incompetence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On page 2 of the statement, Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd is described as a division of National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd. This is not true. In fact, National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd is a partially owned subsidiary of Plywood and Plastic. But then, given that Senator Richardson was not aware that $5.3m had disappeared, it does not surprise me that he does not know which company owns what. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 4 of the statement it is claimed that the assistance agreement was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a list of things that the money provided by the Commonwealth could be spent on-it did not canvass the possible things that the money should not be spent on. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government is admitting that it took no steps to include in the agreement anything to prevent the money being misused-not one word in writing to protect the $7.6m of Commonwealth money. Contrary to Mrs Kelly's assertion, such negative covenants are normal commercial practice amongst responsible lenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The only thing that the Commonwealth can even claim to have done is to mention to the company in its negotiations that expenditure beyond the list would not be acceptable under the terms of the agreement. Well, even if we accept that-and there is nothing to prove it-then the company clearly failed to observe the terms of the agreement and Senator Richardson was totally incorrect in saying that the company had not met all the conditions required of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other points to be made regarding the statement tabled by Senator Richardson. First, the statement deliberately attempts to avoid the facts in saying that it would have been unreasonable for the Commonwealth to take a mortgage in priority to those already existing in favour of Westpac Banking Corporation and Placer Industries Ltd. Indeed, it would be, but that was not the point. My criticism was, and remains, that the Commonwealth should have taken a security over other companies in the group and not just over the assets of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd. That was what Westpac did and what any other responsible lender would have done-any other responsible lender, but not the Commonwealth. I think that the Government's deliberate attempt to avoid that point is tacit acknowledgment of its negligence in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we must take note of the comments of the receivers when they say that they had difficulty preparing accounts for the group `due to the poor standard of the group's record keeping', and further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there was also a lack of fundamental reconciliations of accounts (e.g. bank reconciliation and reconciliation of inter-company loan accounts). </PARA>
<PARA>In view of these comments I think we have to treat with scepticism any claim by the Government that it could reasonably have been satisfied with the company's accounting. These sorts of things would have had a much higher chance of being detected had the Government required quarterly or half-yearly accounts to be presented in a timely fashion, and would certainly have been noticed if the Commonwealth had not waited until March 1990 to get around to requesting a copy of the 1989 annual accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, I totally reject the shabby and unjustified attack made by the Government on Mr Mike Seccombe of the Sydney Morning Herald, and support him in laying blame fairly and squarely at the feet of this inept Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move on, however, to reveal where at least some of the Commonwealth's money, the taxpayers' money, went, because it does not seem to have stayed long in Ravenshoe. The key to this puzzle lies in the statement of financial position of National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd on 31 March 1990, which is contained in annexure C of the information prospectus. National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd was a company owned and operated jointly by Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd and an associated company, National Plywood Company Pty Ltd. National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd had as its principal purpose the operation of a sawmill at Kyogle. </PARA>
<PARA> As at 31 March 1990 National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd had bank loans of $11.7m and what appear to be unsecured trade creditors in excess of $6m. On top of this it owed $7.8m to other companies in the group, one of these being Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd. In short, the company in Kyogle owed $25.8m, or over $11.4m more than the value of its assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare this with the balance sheet for the company as at 30 June 1988 when its total operating borrowings were only $10.7m. This means that between June 1988 and March 1990 the Kyogle company borrowed a massive $15m. Where did all this go? Part of it went to build the mill in Kyogle, which was only on the drawing board in 1988 and which was completed this year. I can only assume that the rest of the money went in losses, although I think that the matter needs further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not pretending that all this money came directly from Ravenshoe, although between $1.5m and $2m did. The point I make though is that the company in Ravenshoe lent money to other companies in the group which, in turn, lent money to the company in Kyogle. The Ravenshoe mill appears to have been the cash cow that National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd, the company in Kyogle, lived off. The documents are all now on the public record, and people can go through them if they want. But let me just say this: A lot of money went out of Ravenshoe and north Queensland, and a lot of money went into Kyogle. A mill should have been retooled in Ravenshoe but was not, while at the same time a mill was being built in Kyogle. Honourable senators can draw their own conclusions, but all this occurred right under the nose of Senator Richardson, and he must be responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again we come back to the inadequacy of the Commonwealth's assistance agreement. I think Mrs Kelly, in response to Mr Chaney's question yesterday, suggested that the Ravenshoe mill went into receivership because of other companies in the group. I think the Ravenshoe mill went into receivership in part as a result of what was going on in Kyogle, but if the Government had taken securities over the whole group and asked for prompt accounting, this could have been prevented. The Ravenshoe mill was bled to death because of Senator Richardson's incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> But the irregularities do not stop there. It has been suggested that a $350,000 boiler purchased with Commonwealth money was sold and leased back, and that a $400,000 veneer mill was also sold. If these comments are correct, then either Senator Richardson agreed to its happening, which would be commercially inept, or he did not. If Senator Richardson did not agree to these sales, then the company clearly breached the terms of the assistance agreement and he failed to notice. Either way it is not a particularly good reflection on Senator Richardson's performance as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the very damning evidence that I have brought to light, Senator Richardson and Mrs Kelly have attempted to allege that those of us on this side have jeopardised the continued viability of the mill. Nothing could be further from the truth. The financial documents I have tabled are either public documents or are provided by the receivers to interested purchasers. None of this goes to the commercial viability of the mill, but it does go to the competence of the relevant Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way that the continued viability of the mill can be jeopardised is if the Government does not keep its promises. By the way, the grant that the Government claims it has made still has not been received. If this grant is withdrawn, let there be no doubt about it, it will be the direct result of a decision by Mrs Kelly. It is not something that can be laid at the feet of those who want accountable government. I think that if the Minister does withdraw the money, everybody will recognise not only what a shabby little stunt that would be, but how it would be totally inconsistent with her stated concern for mill workers. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, we have seen the apparent disappearance of over $5m from the mill at Ravenshoe, combined with extensive borrowings by an associated company in Kyogle. We have seen the people of north Queensland shamefully neglected while a mill was built in New South Wales. Most importantly, we have seen grossly inept commercial practices by a Minister who refuses to accept responsibility for his actions and the people of Ravenshoe and north Queensland deserve better than that. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator O'Chee raises a very serious problem, a massively seriously problem. I have been involved in the Ravenshoe problem since the 1987 election. I have seen people there being destroyed. I have sympathy for the 2 1/2 thousand people employed in the rainforest timber industry-an industry worth $33m, an industry that was destroyed by this Government. I have seen people lose their jobs, lose their businesses, lose their pride. I have made representations for these people in their claims for compensation. I have heard about their broken marriages. I have heard about teachers abusing kids because their fathers are environmental rapists-or so their teachers say. I have seen proud men lose their self-respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Ravenshoe was a proud town and it can continue to be a proud town if the Government meets its commitment. On 29 June 1988, Commonwealth grants and loans to a total of $7.6 were given. On 24 April 1990, the holding company and the associated company went into receivership. Of the loan $4.2m is outstanding and not all of the retooling has been completed. Ravenshoe business people are owed $220,000. Those businessmen and women supported the mill believing Senator Richardson's claim that he made in the Senate, in the Parliament of Australia, that no-one would be hurt by the World Heritage listing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson said no-one would be hurt and no-one would be worse off. The business people extended the credit to support the mill because they believed that that was the only way in which their town could survive. It was all they could do as citizens to hold together a tiny little town that depended on one mill for its survival and its sustenance. If the businesses did not supply that mill, the town would go down. Unless the Government acts, the town will go down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment the company owes the Commonwealth $4.2m. The Government asked for a report on 19 June and 14 September. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, wrote on 19 June this year and 14 September and asked the receivers for a report. As far back as 19 June people were worried about where the money was going. I questioned Senator Richardson, as did Senator Macdonald, on 19 September. We were told that the report would be here in a couple of days. Why did it take from 19 June to 19 September-three months-to get that report? A further report was sent on 25 September. </PARA>
<PARA> We had to wait three months for the Minister to come up with that report. The Minister and Senator Richardson representing the Minister have assured us that all the conditions of the agreement were met. How many times has he stood up in this Senate and said that all the agreements have been met? Either Senator Richardson has not been informed by the Minister or-I will not give the other conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I pointed out, and Senator O'Chee just mentioned in his contribution, that $750,000 worth of machinery was removed from the plant. A boiler worth $300,000, that was paid for by the Commonwealth, was sold back to Westpac Banking Corporation and leased back to the mill. A veneer mill worth at least $400,000 was sold off. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89 the mill was a viable, profitable, going concern which showed a profit of about $300,000, employing 48 people. It would be still making a profit if the Government money had been spent properly: supporting the mill, supporting the people in the town, supporting the employers and supporting the unionists who pay their $160-odd a year and who send people to this Parliament to represent them. The mill was left without capital, without sufficient tools, with a list of unsecured creditors, with unpaid contractors and with unpaid private land-holders who had sold their timber to the mill and had not been paid. It was left without a feather to fly with and that is why it has proceeded down the road to bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot walk away from its responsibility. The Government may say that it gave that money to a particular company, but that company never put the money into the mill. The Commonwealth Government had the responsibility to the people of Ravenshoe, the timber workers, the town-not to the company that it lent the money to. By walking away from its responsibility, writing out a blank cheque, the Government took a Pontius Pilate attitude: it washed its hands of the whole problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the money that should have been spent on supporting the mill at Ravenshoe has ended up supplying another mill in Kyogle. Senator Richardson has not honoured his commitment concerning the World Heritage listing. I do not believe Senator Richardson is a dishonourable man. Senator Richardson made a commitment to the people of Ravenshoe in the World Heritage listing who were disadvantaged by a Government decision to declare an area of north Queensland a rainforest or World Heritage listing. He promised the people of Kyogle nothing; yet they are the people who got some advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had given money to support its promise to the people who had lost their jobs, their homes and their future. The fact that this matter was referred to the Attorney-General is sufficient proof that this commitment may not have been honoured by the company to which the money was given. The Government's responsibility was to ensure that the mill was kept viable. It did not allow any money to go there and it could not perform and make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn to what I believe is an outrageous suggestion by Senator Richardson today. He said-and I paraphrase him-that, because Senator Macdonald, Senator O'Chee and I have exposed this matter in the Federal Parliament of Australia and we performed our duties as we have been elected to do, the people of Ravenshoe would suffer. That can never be sustained or supported. I do not think this Government would ever support a suggestion such as that. I hope it never will, because, if it does, the wrath of the people will descend on it. This Government is supposed to support the working man and woman of Australia. Let us see it put its money where its mouth is in the next couple of days. </PARA>
