<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that I might be asked a question about the economy today. Let me say at the beginning that there are a number of assumptions in Senator Hill's question which I do not agree with. In terms of alleged leadership instability, the Prime Minister has stated on a number of occasions that he will lead the Government into the next election. The speculation and interpretation relating to a speech apparently made by the Treasurer at the weekend is, therefore, somewhat academic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Defence aware of reports broadcast on the Seven Network News last Thursday evening which claimed that the Holsworthy Army Base was on a security alert as a result of a potential terrorist activity associated with the Hizbolla Islamic Organisation?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Channel 7 has not been doing too well in the ratings lately, but resorting to beat-ups of this sort is hardly likely to lift its ratings. The facts surrounding the Holsworthy exercise are these: last Thursday afternoon members of the Australian Defence Force, along with members of the civilian police, carried out an exercise in traffic control on the roads surrounding the base. Some 380 ADF personnel were involved. The traffic control program was one of an ongoing series of exercises that occur at that base-and, I might add, at many other bases-on a regular basis. One of the roads affected was outside the perimeter of the fence. Local police were fully aware of the exercise and actively participated. The exercise ended early on Friday morning. Some individual members of the ADF were carrying weapons but no ammunition was issued. Flak jackets were worn to help ensure realism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last Thursday afternoon, after the commencement of the exercise, Channel 7, amongst others, was advised that a routine exercise was occurring. It was provided with a detailed oral brief and a press release was issued later in the afternoon. Some 3 1/2 hours after that release, Channel 7 chose to broadcast the claim that a security alert was under way as a result of a rumoured terrorist threat. Channel 7 had asked the duty officer at Holsworthy whether the exercise was linked to the Middle East situation and was specifically told no. Army public relations later telephoned the network to ensure that it was clear on this point.</PARA>
<PARA> My office has since been in touch with the Channel 7 journalist who prepared the story in an effort to have a correction broadcast. The station has not done so. The chief of the news staff at Channel 7 in Sydney has also been approached by Army public relations for a correction to be broadcast, again without result. Numerous media inquiries resulted from the Channel 7 broadcast. All responsibly accepted the facts regarding the exercise. The result of the Channel 7 broadcast was to cause needless inconvenience to the ADF and police personnel involved and considerable worry and distress to their relatives and local residents. It does little credit to the Seven Network that it broadcast such a beat-up in the first place, and even less that it has ignored repeated opportunities to air a correction.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Maguire for this question; he gave me some notice of it. The Government is, of course, aware of media reports suggesting that some financial institutions were considering removing or reducing the current interest free period on credit cards of up to 55 days. State and Territory consumer credit legislation currently prohibits the charging of separate up-front fees as well as interest on credit card balances. By altering the interest free period, which is not affected by credit legislation, financial institutions could be in a position to reduce their credit card interest rates. Some banks already operate without an interest free period, but at an interest rate several percentage points below those charged on cards that do give up to 55 days free credit. If particular financial institutions do remove the interest free period, their customers could consider transferring their business to another institution still offering an interest free period, if they consider that a card with that feature best serves their needs and interests.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Does the Minister recognise that the term `resource security', as applied to guaranteed access to forests by timber companies, is an oxymoron? Does the Minister recognise that the proposed guarantee of resource security is counter to accepted environmental impact assessment procedures and to proposals for ecologically sustainable development? Does the Minister concur with the view of the New South Wales Minister for Environment, Tim Moore, that the Four Corners program, `Navy Blues', which won the 1990 Sir William McKell award for environmental reporting, exposed serious deficiencies in the environmental impact assessment process? Finally, will the Minister resist proposals for exclusive resource access and instead work to strengthen the environmental impact assessment process?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When it comes to ecologically sustainable development, we will see over the course of the next 12 months some important developments with those groups that have been set up and which are currently working through a series of problems. I would hope that, if we are going to consider resource security legislation, it would be in that context. But I would remind Senator Coulter that the primary responsibility for resource security, if there is to be such a thing, will lie with the States. In answer to a question from Senator Bell last week, I said that I did not regard resource security necessarily as a problem, provided that there was sufficient room for the reservation of areas needed for conservation. At the end of this argument it is a matter of summing up what we have left for conservation purposes, balanced against anything else. That seems to me to be at the heart of the argument. But I do not believe that there is a primary role for the Commonwealth in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Do I understand that the Minister is saying, firstly, that the question of sustainable development is a matter which in this area will be left primarily with the States, and there will not be an overriding imposition by the Commonwealth so that we have a national sustainable development policy; and, secondly, that one can guarantee resource security for, say, a timber company-and that is the context in which it has been touted-in which the timber company removes the forest and that that somehow can be part of a sustainable development philosophy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5240" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of any sustainable development philosophy will be the capacity of the timber industry to cut timber from forests. Quite obviously, the question is going to be: what is a sustainable level for the cutting? So I do not rule out logging in Australia because we are going to try to seek ecologically sustainable development. In fact, if we can arrive at a definition of what that is in respect of forests, it may mean less logging in some areas than is carried out now. So it certainly does not have to mean more. But at no stage did we ever suggest that the word `sustainable' meant that no logging was ever possible, so I cannot answer the honourable senator that it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the sustainable development work that is being done, there is a responsibility for the Commonwealth to develop a national approach. That is what we are doing with industry, and it is to be hoped that we can take the States with us as well. That is our responsibility. I was merely referring to the fact that, when it comes to access to a forest, on most occasions that will be decided solely by the State government and not by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will have only a very limited role in that decision, on very limited grounds, and that has been the problem over the last few years. I do not believe that anything I have said undermines there being a national responsibility for a proper, ecologically sustainable development program, but much of its implementation must in the end reside with the States.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I preface my question by referring to the apparent debacle in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in Europe. Following the suspension of the GATT Uruguay Round of trade talks last week, can the Minister inform the Senate what the impact on Australia will be and what the Australian Government will do in future to assist Australian industry in the pursuit of its interests in the post-Uruguay Round trading environment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5241" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Loosely raises a number of large issues in his question. Nonetheless, I will try to address the broad issues that are raised. The first and most important point to make is that, while it is true that the Brussels ministerial meeting last week failed to conclude the Uruguay Round, which it was intended to do, there will nonetheless be efforts made over coming weeks to recapture the progress which has been made across the board as a whole and to restart those talks in the new year. The Director-General of the GATT, Arthur Dunkel, will over the coming weeks be talking to the major participants in the round to see when and how the negotiations can resume. Australia will be encouraging him in that effort because the successful outcome of the Uruguay Round must remain the most important trade policy objective on Australia's national agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to remind ourselves what is at stake here. Quite apart from the particular question of agriculture, which is so centrally important to Australia and on which the round broke down, the round has held out the prospect that the GATT could be brought up to date with the realities of the international trading system in the 1990s and be able to deal with new issues such as the growing importance of trade in services and intellectual property. It also has to do with the failure of the GATT system to deal with the increasing resort by government to protectionism in the 1980s. A failed round, accordingly, would throw away the possibility of making GATT a more relevant and contemporary institution. It would also unquestionably unleash the potential for inward looking solutions to international trading developments and growing pressure for the powerful trading countries and trading blocs to pursue unilateral solutions to their bilateral trade relations and frictions.</PARA>
<PARA> The point has been made many times-and it needs to be made again-that Australia, as a medium sized trading power, needs a functioning multilateral trading system to prevent our legitimate trading interests being subverted by protectionist forces. Australia would suffer both from the lost potential for the future of the GATT itself and from any fallout from the international trade wars which could emerge from a failed Uruguay Round environment. That is why attempts to enhance the multilateral trading system remain critical for countries such as Australia and must have priority over other options which inevitably get ventilated at times such as this when the GATT system is clearly under severe pressure.</PARA>
<PARA> The European Community (EC) should be-and no doubt will be-concerned about the international odium which it will carry and deserve for the breakdown so far of this round. The inability of the political leaders of the EC to see beyond the narrow interests of their own farming lobbies to the interests of other sectors of their economies, not to mention the international trading system as a whole, should now be a stinging indictment which should create the environment, hopefully, for a major reassessment of the approach which the EC has taken to the negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, one of the clear messages which emerged from last week's meeting was that the Cairns Group and the United States remained rock solid in their resolve to keep agriculture on the table and not to accept a minimalist outcome. The Cairns Group has ensured, much to the amazement and chagrin of the EC, Japan and others, that no round of trade talks can ignore the legitimate trading interests of a large number of efficient exporters, many of whom are developing countries. In that respect a great deal of the credit for the outcome lies with Australia in its role as Cairns Group convener and with my colleague Dr Blewett, who has carried on the extremely fine tradition set initially by his predecessors John Dawkins and Michael Duffy. The failure of the round owes nothing to the performance, which has been extraordinarily energetic and is acknowledged to be highly professional, of Australia's key Ministers and official negotiators.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the disappointments that last week represented, the Government will remain committed to the successful prosecution of the round in the coming weeks. We can only hope that that objective is shared by our major trading partners, who do need to bring a new sense of commitment to the round in the post-Brussels period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Has the attention of the Minister for Industrial Relations been drawn to complaints by Mr Reith, the Opposition Treasury spokesman, about the current industrial relations system, when he said, `It is inflexible. We have an inflexible and rigid industrial relations system'. Does the Minister support Mr Reith's view or was Mr Reith describing the system he supported under the Fraser Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5243" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have in fact noted the comments of Mr Reith. I have always believed that the prerequisite to an opinion was to know something about what one was talking about. That clearly is not what Mr Reith thinks is a prerequisite to an opinion. He thinks that one can just simply fill an opinion out with empty rhetoric and windy observation rather than in fact portray any understanding about the details of the industrial relations system in this country. Indeed, when the coalition was in power it presided over a period of simple indexation and at the end of its period attempted to introduce a wages pause, which was all centralised wage fixation and inflexible and rigid in the classic terms that Mr Reith has used those words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, in stark contrast, carried out a thorough reform of the Industrial Relations Act in 1988 and introduced, among many other reforms, quite important reforms to enable the parties to reach what are called certified agreements under the Act and contract out of the award system so that industry specific agreements can be reached, reflecting the aspirations of the workers in the industry and the management in that industry, segregated out of the whole of the wage fixing system.</PARA>
<PARA> As well, through the accord, we have been able to introduce ongoing and comprehensive reforms to labour market management and the industrial relations system in this country. The first and most significant is the ongoing process of award restructuring, which is an innovation of this Government-it has not been attempted by previous governments-which enables employers and unions to work at overhauling each of their awards to remove the traditional barriers that have been placed there over time and in a way which can improve their efficiency and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, in the Act we provided for an award flexibility clause, which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has now taken up, in each particular award where the applicants to that award so seek it, to enable employers and employees to agree, within the framework of an overall award, on working conditions tailored to the particular needs of that specific enterprise. A number of those have been availed of in the period since this power became available. There are also award facilitative clauses, which have made awards less prescriptive on issues such as working time arrangements and work organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> All this has been done at a time when we have maintained the need for a centralised wage fixing system to be able to deliver aggregate wage outcomes consistent with our economic objectives. No policy that Mr Reith has ever advocated can give anyone in Australia any certainty that the Opposition has a view about how it will arrive at, in a budgetary context, an aggregate wage outcome for this country or how it will replace the present cooperative system of industrial relations that we enjoy in Australia and succeed in managing the economy in the way in which wages policy has been managed over the past eight years of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> If we revert to the policies that Mr Reith espouses and those that the coalition was manifestly guilty of during its period of office, we will have confrontation, division and Australian being set against Australian. We will not have flexibility. I think that Mr Reith should undergo a quick course on what the accord stands for, what the Act means and what the provisions of the Commission deliver before he criticises this Government about a lack of flexibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Will the Minister tell the Senate what tests are carried out by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories on imported foods, and whether they are adequate to detect most food contaminants that are likely to be found in imported foods?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5245" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question relates to a structure that was introduced by the Government last year, a structure which is geared towards protecting Australians and Australian consumers from the risk of imported food that may be contaminated. The program is coordinated by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and all of the testing is the responsibility of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. The structure is such that the Imported Food Risks Advisory Committee (IFRAC) identifies the categories of food that pose risk to human health, and those foods are then made subject to testing. It is a broadly representative committee which, importantly, constitutes representatives of State government health departments, consumer groups and importers associations as well as the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The program commenced in a limited way in April 1990 and was expanded in July 1990 to include a broader range of tests. Since April something like 2,183 samples of food have been tested under this program. The bulk of these tests have been for listeria in cheese, about 910 samples; microbiological contamination of prawns and oysters, 281 samples; and, in peanuts, aflatoxins, heavy metals and organochlorides, 428 samples. In that time there have been 141 failures out of those 2,183 samples-6.5 per cent-and most of those failures have come in a limited number of areas. Crustacea, cheese and coconut have very small failure rates, but prawns, oysters and peanuts are foods that have been identified as being an area of concern.</PARA>
<PARA> The results to date highlight a number of areas of concern and, as I said, those areas that should be concentrated on are oysters and peanuts. For instance, during October, 40 per cent of oyster samples tested for microbiological contamination and 20 per cent of peanuts tested for organochlorides or heavy metals exceeded the food standards code maximum residue limit. That food standards code is the limit that the IFRAC applies to ensure that the food that is imported and is being tested conforms with the domestic food standards code, a code which adequately identifies whether a particular batch of food poses a threat to the health of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, those two areas of concern have been highlighted by the IFRAC and testing has been undertaken. Although in operation for less than a year, this particular program has already shown itself to be of potentially great advantage to consumers in this country in terms of ensuring that they are protected from public health risks associated with some imported foods.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several portfolios could probably cover an answer to Senator Bjelke-Petersen's question. I think the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which of course used to fall under Senator Cook's supervision, has been sampling imported peanuts from all countries from about July of this year as part of its imported foods inspection scheme. In nine of 14 samples taken from batches of Chinese products, traces of the organochlorin benzene hexachloride (BHC) have been detected in the imported peanuts. The level of BHC residues detected was very small, less than 0.2 milligrams per kilogram. These levels are in fact comparable to those set for other food commodities which are widely consumed in Australia. For example, the Australian food standards code establishes maximum residue limits of BHC in meat of 0.3 and in milk of 0.1 milligrams per kilogram respectively. These standards apply equally to domestic and imported goods as it is not the intention of the NHMRC to promote health interests as an artificial barrier to trade. I know Senator Bjelke-Petersen is not suggesting that, either. The relevant data in this particular case have been assessed by the NHMRC Pesticide and Agricultural Chemicals Committee, which considers that consumption of this batch of Chinese peanuts, containing up to 0.2 milligrams per kilogram of BHC, should not present a hazard to human health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, as with meat and milk products, there needs to be a standard set for the import of peanuts from overseas. I believe that appropriate levels will be considered by the Public Health Committee shortly, but I understand the concerns of peanut growers in Australia that the pesticides which are used as part of the agricultural production worldwide should, nevertheless, not persist, albeit at a level which results in damage to the health of consumers. In so far as Australian peanut growers take particular steps to ensure that public health is safeguarded, the same requirements should be made in respect of imported peanuts and all other foodstuffs. It is important to note that the Federal Government has announced its support for the labelling of unpackaged peanuts coming into this country so consumers will know the country of origin of those unpackaged peanuts and can make a choice-a choice which would support, I have no doubt, Australian peanut growers. The unleashing of the power of consumers in the marketplace can support these important areas of peanut growing which, of course, are of concern to Senator Bjelke-Petersen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of achieving efficiency, it will streamline and make consistent government contracts at all levels of government in Australia. It is also intended that the contract will achieve-and we anticipate that it will-over $100m in cost savings to industry and government over the 1990s. It will apply to all governments, and we will soon contact local governments. In that respect, the Brisbane City Council was also present at the conference at which the contract was launched. The Council also recognises the achievements and opportunities that can come out of a common contract in this area. As I said, the common contract means that the terms and conditions under which suppliers deal with governments are consistent across the country. As a consequence, costs and efficiencies are enhanced. The contract was launched and, in fact, is available for industry consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the lack of awareness on the other side of issues such as this, when the contract was launched the Director of the Australian Information Industry Association, Bob Mounic, publicly welcomed the initiative. The Association, at least, appreciates the sorts of savings and efficiencies that can be achieved by this sort of approach in government. The approach fits very much within the concept of the new federalism initiative. It is a tangible outcome whereby State, Territory and Commonwealth governments operate together. It is also one which underscores the degree of complexity involved in trying to be consistent. In this case we had to achieve a contract which could be used across all the different legal systems in Australia and across all the requirements that those legal systems ensure are put in the way of obtaining consistency in contracting.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not intend to stop here. Other ideas were put forward at that conference to achieve the aim of reducing the cost of tendering for government business. The Opposition does not understand the direct impact of all that-that is, with reduced costs for tendering, Australian businesses can obtain greater access to government contracts. As a consequence, those businesses can get a bigger slice of the government purchasing cake.</PARA>
<PARA> All these objectives form part of the rationale for the move towards a common contract. At this early stage, it has been welcomed by industry. It has been appreciated by industry as having cost saving opportunities for it. It is a pity that those on the other side either cannot understand that or just do not want to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fair to say that funding for local government is an issue under consideration by governments. In fact, it was discussed at the Premiers Conference in 1989. In terms of the actual levels of funding for government, we have a number of arrangements in operation. For a start, we have a financial assistance to local government scheme which operates under legislation that has been in operation for four years and which will be reviewed after mid-1992. That review will comprise representatives from Commonwealth, State and local governments. On the basis of that review and also as a result of the Premiers Conference which took place recently, the Government will be looking at funding and considering whether funding should be allocated on the basis of a council's efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not going to respond to the political point scoring that Senator Calvert is indulging in here, but I ask the Senate to acknowledge that, when we talk about assistance from Federal government to local government, we are talking about some $700m of government expenditure.

Hope springs eternal in Dr Coogan's heart, as it does in mine, in relation to some of these industries. Over the last few years there have been many failures of small technology-intensive companies, but we have also seen for the first time in Australia the growth of some technology-intensive companies with significant critical mass. Computer systems integrators, software houses and companies such as Memtec Ltd have all attained a degree of critical mass probably for the first time in the recent history of this country, and that is very welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Deputy President Riordan, who is hearing this matter, adjourned the hearings because of the absence overseas of significant union officials and company representatives who are on a mission to examine best practice in overseas meatworks. This mission was supported by this Government to try to improve the information base of practitioners on both sides of the industrial relations fence in the meat industry so that they can find better models of behaviour and practice in order to manage a more harmonious industry. That is one of the missions that we have supported to try to bring more rational coherence to the practice of industrial relations in the industry. I am aware that Deputy President Riordan saw this as significant and did not wish to proceed while those leaders of the industry and the unions were away. So the answer to the first part of the honourable senator's question is yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to the second part of the question, the fact that AMIEU representatives did not appear at all is not abnormal. It is frequently the case-in fact almost universally so-that the people who appear on behalf of organisations in the Industrial Relations Commission are the professional advocates retained by the organisations. It is not usual for the leading officers of organisations to appear and argue in their own right. They retain counsel or industrial officers for that purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They can give evidence if they are called and if they are required to give evidence. They could do that, but that is not the point of the question. The point of the question is why they did not appear. The answer is that it is not usual and normal for that to occur. I turn to the third part of the question concerning the number of strikes. There have been a number of strikes in this industry. I have previously said that the Government does not condone any of them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr President. May I also ask that Senator Hill be brought to order because I am sick and tired of him barking away like a little lap-dog at the fringe of a debate while I am trying to answer a serious question from Senator Crane. I do not assume that, because there is a high incidence of strikes, all the right is on one side and all the wrong is on the other. Therefore, I do not assume that I should barrack exclusively for one side and oppose exclusively the other side. I believe the appropriate course is for the Government to step back and enable the independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission to do its job, listen to the arguments, look at the particular circumstances of each case and make an adjudication in those circumstances based on the evidence before it. In that sense I do not condone strike activity. The reason we support the continued existence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is so that it can do its job of preventing and settling industrial disputes. We believe it should be given the opportunity to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<ANSWER PAGE="5252" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Question Time the other day Senator Spindler asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, a question regarding non-cash incentives. I have now received a response from the Treasurer and, because it is of some length, I ask that it be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>BRIEFING ON LEASE INCENTIVES</PARA>
<PARA> - Where a business taxpayer is offered a cash or non-cash incentive to enter into a lease of business premises, the incentive will be income of the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA> - This position was confirmed in relation to a cash lease incentive by the decision of the Full Federal Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling 90 ATC 4472. On 16 November 1990 the High Court refused special leave to appeal against this decision.</PARA>
<PARA> - Mr Cooling was a partner in a firm of solicitors. The firm of solicitors was paid $162,000 as an incentive to procure the firm's service company to accept a 10 year lease of a whole floor of a building in Brisbane. Mr Cooling was assessed on his portion of the incentive payment, $21,060.</PARA>
<PARA> - It is the view of the Commissioner of Taxation that this decision extends to non-cash lease incentives received in similar circumstances, that is to encourage a business taxpayer to enter into a lease of premises to be used by the business.</PARA>
<PARA> - Non-cash benefits which have been offered as lease incentives include such things as rent-free periods, rent-discounts, cars, boats and paintings, free fit-outs, the payment of removal costs and payments for the surrender of the existing lease.</PARA>
<PARA> - The Government legislated in 1988 to ensure that non-cash business benefits which were not convertible to cash would be treated as if they were convertible to cash. These provisions will apply to lease incentives provided in similar circumstances to Mr Cooling. The provisions are contained in section 2lA.</PARA>
<PARA> - Section 2lA provides that if the non-cash business benefit would otherwise have been deductible, the benefit will be reduced by the amount of the deduction. This provision will have the practical effect that in relation to a lease incentive provided in the form of a rent-free period, the benefit will effectively be tax-free.</PARA>
<PARA> - The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that he is in the course of preparing a draft ruling which will outline the proposed treatment of cash and non-cash lease incentives, and on the penalties which will apply if a taxpayer has not disclosed the receipt of such a benefit. It is anticipated that the draft will be released to the public by the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> - Yes, the Government is aware that lease incentives are provided in the form of non-cash benefits. The legislation which was enacted in 1988 is considered to be adequate to ensure that these benefits are assessed in the appropriate manner.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="5253" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week Senator Walters asked me a question concerning the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and a legal opinion in relation to it. Honourable senators will recall that an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Guild was signed on 23 November and on the same day both parties sought a determination from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal that the agreement take effect from 1 December 1990. The Tribunal did not issue such a determination. In seeking a determination from the Tribunal, the Government had firstly obtained legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department which indicated that under the legislation the Tribunal was required to implement the agreement as soon as possible and that there was no authority for the Tribunal to hold a public hearing on the matter. Independent legal advice obtained by the Tribunal supported the advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department. However, it raised doubt over the description of parties entering into the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement was between the Commonwealth and the Guild, whereas legislation refers to an agreement between the Minister and the Guild. This in the Solicitor-General's view is an arguable technical point. However, in view of the doubts raised and in order to promptly resolve the matter, action was taken to amend the agreement. Contrary to misinformation distributed by the Opposition spokesman for health, Dr Woods, this amendment had no adverse financing effects for taxpayers. The costs to the Budget had already been incurred as a result of the Tribunal's decision in November not to issue a determination but instead to call a public hearing to consider the impact of the agreement. A revised copy of the agreement was provided to the Tribunal on 7 December. In accordance with legal advice from independent and government bodies, the parties sought that the Tribunal cancel its hearing of 18 December and issue an appropriate determination as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA> That we, the undersigned, call for the full and total recognition, by Federal Parliament and the High Court and all government agencies that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth according to law and its heritage, traditions and customs.</PARA>
<PARA> That as Australia prepares for the Centenary of Federation on 1st January, 2001 AD we celebrate our Centenary as a Christian Commonwealth as described by the Founders of Federation such as Sir John Downer, who said ``The Commonwealth will be from its first stage a Christian Commonwealth and as stated in our Federal Constitution-``Relying on the Blessings of Almighty God . . .''</PARA>
<PARA> That our Federal Parliament therefore implement the following policies before 1st January, 2001 AD.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Adoption of a Christian National Anthem-``God Bless Australia'' to the tune of ``Waltzing Matilda''.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The adoption of a Christian National Motto-``One Nation Under God'', for use on our coins, banknotes, etc.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> All State Governments, States' Attorneys-General, womens' organisations and the vast majority of men, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation, distribution and classification of X-rated and excessively violent R-rated video and printed pornography into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition also draws attention to the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA> - the great majority of X- and violent R-rated videos are imported,</PARA>
<PARA> - this is a Department of Customs responsibility under the control of the Federal Government, and not the Government of the ACT,</PARA>
<PARA> - thus it is the responsibility of the Federal Parliament to make Australia a happier and safer country for men, women and children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the Members of the Senate to:</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that I reported to the Senate on 4 December 1990 on the concerns of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances with this instrument. Those concerns were that the instrument may not be in accordance with the parent Act, that discretions affecting individual livelihood may not be subject to Administrative Appeals Tribunal review, and that provisions empowering officials to enter premises may not include sufficient safeguards. The Committee has now received advice from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, which meets its concerns, including an undertaking to amend some provisions of the guidelines. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for his cooperation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence of the Committee on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>13 November 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Hon John Dawkins MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Employment,</PARA>
<PARA> Education and Training</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Industry Training Agents' Guidelines No.l made under s.94 of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 8 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 7 and 8 set out detailed criteria for qualifications and conditions for registration as an industry training agent. Clause 9 provides for the cancellation of registration as an industry training agent. A Note to clause 9 in the body of the instrument helpfully advises that where a registration is cancelled under s.93 of the Act then AAT review of the decision is available under s.95 of the Act. The Committee assumes that AAT review is also available for decisions made under clauses 7 and 8. If so, then it would appear useful to include similar notification of review rights in Notes to these clauses. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also raises the validity of cancellations under s.93 of the Act. That section provides that the ``training advisory body may cancel the registration . . . if the training body is empowered, under the guidelines, to cancel the registration.'' (Emphasis added.) There does not appear to be such a power in the Guidelines, apart from where a person has requested cancellation. Clauses 9.3 and 9.4 are drafted as if such a power exists, and the Note to clause 9 also assumes that the power exists. However, the actual drafting of clause 9.3, which seems to be intended as the relevant provision, does not include an express power of cancellation. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 8.14 provides that a registered training agent must allow the training advisory body to enter premises and inspect or copy records and the agent must make the records available and answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would appreciate your advice on the relationship between these provisions and s.98 of the Act, which also provides full powers of entry and inspection of documents. </PARA>
<PARA>The Guidelines do not provide that persons entering premises under clause 8.14 produce any form of identification. The Committee normally insists that provision be made for such persons to produce photographic identity cards. In this context, s.98(2) provides for written identification and also provides that the person entering must leave on request if this identification cannot be produced. </PARA>
<PARA>Your advice is also sought on any penalty for a breach of clause 8.14 if an agent refuses to comply. Under s.98 there is a penalty of $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, there appears to be no protection against self-incrimination in relation to the questions which may be asked. </PARA>
<PARA>Your advice would be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Patricia Giles</PARA>
<PARA>Chair</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Standing Committee on Regulations</PARA>
<PARA> and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate the helpful comments and suggestions in your letter of 13 November 1990 concerning Industry Training Agents' Guidelines No 1. </PARA>
<PARA>The suggestion that appeal rights be footnoted under clauses 7 and 8 of the Guidelines does not seem appropriate. Clause 7, qualifications required for registration, and clause 8, conditions of registration, are not in themselves subject to appeal. Decisions and appeals concerning registration, which take account of these conditions, are provided in the Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no perceived relationship between subclause 8.14 of the Guidelines and section 98 of the Act. Section 98 of the Act empowers officers of the Australian Public Service to enter premises and inspect records relating to financial obligations imposed under the Act. Subclause 8.14 differs, since it refers to the powers of the training advisory body to enter premises, inspect records and ask questions of a registered industry training agent, in relation to determining whether the agent is carrying out its duties under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no intention to impose a financial penalty on industry training agents for a refusal to co-operate under subclause 8.14. As mentioned, there is no relationship between section 98 of the Act, which provides a penalty of $1,000, and subclause 8.14. Since co-operation is part of the condition of registration, the training advisory body is authorised to cancel registration and there is no criminal penalty to be imposed under the arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>The matters raised in your letter which appear to require an amendment to the Guidelines are, in summary, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> - removal of the requirement for a registered industry training agent to answer questions, to ensure consistency with section 98 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> - provision for procedures, including appointment of authorised officers and proof of identity, concerning access to premises and records of a registered industry training agent, in a manner consistent with section 98 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> - the need for express powers for the training advisory body to cancel registration where a registered industry training agent is of unsound mind or is undergoing imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>Attached for your consideration are clauses which have been drafted to give effect to the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be grateful if you would confirm that the proposed amendments are satisfactory so that I can make amending Guidelines in time for them to be tabled before the end of the current Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The role of the Office of Australian War Graves is very important. In the words of the annual report, it exists to commemorate individually the sacrifice of those Australian men and women who gave their lives during or as a result of their service for Australia and the Commonwealth and to maintain these commemorations. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the Office of Australian War Graves is responsible for the maintenance of 19,520 war graves and 3,336 memorials to the missing. As well, it is responsible for the erection and maintenance of standard memorials to eligible men and women who have died post-war. These number approximately 170,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Australian War Graves has been improving its administrative procedures, according to the annual report, but it is still experiencing some delays in achieving the target of completing all commemorations within three months. This is because graves cannot be dealt with within that time frame, for proper reasons, and also because applications are not being returned promptly. There is a need still to improve this system. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters I would like to raise from the annual report. One matter relates to tenure, and page 9 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Cemetery authorities are increasingly adopting the overseas practice of placing a tenure of 25 to 50 years on graves and crematoria niches. This has been strongly resisted on behalf of veterans but is likely to become law in some States. Where perpetual commemoration cannot be guaranteed, alternative arrangements for commemoration in our own Gardens of Remembrance may be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to the third matter I wish to raise from the annual report: the gardens of remembrance in South Australia and New South Wales. One can see that increasingly these gardens of remembrance are going to be extremely important. I asked a question of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) nearly a fortnight ago about gardens of remembrance in South Australia and New South Wales, and he was totally unable to answer it even though he is himself a South Australian senator. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a contract arranged in August 1988 for a new New South Wales garden of remembrance which would hold 100,000 plaques when completed, and it was to be the largest in Australia. That project has been unduly delayed by industrial problems, wet weather and contractor bankruptcy. As a result, the price of that garden of remembrance has doubled from $3.1m to a final cost of about $6.3m and its completion has been delayed for over a year. One can imagine what effect that outcome has had on the next of kin and the strains it has placed upon them in that context. In addition in South Australia, unsatisfactory specification of the work has created greater delays there. The annual report concludes on this aspect by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The erection of the new Gardens in South Australia and New South Wales could only be described as disasters from the aspect of time, cost and quality. The employment of Australian Construction Services as the construction authority on any future major War Graves projects must be carefully considered. </PARA>
<PARA>What a scandal it is-with something so important to our national heritage, to the men and women who fought for this country, to the taxpayers of Australia-to see the waste and the incompetence of the management of those programs. That blow-out in costs is, I remind honourable senators, coming out of the Department of Veterans' Affairs budget, all because Senator Bolkus and his construction people cannot get their job done properly. Similarly, with the Concord repatriation hospital in New South Wales, there has been a blow-out of $5m which had to be settled a few months ago because that same Construction Services organisation could not run that job properly either-and, once again, that amount is coming out of the Veterans' Affairs budget. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford to have wasted dollars like this when the need to look after our veterans is so great as they age. We cannot afford to have this scandalous misuse of taxpayers' money, this waste and this incompetence, just because this Government is not interested in administration or in looking after the interests of our veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to pass a comment or two about the administration of Australian war graves. Having had the opportunity recently of visiting some of the grave sites in Flanders, I wish to extend my congratulations to those who are administering this aspect of the portfolio of Veterans' Affairs. I think it is impossible to attend war graves anywhere, but particularly those in Flanders, without being deeply moved and enormously impressed by the way in which they are presented. That obviously reflects the attentiveness of those who are charged with their administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We visited the Office of Australian War Graves administration in Flanders and were enormously impressed by the ease with which one can obtain data about the location of graves and details of those whose graves are located in the various sites around north-eastern Europe.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it highly ironic that we are here today talking about war graves with some applause and some criticism about how they are managed when in fact what we have at the moment on our political agenda in this country is the possibility of a whole new generation of war veterans being created and of war graves being needed. The guts of the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 4 December was: if there's a war on, we'll be in it. So if indeed there is a war in the Gulf, we will look back in history and see this statement made on 4 December as being the definitive statement of the Prime Minister of this country, the first Labor Prime Minister ever to take Australia into a war, our sixth war this century-and that is a terrible situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here we are not having dealt with veterans from previous wars, and yet we are considering creating another whole body of people who will either be maimed for the future or who will be dead at the end of a war. We have not yet dealt with Vietnam veterans. As the United States Vietnam veterans have pointed out so poignantly to President Bush, `Don't let us create another generation of vets; we have not dealt with the last ones yet'. Exactly the same could be said of the Australian veterans. In the United States, 60,000 Vietnam veterans have committed suicide since that war finished-that is, more people than were actually killed in the conflict in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many Australian Vietnam veterans who are still very damaged psychologically as well as physically and emotionally by that experience. Let us not create another generation of veterans that we have then to look after. Let us look after the ones we have already got. There is a placard down there on the avenue that leads up to the Australian War Memorial which says, `This space reserved for a memorial to the Vietnam casualties'. We have not yet dealt with the last generation of victims of war. Let us not create another generation of victims of war-and that is exactly what our Prime Minister has on the agenda for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough. The Prime Minister does not have the permission of the Australian people to consider war an option in the Gulf. His saying in his gung ho fashion, because he supports the United States come what may, that if there is a war, we will be in it, is highly offensive, immoral, degrading and disgusting for this country. We should have no part in the slaughter that will ensue in the Gulf, whether it is condoned by the United Nations or not. </PARA>

I am sure that those on all sides of this chamber, and, indeed, the Parliament as a whole, welcome what has been happening in the Gulf region-the attitude of Saddam Hussein to the hostages and the movement toward negotiations to bring about some form of resolution to the impasse that has existed for some time. For whatever reason, if Senator Vallentine chooses not to recognise that, she can remain one out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by reflecting on the comments that were made by a previous speaker in drawing attention to the significance of ensuring that war graves are protected, preserved and maintained in a manner in which they ought quite properly to be. We ought to be acknowledging, without apology, the role that those who are now buried in those graves played in preserving democracy, not only for Australia but for the Western world, and their role in creating and maintaining an environment which allows the Senator Vallentines of this world the freedom to rise to their feet in indignation at and in contempt of the views expressed by others and allows her the freedom to demonstrate and protest, sometimes outside the laws of this land, in the way that she does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When discussing the 1989-90 annual report of the Office of Australian War Graves, one cannot help thinking of the mindset mentality that prevailed in parts of Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, in the thirties, in the pacifist movement which gave succour and comfort to those who discouraged armament by Great Britain and caused Churchill to have a great deal of difficulty in arming the United Kingdom. One can only speculate that, if Hitler had been stopped when he first began his annexation and when he first marched into the Rhineland, 50 million people might not have been massacred in the Second World War. One might well ask what world we would live in now if there had never been a resistance to Hitler, if the majority of people had accepted the view that Senator Vallentine proffers today-that is, peace at any price. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an interesting parallel, when one reflects upon it, that Saddam Hussein is doing now exactly what Hitler did. He marched in, invaded and occupied another sovereign nation. As we all understand, it is but the beginning of his pan-Arab ambitions. If we are to stand by now and accept that as not being our responsibility or not being the responsibility of the United States or anybody else, we beg the question of what sort of a world we would have and what sort of a world Senator Vallentine would want us to live in. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The period covered by the 1989-90 annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation has been notable for the great difficulty the Australian Taxation Office has been facing in coping with the consequences of so much legislation, much of it correcting previous deficient legislation, particularly in the area of capital gains. But the Australian Taxation Office has tended to diminish or reduce its costs, responsibilities and administration by transferring such factors to the taxpayer, with the result that there is now a minimum review of the assessment of the tax return as lodged. That is later followed up through a taxation audit. </PARA>
<PARA> The major problem facing taxpayers is self-assessment. There is an insufficient legislative base, with too great a reliance on income tax rulings, with the result that there has been a great deal of uncertainty before the law. That is not good in a democracy. Although tax agents and taxpayers, particularly the corporate taxpayers, have been requested not to lodge much of their documentation and paperwork other than the official limited information on the tax forms, many taxpayers are opting to ignore this advice and to provide more detailed information in order to protect their interests, including the minimisation of penalties as an insurance against possible future action. </PARA>
<PARA> The operations of the Australian Taxation Office have not been without some criticism. The McKinsey report testifies to this. Also, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia has drawn attention to certain shortcomings in the administration of taxation law in Australia. The Government, of course, has no excuse for further delaying the first instalment of the tax simplification or the Green Paper, which was promised earlier this year and originally scheduled for August. It is now well overdue. However, we must commend the Australian Taxation Office for what it has done in terms of tax simplification. The report is with the Government. The criticism is not with the Office but with the Government. Sales tax simplification is moving along quite nicely and I would like to commend the Office for the work it has done. </PARA>
<PARA> The year has been notable for the passing of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). This will bring to termination or to the grave many companies which will be unable to meet their tax commitments on 15 December. I call upon the Government to ease the requirement to pay tax on this date because corporations in these straitened economic times simply will not have that ability. We drew the Government's attention at the time of the passage of the legislation to the fact that it will certainly cause a cash crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the recent amendment passed by Parliament, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), whereby the Commissioner of Taxation can apply to a court of summary jurisdiction to have a conviction or order set aside for prescribed taxation offences. Generally, I must say, this has been applied with a great deal of discretion and compassion; however, not all States are using this provision, as is the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Tasmania, and I draw the Taxation Commissioner's attention to this law to ensure that the new Act is appropriately used in necessitous circumstances where judges are perhaps being a little too severe in imposing unreasonable penalties. However, I would like to commend the Taxation Office for what it has done in setting up the problem resolution sections. I believe they are working quite well. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that the Commissioner of Taxation has signalled that an attempt will be made to deny a deduction for defence costs to companies which have been targeted for takeovers on the grounds that they are capital costs. There do appear to be certain circumstances where this is a harsh approach. For example, to deny a company costs which were statutorily incurred under the Companies Act of informing shareholders preparing a part B and part D statement appear to be not outside the normal accepted costs allowed under section 51 of the Income Tax Act. I inform the Senate that a lot of defensive action is really akin to an insurance policy. However, to the extent that capital structures were changed, the Deputy Commissioner would probably be right in denying a deduction in this particular area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to offer a few comments on the 1989-90 annual report of the Australian Commissioner of Taxation. I draw the attention of the Senate to page 138 of that report, which documents the enormous success of the fringe benefits tax which was levied for the first time by the Hawke Labor Government from 1985 onwards. We all know that before the fringe benefits tax was levied, in effect, a number of people were receiving non-cash remuneration. Tax avoidance was going on in the community; people were receiving part of their remuneration in non-cash forms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the first time in Australia's history, this Government decided to crack down on this effective form of tax avoidance by levying the fringe benefits tax. That tax was long overdue, and it is now generating enormous revenue for the Australian Government. According to this report, the value of fringe benefits amounted to $2.385 billion-over $2,000m worth of fringe benefits in the community. About half of those fringe benefits were in the form of company-provided motor vehicles, the value being $1.1 billion in that year. From the very important fringe benefits tax we are now collecting over $1,100m annually. It is now a $1 billion tax. Fringe benefit tax collections continue to come in ahead of Budget revenue predictions. In this Budget, the collections were $48m ahead of Budget predictions, as has been the case in most years with this particular tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of the fringe benefits that are now taxed is one measure of the prior amount of tax avoidance that was going on in the community by a privileged group which had company-provided cars and a whole range of other assets provided to them as benefits. We are now generating over $1.1 billion in extra revenue from this tax. It is high time the Opposition came clean and told us what it intends to do about this tax, because when we debated this tax in 1985, and later, Opposition spokespersons told us repeatedly and regularly that they were going to abolish the fringe benefits tax. I want to know now what Mr Reith's attitude is to the fringe benefits tax. Mr Reith is the shadow Treasurer in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to know what the Opposition's attitude is to the capital gains tax, because the report that we are now looking at points out very clearly that in the revenue year 1988-89, the value of capital gains-that is, the increases in asset values-was $1.5 billion. Of course that is after the adjustment for the consumer price index impact on asset values; it is the real value of gains. The net tax collected was $543m, a very tidy amount of revenue-a sizeable sum. It is a very important tax which cements the basis of our personal income tax in Australia. The capital gains tax generates further revenue through the income tax system as well as collecting revenue itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to know what Mr Reith's attitude is to the capital gains tax. The people of Australia deserve to be told what the position of the shadow Treasurer is on the capital gains tax. He has procrastinated and delayed coming forward with concise, clear statements of what he would do about the capital gains tax in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The report shows that some $10,000m was collected from sales tax in the last year of data. The present sales tax completely exempts clothing and most food items in the Australian community. It excludes almost 99 per cent--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise to comment briefly on the Australian Commissioner of Taxation's annual report 1989-90. As usual, it is an excellent report, with very extensive information on the activities of the Office. In terms of general administration, a few points should be made. First, a significant reduction has been achieved in time lost due to injury and illness. No doubt the reduction by 20 per cent in the cost of Comcare's workers compensation premiums is due to that. It shows how attention to proper planning of workplaces and equipment can yield results in both human and financial terms. The very low level of industrial disputation in the Taxation Office-that is, until the recent dispute which has affected the issue of refunds-also deserves comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The audit program has again been successful. The revenue raised from the large case audit program more than doubled, from $160m in 1988-89 to $373m last year. This was more than 60 per cent above the estimate. The average tax raised per case on these strategic examinations has grown from $282,000 to over $600,000 last year. One alarming statistic is provided by the result of fringe benefits tax audits conducted last year in that government agencies were found to have underpaid fringe benefits tax by over $6m. Perhaps government agencies are beginning to learn from some of their private sector counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> One positive trend which appears is that the percentage of audit cases in the desk audit program which actually suffer adjustment is falling. This shows that voluntary compliance is increasing, especially in the area of interest and property income assessments. That is a welcome development, as it shows that the thrust of the strategy of the Taxation Commissioner, Mr Trevor Boucher, appears to be having some success. I note that the Opposition has been a bitter critic of Mr Boucher's and has especially complained about the successful large company audit program. But since it is always talking about reducing taxation rates, it should acknowledge the value of both voluntary compliance and the key role that effective audit programs play in promoting compliance by all taxpayers. It is clear that some members of society will contribute only if they are compelled to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know of the chronic Budget problems that the United States Government has experienced during recent times. I draw the Senate's attention to an excellent article by Mr Ian Wallshutzky which appeared in the September edition of the Australian Accountant entitled, `Will Australia follow the United States with Tax Audits'. The author pointed to the decline in audit activity over the last decades and the consequent fall in voluntary compliance in the United States. This has mirrored almost exactly the shortfall in revenue which the United States Government has experienced. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter which is of concern is the Government's intention with respect to the various relief boards which deal with income, fringe benefits tax and payroll tax liabilities above $500. Statistics have been provided in the annual report, although they were omitted from the 1988-89 report. Last year, of 1,965 applicants, almost 1,000 were granted full or partial relief. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator TAMBLING: I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is presented to the Parliament in order that senators and members of the House of Representatives, and in fact any other interested person, can overview the activities of the Australian parliamentary delegation which visited Switzerland and France in September and October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation also had the opportunity to attend the European Commission and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in Brussels, as well as participate very actively in the Council of Europe and the European Parliament in Strasbourg. In that respect, I am sure that senators will find the comprehensive report interesting and, in many respects, timely and topical. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues were addressed against the background of some very dramatic changes in Europe at the time of our visit. For example, German unification; the early consequences of the Gulf crisis, particularly as they would impact on east Europe; the entry of the United Kingdom into the economic monetary union; and the important considerations surrounding the mad cow disease that affected the beef price industry. The report addresses many of these issues and has now been presented to Parliament to enable a very comprehensive study of the current issues that are going on in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that normally a report of this nature would probably not be presented to the Parliament until about March or April next year. The delegation members decided that, in view of the important issues that were addressed and canvassed, it was important that we bring the reporting date forward, which we have done. The delegation visited some four countries and it met across the table with approximately 150 politicians, commercial leaders and a very wide range of advisers to government and to the various institutions in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that there are serious changes going on in eastern and central Europe and in the Soviet Union, which of course impact considerably on the capital requirements of Europe, the changing trade patterns, changes that are happening in the fields of education and technology and, importantly, the areas of defence and security, particularly those issues surrounding NATO. The changes in the east European countries bring with them dramatic social, trade and defence issues that have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> All members of the delegation were struck by the fundamental changes that are occurring in the Soviet Union and are apprehensive and fearful of many consequences that could flow, particularly in the area of defence, which are now receiving considerable media attention several weeks after the return of the delegation. It is also important to note that the debate on the common agricultural policy of Europe continues. It has been highlighted dramatically in the last few days by the lack of resolution at the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions. There are important implications not only for farmers but also for the consumers in Europe. The implications that this will have on the Australian economy need to be seriously addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the only issue on which members of the delegation were not able to reach a common view this year related to our visit to the Chinon nuclear power station south of Paris where, not surprisingly, the views of members of the delegation were sharply polarised, as has often been demonstrated in the debates in this Parliament. Nevertheless, it was important that the delegation visited the Chinon power station on a day when the lid of the nuclear reactor was lifted and the nuclear uranium fuel rods were being changed. The delegation was able to observe many of the issues relating to the consequences of waste in the entire industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the entire delegation visit the issue that struck me most was the changes that are happening in tourism and those changes that are related closely to the environment. The report addresses in some detail the changes that will be required both for marketing purposes and for future environmental considerations by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report. It was a pleasure to represent the Senate this year on this occasion. The company of the other senators and members of the House of Representatives was convivial and, at the same time, very constructive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a member of this delegation to speak briefly to the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European Parliamentary Institutions. As Senator Tambling has said, it was indeed a privilege to be a member of this particular delegation. I commend the report to members of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On our visit to Europe at this time, we saw and heard many things which suggested to us that Europe is in a state of incredible change. The speed of change is enormously challenging to government. It is throwing up issues of profound magnitude. This report cites some of those issues and provides insights on it that we gained from the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise the importance of this delegation each year to European institutions. As honourable senators would know, on most occasions it is preceded and followed by a visit to a European parliament. On this occasion, we visited the Parliament of Switzerland beforehand, then Belgium throughout the visit to the European institutions and, subsequently, at the end of the delegation's visit we attended the French Parliament for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is virtually impossible to overemphasise the importance of being there. Our involvement in those forums and institutions is of vital importance, especially with the changing status of the European institutions. The report cites significant matters. I will touch on just two issues which are not mentioned in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I make the observation that the whole of Europe is trying to come to grips with the problem of agriculture, which has been an essential element of the recent debates on international agricultural policy. The fact is that European farmers are extremely productive. They produce too much and are being subsidised by their governments to produce less. They are also being subsidised to stay on their farms, but in doing so to produce less. This gives rise to an extraordinary contradiction really. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were in Switzerland it occurred to us in the course of our discussions that we were really talking about-if we view this process differently or laterally-governments subsidising farmers to become conservationists in situ. The Swiss Government is beginning to see quite clearly that it must keep its farmers in situ, that it is the farmers who are in fact keeping Switzerland as it has always been. Environmentally and, in every sense, culturally and socially, that is of profound importance. It is possible to view the money that we are paying these farmers to stay there and do that as being a process of subsidising conservationists in situ rather than encouraging farmers to be less productive, et cetera. In other words, we can see it in a positive sense rather than in a negative sense. I suggest to the Senate that this is the beginnings of the new perception about how we have to see this process of subsidising farming. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question which struck me quite vividly when we were taking part in the debates in the Parliament and the Council of Europe was that we are constantly living with the implications of the enormous changes of central and eastern Europe. The leaders of the new democracies in central and eastern Europe are saying to the West, `Teach us how to be like you. Teach us how to become market economies. Teach us how to become democracies of the Western style. Teach us to be like you.' I think we have to ask ourselves what we are going to teach these people; what sets of values we are actually going to transmit to them as being the appropriate sets of values of the post-communist era in a densely populated, increasingly unstable, increasingly poverty-stricken and, indeed, devastated part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that not only the political leaders of Europe but also the political leaders of the world, and especially of Western society, have to address this question seriously. Certainly, the answers that we received were that we have to teach them about development, market economies and dollars and cents-the implications as we have seen them for the last four or five decades in a prosperous and yet, in many respects, socially sterile and bankrupt Western set of values. </PARA>
<PARA> In some respects, I think that was the most profound issue that occurred to me while participating in this delegation. It is an invaluable opportunity for parliamentarians to visit and take part in these institutions every year. I commend the process of the delegation and specifically this report to the Senate. I thank my colleagues with whom I took part in this delegation. I congratulate its organisers and my colleagues on what I saw as a very positive and valuable process. </PARA>

<PARA>The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill removes the discriminatory provisions in the Australian National Museum Act 1990 preventing people 65 years or over from being members of the Board or a Director of the National Maritime Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill brings into effect the amendments unsuccessfully moved by the Coalition in the Committee of the Whole on September 19, 1990 prior to the Act receiving The Royal Assent on November 20, 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> On that occasion, the Australian Democrats joined with the Government to prevent the removal of subsection 4 of section 17 which states: ``a person who has attained the age of 65 years shall not be appointed as a member and a person shall not be appointed as a member for a period that extends beyond the day on which the person will attain the age of 65 years'', as well as subsection 2 of section 30 which states: ``a person who has attained the age of 65 shall not be appointed as Director and a person shall not be appointed as Director for a period that extends beyond the day on which the person will attain the age of 65 years''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has subsequently reversed its opposition to the Coalition's policy of removing age discrimination from new legislation pending the outcome of the Government's review of this question, as is evident by its recent acceptance of a similar Coalition amendment extending eligibility for membership of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority to people 65 years or older. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have also reversed their previous support for the Government's discriminatory approach and have welcomed the Government's support for the Coalition's anti-ageist amendment to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does not affect the need for the Government to continue its wideranging review of age discrimination in Governmental bodies, but it does ensure that this further increase in the number of Governmental bodies exercising age discrimination does not take place pending the outcome of the review, particularly as there are several bodies, such as the Australian National Gallery, which are not subject to age discrimination. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill seeks to establish a statutory framework to secure the health and safety of Commonwealth Government employees while at work. In doing so, it will provide Commonwealth Government employees with the protection of modern occupational health and safety legislation similar to that which is presently enjoyed by both public and private sector employees in most States. </PARA>
<PARA>The incidence of occupational death, injury and disease in Australia, including in Commonwealth Government employment, is unacceptably high. On average, each week, over 3000 workers experience a compensable work injury resulting in a period off work of one week or more. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the human suffering involved, occupational injury and disease results in massive costs to Australian industry and the community through the need to provide medical and rehabilitation services, retraining and workers compensation schemes. There is also a huge cost through lost production. Working time lost in Australia as a result of occupational injury and disease has been estimated at around 10 times that lost through industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to determine a precise estimate of the total costs involved. On the basis of the Australian National Accounts figures the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the cost of workers compensation claims in 1989/90 was $4.8 billion. This direct cost alone represents 1.3% of Australia's non-farm gross domestic product (GDP). If all the associated indirect costs, such as lost production and retraining were included, this figure would be much higher. </PARA>
<PARA>At a time when Australia faces considerable economic difficulties and is striving to improve its international competitiveness by improving productivity and holding down costs this is a cost which cannot be ignored. Every effort must be made to reduce it. </PARA>
<PARA>It follows that the reduction of occupational injury and disease should be seen as an integral part of efforts to improve Australia's performance through the Government's microeconomic reform program, including workplace reform through award restructuring. It is essential that consideration be given to improvements in occupational health and safety, when changes in job design and work patterns associated with award restructuring are being developed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, these are the reasons which make improvements in occupational health and safety essential. Of course, this Government's commitment to improved occupational health and safety is not new. It is contained in the ALP platform and was included as a key factor in the non-wage element of the Accord. That commitment arose because it has been known for many years that Australia has a relatively poor OHS record. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1983 the Government commenced negotiations with the States, unions, employers and OHS professionals about the development of a national approach to occupational health and safety. In 1985 we established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental aims of the Commission are to rectify the consequences of the previous fragmented and piecemeal approach to occupational health and safety and to provide a national focus for the development and application of uniform OHS standards and strategies. The Commission is thereby facilitating the development of a uniform approach to OHS across Australia and the most effective use of scarce OHS resources. This will avoid the duplication of effort which we as a nation can no longer afford. </PARA>
<PARA>An important element of the Government's overall OHS strategy is the development of legislation for the protection of its own employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Unlike other workers in Australia, Commonwealth employees are not covered by comprehensive occupational health and safety legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1983, this Government commenced extensive consultations on the content of OHS legislation to cover the area of Commonwealth responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>An important development which coincided with consultations on this legislation was an extensive review of compensation and rehabilitation arrangements for Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Commonwealth's expenditure on workers compensation in 1989/90 was $240m. Our compensation costs had been rising significantly for a number of years. The problem had to be tackled not only to reduce costs but to ensure that Commonwealth employees were protected from occupational death, injury and disease, and that injured workers were assisted to achieve a prompt return to work by effective rehabilitation and adequate and timely support, treatment and financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has created an integrated approach to prevention, compensation and rehabilitation. A progressive compensation and rehabilitation system was introduced under the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and is administered by the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees (COMCARE). It is designed to minimise the human and financial costs of work-related injury and disease while at the same time providing adequate compensation and support for long term incapacitated employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Those reforms are complemented by this Bill. It aims to provide mechanisms for reducing occupational injury and disease that give rise to these unacceptable human and economic costs. </PARA>
<PARA>During the extensive consultation processes and the development of the resulting legislation, the Government was anxious to ensure that worthwhile improvements in OHS were not delayed unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, after careful consideration of the direction of consultations and the likely content of the resulting legislation, the Government agreed to the implementation of interim OHS agreements between the management of individual public sector bodies and relevant unions. These agreements cover the detailed OHS arrangements to apply in individual Commonwealth bodies. It is not intended that this legislation override these arrangements except where any provisions of those agreements are contrary to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President I will now describe some of the major features of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is a comprehensive piece of legislation. A key aspect of the Bill is the emphasis it places on direct involvement by employers and employees in workplace OHS. Accordingly, it requires Commonwealth employers and employees in each workplace to take greater responsibility for the management of health and safety in that workplace. In this way it is consistent with the modern co-regulatory approach already adopted in most States of Australia and the A.C.T. as well as a number of overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation provides for regulations and codes of practice to be developed to cover specific problems. At the same time it imposes a duty of care on employers and employees, as well as manufacturers and suppliers of plant and substances, to take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure a safe and healthy work environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides a framework for employers and employees to co-operate and consult in addressing health and safety matters in the workplace through the establishment of designated work groups and health and safety committees, and the selection of health and safety representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation will be administered by COMCARE, with a small core of permanent staff providing an advisory and investigation service. The service will assist Commonwealth agencies in complying with the Act, provide technical advice and have the power to issue improvement and prohibition notices and other orders and directions. In addition to the expertise of its own employees, COMCARE will be able to draw on outside experts, including State and Territory Government OHS inspectors, to provide advice and assistance on particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill covers the employees of Commonwealth departments, statutory authorities, Government Business Enterprises and companies. Commonwealth employees will be covered in Australia or overseas, although not all provisions will apply overseas. The Bill covers persons employed by the Commonwealth under a law of the Commonwealth and of a Territory or under a contract of service or apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA>We have ensured that the legislation will not prejudice Australia's national security or its defence. It provides arrangements which enable particular provisions to be declared not to apply or to apply in a modified form, in relation to specified matters concerning national security and specified members of the Australian Defence Force. The legislation also provides for particular provisions to be declared not to apply in relation to certain covert or dangerous operations of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, where the application of the Bill to a person who exercises a power or function under a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory would prevent the proper exercise of that power or function, regulations may be made excluding the Bill, or particular provisions of the Bill, from applying to that person. </PARA>
<PARA>Standards. An important aspect of the Bill in terms of the Government's commitment to encouraging a uniform national approach to OHS is that it provides for the adoption of standards and codes of practice which have been declared by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC). Where they exist, and are capable of relating to Commonwealth employment, these standards and codes will be adopted within the Commonwealth employment sector in all States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>Where there are no NOHSC standards or codes the Commonwealth will adopt the existing State or Territory standard, pending review of its appropriateness and applicability to the Commonwealth sector. There will, of course, be consultation with State and Territory authorities in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>I am hopeful that the Commonwealth's intention to adopt NOHSC standards for its own employment area within all State and Territory jurisdictions, will provide further encouragement to States and Territories to implement NOHSC standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I have mentioned earlier that the Bill establishes workplace arrangements which are an integral part of the concept of co-regulation, and provide the framework for ensuring the participation of employees in OHS matters, and co-operation and consultation between employees and employers. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to describe these arrangements in detail. The mechanisms for their establishment, and their various functions, are listed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it is important to note a number of aspects in relation to the powers of the health and safety representative. He or she has the power to issue a provisional improvement notice requiring the employer to take corrective action to stop or to avoid a breach of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, in an emergency, where the representative believes there is an immediate threat to health and safety, the representative may order a cessation of work, but only when a supervisor cannot be located. If a supervisor is located, the supervisor has the right to decide whether work should cease. This approach has been adopted in most of the existing OHS agreements in Commonwealth agencies but has rarely, if ever, been used. </PARA>
<PARA>A health and safety representative who misuses his or her powers is liable to be disqualified by COMCARE from holding such a position for up to five years. The Government will closely monitor the activities of health and safety representatives and take whatever action is necessary to ensure there is no abuse of their power. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for an advisory function for COMCARE which will be most important in assisting employers, employees and contractors with their obligations under the legislation and in dealing with OHS problems. Use of the advisory facility may be a first step in an investigation process. I have already mentioned that the legislation enables COMCARE to refer requests for advice to experts outside the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Investigations. While the legislation's co-regulatory approach, which I have outlined here, emphasises co-operation in securing health and safety in the workplace, it is recognised that there needs to be effective enforcement of standards. The Bill provides investigators with comprehensive powers to enable them to adequately enforce its provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>These include powers of entry, and powers to issue prohibition and improvement notices to remove threats to health and safety or to stop or prevent breaches of the legislation. An inspector entering a workplace is required to carry an identity card and produce it upon request. </PARA>
<PARA>Appeals. The Bill provides for appeals against the decisions of investigators. In each case, the appeal is to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, referred to in the Bill as the ``reviewing authority''. </PARA>
<PARA>Sanctions. The Bill, provides, where a breach of the legislation occurs, that financial penalties can be imposed on Government Business Enterprises, or their employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Manufacturers and suppliers will also be liable to prosecution and fines for contravening the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth departments and authorities which are not Government Business Enterprises may be the subject of a report to Parliament if found to be in contravention of the Act. Employees of such agencies may be subject to disciplinary action under the Public Service Act or other terms and conditions applying to non-Australian Public Service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is not intended to exclude the application of the criminal law in appropriate cases. Instead, it is intended that the criminal law of the States will continue to apply to Commonwealth employees to the extent that those laws are capable of concurrent operation with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate that I say something about the level of pecuniary penalties which this Bill imposes upon Government Business Enterprises and individuals who contravene the legislation. Those penalties have been set at levels which have regard to the range of penalty levels in similar State legislation. This is again consistent with the policy of striving for greater consistency in OHS legislation, standards and strategies and will ensure that persons who breach the Commonwealth legislation are penalised in similar manner to persons who breach equivalent State laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact. The cost of implementing the proposals included in the Bill will be offset by savings already being achieved by COMCARE through the rehabilitation of long term compensation claimants and by a reduction in accidents in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>Five additional staff resources will be required by COMCARE in the first two years of operation and ten by the third year. This will involve a salary cost of 0.4 million dollars by the third full year of operation. Contract staff will be used to supplement the minimal permanent resources, at an estimated additional cost of 0.5 million dollars in the first year, decreasing to 0.2 million dollars by year 3. </PARA>
<PARA>There will also be some additional expenditure for essential operational costs. The total cost during the first three full years of operation will be between 1.1 and 1.4 million dollars per annum. The legislation will commence operation six months from the date of proclamation of the Act and, to facilitate this, ``start-up'' costs of the order of $0.3M will be incurred during the six months leading up to the commencement date. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, individual agencies may incur additional expenditure to implement the workplace arrangements. The net additional cost attributable to this activity cannot be precisely estimated due to the wide variety of existing occupational health and safety arrangements currently in place in various Commonwealth agencies and the offsets and savings which will be associated with revised arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision of a safe and healthy working environment and the increased emphasis on co-operation to achieve such an environment is expected to reduce the incidence of accidents and injuries for which the Commonwealth would be liable. Implementation of the provisions of the Bill should, therefore, result in reduced Commonwealth expenditure on compensation and associated costs such as unnecessary retraining, lost time and sick leave. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill contains important reforms which, together with the compensation and rehabilitation arrangements already in place, will ensure that commonwealth employees receive the protection at work to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind honourable senators that at the time the debate was adjourned we were discussing the Australian Democrats amendment which was focusing on a very critical aspect of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, namely, the special circumstance or the exemption provisions of the legislation. Honourable senators will recall that, as a result of the passage of an earlier amendment, the Industrial Relations Act will now require that organisations achieve a membership of 10,000 within a prescribed period unless they can convince the Industrial Relations Commission that their circumstances are special and that they should be provided exemption. This has proven to be one of the most controversial aspects of the Bill and, in an attempt to clarify what is meant by a special circumstance, there has been a good deal of consultation. Indeed, the Minister had undertaken to provide the Committee with a clarification of what was meant by `special circumstance' and was about to table such a clarification at the time that our debate was adjourned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the Democrats are of the very strong opinion that organisations should not be forced into marriages involuntarily. In other words, there should be no shotgun weddings, to use the expression that we have come to use in the popular vernacular, because it prob- ably conveys to the Australian public the potential implications of this legislation. The Democrats have insisted that the process by which organisations plead their case for exemption should be a public process. We believe that it is within the powers of the Bill to provide for-and the Bill indeed does provide for-a healthy process of exposure. We are advocating by these amendments that the process should be a public one; it should be as open and as convincing as is poss- ible; and it should be seen to be true and just and appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister gave the Committee the undertaking prior to the adjournment on Thursday that his clarifying statement will put at rest the concerns that small organisations have that they are being forced into marriages that are inappropriate and forced into amalgamations which in some cases they had previously tried and found to be unsatisfactory. I think it is appropriate that the Minister provide that clarification through a tabled ministerial clarifying statement. We are aware that that statement will have standing before the courts and it will guide the courts in the interpretation of the Government's intention, and in fact, the legislation's intention, in relation to `special circumstance'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague for attempting what appeared to be the impossible and turned out to be so. The statement by me was explained the last time this matter was before the chamber so, without going back to do a synopsis of my previous remarks, let me go straight to the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 provides in clause 14 for a two-stage review by a designated presidential member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of the continued registration of unions whose membership is below certain levels. The first stage, under proposed section 193 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, will involve unions whose membership is below 1,000 members who are employees. The second stage, under the proposed section 193a of the Act, will involve unions whose membership is below 10,000 members who are employees-the figure being 10,000 because the proposal of the Government was recently amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The term `employee' is defined in subsection 4 (1) of the Act to include any person whose usual occupation is that of an employee. There are certain other classes of persons who, under sections 188 and 202 of the Act, may also be members of unions registered under the Act. These are not persons who come within the scope of the Commission's powers to prevent and settle industrial disputes and are therefore not relevant to the purpose of a union's registration. </PARA>
<PARA> Each stage of the review is to commence within the period specified for that stage in proposed new sections 193 and 193a. These proposed sections are closely modelled upon the present 193 of the Act, varied only in relation to the implementation of the two stages. Provision is made in proposed subsections 193 (6) and 193a (6) for the designated presidential member to cancel the registration of a union which does not have the required level of membership. This must occur if the presidential member is not satisfied that special circumstances exist that justify the continued registration of the organisation in the public interests. </PARA>
<PARA> An identical requirement exists in the present section 193 of the Act. This relates to the review of the continued registration of a union with fewer than 1,000 members who are employees. The Industrial Relations Bill 1988 had proposed a threshold figure of 3,000, but this was amended in the Senate to the present figure. Since the Act commenced it has become clear that the present provisions are not realistic requirements for unions participating in Australia's principal industrial relations system, which deals with matters of national importance in the economic, industrial and social fields. Trade unions must be capable of being effective partners with government and employers in achieving progressive changes in these areas. It is the Government's view that a federally registered union must, in the usual case, be sufficiently large and well resourced to take an effective part in the national industrial relations system. This view is also consonant with the voluntary activity now occurring in the Australian trade union movement to restructure itself, producing fewer and larger unions with greater industry focus. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, as I acknowledged in my second reading speech, it does not follow that the national system has no place for unions with fewer than 10,000 members. It is precisely for this reason that a special circumstance exemption is to be available. A question has arisen about its width. There are two related elements to the proposed exemption. The first is the demonstrated existence of special circumstances. The Bill does not define the term `special circumstances'. This is deliberate; to attempt to define it would defeat the aim of providing a broad discretionary power. The objective is to provide a discretion which has flexibility and which admits full scope to take account of the facts of particular cases. The second element is that where there are such special circumstances, it is in the public interest for the organisation's registration to continue. It will be entirely for the designated presidential member, when exercising this discretion, to determine whether these elements are satisfied, but the discretion will not be exercised in a vacuum. A statutory discretion must be exercised having regard to the scope, objects and purpose of the Act in which it is found. In the case of the Industrial Relations Act, this requirement is reinforced by section 90. Under that provision, the Commission must in the performance of its function take into account the public interest and for that purpose have regard to, among other things, the objects of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The explicit objects of the Act are set out in section 3. Particularly relevant to the exercise of the discretion are the objects of promoting industrial harmony and cooperation among the parties involved in industrial relations in Australia, found in paragraph 3 (a); encouraging the organisation of representative bodies of employers and employees and their registration under the Act, found in paragraph 3 (f); encouraging the efficient management of the organisations, found in paragraph 3 (h); encouraging and facilitating the amalgamation of the organisations, found in proposed paragraph 3 (j); and encouraging and facilitating the development of organisations, particularly by reducing the number of organisations that are in an industry or enterprise, found in proposed paragraph 3 (k). </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, depending on the circumstances of each case, the designated presidential member may decide that the elements justifying continued registration exist where, for example, any or a combination of the following criteria are satisfied at the time of the review: (a) whether there is any other organisation which can represent under the Act the industrial interests of the members of the small organisation and, if so, whether that other organisation is prepared to do so and would do so satisfactorily; (b) whether the industrial interests of the organisation's members are such that those interests would be likely to be better represented under the Act if the organisation remained registered; (c) the views of those members about which organisation should represent their industrial interests for the purpose of the Act; (d) the extent, if any, to which the organisation is attempting by appropriate means-for example, increasing its membership or by amalgamation-to obtain more than the required number of members and whether it would be reasonable to give it a further opportunity to do so; (e) whether cancelling an organisation's registration would be likely to harm industrial relations in the industries or enterprises of employers of persons eligible for membership of the organisation; (f) whether the continued registration of the organisation would be likely to contribute to good industrial relations in those industries or enterprises; (g) the organisation's record of active and constructive participation in industrial relations; and (h) whether the organisation is the major union in a particular area of economic activity of employers engaged in similar or related businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of these examples should not be taken to imply that any of them should be given any particular or additional weight by a designated presidential member when considering an organisation's continued registration, nor should they be taken to limit the matters which can be taken into account. The examples are simply intended to illustrate three points: firstly, that if a nationally registered union is unable or unwilling to increase its membership to the threshold level, it will be for that organisation at a hearing for the purpose to demonstrate that there are sound reasons for its continued participation in Australia's national system of industrial relations as a registered organisation; secondly, that the special circumstances test is not intended to be narrowly or rigidly applied; and, thirdly, that if it appears to a designated presidential member that there are good reasons in the public interest, in the context of the Act, for a union subject to review to continue to be registered, that should occur. </PARA>
<PARA> That concludes the statement and, as I said at the beginning of it, it is intended-and deliberately so-to be used for interpretative purposes in proceedings before the Commission where it seeks to interpret or understand the legislative intention of those amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Durack uses emotive expressions such as `arrangement' and `happy with' and things like that which do not convey much. The realities are that the Australian Democrats had grave concerns about the requirement to strengthen the exemption provisions. I discussed these with Senator Durack, Mr Howard and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). All the way along the Democrats have been concerned about how to strengthen the exemption provisions. We had discussions with the Minister about how to do so and there were two possibilities. The first was to amend the legislation as such, which, as the Minister has quite rightly pointed out, would have reduced the flexibility and would have placed constraints upon the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in servicing the needs of smaller organisations which were convincing in their argument. I was convinced, as was our party room, that this route-an explanatory statement with the same standing as it would have had had it been in the legislation but not as constraining-was the preferred route. The fact that the Opposition may not be convinced by that and that the Opposition, having enunciated its principle of opposing anything that strengthens the legislation and supporting anything that weakens it, is frustrated by the fact that this choice has been made, is its problem. The Democrats have no problem with this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that the ministerial explanation-having the same standing under the Acts Interpretation Act as a second reading speech or, indeed, in guiding a court, the same standing as the words of an Act itself-is the preferred way to deal with this. It does not place unnecessary constraints upon the Commission. We were convinced by that argument. I can assure the Committee that people worked very hard at convincing us. There were many hours of discussion and, in fact, papers were prepared to convince us that this was the best route and the route which would improve the legislation but, at the same time, attend to the very real needs that were brought to us by small organisations, both on the last occasion and on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The honest answer is that we did have long deliberations with the Government over this matter. We did attempt to have long deliberations with Senator Durack, which we truncated because of the Opposition's totally irrational and unethical stand as legislators. We chose this as being the best route. The answer is that, yes, we are satisfied with the statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean is going from one ridiculous statement to another in relation to negotiations that he had with the Opposition on this matter, but I am afraid that he has gone a little too far in this allegation of some sort of unethical conduct in relation to this matter. In fact, both the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and I had discussions at some length on two occasions with Senator McLean over a period of time, which makes it very difficult to bring to a sharp point of focus what those amendments favoured by the Australian Democrats were going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, a document dated 27 November, which was probably received by me shortly after that, and which was conveyed to my colleague the shadow Minister, contained the amendments that the Democrats proposed to make to clause 14. The wording of the amendments starts off in the way that the wording of their present amendments starts off. After paragraph (c), there appeared the following sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>In deciding whether special circumstances exist, the presidential member must consider, but is not limited by, the following matters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then proceeded to detail eight different matters which should be taken into account by special circumstances. Those views were presented to us as the final form of the Democrats' proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> It was with some surprise that I heard a day or two later from Senator McLean that they would not be going on with the limbs of their amendment beyond paragraph (c). Of course, we now have before us these earth-shattering amendments from Senator McLean to the effect that when a presidential member has before him a proposal by a small organisation, the member should consider special circumstances as to why it should be allowed to survive this draconian shotgun-I think Senator McLean suggested this term once-process of amalgamation which is provided for in this legislation. According to the amendments we have before us, the presidential member must do these epoch-making things. He must fix the time and place for hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I am goaded to explain what happened between the Democrats and the Opposition because I am being accused of unethical behaviour. If Senator McLean had not introduced these allegations of unethical behaviour, we might have been able to get on a bit more quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that we have before us amendments which are totally unnecessary, in view of what Senator McLean has done. He proposed some amendments which may have had some purpose. As recently as 27 November, as I said, he was proposing those amendments. He has now sold out on his amendments because of the undertaking which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has now given by way of a statement as to the way in which the Minister believes that a presidential member will go about applying the statutory provision of special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we now have before us a totally unnecessary amendment with three limbs which are only an introduction to what was intended to be a more significant amendment which has now been abandoned. Certainly, the Opposition has no objection to these three amendments, except for the fact that they are totally unnecessary, as is the next group of amendments. I am intrigued to know what value either the Minister or Senator McLean think the statement made by the Minister has. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill that is before us states that if an organisation, which is defined in the legislation as having fewer than 1,000 members, or now fewer than 10,000, by certain dates, which we will be discussing later, is still in that benighted state, in the eyes of the Government-it may have only 9,000 members when it should have 10,000 members-and it has not proceeded to amalgamate, under this Bill the presidential member has to consider the situation. Unless he finds that there are special circumstances, as Senator Walters pointed out so clearly the other day, the registration of that union must be cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that Senator McLean is still under the illusion that if a poll were carried out by members of such a union and they decided that they wanted to continue as a union, that would stop the cancellation. It might, if the presidential member thought that that was a factor worth taking into account. I see that that is one of the matters which, according to the Minister, may be taken into account, just as a lot of matters may be taken into account. The Minister has indicated in his statement that it is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the things that are to be taken into account. Special circumstances do indicate fairly clearly that any old reason would not be good enough. In fact, I do not suppose that the presidential member is likely to take such a wide, benign view of the phrase `special circumstances'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not exactly an ambiguous phrase. It does indicate a view, fairly clearly, of the legislators, of ourselves, as to what the role of the Commission would be. The argument that has been used by both the Minister and Senator McLean is that it would be a pity to constrain the presidential member by having these examples incorporated in the legislation. I pointed out that the amendments submitted to me by Senator McLean did say that the presidential member must consider, but was not limited by, certain matters. The Minister has made it clear in his speech that these were only examples. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not matter whether they were in the Act or in the Minister's statement. They are not supposed to be exhaustive, nor should they be. That is clearly the idea of having a phrase such as `special circumstances'-so that the discretion that must be exercised by the presidential member is emphasised, along substantial grounds at least, for allowing the union to continue. That is really the point of this whole phrase, and it is not changed one whit by what the Minister has said. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that seems to have got into the head of both the Minister and Senator McLean is that this statement has some value. I think the Minister did say at some stage that he was relying on the Acts Interpretation Act for the use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an Act. The section that deals with that, section 15ab of the Acts Interpretation Act, makes it very clear that the use of this extrinsic material is available only where a provision is ambiguous or obscure. I think it would be hard to say that this was the case here. </PARA>
<PARA> The extrinsic material which may be allowed to be taken into account is listed in paragraphs (a) to (h) of the Acts Interpretation Act. This Act was reprinted and the version as at 31 January 1990 is apparently the latest position. The Act deals with various things, such as reports of parliament, royal commissions, international treaties, explanatory memorandums, and so on. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>(f) the speech made to a House of Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in the House;</PARA>
<PARA>So a second reading speech is extrinsic material. Then the Act deals with a number of other things, such as relevant documents, Journals of the Senate, Votes and Proceedings, and so on. There is certainly no mention of a statement extracted from the Minister in the course of a committee debate as a substitute for an amendment. I am somewhat mystified as to what this statement is all about. Perhaps it might be clarified by Senator McLean, who seems to be totally satisfied with the legal significance of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that I rise at this point. I do so in recognition of the argument that Senator Durack has put and the fact that in a former government Senator Durack was an Attorney-General and therefore greater weight may be placed on his arguments than ordinarily ought to be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I should say is that the central question of this debate is whether we have faith in the designated presidential member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-as, if you like, in colloquial terms, the umpire-being able to recognise what is the most appropriate circumstance to give effect to the broad objectives of the Act. The second question is: if we do recognise that role, given the specific reservations of the Australian Democrats and the Government's real commitment to the freedom of association convention, what is the best way to reflect our concerns?</PARA>
<PARA> There seem to be two options. The first option is to set out in the Bill, or sub- sequently in the Act, comprehensive amendments aimed at each conceivable circumstance. The problem with that is that we can conceive of a range of circumstances. This legislation is to stand for a considerable time, I anticipate, and I do not think it is proper for us to be cast in the role of trying to conceive of every circumstance. Indeed, where we are put in that position, often our imagination is found wanting, given that fact is frequently stranger than fiction. The second option is to invest in the umpire-in this case, the designated presidential member-the discretion, but to set down the particular guidelines as clearly as we can. </PARA>
<PARA> Having put it in simple terms, let me go to some detail. No matter how carefully the definition is drafted, it is highly likely to be subject in this field in the future to considerable argument and litigation. We recognise that whatever we write may be well the subject of argument and litigation. The examples that we might give would inevitably become the primary considerations in the reviews of the continued registration of small organisations and the focus for determinations by the Commission under the proposed sections. This may have the undesirable effect of drawing attention away from other matters that could be regarded as justifying a small organisation's continued registration. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision reproduces the existing special circumstances formula-that is, the present section 193-which was developed in consultation with representatives of the employers; in this case the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions at several of the meetings held by the National Labour Consultative Council. It was deliberate legislative policy not to qualify the expression `special circumstances'. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say it was deliberate for a number of reasons. There are other examples in Commonwealth legislation of the use of the term without any qualification-for example, in the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, with which the courts have had no difficulty and indeed have enjoyed some judicial support. As Fogarty J. of the Family Court of Australia has observed, it is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . difficult and in a sense undesirable to lay down any precise definition of the meaning of or attempt to catalogue the circumstances which may constitute `special circumstances' [within the context of the Family Law Act] . . . it is desirable to retain its flexibility of scope and application to the facts of particular cases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That judgment was in relation to the marriage of Schmidt (1979) 28 ALR 84, at page 95. Moreover, Burchett J. of the Federal Court of Australia has commented, in relation to guidelines under the Health Insurance Act 1973, which referred to special circumstances, that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is particularly important that the broad discretions, created to give a lively flexibility to the administration of the scheme, should not by the gradual deposition on judicial decisions, become fossilised into rigidity . . . (t)hose discretions are intended to be applied to a great variety of situations. </PARA>
<PARA>That judgment was from Chee Keong Thoo's case (1988) 78 ALR 307, at page 323. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, defining special circumstances in one case would create uncertainty in relation to the meaning of `special circumstances' where used in other provisions of the Act, for example, section 189 which requires various criteria to be met for registration under the Act, including, for unions, a minimum membership size and being industry based and, for employer bodies, a minimum number of employees. Those particular criteria do not have to be met where a designated presidential member is satisfied that special circumstances exist justifying the association's registration. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems of interpretation may arise because it will be seen that the Parliament has given legislative guidance on the meaning of `special circumstances' in one context but not in another. The discretion is to be exercised not, as in the case of some important discretions under Commonwealth legislation, by a departmental subordinate of a Minister, but by a highly qualified, experienced and independent presidential member of Australia's primary industrial relations tribunal-the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-which has judicial status and whose decisions can be appealed to a Full Bench of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that extended, somewhat legalistic, presentation in order that it be set down clearly in the record of this debate that the statement I have made concerning special circumstances is a statement which is deliberately intended to be accessed by a presidential member in a particular case for the purpose of determining the Government's intention in bringing it forward. Senator Durack has now raised the question of whether or not that is capable of being received by such a designated presidential member as guidance within the meaning of the Acts Interpretation Act and he has sought to quote from the Act. The first part he quotes are the words `ambiguous' and `obscure'. It may well be that Senator Durack sees nothing ambiguous and obscure within the terms that are set down in the amendments. However, I cannot anticipate what will happen in the future; I do not have a crystal ball and I am not gifted with prescience. In the volatile and robust field of industrial relations, I cannot anticipate what issues may be debated or how matters which call for judgment may arise. So I do not take the view that matters which are `ambiguous' and `obscure' may not arise in a proper debate before a commission concerning what the meaning of those provisions might be; nor do I say that my statement should not be taken as not being a part of the Government's intention and that the Government's intention should be limited only to what appears in a second reading speech. I deliberately prefaced my statement-in fact, I also concluded it-by saying that it was meant to be read as part of what the Government intended. Therefore, I would expect that in a case before a designated presidential member those words would be used as a guidance. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we either make the decision to vest some confidence in the umpire-the designated presidential member who sits close to the play of industrial relations, who observes the behaviour of the parties, who is knowledgable about the industries and is experienced in the field-to make the appropriate judgment, guided by these views as to what is reasonable, and to so decide, or we will clutter a Bill with quite extensive amendments which, by virtue of the way in which the law is expressed, cannot be discursive, elaborate, consider or imagine the various possibilities, and we then sit back and allow the profession of law to be practised at great expense to employers and unions in trying to uncover the real meaning of the legislation. It seems to me that the course being adopted by the Government and, in this case by the Australian Democrats, is an appropriate course. It is appropriate in any case, but it is especially appropriate in a matter such as this where the questions of what an exemption will be are very real and important questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have put it to the Government, sincerely and conscientiously, that they want a strong commitment from the Government which sets out the provision for exemptions; in fact, they have weighted their position strongly that exemptions can be obtainable in proper circumstances. The Government recognises, acknowledges and accepts that point. We, too, want to see that provision appropriately expressed in the legislation. Given the options, it seems to us that it is entirely appropriate, and indeed quite proper, that the amendment should be made and we accept the amendment, but it should be made as a caveat against a real knowledge of what is intended. When the second reading speech was delivered this amendment was not foreshadowed. At that point we could not have expressed our view of it. At this point, now that it has been moved, we can express our view on it and that is what I have done in my statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week when we were debating this clause of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 I said that the intention of the Government was to force the unions to amalgamate and that, indeed, the Australian Democrats were going along with that. I went into a fair bit of detail about how I was not surprised at the Government's view because it is its form of democracy to allow the unions to force their members to do as the unions want. But the Democrats bridled against it when I said that the Democrats' form of democracy was to force unions to amalgamate, and they said that I did not know what I was talking about. Honourable senators may remember that I then quoted from the Bill and said that of course it forces all of those small unions to amalgamate to constitute unions with 10,000 members. I quoted from subclause 6 of the Bill which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If, on exercising the power conferred by subsection (1), a Presidential Member is not satisfied that special circumstances exist that justify the continued registration of a small organisation . . . in the public interest, a Presidential Member must cancel the registration of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>This pointed out to the Democrats that if those small unions do not amalgamate the presidential member is forced to cancel their registration unless he believes it is in the public interest not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Democrat senators then said, `Wait for the Government's statement because we have agreed with the Government that it will make the statement and that it will be taken notice of by the Acts Interpretation Act'. But this is not so, as Senator Durack has just pointed out, because the Acts Interpretation Act takes note of the second reading speech only and, as the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has now acknowledged, this point is not contained in the second reading speech. I will quote from the Minister's statement, for the benefit of the Democrats. On page 1 of that statement it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Provision is made in the proposed subsections . . . for the designated Presidential Member to cancel the registration of a union which does not have the required level of membership. This must occur if the Presidential Member is not satisfied that special circumstances exist that justify the continued registration of the organisation in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is very clear that the provision is still there. The Bill does not define the term `special circumstances'. This is deliberate, and the Minister has spoken at length about that. We now turn to page 3 of the Minister's statement, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission must, in the performance of its function, take into account the public interest and for that purpose have regard to, among other things, the object of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the object of the Act. When we look at what is set out in the Minister's statement with regard to the object of the Act, we see that it is to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of organisations. So what on earth are the Democrats talking about? Democrat senators tell us that this is strengthening the provisions of exemption. That is a lot of rot. It does not do anything of the sort. Senator Cook is pulling the wool over Senator McLean's eyes right at this moment. All this ministerial statement is doing is enforcing the legislation and saying that the presidential member must deregister particular unions unless it can prove that it is in the public interest to do otherwise. It says that not only must it do that, but also it must take into account the objects of the Act. The prime object of the Act is to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean had quite a number of what he called `draft' amendments. I cannot see `draft' written on them. I have a copy here. It states that these are the proposed Australian Democrat amendments to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill as at 27 November 1990; it certainly does not mention the word `draft'. The Government has talked the Australian Democrats out of amendments (a) to (h). The Democrats have reneged and are now only pursuing amendments (a), (b) and (c). </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats tell us that the Government has strengthened the provision for exemptions, but it has not in any way. The Minister says that he hopes that the Acts Interpretation Act will be considered at the committee stage. Indeed, as Senator Durack has pointed out, the Acts Interpretation Act must take account only of the Minister's second reading speech. There is nothing in the Acts Interpretation Act that says that the presidential member has to take any notice of the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister tells us that we should have faith in the presidential member. Unless we say that to amalgamate is not in the public interest-and we must also take into account the objects of the Act; that is, to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation-naturally the presidential member must, and `must' is underlined, force these unions to amalgamate; he has no option. The Democrats cannot hide behind the fact that this Bill forces the amalgamation of small unions into the large unions of 10,000 members. I can see the Minister nodding his head. </PARA>

If the Democrats for one moment think that the people will accept that sort of democracy, they have another think coming. I ask the Democrats: if they really believe in democracy, do they also believe in freedom to join or not to join a union? I really would like Senator McLean to answer that question. Does he believe in freedom of association? Should every Australian be allowed to decide, without any pressure at all, whether he or she will join a union? That is the crux of democracy. While I know the Australian Labor Party's view, I would be most interested to hear Senator McLean's view on that form of democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very fine line between obtuseness and stupidity. Frankly, it has been tested this afternoon. I would like to address some replies to Senator Durack. Shortly after I arrived in the Senate, I recall Senator Chaney, as he then was, the former shadow Minister for industrial relations, telling me in the course of some discussions about industrial relations-I took it on good faith-that he regarded Senator Durack as having one of the best minds in the Parliament. I respect that opinion because we have subsequently become close friends. But this afternoon I am finding it a little difficult to give that statement quite that standing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accused-and quite deliberately-Opposition senators of being unethical in their approach as legislators to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. Mr Howard, the shadow Minister for industrial relations, told me-I asked whether he minded my making this statement public and he said no-that the Opposition would oppose any amendments that strengthened this legislation and would support any amendments that weakened it. What we are listening to now is the frustration of Opposition senators at the fact that an amendment, which I discussed with them on 27 November, is now not before the chamber so that they can support it in accordance with their principle of weakening the legislation. They are frustrated. In the light of that principle that was enunciated, I can understand that frustration. I believe that it is an unethical position to take as law makers. That is what I was referring to as being unethical. </PARA>
<PARA> I paid the Opposition the courtesy of letting it look at a copy of our amendments as they were on 27 November. A couple of days later, I paid Senator Durack the courtesy of a telephone call, which he did not refer to, telling him that we had decided not to proceed with that amendment as we did not think it was the best course of action. He expressed his frustration to me then. It was obvious to me that he was frustrated that we were not proceeding with an amendment that he could support because he thought it would weaken the Bill. But he did not make reference to the courtesy of that telephone conversation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I explained to the Senate that Senator Durack gave me no notice whatsoever of the Opposition's intention to move a profoundly significant amendment to the Bill that we processed prior to this one-the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990.

Let Senator Chapman name the price and the nature of the transaction. He has thrown down the challenge and I will respond later. I return to the debate. Perhaps it tends to emphasise this question of ethics or otherwise that is being brought to the debate by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is, as I was saying, that an amendment does not have standing until it is moved. We chose not to move this amendment. That is the point I was making before Senator Chapman interjected. We chose not to move it because we believed that there was a better way to do it, and the better way is what has just occurred. I understand that members of the Opposition are miffed by that. They are frustrated in their intention. Senator Durack used the expression that we `sold out on an amendment'. How meaningless is that? It is really an attempt to be emotive and to introduce pretty squalid stuff into a debate which is supposed to be about improving legislation-and that was our precise intent from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I paid some compliments to Senator Walters when I talked about her being a formidable opponent, about her being courageous, tenacious, determined and committed, but I qualified that by saying that she was also illogical, biased, prejudiced and selective. Let me quote some of the examples of the selectivity. Senator Durack was very selective in what he read out from the Acts Interpretation Act. He read out a section which said that this particular process had no standing, and he quoted certain sections from the Act. But he ignored section 15(AB) (2) (h), which goes on to explain that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any relevant material in the Journals of the Senate, in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or in any official record of debates in the Parliament or either House-</PARA>
<PARA>has standing. He chose to be selective and to ignore the significant subparagraphs which acknowledge the point that we had made about the standing of the ministerial statement. He failed to refer to section 15(AB) (1) (a), which elaborates further upon the standing and the circumstances upon which this sort of material has standing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters was quite precise in her citing of specific sections of the ministerial statement when pursuing the usual union bashing line that she gets up with over and over again and, in fact, was very selective in what she quoted from the ministerial statement. The Act, the ministerial statement and the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill itself go out of their way specifically to build the process of exemption to the point of fairness. In the final analysis, all the propositions that are contained in this Bill are tested in the ballot box of any union. In the final analysis-from somebody who has been involved in social action movements for some years-the union movement, if it did not like what was being enacted here, could bring this process to its knees by its response to it, and that will be the final test as to whether or not it is an acceptable process. That is the final test as to whether or not any law works. That is the nature of what we are confronted with as legislators, and so it should be in a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Senator Walters and Senator Durack have been absurd in their selectivity. They have been illogical in their approach; they have distorted what occurred before we got into this chamber; and they are miffed by the fact that their intentions have been frustrated because, for some reason or other, they sense that we did not cooperate with them. Senator Walters posed certain specific questions about the attitude and position of the Australian Democrats in relation to International Labour Organisation (ILO) requirements of freedom of association. The Democrats are of the same mind as the Government that the provision of the existing Act, and especially as it will be amended by this Bill, should meet the requirements of the ILO provisions for freedom of association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why the ILO?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is wrong. That is not the position of the ILO. We are not signatories to those particular clauses, and the request is that we become so. There is no difficulty in our mind with the position that is being advanced both in the Act at present and as it will be amended by this Bill in terms of freedom of association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question relates to what the Democrats' position is in relation to compulsory unionism. It has never changed in our 13 years. We do not believe that unionism should be or is compulsory in this country. The reality is that about 65 per cent of Australians are not members of unions. The proof of the pudding is in the fact that Australians are not compelled to be members of unions. The fact is that Minister Fahey in New South Wales recently chose to distort a major piece of legislation which was in excess of 300 pages long and to call it the Industrial Relations Amendment (Voluntary Unionism) Bill 1990 and that one clause of that Bill of 350 pages related to the question of voluntary unionism. He chose to distort the whole process, but that is not our way of doing things. The answer to Senator Walters's question is that we believe in voluntary unionism. There is voluntary unionism in this country today and about 65 per cent of Australians have chosen not to be members of unions. Senator Walters is grasping at straws. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we put this amendment, and presumably it will be done soon, I would like to turn to the question of the position of professional officers and members of organisations of professional officers. They came to us in strength and they put arguments to us on paper. They were good arguments, and we listened hard and long. Their argument was the fact that professional officers are in a special situation in relation to amalgamations and the requirement to amalgamate. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that in the second reading debate I referred to the Swedish model which takes them aside and addresses their circumstances as being special. But since then I am convinced of the fact that what we were being asked to do was to create a special class of people who did not have to prove under the Bill that their circumstances were special. In other words, it was inherently contradictory. If they have special circumstances-and I am convinced that they have-I believe that they will convince the Australian Industrial Relations Commission easily and those special circumstances will be acknowledged in the manner the Bill provides for. I do not believe there are any grounds for fear any more. I must admit that for some time I listened very closely to their arguments. I am now convinced that there are no grounds for fear. I do not believe I have to apologise to those people because I am convinced that the Bill as it will be amended will accommodate their requirements-and I am convinced of that by argument. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a final question which I would like to address just briefly, and the Minister for Industrial Relations may respond to this. The Minister is aware of the fact, as also is Senator Durack, that the Democrats had great concern about the standing of individuals in relation to industrial relations legislation generally. All of the industrial relations legislation in this country is very much organisation oriented; it does not overtly acknowledge the situation of individuals in the industrial relations context. We have always argued that we were not convinced that individuals could not be caught in impossible situations. In this place, as honourable senators will know, I have pursued the cause of John Ellenbogen in New South Wales. In the State jurisdiction he was caught as an individual in a most unenviable and unjust situation. I was concerned that this legislation might place individuals federally in similar circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will acknowledge the fact that that has been the subject of some considerable discussion. Senator Durack will acknowledge the fact that I had considerable discussion with him and Mr Howard about this matter. Senator Durack, as a former Attorney-General, assured me that the individuals were okay, that they had access to legal aid and that under common law they could pursue any difficulties they found themselves in in relation to their circumstances of contract with an employer. I am convinced therefore that the rights of individuals are adequately protected. Indeed, Senator Durack was one of the people who convinced me about it. Therefore we have backed off in relation to the rights of individuals in the context of this legislation, which has a strong organisational or collective bias to it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have discussed with the Minister, and with the shadow Minister and Senator Durack, the concept of an industrial ombudsman, because I believe this legislation has created fear among small organisations and individuals about their standing. I have advanced the suggestion that there should be an industrial ombudsman because I believe a lot of that fear is ill founded and unnecessary. I am convinced of that. I was not at first, but I am now. </PARA>

<PARA> The concept of an ombudsman struck us as being a way in which a lot of the unnecessary fear could be placated and we thought that an ombudsman could deal with a whole clutch of minor matters that would consume the time, resources and energy of the Commission at large, particularly when the Commission has been directed to undertake quite substantial tasks in relation to what we regard as an essential, positive, responsible and appropriate process of amalgamation, which this Bill is essentially directed towards. </PARA>

I must place on the record that I do not believe that the position that the Opposition is required to take is one which says that our job in the Parliament as legislators is to strengthen the Government's legislation-either this or any other Bill.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Can I just finish my response, Madam Temporary Chairman, to what you allowed the Democrats to say, because I think it is relevant. The Democrats are claiming that there is not compulsory unionism and that they agree with complete freedom of association. Yet they supported clause 11 which gives power to grant preference to members of the organisations. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The following matters are examples of the matters in relation to which it may be directed . . . that preference is to be given . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, preference to union members. It is stated in this legislation that the Government is giving preference to union members. The first example given is preference for engagement in employment. So if a person is not a union member, if he does not have a union ticket-no job. The second example given is promotion. If a person is not a union member, he should not ask for promotion. The third example is regrading and the fourth is transfer. The fifth is retention in employment-first off are non-union members. The sixth example is the taking of annual leave-people do not get a choice if they are not union members; union members get choice of annual leave. The other examples given are overtime and vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are just examples, so Senator McLean should not talk rot in this place. Of course we are talking about Government legislation that gives preference to union members. Engagement in employment is the No. 1 example, and No. 2 is promotion. So if a person wants a job, he must be a union man, in a number of closed shops. I am sure that Senator Cook would not disagree with that. Senator McLean should be ethical and talk about the legislation he is supporting. We are not supporting it. We believe in freedom of association. We do not believe that small unions which get together should be forced to amalgamate into unions of 10,000 members.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has made in relation to this clause this afternoon has been shown by my colleague Senator Durack to be largely irrelevant to the way in which the legislation would be applied by a court. That means that the onus for a union of fewer than 10,000 members continuing in operation and continuing to be able to represent its members effectively lies with the union. That is contrary to the principles on which this coalition would base any approach to industrial relations and that is why we oppose this particular aspect of the legislation. The amendments moved by the Democrats certainly ease that situation in some respects, but not in any really practical or applicable way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important part of this statement by the Minister is not in relation to any effect that it might have on this clause of the legislation, but in relation to what it reveals about this Government's approach to government and legislation generally. It reveals what the Opposition has been saying for some years now is this Government's approach: it is a corporatist approach to the management of this nation's affairs. That is revealed on the second page of the statement where the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>Trade unions must be capable of being effective partners with governments and employers in achieving progressive changes in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Three segments of our community are singled out-trade unions, governments and employers. In other words, big business, big government and big unions. That is all this Government recognises. It does not recognise small organisations. It does not recognise individuals, not only in the sphere of industrial relations but in any other sphere of activity in this country. That is all this Government is about-fixes and deals between big organisations, between government, big unions and big business. That is something which this coalition will not have a bar of. That is why we are opposed to this legislation, because this legislation and this clause simply further entrench that corporatist approach of this Government to industrial relations in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments that Senator Durack has put for our seeking to weaken this legislation as much as we can-because we are totally opposed to it-retain their validity and are worthy of the support of this chamber. There is no doubt that this legislation does restrict quite severely the right to freedom of association. Freedom of association implies that an individual can form and join any organisation of whatever size he chooses in dealing with any aspect of our social life, including industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will preclude an individual from doing that. It will remove that right from individuals unless they can appear before some presidential member and present arguments that it is in the broad public interest that their small organisation continues to exist, irrespective of their own wishes, irrespective of their own rights to freedom of association. Let us not hear any of this nonsense from the Democrats or from the Government that this legislation does not restrict freedom of association. Clearly it does, and clearly this legislation ought to be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address a few remarks in support of what my colleagues have said. I am amazed at the attitude of the Australian Democrats to the statement that has been issued. As I understand it, the Democrats were going to produce some amendments that would explain in greater certainty some of the very vague wordings of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the absolute tenets of our legal system and our system of justice is that people are able to understand what legislation is all about. I do not say that the Australian Democrats have been bought off by the Government in this instance over this issue, but I do say that they have been absolutely conned because they had something that might have meant something to the Australian public, that might have allowed people to understand the legislation. But the Australian Democrats have been conned by the Government into withdrawing it on some specious argument that it might clutter up the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation should be put down so that everybody can read it, understand it and see what is in it. The Democrats have been conned by a skilful suggestion of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook)-and the Minister is to be congratulated because he has done it very well-who has put down an even vaguer statement. In doing so, the Minister has conned the Democrats into believing that this statement will somehow give some clarity to the thing that they were worried about. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what has happened to the Democrats. They have few principles but one of them, I thought, was that they wanted parliament to be supreme. I believe in that. If something is going to be passed that affects the lives of Australians, it should be in legislation which is debated in the Parliament and it should be certain. The Democrats have been conned out of that. They have been conned into taking that out of legislation and putting it into some flimsy statement, which the Minister waves around when he refers to the Acts Interpretation Act. We could have a debate all day about what the Acts Interpretation Act says, and Senator Durack has done so skilfully. </PARA>

But the statement itself, which the Minister has tabled and which is supposed to clarify things, is equally vague and indifferent and does not take the thing any further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I feel that a number of statements have been made here which do need correction. I am not going to state my view on all of them, but I want to say that when we are dealing with International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention No. 87, we all ought to be perfectly aware of what that convention means. I believe that the action of the Government in placing provisions in this Bill which will force union members out of one organisation and into another, with all that this means for their award coverage, is contrary to ILO convention No. 87. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot agree with some of the statements that have been made about so-called compulsory unionism. I think that those who are making statements should recognise that ILO convention No. 87 is not contravened when preference provisions are inserted in awards. They should also have a good look at the travaux preparatories, including the Roosevelt clarification, and then reconsider what has been said. </PARA>

We now believe that it is not inappropriate, since the target is now smaller, for it to be achieved in a shorter time frame. We have discussed with others whether this is practicable, and the general feeling seems to be that the revised time frames which suggest that the smaller target should be achieved faster are achievable within the time frames proposed in this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in the answer. The Australian Democrats are in favour of the process of amalgamation. Five major reports to this Parliament in the last decade have recommended getting the process of amalgamation under way in the best interests of Australian industrial relations. We identify with the process of amalgamation. We want it to be fair. We want the exemption provisions to be strengthened. We want to ensure that individuals will not be treated unjustly in this process. We identify with the process. We believed that the gearing of that process in setting a figure of 20,000 was inappropriate and we said, `Let's choose another gear to do it'. We have said that there would be some interest in having an industrial ombudsman to ensure that justice occurs en route, but we have always said that we identify with the process of amalgamations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 proposed by the Government lays down a two-stage process in relation to its enforced amalgamations. The first process deals with unions with less than 1,000 members and provides for the process for unions of that size to be completed in the period beginning on 1 March 1992 and ending on 28 February 1993. However, the second process that the Bill brings into focus is the amalgamation of the larger organisations. The Government proposed fewer than 20,000 members, but as a result of amendments made to the Bill it is now 10,000 members or fewer. The Government has laid down a period beginning 1 March 1994 and ending 28 February 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have now-and we have heard the argument of Senator McLean-decided to propose that the process should be accelerated and brought forward by one year so that it would commence in March 1993 and end on 28 February 1994.

The Government was a bit more understanding of the problem of the smaller organisations than the Democrats. In fact, the Democrats are encouraging the Government to hasten the whole process and are now supporting it in this manner. I am not surprised-I do not think anyone is surprised-to hear that the Government will accept this amendment. However, what is surprising is that the Democrats should be proposing this amendment in light of the stance that they have taken in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean says, `We have always been in favour of amalgamation of unions and fewer unions'. That may be so, although I do not know how far back in time he goes. But when Senator McLean spoke on the Industrial Relations Bill in committee on 29 September 1988-I have already had occasion to refer to this speech-he made this statement in Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we offer no objection to the process of amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is consistent with what he is saying now, but he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>However, we think it is important that we proceed slowly and responsibly and in a way which accommodates the needs of presently small unions. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Government proposed this timetable up to February 1995, which was perhaps rather hasty in view of the volume of work that could be involved, it proposed what it saw to be a reasonable time. Not on your life; the Democrats are totally dissatisfied with that. Senator McLean, who wants this process to proceed slowly and responsibly, has now moved an amendment to hasten the whole process in a speedier way than in fact the Government itself wished to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet again we have the Democrats changing their minds about this whole question. Every time they debate the issue they change their minds, as was the case in the long debate that ensued on an earlier clause. They changed their minds as recently as 27 November 1990 about a very important clause of this Bill. They are clearly changing their minds of two years ago on the need for amalgamations to proceed slowly and responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is opposed to this amendment. Apart from our opposition to this process, which I reiterate, we are opposed to the amendment on practical grounds. Although we think the Government's proposal may have been a bit hasty, it was certainly more reasonable from a practical point of view than the amendment of the Democrats. We will be voting against this particular amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned about this amendment. Frankly, I cannot see any real logic in the amendment. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill says that a `small organisation (stage 1)' means an organisation that has fewer than 1,000 members. This particular amendment before us only deals with `small organisation (stage 2)'. It is a fact of life that Senator McLean's argument in support of this was that an amendment had been adopted by the Committee which would reduce the number from 20,000 to 10,000, the implication being that that would reduce the number of unions substantially; therefore, the Government should get on with it and pursue the amalgamation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two problems with that. Firstly, reducing the number of members from 20,000 to 10,000 really affects only 13 of the 105 unions that are to be affected by this legislation. On that ground there is no reason for supporting this amendment. A more important ground is the issue of the rights of those individual members to a say over a period of time. The longer that period of time, the better, because if one looks at unions with membership between 1,000 and 10,000-and there are a substantial number of them-one finds that many people in those unions have been there for many years. A number of them have built up over the years a great loyalty to their individual organisation. I know how they feel. When I came into the trade union movement full time-full time work, but certainly not full time pay at the time-I was associated with people who had been in the trade union movement since the early part of the century. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the loyalty people have to their organisations. The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen (AFULE), for example, is listed in the unions with a membership of between 10,000 and 20,000, so it is not affected, but one of the things my father gave me before he died was a badge, which his father had, of the AFULE-something which presumably was struck early this century. A number of people in a range of unions, not least of which are the craft unions, are vigorously loyal to their particular organisations. What concerns me as far as this amendment is concerned is that those people should have as much time as possible to get used to the idea that under this legislation their union needs to amalgamate with other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Government is not acting too hastily in accepting this amendment. Perhaps the Minister can let me know whether the Government has sought the view of the unions likely to be affected and whether even the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has conceded that the Government should alter the Bill to bring back the period by about 12 months as proposed by the Australian Democrats. I wonder whether the ACTU Executive has agreed with that. Some official may have, but to my knowledge the ACTU Executive has not agreed to it. I am not suggesting at all that that ought to be the only reason a government acts; I am just asking the Government whether it has not been too hasty in agreeing to this. I appeal to the Democrats to leave well alone and at least to allow the proposition in the Bill to stand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked a direct question and I think I should oblige the chamber by furnishing an answer to it. In doing so I indicate, as I did earlier by way of interjection on Senator Durack, that the Government accepts the amendment of the Australian Democrats. Our basic reason for so doing is that we would not have accepted it had the figure for minimum size remained at 20,000, but we have been knocked down from that figure to 10,000. Fewer organisations are thereby affected and the provisions of a shortened time to come to terms with amalgamation are more reasonable-certainly they are less onerous-in those circumstances. Given the tenor of the debate earlier when the Democrats were being attacked for changing their minds, I should own up and say that the Government changed its mind as well, and if the Democrats should be attacked, so should we. However, I have always thought that consistency is the sign of a lack of imagination and we reserve our right to change our mind if new information is put before us. On the basis of that new information, we think it would indeed be an exercise in total narrowmindedness and stupidity not to change a position if that information was compelling. The new information in this context is the information dealing with the minimum size, and that caused the Government to change its position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other factor is that a provision indicating a minimum size figure has existed since 1988-that was brought out in this debate by Senator Durack-so two years of notice have already been served in order that organisations can be seized of the urgency of amalgamation. Like Senator Harradine I, too, was handed by my father a badge of membership in the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen (AFULE). I wonder whether it is the same sort of badge and whether it was struck for the same sort of occasion, but it is a family heirloom. </PARA>

I would be surprised if some other government did not reserve that right as well. In consultation one is not bound to adopt all the views of the parties one consults with.

They know that after the election this lot will not be in government, and there will be a new government in power which will repeal this ridiculous legislation that is contrary to the interests of trade unionists. I am not sure what the Democrats' reason for the amendment is, but I can understand the ACTU and the Labor Party being quite ecstatic that this will all be over and done over with by the time the Government changes after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do the Democrats want to do that? They will see that the people of Australia do not want this sort of thing. That will be another reason why the polls will show us to be further ahead after the election, as they do now. They will show what the people of Australia want. These ridiculous, huge unions which will go with the huge business that both the Labor Party and the Democrats seem to be so keen on these days will be dismantled and put aside by the coalition. It is a pity that the Democrats are trying to shorten the time. I just ask the Democrats to stop and to listen to what Senator Harradine said about the matter, to get some sense into their industrial relations ideas and to take some notice of what Senator Harradine said on this particular matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the question put by Senator Harradine, I think it is important for us to return, at least briefly, to the question of what the Australian Democrats see as the role of the numbers and the date. The intention of the Bill is to induce amalgamations because they are considered by the Government, by five major reports to government over the last decade and by the Democrats to be in the best interests of better industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, and quite within their rights, Opposition members do not agree with that. We happen to agree with it; it is a question of how we achieve that. As I said, in responding to Senator Durack and others the other day about what the numbers and the date mean, I think they are purely and simply mechanisms which will facilitate the process of induction. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the outcome for union limits will be 10,000 or that the date on which that will be achieved will be a prescribed date. It is `goals', spelt g-o-a-l-s-not `gaols', spelt g-a-o-l-s. It is a process of simply setting some targets if one believes in the idea. Nobody is going to finish up in gaol on the day after the prescribed date. The fact is that these numbers are a facilitating process. Other mechanisms have been put in place to facilitate amalgamation. The federation process is another mechanism of facilitation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the Opposition does not believe in amalgamation; we do. The Democrats do believe in amalgamation, therefore we will have to set some goals because the earlier goals were not working for all sorts of internal reasons. It is not true to say that most unions do not accept the process of amalgamation. Most of them are toiling away at it and identify with it. The ones that are not doing so, for very good reasons, will be acknowledged when they argue under special circumstance. They have been facilitated in the process of arguing special circumstance by the amendments that have just been passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, the amendments have facilitated and strengthened the exemption provisions. These amendments suggest that we should get on with the process. In the last 10 hours of debate, we have tried to make the system fairer, to acknowledge the requirements of individuals, to accept that there will be organisations of special circumstance and to enable us to get on with carrying out the legislation once we have made it better. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not be forced to adopt the inflexibility, the intransigence and the lack of objectivity which is the stance of the Opposition. That is not our way. We simply see the numbers and the date as being reasonable, achievable goals. To answer Senator Harradine's question, we believe that they are achievable because we have consulted with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) about them. </PARA>
<PARA> We offer no apologies for the fact that we consulted with the ACTU. I offer no apologies for the fact that I sat down with Brian Noakes for three hours in Sydney, and consulted with the Confederation of Australian Industry. I offer no apologies for the fact that we acknowledge that the National Labor Consultative Council has endorsed by and large a substantial proportion of the Bill. We are prepared to be persuaded by all this. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the facts about what is occurring. It is a fact that much of the union movement has been discussing the process of amalgamation very positively for quite some time, but the goals were not strong enough to get them to get on with it. That is the intention of prescribing a number and date. If people want to be obsessed about it and want to fail to see that it is purely and simply a mechanism, they can be so obsessed. We offer no apologies for thinking about what would be the most appropriate numbers and dates. We are offering suggestions which are acceptable to the ACTU and to the Government and which will probably be legislated for now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean has not convinced me to support his amendment. He mentioned that over a number of years there have been a number of reports suggesting that there ought to be amalgamations. I agree that these reports have come in. Various Ministers for industrial relations have urged amalgamations-and I include here some coalition Ministers. I have taken the same view with them as I take now. Successive governments have viewed union restructuring, such as amalgamations, on either an industry or an enterprise basis, as something of a panacea for improved industrial relations outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, I have to say that industrial relations outcomes are not determined by this type of union restructuring. The fact of industrial life over a period of time is that industrial relations outcomes are determined more by the desire of the parties to see that a particular system of industrial relations works than by the size of individual unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason put to us with the Viner legislation was that, because of all the demarcation disputes, one needed an altered structure of trade union movement. As I recall it, the worst example of a demarcation dispute was between a fitter member and a boilermaker member of the same amalgamated union. I do not accept that industrial relations outcomes are primarily determined by this sort of union restructuring, particularly if it is a forced union restructuring, because individual members of those organisations who are loyal to those organisations may ultimately be so incensed with it that they, too, within their own craft, may take individual action which will be regarded as a demarcation dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Going to the other questions that have been raised by Senator McLean, I very much doubt that the industrial legislation subcommittee of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and particularly the ACTU Executive, have given their approval for this shortening of the time. As I indicated previously, even if the industrial legislation subcommittee, the ACTU Executive or the ACTU officers say something, that is not necessarily to be regarded as the ultimate determinant of whether something is passed by this chamber; but it is of importance in this case because it affects the individual registered industrial organisations of employees for which the ACTU speaks. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I would have expected the Government to be able to come into this chamber and say whether or not the ACTU has agreed to this reduction in the time allowable for amalgamations to take place. As I understand it, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is not able to say that. The Minister, in his response, said that he has had discussions with the ACTU on the Bill. Senator McLean said that he has had discussions with the ACTU and others on the Bill. That is good and fine. We have here an amendment to a Bill which goes to the question of the time allowed for organisations to conduct their negotiations as to which union is most suitable for their members to be transferred to-compulsorily-under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean says that the unions are busy on amalgamations. I can tell the Committee that there is a mad scramble out there at present to see who is going to end up on top. I do not feel that that is an appropriate way of going about it, and it is going to be worse if this time is truncated, as is suggested by this amendment. Let us hear what the ACTU has said about this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner we were talking about the period before amalgamation takes place being reduced by 12 months. I find it quite extraordinary that the Australian Democrats-in view of the argument put forward by them on the previous amendments that we dealt with, and supported by the Government through the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), about wanting, as I understood them, to make things fairer and less difficult for the small organisations that will be forced into amalgamation through this Bill-are now going to make it more difficult for them by this amendment. They have reduced the time by approximately one-third. In terms of their other amendment, by which they would reduce membership from 20,000 to 10,000, about 11 per cent of organisations would be directly affected. If we analyse that in real terms, the overall changes to the impact on those unions or employee organisations would be very little; it would not change very much at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the likely pattern of this type of legislation, and picking up the Minister's words in previous debates when he was looking at industry unions, it is far more likely to be the medium sized industry organisations or employee organisations which would find amalgamation more attractive-I emphasise the word `attractive'-in the marketplace, not by compulsion, which is the effect of this. In relation to those organisations which, under the previous amendments we debated, the Democrats were arguing should be protected and given some consideration with regard to pressure, we now find that the actual time they would have in terms of the pressure that will be put on them would be reduced by some 33 or 34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I concur very much with the comments made by Senator Harradine in terms of that particular pressure. This demonstrates inconsistency, firstly, in terms of the position that the Democrats have adopted on this legislation and, secondly, in terms of how the Government is prepared, when the crunch comes, to sell just about anything to get its way in terms of this legislation. It is very unfortunate-I disagree with it-that we see a demonstration in this place of such monstrous inconsistency in terms of the treatment of those particular organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to Senator McLean that one of the important things about legislation, whether or not he agrees with it, is that at least in the presentation of his arguments he should have a bit of consistency in what he is trying to do. This amendment demonstrates quite clearly that some sort of a deal has been done with the Government right along the line on this, which will once again force a situation which absolutely abuses the democratic process as far as the progress of this legislation is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As people will not only be reading what is said in this debate but also be listening to it, I think it is important that they hear very briefly why we are prepared to put forward this amendment, why the Government is prepared to support it, why the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) is prepared to support it, and why we have not been lobbied heavily about it. It is not a cause of difficulty. For the benefit of those who may be beginning to listen to this debate, I will repeat briefly the point I made before dinner: targets of numbers and targets of time are purely and simply to induce the process of amalgamation. The precise outcomes are not known to anybody. Nobody has a crystal ball and can see what the precise outcomes will be in terms of the size of unions, the number of unions, or the timeframes in which they will be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our earlier amendment, which was accepted and carried with the support of the Opposition and which was not unacceptable to the Government, was to reduce the target from 20,000 to 10,000. We are simply saying that it is not unreasonable-given the information that we have from those who will be involved in this-to set an earlier target date. As I said in response to a question posed by Senator Harradine, we have discussed this matter with the ACTU, and we have not been lobbied to the effect that this is an impossible target. In fact, no objections have been offered. If objections had been offered prior to this debate, I do not believe we would have persevered with the amendment. It is of no great consequence to us. It is not a matter of burning significance, but we believe that it is not an unreasonable target to set because we believe in the fact that targets have to be set. I say this only to put Senator Crane's comments in context. It was pretty spongy stuff and it simply did not bear any relationship to the point we are making. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make a couple of comments from the point of view of experience in this particular issue. For a long time the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and constituent bodies have been carrying out amalgamations. Originally there was the boilermakers and blacksmiths amalgamation; then the sheet metal workers with the boilermakers and blacksmiths into the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union; then the shipwrights and amalgamated metal workers into the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, then the AMWSU with the metal foundry union, going back to the AMWU; and finally, there was a recent vote by the AMWU in terms of amalgamation with the architects and draughtsmen's union. They voted 74 per cent in favour of amalgamation and the draughtsmen's union, with its first experience, voted 55 per cent in support. The point I make is that provided there is sufficient time to carry out the process that is necessary to achieve those amalgamations, that is all that is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Comments of a broader nature have been made which I would like to put to rest. There was a comment by Senator Harradine that the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union had problems with demarcation arguments between its members in the fitting and boilermaking categories. I say very clearly that for many years there were many destructive disputes and stoppages between those two types of tradesmen when they were in separate unions, but following their amalgamation into one union-particularly in Queensland-they ceased immediately to the point where organisers of the previous unions did not even have to attend to those problems by talking to people about commonsense. In fact, a single organiser-he may have been a boilermaker, a fitter or a sheet metal worker-was able to go out and talk to people on the job who might have made a difference, and to clearly indicate a process of reaching agreement on work allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge anybody in this chamber to tell me about demarcation disputes, particularly in Queensland, where there have been many stoppages, as I said, of a wasteful and destructive nature. That amalgamation achieved the process of eliminating demarcation disputes-not disputes that one would have to talk out while people continued on the job, but disputes that created stoppages. I would like to point out also that the process of amalgamation in that particular organisation always followed a lot of communication with members, at all times looking for the maximum amount of democratic say by the members. They understood that, and that is why on every occasion they voted for amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people talk about the rights of those in smaller organisations. One could look at the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union amalgamating with the shipwrights union, the latter union with 2,000 members in Australia and the former with 150,000. Of course, we wrote into the rules, at least for a period of two years, protection for the officials of the smaller union. In that amalgamation we also made a decision-without the assistance or direction of anyone else-that some 200 members of the shipwrights union would be better off in a seagoing union. We ran a ballot-they decided for themselves and went to a seagoing union. That is the type of operation that can be carried through by amalgamating unions with good faith. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the national Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, with some 180,000 members, is a person named George Campbell, the former secretary of the shipwrights union. It was a question of recognising his capacity to carry out the job, and that he would treat equally all members of the union movement in terms of what was in their interests. As a result of those amalgamations many things have occurred in the area of education, looking after people's compensation claims, understanding the law, and being able to negotiate through problems with employers who previously would not have had the capacity, the skill or the knowledge to do it-there would have been a dispute. When they knew that we had the information that they had, then they had to negotiate in a more meaningful way, and we have been able to argue those things through without any problem with regard to disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the coin there are those smaller unions which have as officials people who want to be big fish in little pools. There is a problem dividing the trade union movement in terms of politics. Some people have a particular ideological position in the political spectrum and they are more concerned about seeing their brand of politics-even if it is within a party-accepted by the trade union membership generally. They look at amalgamation on the basis of politics and ideology. Let me say clearly: that has never been the position with the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be the position of any trade union which wants to amalgamate. The bottom line should be what is in the interests of the members. Is it suitable that they should amalgamate? In the process, should certain groups of members be given to other unions because it is more appropriate? That is in the minds of many. As I said a moment ago, we have a situation where people want to remain as they are-big fish in little pools. They have no concern for the ordinary trade unions-the rank and file-and the sorts of improvements that have a spin-off for all workers in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people, I must say, clearly have to be dealt with. They should be given an opportunity to make a choice. They must consider what are the interests of the membership and take action reasonably quickly without undue haste or force. If they decide selfishly and say, `We don't care about the membership and future membership. We reject all the logical and correct arguments that can be proven statistically by figures and experience, because they stand in the way of our personal position', then they have to be dealt with fairly effectively and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the things that quite often is not considered in this debate is that certain people on the other side really hate unions unless they are tame cat unions. Where there is that sort of situation there is a problem. Very often people are not concerned about how amalgamation affects the community. The amalgamation of all of those unions which are now a part of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union has made a great contribution to the community and the community's interests. I think that this amalgamation process should continue and that people should be given that opportunity. If not, there should be some government action taken. </PARA>
<PARA> No union with a membership of under 10,000-that is now the figure-can properly service its membership, do the research necessary to give the information to the negotiators, start to develop policy positions in terms of safety on the job and look at the social issues that affect the union members or their families. Trade unions are not just about working 9 till 5 or 7.30 till 4 o'clock; they are about the total concerns and interests of the workers' families and the workers themselves. Any union with less than 10,000 members does not have the capacity to service its members properly in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, which will have 180,000 members, will still find itself unable to carry out, in a perfect fashion, the role that should be expected of it in an enlightened society. Of course, people who are members of unions with under 10,000 members do not have any hope at all. These unions will become refuges for non-unionists-people who want to freeload on the system and take the benefits out of the system. Let us have a trade union movement that is effective on behalf of its members and which makes the necessary and proper contribution to the community. I think the process of this legislation will achieve that. </PARA>

They do not necessarily share my views of the world; in fact, some of them share views more akin to those sometimes expressed by Senator Burns.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, the careerist leadership of a giant conglomerate union, aloof from the rank and file and oblivious to the rights of members of other unions, could cause havoc in industrial relations outcomes. I make that point very clearly because in many instances when unions have had to rely on the central trade union movement for their research capacity and facilities, in areas of common interest to all of the unions, an industrial outcome has been achieved which has had regard to all the interests of all the members of all the unions party to the particular award. A number of us in this chamber have been involved in award negotiations for a range of unions. I used to do that as Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council (TTLC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Burns talked about safety. In the same breath he made certain disparaging remarks about small unions. I well recall that in Tasmania advances in safety were made by a very small union which led the fight, the United Firefighters Union, of which I was Secretary. That organisation, together with the TTLC, prepared information on the problem as it was in those days, whereby compensation was paid at a rate lower than that which a worker would normally receive per week. The point was made to members of the Legislative Council with whom those organisations were meeting that, if a fire occurred in the parliament building in Hobart and the legislative councillors, who were not known for their agility, were required to be carried down the stairs, in the event of a fall the legislative councillors would receive the same amount that they would normally receive in a week but, at that stage, the firefighter would receive only 75 per cent of his normal weekly rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I can well recall that, although it did happen some years ago. But it is totally unfair, really, to give the smaller unions a blast. I would suggest that Senator Burns and others have a look at those unions we are forcing to amalgamate and ask themselves whether it is in fact fair to make those remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 15 of the Bill repeals an existing division relating to the amalgamation of organisations and substitutes a new subdivision which deals with a number of matters which are of concern to the Opposition-and, apparently, in some respects to the Australian Democrats, because they also have an amendment in relation to one of them. However, one of the early parts of the new clause 15, on page 12 of the Bill, seeks to insert a new section 237 in the Bill which provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) An existing organisation concerned in a proposed amalgamation may, at any time before the closing day of the ballot for the amalgamation, use its financial and other resources in support of the proposed principal amalgamation and any proposed alternative amalgamation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It may do so on condition that the committee of management of the organisation has given notice of the resolution and has resolved that it should so use the resources of the union. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal appears to be a new provision from those that are in the existing subdivision of the Act relating to amalgamations. There is provision in the existing Act and in this new subdivision for official Yes and No cases for and against amalgamations to be lodged and to contain no more than 2,000 words. Those Yes and No cases are sent out with ballot papers to all members of the unions concerned with the proposed amalgamation. I suppose that is modelled on the Yes and No cases in a referendum under the Constitution; there seems to be some similarity. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Act apparently was silent on the subject of whether or not a union with financial resources could use those resources for more propaganda in favour of an amalgamation by a union. Recently, however, a decision of the Federal Court of Australia has prevented organisations from using their resources, after the day on which notice of an amalgamation ballot is given, to promote a particular result in the ballot. That seems to be clearly the reason why the Government now has inserted this proposed new section 237, which I have paraphrased. The result now is that there would be a firm statutory provision that the proponents of an amalgamation, who are the officials of the union or those acting on behalf of the union, could use the resources of the union to promote the Yes case. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no equal provision for any of those who wish to support the No case to go beyond what is sent out in support of the Yes or No cases with the ballot papers. People opposing the amalgamation, unless putting up a proposed alternative amalgamation, are not able to use the resources of the union. The view from our side of the chamber is that the Federal Court decision is fair in preventing the resources of a union from being used to promote a Yes case and from being used to promote any particular result, either the Yes or the No case. </PARA>
<PARA> The section that the Government wants to insert now would be of assistance to only one side, namely, those promoting the Yes case. The result would be clearly unfair and of benefit only to one side of the amalgamation process, namely, those who are in favour of it, whereas in the old legislation, and in other sections of the new subdivision, the balance and equality of treatment of those who are proposing the Yes and the No cases are preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to be very like the situation which this Government proposed in relation to the referendum in 1984 when the Government announced-it did not bother to come to the Parliament to do it-that it was going to spend about $2.5m to support the Yes case. The Senate, with the support of the Australian Democrats, introduced an amendment to a referendum Act which was going through the Parliament at the time. That proposal of the Government to create what would have been a complete state of unfairness between the Yes and No cases in that referendum was prevented by a vote of the Senate, which amended the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act to prevent the Government from spending taxpayers' money on additional promotion of the Yes case; if the Government party or the Opposition party had wanted to spend the money out of their party funds, that was a different matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very close parallel of thinking here because the Government is giving a special privilege to the executive of a union to spend union funds promoting an amalgamation-the same as the Government had it in mind to use taxpayers' money for the same purpose in a referendum to alter the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, the Opposition is opposed to this new clause. We believe the decision of the Federal Court is the right position, and that is the one which should be preserved and not altered by inserting this new division, which seeks to replace the existing division dealing with the amalgamation of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Here again we have the very clearest indication of the extent to which this Government is prepared to go to force the process of amalgamations. Not only do we have these very firm provisions in the legislation which we have been debating-because of their draconian nature, if unions remain with fewer than the 10,000 membership limit they will be subjected to cancellation of their registration if they continue in that state and do not proceed with the amalgamation process-but in addition to that the Government has in other provisions made it unnecessary to have a secret ballot in certain cases in these amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the Democrats' amendment to accelerate the process further and the Committee has just taken a vote. In this particular clause the Government is giving clear favour in the propaganda war in an amalgamation to the union which is supporting it and which will be enabled by this legislation to use its funds-funds which are likely to be very far in excess of those that would be available to those who are promoting the No result. </PARA>
<PARA> Here the Government is giving legislative force to a clear preference for one side of the argument in one of these amalgamation ballots, and creating a position which is totally unfair to the other side of the argument. This is in fact not a clause we can simply vote against. It requires an amendment to delete it from clause 15. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15, page 12, proposed section 237, lines 6 to 19, omit the section. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Durack has just spoken at length on why we are deleting this clause of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. He very rightly likens it to the shonky approach that the Government wanted to adopt at one stage on one of the previous referendums. I remember it well because the Government tried to thwart the Constitution. The Constitution says that in a referendum both sides shall be treated equally by the Government. In other words, when a referendum is being put to the people both sides of the argument shall have exactly the same amount of taxpayers' money used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember very well in the Estimates Committee that Senator Evans had appropriated extra money through the slush fund of the Minister for Finance. That was not mentioned at all during the Estimates hearings. When we asked him, `Why did you not tell us that was where the extra money was appropriated for the Government's case alone?', he said, `You did not ask'. So it was all right to hide it as long as nobody asked. But the Government eventually came clean and, as Senator Durack so rightly said at that stage, Senator Haines joined us in not permitting the Government to get away with it. The Australian Democrats at that stage said that the biggest user of taxpayers' money-the Government-should not be able to ride roughshod over the smaller user, the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> This is exactly what the Government is legislating for now. It has said that the biggest unions can use their financial resources to put out all the reasons why the smaller union should be gobbled up by them. The smaller union will not have the finances or the resources to be able to fight it. That is exactly what the Government is on about, and that is exactly the point on which the Democrats are joining it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the situation where the Federal Court ruled that as illegal; it said that it was not permitted. Once again, the Government is taking action to override the court's decision on fairness. Who joins it-the Democrats. So the Democrats join the Government once again in legislation to overrule the court's decision. We had this not so long ago with the postal allowance. The High Court, in a unanimous decision, said that what the Government had done was illegal. Ultimately, the Democrats decided to join it and said, `We were only trying to flog a dead horse'. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the same situation here tonight where the Democrats are saying that it is all right for the large unions to use their financial and other resources in support of the proposed principal amalgamation and any proposed alternative amalgamation that the committee of management of that organisation has resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unbelievable to me that two parties-the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats-could interpret that as democracy. As I have already said many times in this debate, it is not our sort of democracy. Senator McLean tells us that he listens to the debate and that he has an open mind, not a shut mind. I hope he is listening and that his mind is not too shut to take aboard the things that Senator Durack, in particular, has been talking about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 15, which runs to some 20 pages, is one of the key clauses of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. Firstly, it replaces the existing amalgamation provisions of the legislation with provisions which explicitly recognise union federations under proposed new section 236. Secondly, it introduces a proposed new section 253h which provides an exemption from the necessity of having a secret postal ballot of members to approve amalgamation. A secret ballot of duly constituted meetings of members can suffice to approve an amalgamation. These provisions are designed by this Government, in effect, to make a merger of unions all but a fait accompli.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most important factors in achieving mergers as almost a fait accompli is allowing the establishment of federations of merging unions which are recognised by law and which can act on behalf of unions before industrial tribunals while the merger itself is being put in place. Allowing votes in favour of a merger to take place at meetings of members, instead of by what this Government and its Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) masters regard as the time consuming and counterproductive method-although obviously the far more democratic method-of a postal ballot, is another part of this agenda of the Government to try to make mergers a fait accompli. This is, of course, a much less democratic means of achieving mergers and amalgamations, because we all know that what happens in many meetings of unions when ballots are to take place is a sort of thuggery and intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack has already referred to the provision in this clause which frees up union funds and available resources to promote the cause of the merger, but of course there is no provision in this legislation for funds to be provided to those who are opposing the merger. This is the first time that legislation has expressly authorised unions to use members' funds to campaign in support of amalgamation. Also, apart from the fact that there is no requirement for opponents within a union to be funded to present the campaign against that amalgamation proposal, there is no provision in the legislation for any particular union which might oppose amalgamation to be able to use its funds to campaign against amalgamation. In other words, this legislation is all one way. Members' funds can only be used to promote amalgamation, whether or not the union or all its members want that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no provision for a union to use its resources to campaign against amalgamation. There is no provision for particular members of a union who might be opposing amalgamation to be provided with union funds to campaign against that amalgamation. The only provision for any case to be put against an amalgamation is, as Senator Durack said earlier, the formal 2,000 word argument which is sent out with the ballot papers. This indicates very clearly the one-sided nature of this legislation and indicates to us why it ought to be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions for federations of unions to be established are completely unnecessary, because most unions would already have such provisions within their own constitutions. The inclusion of those provisions merely pre-empts the result of any subsequent ballot on the part of union members in terms of amalgamation. Union members are not required to vote with regard to the establishment of a federation, but acceptance by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of a proposal to federate will undoubtedly be represented by supporters of an amalgamation as approval by the Commission for the unions to amalgamate. </PARA>
<PARA> Again it is part of this attempt to establish a fait accompli process on the part of the Government and on the part of the ACTU in favour of amalgamations. The practical effect of allowing the establishment of federations under this legislation will be to reverse the onus of proof for those who are opposing amalgamations. Again, the Opposition sees in this provision the dice weighted against those who want to oppose amalgamations; it is weighted against them both in the provision of resources for them to oppose the amalgamations and in the structures which will be established in terms of the process of amalgamation. This legislation and in particular clause 15 warrant the strongest possible condemnation and opposition from this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this amendment by the Opposition. The Opposition put several arguments in support of this amendment. Let me try to deal systematically with those arguments in the way they have been put, starting with the last speaker, Senator Chapman, and his last point about the federations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Senator Chapman does not know or chooses not to recognise is that the process of forming federations is seen as a step towards testing whether it is thought by the members of a particular union or both unions in the federation, or any number of unions in the federation, that going the whole hog towards amalgamation is desirable. It is like an engagement before one is married or a try-before-you-buy type arrangement. Federations can be terminated in one of two ways. They can lapse, whereby the unions then go their independent ways and do not amalgamate, or they can be terminated by the process of actually amalgamating and forming a new third union. </PARA>
<PARA> To characterise this provision as anything other than something that strengthens the rights of union members is to misrepresent it, because union members can have a chance to find out what an amalgamated organisation would be like to be in and then form a judgment within the time period and exercise their vote as to whether they will proceed. It is something that encourages the process of involvement in democracy and something in which the manifest benefits or disbenefits, whichever they may be, can be apprehended by the individual members and by the organisations. In addition, because an amalgamated organisation is a legally recognised federation, it can have some standing in law and be taken as a serious arrangement and not as some informal arrangement reached by organisations acting in whatever individual way they may choose. I submit that `federations' is not a basis for moving this amendment; it is a basis for supporting the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the next point, which was about the waiving of secret ballots. I wish that someone in this debate would complete a full sentence or a full explanation. Why does the Opposition simply say that under this legislation secret ballots are able to be waived? In the first place, secret ballots are not able to be waived anywhere. The difference is whether one has a postal secret ballot or a secret ballot held in a workplace. Who makes the decision about which of those two choices will be used? The person who makes that decision is the designated presidential member; that is, the Industrial Relations Commission makes it. Why does the Commission make it? It makes it on a basis of determining-that is, the umpire deciding-whether it is appropriate for the particular industry making the application, whether it has a tradition of meeting in authorised stop-work meetings, as the Waterside Workers Federation does, and whether in those authorised stop-work meetings the most democratic way is not to have a secret ballot on the premises with provision for absentee voting, rather than to send through the mail dry and arid reading, as it often is, to individuals in their homes to make a decision about and then often to find that the ballot papers are not returned. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the fairest and most democratic way of deciding? The body which will have that call is not the Government or the union but the Industrial Relations Commission, the umpire. If the umpire is satisfied, he then has an option. It is an option that he can choose to accept. I wish that in the discussion of this item that point would be made clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that it is not made clear and that it is militantly ignored perhaps could lead to speculation about motive. I do not intend to engage in that speculation now, but it certainly is not a motive driven by an impartial and objective analysis of what the choices before the Commission are and how the amendment will benefit the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order as to relevance. I may be on the wrong tram, but I understood that we were debating a proposition for the deletion of lines 6 to 19 on page 12. I just cannot see anything about that in what the Minister is saying. I acknowledge that he is replying to something that Senator Chapman said, so maybe they are both out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can accept that point of order, Madam Temporary Chairman, and I will move to the next point. Senator Harradine is right that I should not be drawn unnecessarily simply because the debate is off the point. I thank him for correcting me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now go to the first point relating to the matter before the Chair, though it is the last point on my list of matters that Senator Chapman raised. He said that under this provision unions cannot use their resources to campaign against an amalgamation. This betrays a breathtaking ignorance of what in fact this legislation is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> An organisation will have made a decision whether it chooses to amalgamate or not. If it has made that decision, it will obviously campaign in support of that decision. It is not a situation, as Senator Walters said in her contribution, of a big union attacking a small union and trying to take it over and of that big union funding the campaign to take the control of a union away from the management committee of the small union. That is not the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions are independent entities until they are joined in amalgamation. It is the management committee of each that can decide whether to spend money in support of the pro case for its own organisation. It is not a situation in which the organisation can be authorised in any way to spend money on a campaign in another organisation. This is not a situation of a big fish swallowing a small one; it is a situation of each organisation, true to its sovereign right, being able to exercise, through its management committee, the policy and objectives of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the main argument put by Senator Durack. He proceeded to do a very dangerous thing when he put his argument, an extraordinarily dangerous thing in a debate of this nature-he argued by analogy. He argued that something applied to a constitutional referendum, ergo it applies in a union situation. Argument by analogy is interesting. It works if the analogy is true on all points, and if it is not true on all points the analogy fails because of that inconsistency.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not true to say that a union is the same as a parliament. Neither a union nor any other organisation that is a proper organisation has an in-built provision for an opposition. In a union, as in any social club, sporting organisation or any other organisation of any sort, there is an election process which determines the management committee of that organisation. It does not have an opposition. The management committee is elected to represent the views of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The question now arises as to how that election should be conducted within a union and whether it is fair. I have to answer to that question, `Yes, it is'. It is fair for the reason that this Bill prescribes how union elections will be conducted and at what interval they will occur. It requires, as well, that rules of a union be presented to the Industrial Relations Commission before that union will be registered. It provides all of those things. That guarantees that union elections shall be fair. Therefore, one must accept that the outcomes of those elections represent the views of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> As soon as we arrive at that point, we say, `Can a properly elected representative body of an organisation have a view about the future of that organisation in a potential amalgamation?'. It is foolish to say that it cannot. Clearly it is there to govern and manage the affairs of the organisation; clearly it is there to have a view. In fact, many of its members would lean on it and seek advice from it as to what they should do in a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument that is raised is that the Federal Court of Australia found in a certain way in a particular case. Until the Electrical Trades Union and Australasian Society of Engineers case was taken, it was believed that management committees had this right. It was a surprise to everyone that the Federal Court found as it did. We are proposing to correct the unintended consequence of that finding, and there is nothing exceptional or unusual about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The meaning of the law can only be adduced after a court decides. If the meaning of the law is found by a court not to accord with the will of the Parliament, it is appropriate for the Parliament to make the correction. That is all that the Government is doing. We are doing this, moreover, with the support of the National Labour Consultative Council (NLCC), the tripartite body representing employers and unions in this country, which both support this amendment and which have both said that they support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest the argument now be raised that the Confederation of Australian Industry is somehow `big employers', let me tell the Committee that the CAI is the one organisation in this country that mostly represents small employers, because members of the Confederation of Australian Industry, unlike the members of the Business Council of Australia or unlike, as is often the case, the members of the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors or some other employer group, are smaller companies. The CAI is saying, through its representatives in the NLCC setting, that it supports this proposal by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider that the object that is being added into this Act is to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of unions, we see that it would be passing strange indeed if we denied an opportunity for those very unions to have in the amalgamation process the facility to promote the purposes of that amalgamation. They must do so, in my view, if they are conscientious about amalgamation, but there must also be a safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA> In a situation such as this there always has to be a safeguard, and there is. The safeguard is that, if a management committee wishes to promote the benefits of an amalgamation, it must advise its membership in advance that it so intends and enable that membership to engage in a process of seeking equal time to promote a counterview, if there is a body of membership of reasonable size that wants to do that; or to provide by resolution of the organisation, within the terms of that organisation, that the management committee should not proceed to do that. So there is a safeguard there and a let-out for ordinary union members if they wish to run against the prevailing view of their elected management committee, and properly so.</PARA>
<PARA> To carry this amendment would be to deny the democracy inherent in the way in which unions elect their memberships and to deny the democracy inherent in the leadership of an organisation being able to express a view about the future destiny and policy of that organisation. </PARA>

What we have, whether the Minister will acknowledge it or not, very simply, is the right of the large unions to use their financial resources and any other resources they can, as long as their committee of management agrees and the committee of management has given reasonable notice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as the Minister has said, that in the event of an amalgamation proposal being raised the large union and the small union would have made a decision to amalgamate. In that circumstance it is highly unlikely that the management of either organisation would be interested in committing union funds for a No campaign. That is not the point that is absolutely crucial to this consideration. We must ask ourselves as a committee: what is the most important decision to be made by the membership of an organisation? Surely the most important decision to be made is whether that organisation will continue in existence. As I see it that is the most important decision that is to be made, particularly by union members who have had years and years of membership--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that point. Let me take up the point that the Minister made: in what form. There may be a substantial number of members of an individual union who just do not want to be forced into a union which is in another form. They could be members who have done their apprenticeship, have become tradesmen and who now, because their union is going to be affiliated with another organisation, find themselves in an organisation with membership not comprised solely of persons in their particular skill but ranging over a whole wide range of organisations. We will see a lot of this. For example, the senior officers of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are going for the chop. They will have to be amalgamated into some other organisation. Over the years some unions have objected to supervisory staff being members of their organisation because it creates too much of a fight within the union at the time the unions have their meetings. We are going to run into a lot of these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If it is agreed that one of the most crucial of all decisions that an individual unionist has to make is whether that organisation will continue as it is currently registered with its eligibility rule as it is or whether it will be discontinued in that form and continued in another form with an expanded eligibility rule, why can the funds of the union be utilised only for one side of that proposition? If the funds of a union are utilised in a union election the court will declare that what has occurred is unreasonable and unjust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, as the Minister said. It will be agreed that the election of office-bearers for the next three years is not as important technically-it might be important politically-as a decision as to whether the union will continue in existence in its present form. Therefore, it does not seem logical to me that such a decision can be influenced by a campaign paid for by the union, whereas a decision of a lesser character cannot be-the lesser character being the election of officials. As has been indicated in this debate, the court has held that union moneys-that is to say, moneys provided by the persons who may be voting against the proposition-should not be so used and that is the crux of the matter. The Government is saying by this clause that a number of unionists do not want the amalgamation to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the Minister's interjection. There are provisions in the legislation for a statement to be made if the committee of management decides that a statement should be made against the amalgamation. Money is not allocated to the campaign for the No proposition. The No proposition will go out with the ballot papers, as will the Yes proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is saying that those people who do not want an amalgamation to take place have got rights in the lead-up to the decision taken by that particular union as to whether it ought to amalgamate. That is true; they have their rights in that instance. The Minister is saying that once the decision has been made by the majority, everybody should stick to it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the end of the matter. If one is going along that track, what is the need for any of these provisions at all? There is no need for any of these provisions. I am sure that the members, who do not want to see their union amalgamate with another, would take a very dim view of the committee of management using its funds in a campaign to do what they do not want it to do. Therefore, it is my view that either there is a provision for moneys to be spent on the No campaign or the Yes campaign-it would be a very difficult task to decide how much unless it was even-handed-or one takes the view of the court in the Electrical Trades Union case where no union money was made available at all for the Yes or No propositions. </PARA>

The original draft provided them with the grace of an additional four years in office even though they may well have served about four years prior to amalgamation. In rare cases-and they would have been rare but we had to acknowledge the possibility-that would have given rise to their being in office for eight continuous years without facing their members. Should they be fortunate enough to achieve a further amalgamation, they may be blessed with a further four years, et cetera. That was not the intention of the Government, and it has since been acknowledged as a drafting error. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to come to grips with what is a reasonable thing in terms of continuity in office. It is a fact that office-bearers will be affected by amalgamations and that they will be called upon to forgo careers. Many people will be impacted quite severely in many ways by this process of amalgamation. We are now specifically addressing the circumstance of office-bearers. We are really trying to address what is a reasonable thing. We begin from the premise that four years is a reasonable period of office for an office-bearer in an organisation. The Democrats have sought to rectify the original drafting error with an amendment which provides for a minimum of four years continuity. It is possible that some people will have more than four years in office, but not more than two years after amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this amendment is to achieve an outcome whereby, as a result of the process of amalgamations, officebearers are assured of their four years in office. Should a substantial portion of that occur prior to the period of amalgamation, they have the grace of an additional two years. Therefore there is the possibility-it is a fairly remote possibility-of a maximum in the vicinity of six years. But certainly there will be no roll-over provision whereby the people can go on using the process of amalgamations to extend their time. The objective of Democrat amendment No. 9 is simply to come to grips with that anomaly to ensure fairness in terms of continuity in office. Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 12 deal with consequential requirements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will indeed support the amendments moved by Senator McLean because, whether it was inadvertent or whether in fact it was intentional, the clauses to which Senator McLean's amendments refer could have, in effect, allowed union officials to remain in office ad infinitum by simply successfully organising a series of amalgamations every few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say this because the present Act has required elected officials to face up to an election every four years, but the amending legislation which we are debating allows those holding office in an amalgamated organisation to continue to hold office without the need to face a new election to maintain that office for up to four years after any amalgamation takes place. If, during those four years, as I said at the outset, another amalgamation can be initiated, those holding office can continue to do so without an election for a further four years after that amalgamation is completed. Of course, if a union official-its secretary, for instance-were able to organise three amalgamations in a period of 12 years, he or she could avoid facing an election for more than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean was charitable to the Government, I believe, in saying that this was perhaps a drafting error. But, given the manic determination of this Government and of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to see amalgamations proceed come what may, could it be in fact that this clause was included as yet a further incentive for union officials to promote amalgamations, with the aim in mind, of course, of keeping themselves in office without having to face elections? It does indeed provide a real incentive to amalgamate, if a union official can successfully organise a series of amalgamations, each about four years apart. If an organisation continued to amalgamate with organisations a quarter of its size, it would never have to hold a ballot of its members on amalgamation. If it did hold a ballot, as we have already discussed in this debate, it could use its members' funds to support the campaign for the amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> This clause, I believe, far from perhaps being inadvertent in its intention, may well have been very positive in its intention. Therefore, we welcome the amendments that Senator McLean has suggested this evening, and the Opposition will support them. </PARA>

<PARA>14. Clause 15, page 26, proposed subsection 253g (2), line 28, after ``members of the'', insert ``applicant''. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to give a very brief explanation of the significance of these amendments. There was an ambiguity in the drafting of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill centring on the clause which seeks to increase from 5 per cent to 25 per cent the portion of a membership required before a union can seek an exemption from a ballot. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain briefly what the situation is at the moment and what is being sought now. The experience has been that large organisations have been conducting ballots about amalgamations when it is proposed that they absorb smaller organisations. Often the process is one that is quite acceptable to the large organisations, the impact upon them is relatively minor and there has been a high level of indifference and a low level of participation by the members of the larger organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> As you would fully realise, Madam Chair, the process of an amalgamation ballot can often be very expensive. By legislation, it has to be supervised by the Australian Electoral Commission, which in turn incurs expenses, and there is general agreement between all parties to the National Labour Consultative Council that often those ballots are unnecessary, expensive and consuming of resources and time and that under certain circumstances the Commission should regard exemption as quite reasonable and endorse it as being appropriate and certainly not in contravention of the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the suggestion has been that, should the organisation being absorbed be less than 5 per cent of the final outcome amalgamated organisation, such an exemption should be able to be sought but not necessarily automatically granted. The suggestion here is that that 5 per cent be increased to 25 per cent. It is generally agreed that that is not an unreasonable proposition. Unfortunately, in the wording of the clause it became ambiguous as to whether it meant 25 per cent of the large organisation prior to the amalgamation or 25 per cent of the large organisation after the amalgamation. The second of those was the intention, and this seeks to clarify that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to proposed section 253h under 253j. As Senator Cook and others mentioned earlier, this provides the ability to do away with the postal secret ballot. When in government, we introduced the provision for the secret postal ballot. This was seen at the time-and is still seen-as very necessary within some, though not all, unions. We have had many experiences-and people have only to look at reports such as those on the waterfront-where casting a supposedly secret ballot at a union meeting has not been not good enough. We have had reports of intimidation of people so that they just do not turn up at that meeting. It is not compulsory that members turn up at these meetings, just that those members who do turn up have a secret ballot. The intimidation of people actually walking through the door is well known in some of the more radical unions. We have had reports to this effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is saying that in this amalgamation process it will allow the continuation of that intimidation to occur; it will allow secret ballots of members' organisations at that meeting; it will do away with the need for secret postal ballots. I do not think there would be anyone in this chamber who is not aware of the difference between the two procedures. One cannot easily intimidate people who, in the secrecy of their own home, receive a ballot paper and fill it in. But members of the Government are well aware of the intimidation that can occur with some of the more radical unions where they have the so-called secret ballot at a meeting of union members. </PARA>
<PARA> It was for that very reason that, when in government, we introduced this amendment to the legislation. The Australian Democrats are joining with the Government in getting rid of that amendment. It is the very basis of all democracy that a secret ballot forbids intimidation. I assure those listening to the debate tonight that there is no way the Government can ensure there will not be intimidation unless it goes for a postal ballot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly respond to the suggestion by Senator Walters that the Australian Democrats would be endorsing processes of intimidation to support the exemption provisions from secret postal ballots. I will briefly reiterate what the Minister said earlier. I think he made it very clear that under certain circumstances it may well be that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission would consider a direct participation ballot, rather than a secret postal ballot, to be more appropriate and more democratic in certain circumstances. If it does not consider this to be so, it is certainly within its power and, in fact, it is an obligation of the Industrial Relations Commission under the provisions of the Bill that it does not provide such exemptions. It is only when it considers them to be more appropriate that it should do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook cited, and I will re-cite, the fact that in some blue collar unions we could not introduce a less appropriate, less democratic process than to ask members to ingest and react to a whole lot of dryly presented written propositions, and to respond to them individually, without the right of questioning their elected officers or those who are advancing these propositions. The whole ethos of those unions renders direct secret ballots to be much more democratic and participative. All this Bill provides for is the opportunity for the Commission to recognise that and to grant an exemption, then the Electoral Commission comes in and supervises these ballots anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> To talk intimidation in this context is pure hypothesis. It is classic Senator Walters gone crazy again. The imagination runs riot.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have already indicated, the Opposition is so totally opposed to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, which we have just been debating in committee for a great length of time, that we will vote against the third reading. It is, of course, not appropriate in debating a third reading motion for one to go over the grounds of principle as to why one is opposed to the Bill. I do not propose to do so or to delay the chamber any longer than is necessary in relation to this Bill, proposed by the Government to facilitate and encourage the amalgamation of unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us be quite clear about that. This Bill is very dramatic and very radical in its proposals as far as the organisation of the union movement in this country is concerned. It proposes to add new objects to the Act to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of organisations and to encourage and facilitate the development of organisations, particularly by reducing the number of them. As revealed by this debate, the Government wishes to see the present number of unions, totalling something like 300, reduced to 20. Those 20 or thereabouts unions can only be described as mega-unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been very concerned, for a number of reasons, about this proposal. I suppose basically the most serious reason of all is the direct and gross assault on the principle of freedom of association for members of unions, particularly of those unions that will not survive the draconian processes that have been included in this legislation by the Government in order to attain the purposes that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is also particularly concerned about the power that can be exercised by such large unions as the Government proposes. That concern is shared by many leading unionists who have expressed the same worries referred to in the debate. The Opposition does not believe that the reasons advanced by the Government for these proposals will achieve even the Government's own purposes, but that perhaps is a lesser concern than our opposition to the totally undemocratic nature of these proposals and the breach of the fundamental principle of freedom of association, which is probably-almost certainly-a breach also of International Labour Organisation conventions. That process has been invoked already and we await the decision of that body in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill puts in place a long and somewhat complicated new process for amalgamation. The Committee debate has been long enough as it is, but there are many other features in this legislation other than the ones we have debated which are of concern to the Opposition. Senator Walters raised but one of a number of those concerns. For instance, the extension of the power to grant preference to unionists which is contained in this legislation is another matter of concern to the Opposition which we did not highlight during the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons the Opposition wishes to continue to maintain its strong opposition to the passage of this Bill. If anything, the result of the Committee debate, long as it has been, has not been to improve the Bill, but in one very important respect to make it worse as far as the Opposition is concerned. I refer to the amendment by the Australian Democrats, supported by the Government, to accelerate the process of amalgamation even more than the Government's own proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Democrats were not prepared to support the Opposition's attempt to get some fairness into the conduct of a ballot in relation to the Yes and No case propaganda is also a matter of very real and additional concern for the Opposition. We felt that at least we could have expected the Democrats to support an amendment which was going to prevent the use of large financial and other resources by, in many cases, a large union-although it might not be-hell-bent on further amalgamations. The Government has proposed to facilitate even further the process of encouraging amalgamations-or indeed ensuring them-by allowing union funds to be used to propagandise the case for amalgamations without any balancing funds being made available to those who oppose amalgamations. For those reasons the Opposition maintains its implacable opposition to this legislation and will vote against the third reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting (Foreign Ownership) Amendment Bill 1990 seeks to amend the Broadcasting Act, an Act which this Government has done nothing about amending for something like four years. Prior to the 1987 election the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) described it as `nightmarish legislation' which he promised to reform urgently. Since that time we have had virtually nothing done to it. This particular example of amendment is really a classic case study of why the Australian Labor Party has lost its nerve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had the great punitive leader Mr Keating, who has really tried to influence debate behind the scenes by press releases and background briefings but never leading from the front in the area of broadcasting. He has not said one word about this other than to make what is a fabricated concession-that it is possible to own up to 100 per cent of a licence via the holding company. That was a tawdry example, playing to the crowd, and designed simply to support the proposition that somehow Australian broadcasting was about to be overrun by foreign interests. Nothing could be further from the truth. Today we have had the sorry spectacle of the Fairfax group going into liquidation. We will no doubt see more problems on the media front. </PARA>
<PARA> We not only have a nation in recession but a media industry in recession. If honourable senators speak to the major players they will be told that this is worse than anything since the 1930s. It has come about through a combination of poor investment decisions on the part of some players who were not particularly experienced in the game. It has also come about because they were encouraged to believe that this Government was going to provide them with a regulatory regime. That is precisely what has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had all sorts of flip-flops on the foreign ownership issue to the point where it went into the last election with a policy that said, `We have no policy', and that is precisely what it was about. In the space of some six weeks it had five different policy positions, ranging from anything up to 100 per cent down to 20 per cent, which was the flat limit on holding and licensee companies. This was done to accommodate people that the Government regarded as likely to be sympathetic to it. Of course, the Mr Packers of this world do not regard themselves as being indebted to any politician for any more than about five minutes, but the great hero, Mr Caesar, no doubt always took the view that five minutes was better than nothing at all and therefore he was prepared to accommodate anyone who might give him a good run, especially in the lead-up to an election. </PARA>
<PARA> What we had was Mr Hawke making noises that it might be necessary actually to raise the limit of foreign ownership. The height of dishonesty was reached in a press release put out by Mr Willis on 4 January this year, when he somehow pretended that he had discovered a loophole in the legislation, which since 1981 when the Murdoch amendments were put in place had allowed a limit of 20 per cent on the licensee company and up to 50 per cent on the holding company. Mr Willis suddenly pretended that this was a loophole, that this was outrageous and it had to be blocked-he was playing to the crowd, no doubt- and from then on he backfilled. He changed his mind to the point where he was reported to have taken three Cabinet submissions on the issue and ultimately took none. He was told by Mr Hawke, after Sam Chisholm had rung him up, that he was not to say anything further about it prior to the election, and indeed the Government went into the election with an open cheque in terms of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> But what has happened after the election is that we have had this shameful situation of Mr Beazley proposing what is now contained in this Bill, and that is a 20 per cent flat limit. I could go through at quite some length all the various stages in the game and all those changes of policy, but at the end of the day one is entitled to ask: what is the Government so afraid of when it tries to turn its back on anything other than very modest levels of foreign ownership? We had recently in this country a visitor from the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, who said that this sort of-she would not use the term but I do-broadcasting McEwenism is really economic protectionism under a cultural guise. That is the way in which it is usually dressed up: somehow we have to protect our own local content; we have got to be sure that all that is unique to Australia is not set aside or somehow watered down by foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality, of course, is that foreign investment at levels below controlling interests of 50 per cent can have a very beneficial influence on any industry. This is the case in the media industry in particular, where there is a constantly high rate of change, with new technology that Australia could stand to gain from to a very significant degree, and we get the benefits of access to capital and accumulated expertise. There are very many players in the world who could teach Australia a tremendous amount about how to run an effective broadcasting industry, yet we have a cocoon industry that is going nowhere-indeed, going backwards-all because this Government is policy paralysed. It is simply not prepared to face up to the situation that the rest of the world faced up to long ago and to acknowledge that we can strike a proper balance between foreign and domestic interests, that we can derive very considerable benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of doing that, the Government has pandered to the worst forms of xenophobia and jingoism, and introduced what I would regard and what the Opposition regards as an utterly indefensible level of protectionism. That will have the effect that we will continue to languish, we will continue to have a media industry in crisis, and we will continue to have a television and radio industry that will simply not do anything other than try to keep its head above water. We have already had one of our three networks in receivership for more than 12 months. We are in the process of seeing the Ten network being progressively cut up and decimated to the point where it will no longer be no frills but no revenue. It will end up, no doubt, with some of its major participants being picked off, and we will end up with virtually two networks in this country. We are all aware of the possibilities of the ambitions of Mr Packer in terms of extending the dominance of the 9 network. If that is the case, what we will end up with in this country is the worst of all possible--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on an important matter relating to student unionism and the National Union of Students (NUS), which is holding its annual conference at Deakin University in Geelong this week. The National Union of Students was formed three years ago; I believe its anniversary is this week. This organisation has an income of around $800,000 per annum, derived from student union fees. Of course, in Australia membership of the NUS is compulsory for every student on a campus affiliated with the union. The constitutional provisions of the union render disaffiliation from the NUS at best difficult and at worst practically impossible. Despite this, since the union's formation in 1987 Liberal and other conservative students have denied the union $750,000 in membership fees through successful referendums and other campus action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This student union purports to represent 250,000 students and holds itself out before university administrations and governments to be the official voice of students. This is what I would call a fairly invalid claim, in that only some 25,000 students across Australia have ever actually voted to become members of the union. I fail to see how the NUS can claim to be representative of the majority of tertiary students, when major campuses such as the University of Sydney, the Australian National University and the University of Queensland will not have a bar of the union. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Union of Students is like many other bureaucracies. Last year, the union spent about 80 per cent of its budget on wages and administration, and concedes that it spent only roughly 9 per cent on education. For a national union of students, it is fair to say that that performance is fairly dismal. </PARA>
<PARA> The NUS has a series of policies; in my eyes-somewhat biased I would admit-what I would call fairly irrelevant left wing student-type policies. One can go through policy after policy, but I will not bore the Senate tonight by referring to all of them. I will just mention a few to give an indication of what the NUS gets up to with the compulsorily acquired funds of students across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, the union supports the inclusion of lesbian and gay content across undergraduate curricula-something that not even the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) would propose, I guess. I ask just what homosexuality has to do with engineering or economics courses. I am not quite sure. </PARA>
<PARA> At last year's conference held at La Trobe University the union resolved to campaign against real estate agents, which is most offensive to me, bearing in mind that was one of my previous incarnations. The reason for this was that the NUS blamed real estate agents for discrimination against women in the housing market. </PARA>
<PARA> At the conference about 12 months ago the union passed a bill of students rights. That bill, amongst other things, said that students had the right to work not more than 38 hours a week. I am sure many of the students who are attending the conference this week might wish to amend that bill of students rights and suggest that students be given the right to work even a few hours a week. In fact, I am sure many students would like the right to work 45 or 50 hours a week to meet the rising cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA> NUS support for the Australian Labor Party is undeniable. Last year the NUS resolved to campaign in opposition to the coalition's higher education policy throughout the Federal election. A marginal seats campaign was undertaken and publications were produced and distributed which attacked the Liberal and National parties' policy-using, I repeat, compulsorily acquired funds from people who had no choice but to pay those fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I wish to refer to tonight-and the reason I am speaking tonight-is a matter of grave concern which calls into question the proper administration of the union and which challenges the conduct of those elected to student political office. The National Union of Students has five elected student office bearers. Amongst these office bearers is the important position of General Secretary, which is held by Mr Andrew Wooldridge. In the financial reports of the union, which were released today at the national conference of the union at Geelong, it was revealed that in addition to his yearly wage of $19,000, Mr Wooldridge also claimed $17,690 in travel and other allowances. This is, in itself, a wanton abuse of students' money, but it is not the primary expenditure about which I am concerned tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst other things, the duty of the General Secretary includes responsibility for the administration and financial operations of the union and a responsibility for the national secretariat office which is located in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton. The regulations of the union impose several responsibilities exclusively on the General Secretary. Those are: the approval of all payments and loans and the requirement to act as a co-signatory on all cheques. In other words, the General Secretary has considerable authority and power and, next to the President, has a most responsible position in terms of the administration and operation of that union. One would expect only the highest standard of integrity and honesty from someone holding such an office.</PARA>
<PARA> But it has been alleged that these standards have been breached in perhaps the worst manner possible. It transpires that no fewer than 22 charges have been laid against Mr Wooldridge in relation to an alleged misuse of a cheque drawn on the account of that union. The amount of the cheque is believed to be in the vicinity of $4,500. </PARA>
<PARA> I have before me the minutes of an emergency meeting of the National Union held on 29 October 1990. These minutes reveal that the national executive ratified the actions of the NUS President who suspended the General Secretary after receiving written legal advice and who assumed the powers and duties of the General Secretary. On that same day-29 October-the General Secretary tendered his resignation in a letter written to the national executive. The resignation was accepted by the executive at the emergency meeting which then vested the powers and duties of the General Secretary in the President. </PARA>
<PARA> At the conclusion of the meeting a very short public statement on the matter was made. I would like to refer to that release and I seek, with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who is at the table, leave to table the minutes of the meeting and also a notice that was put out today in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The notice stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The General Secretary of the National Union of Students, Andrew Wooldridge, has resigned. This follows his being charged in relation to misuse of a cheque drawn on the account of the Union. </PARA>
<PARA>The importance of this was that Mr Wooldridge was due to appear before the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 4 December 1990. I have been informed by the Melbourne Magistrates Court that Mr Wooldridge failed to appear and that a warrant has now been issued for his arrest. I make no comment tonight about Mr Wooldridge or his alleged actions as the matter is now before the courts, but I will, however, comment on the handling of the matter by the other NUS office bearers. </PARA>
<PARA> The NUS President was aware of the charges against Mr Wooldridge up to a fortnight before the emergency meeting was held. The emergency meeting should have been called at the very moment that the NUS President became aware of the charges. Given that the NUS constitution requires that only 24 hours notice of meeting be given and that its meetings can be held by teleconference, the appropriate action should have been taken against Mr Wooldridge at a much earlier date. Instead, the NUS President, Kate Deverall, chose to engage in a cover-up which was worth about $80,000 to the union. </PARA>
<PARA> Between the time that the NUS President became armed with the information concerning the charges against Mr Wooldridge and the date of the emergency meeting, the union was engaged in two referendums relating to membership of the union. They were at Macquarie University and the Queensland University of Technology, where students were voting on membership of that union. So what, one might say, but victory in the referendums on those two campuses is worth approximately $80,000 a year to the NUS. Both were very hard fought campaigns and the NUS spent a considerable amount of money on both of those campuses. Both elections were won by the NUS. Had the charges against Mr Wooldridge been known on those campuses there is no way that students at these universities would have voted to be part of such an organisation which is shrouded in such allegations of potential corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> What does that say about the administrative procedures of an institution that will permit activities such as is alleged to have occurred? The attempted cover-up continues. At the NUS conference today in Geelong delegates were issued with a guide to the conference which contained a statement on the matter by the current NUS President, Ms Kate Deverall. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>As you would all be aware the Union's former General Secretary has recently appeared in court on charges relating to alleged embezzlement of Union funds. While this unfortunate matter continues, it would be legally unwise for any Member of Conference to make any public comment on the matter whatsoever for fear of contempt of court or other problems. This advice comes from the Union's solicitor. Therefore I must appeal to all delegates to respect this position and refrain from commenting on what is undoubtedly the most unfortunate episode to have struck the Union. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunate indeed. The purpose of that statement is to stifle debate on this issue and withhold the circumstances surrounding the matter from the very people who should be fully informed of these events-ordinary students who have been forced to pay for this indulgence, possibly even criminal indulgence. </PARA>
<PARA> The union has failed the fundamental test of propriety and, as such, has proved to be totally unaccountable to the thousands upon thousands of students who are forced to pay union fees to this corrupt institution. Is it any wonder that Liberal students vowed to bring down this union soon after it was created in 1987. Cries of `I told you so' must now be bellowing through the corridors of student unions across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The actions of the NUS leadership have been the inevitable consequence of the corrupt regime of compulsory student unionism which props up the NUS. Without compulsion the union would be forced to be accountable to its members. Surely no right-minded individual can now stand up and defend compulsory student unionism given the scandalous events that have transpired within the NUS. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that those students who are attending the conference this week appreciate the weight that now rests upon their shoulders in considering the future of the union. They should recognise that NUS has been an abject failure. It has failed to provide any tangible benefits for students which it prides itself on doing. It has also failed to provide accountability and it has failed to demonstrate propriety. Its very existence should now come under question. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, were a national union of students formed through a voluntary amalgamation of student campuses across the nation, which have themselves been formed voluntarily, the sort of corruption I have referred to tonight would not happen because the leaders of those unions at the campus level and at the national level would be accountable. Indeed, they would have been called into question for these sorts of improprieties a long time ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express once again my concern in the strongest possible way about the misuse of parliamentary privilege. I refer to the speech made in the House of Representatives on 6 December 1990 by the honourable member for O'Connor, Mr Wilson Tuckey. In fact, to describe his contribution as a speech may only dignify what was a cunning exercise in dirty politics. Mr Tuckey has justified this recent outburst on the grounds that in 1980 the honourable member for Fremantle attacked Mr Tuckey for his conviction for assault.  That is a shallow excuse for a dirty attack against one of the most honest Premiers Tasmania has ever had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Tuckey's so-called speech implied two things: first, that the legal system in Tasmania played favourites with the Premier, Mr Field, when he was charged in 1973-74 with a crime; secondly, that Mr Field received a light sentence for what Mr Tuckey described as a serious crime. On the first matter, Mr Tuckey implied that the magistrate trying Mr Field in 1974 and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Sir Guy Green, who heard the appeal, went soft on Mr Field because of political interference. Mr Tuckey said it is:</PARA>
<PARA>worthy of inquiry by a royal commission to guarantee the public of Tasmania that no outside influence was attempted by any person or any member of the then Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the innuendo by Mr Tuckey is absolutely objectionable and it casts aspersions on the honesty and integrity not only of the magistrate but of the Chief Justice, Sir Guy Green, who has had a distinguished career as a judge and as the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania under governments of two different political persuasions. Included also in Mr Tuckey's attack is a suggestion that the chief judicial officer, the Attorney-General, the late Mervin Everett, or other politicians close to him may have influenced the outcome. Given the integrity and the reputation of the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, Mr Merv Everett, all of that is impossible. Just as relevant, of course, is my own observation that Michael Field, like me at the time, was an unimportant branch member of the Australian Labor Party who held no office and was probably more concerned with issues related to uranium mining, civil liberties and other idealistic areas of political activities. For Mr Field to be able to pull any strings at the time or have any strings pulled for him is plainly ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, Mr Tuckey has tried to imply that the Tasmanian Premier Mr Field at that time was guilty of a serious crime that warranted stronger penalties. I have known Mr Field personally from that particular period right through, and I have known him in many situations. I know that all the parliamentarians he came into contact with, both on a personal and professional level, regarded him and still regard him as absolutely honest and a decent person. In fact, he is the quintessential honest man. </PARA>
<PARA> I also suggest that the matter for which the youthful Mr Field was prosecuted was an unusual one in that he was the victim of a rather revengeful and silly person who probably set him up, to put it in the vernacular. As is his style, Mr Field then took it on the chin and suffered the consequences, one of which was the loss of his teaching career. I also add, not only for this chamber's benefit but also for the benefit of Mr Tuckey, that the then Labor Minister for education would not interfere in order to save Mr Field's teaching career-so much for Mr Tuckey's view that Mr Field got off lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very unhappy, Mr President, that parliamentary privilege has once again been used by Mr Tuckey to attack the reputation of honest people; namely, the Chief Justice, Sir Guy Green; Mr Field; the unnamed magistrate; and the Attorney-General, Mr Merv Everett. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a similar misuse of parliamentary privilege by Senator Newman when she attacked the former President of the Returned Services League, Sir William Keys, calling him a Labor stooge. On a previous occasion, she has attacked a Canberra public servant in a similar vein. I say tonight that this Parliament and all parliaments, whichever chamber we happen to be in, must recognise that parliamentary privilege exists for a very specific purpose; namely, as a protection for parliamentarians who must raise contentious issues that are demonstrably in the public interest. It exists for their protection against defamation and for no other purpose. If it is to be used for personal attacks on people, either through implication or innuendo, and if attacks without substance against individuals who are not in this chamber are to be the order of the day, then the question of parliamentary privilege will be queried all around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> On many occasions I have had the opportunity in this place to defend my reputation against individuals outside this Parliament. For example, in a defamation case I was involved in a number of very smart people in the literary world, for example, said, `It's totally up to Senator Aulich to redress the balance and to put his case in this Parliament under parliamentary privilege'. As I said on radio in reply to that, `I have no intention ever of using this Parliament as a place to either vindicate myself through the personal attacks on people who cannot defend themselves in this chamber--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not over that. I will not ever use this place to attack an individual who does not have the right to speak directly in this chamber. In many ways, this Parliament has to look carefully at parliamentary privilege-not only at the way it operates now, but also at what we plan to do with it in the future. Otherwise, in the end, we may well lose it. The example of people like Mr Tuckey, in his attack on the Premier about an incident which occurred many years ago, is no benefit at all for this Parliament, for Mr Tuckey or for politicians in general.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is by sheer coincidence that I happen to rise to use parliamentary privilege. I acknowledge the points that have been made by Senator Aulich about the seriousness of parliamentary privilege; I think that he and other honourable senators realise that I have used privilege previously and, therefore, am quite prepared to acknowledge the extreme seriousness that is associated with its use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that on 14 September I was in the process of reading into the Hansard a case study of the abuse of a system of foreign exchange loans by the Commonwealth Bank against A.T. and D.A. Rigg. I was reading into the Hansard for quite deliberate reasons details of that case, and I had not quite finished. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you and other honourable senators will be relieved that I seek only to finish that case rather than commence another one. On that occasion I sought permission to table the documents upon which I based the serious allegations. I was denied leave to table them on that occasion on the grounds that I had not given sufficient time for their perusal. I will be seeking leave to table the documents later. I have placed those documents in the hands of the Minister and shadow Minister on duty tonight at the table, Senator Button and Senator Watson. I gave them the documents at about 2 o'clock this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I left Australia on, I think, 16 September, two days after I had mentioned the matter in this place. By sheer coincidence, three days later I found myself in Zurich sitting before senior Swiss bankers, one of whom made the quite unsolicited comment that the senior Australian bank officers who were involved in inducing Australian business people and farmers into foreign Swiss loans between 1984 and 1986 were nothing short of criminals and that they should be in gaol. That was a comment from somebody at the other end. I later asked if he was prepared to come to Australia and he said that he was prepared to come to Australia and give evidence on the matter which he had told me about. I believe that he may well be appearing before the bank inquiry shortly to support the very proposition I have been advancing for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> As a point of explanation to those who may read this adjournment speech, I am returning to a speech which was not completed on 14 September in order merely to finish it and seek to table documents in support of the allegations of fraud. I had made allegations of fraud and I was attempting to substantiate those allegations by reading and citing the documentary evidence in support of them. I am returning to a rather complex technical explanation about the draw-down facilities and procedures on bills relating to these foreign exchange loans. I had cited documentary evidence in support of the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make is that, upon the draw-down of the bill, which is the technique that was used, the net proceeds of the transaction-that is, the face value of the bill less the interest, fees and margins-was credited to account No. 181.829. All subsequent action sheets showed the net proceeds as credited to account No. 181.415 and, when the bank's accounting procedures were changed, showed the interest and margins of the fees as debited to the account, which had the same result for the customer. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point I cite from this documentary evidence is that the evidence nominated whether the bill was to be retained at the branch or forwarded to the money market dealing section. If the bill was retained at the branch, it was not delivered to an independent dealer on the open money market and therefore was a sham. </PARA>
<PARA> The action sheet shows that this bill was retained at the branch. In fact, all 34 bills were retained at the branch and were shams. Some action sheets were not properly completed and are ambiguous on this matter. Nevertheless, in those cases, other documents issued by the bank established that the bills were retained at the branch. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point I make is about the documentary evidence. Upon the maturity of the bill, the face value of the bill was debited to account 181.415. All subsequent action sheets showed the face value of the bill as debited to account 181.415, but when the bank's accounting procedures were changed the transaction was nevertheless treated to that account. I will table evidence to that effect, with leave, shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The purchase advice in respect of that bill, dated 14 August 1985, was issued by the Nowra branch to Sydney. The advice nominates the branch as 2585 and nominates the location of the bill as that branch. That is further evidence that the bill was a sham. Some purchase advices were not properly completed and are ambiguous on this matter. Nevertheless, in those cases, other documents issued by the bank establish that the bills were retained at the branch. The dealer's slip in respect of that bill, dated 14 August 1985, discloses that the bill was held at branch 2585, that is, the Nowra branch. This is further evidence that the bill was a sham. All subsequent dealer's slips disclose that the bills were held at the Nowra branch. </PARA>
<PARA> By a letter dated 14 August 1985, the bank advised Mr and Mrs Rigg that the acceptor of the bill was the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That is further evidence that the bill was a sham. In the case of each subsequent bill transaction, except in respect of the last bill, the bank wrote to Mr and Mrs Rigg advising that the acceptor of the bill was the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 9 of the bank statement in respect of account 181.415, shows that, upon the maturity of the bill on 12 November 1985, the face value of the bill was $50,000 and was debited to the overdraft account of the company. That statement is evidence that the fraud perpetrated on the company was consummated. In the case of each subsequent bill transaction, the bank statements in respect of account 181.415 faithfully record the transaction and evidence the consummation of the fraud in respect of that bill. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of further example, I propose to deal briefly with the last bill. The bank sued Mr and Mrs Rigg and obtained summary judgment in respect of that bill. I will seek leave to table the following documents: the action sheet issued on 20 November 1987 showing that upon the draw-down of the bill the roll-over fees totalling $9,058.93 were to be debited to account number 181.415 and that, upon the maturity of the bill on 22 December 1987, the face value of the bill, $750,000, was to be debited to account 181.415; the purchase advice dated 20 November 1987, showing that the bill was located at Nowra branch; the dealer's slip dated 20 November 1987, showing that the bill was held at Nowra branch; the bill dated 20 November 1987, showing the acceptor as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia; and the bank statement, page 43, in respect of account 181.415 showing that on 23 November 1987 roll-over fees totalling $9,058.93 were debited to the account and that on 23 December 1987 the face value of the bill, $750,000, was debited to the account. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the Attorney-General for New South Wales to commission an investigation into the conduct of officers of the Nowra branch of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in relation to Tony Rigg, with a view to laying criminal charges. In particular, I request that certain investigations be undertaken. First, in respect of each of the action sheets, I request an investigation identifying the bank officer who prepared and initialled the document and the bank officer who examined and initialled the document to determine whether these bank officers should be charged with fraud. Secondly, in respect of each of the purchase advices, I request an examination to identify the bank officer who completed and initialled the document and the bank manager who authorised the draw-down of the bill and initialled the advice, to determine whether those bank officers and bank manager should be charged with aiding and abetting the fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> I further request investigations to: thirdly, in respect of each of the dealer's slips, identify the dealer who initialled the document, identify the checking party who initialled the document and identify the authorising officer who signed the document, and determine whether those dealers, checking parties and authorising officers should be charged with aiding and abetting that fraud; fourthly, in respect of each of the bills, identify the bank officers who prepared the bill in blank as to the identity of the acceptors, identify the bank officers who were present when Mr and Mrs Rigg signed the blank bill, and identify the bank officers who inserted the name of the Commonwealth Bank as acceptor, and determine whether those bank officers should be charged with aiding and abetting the fraud; and fifthly, in respect of the letters of advice that were addressed to Mr and Mrs Rigg, relating to the drawdown or rollover of the bills, determine whether charges should be laid for aiding and abetting that fraud, against the following officers of the bank: S. J. Bennett, L. S. Greenaway, J. S. Irwin, K. D. R. Scarfe, C. J. Scarlett, S. A. Warne and D. M. Wilbraham. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be apparent from what I have exposed here that there should be a public inquiry into bills discount facilities and simulated foreign currency options offered and provided by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to small business proprietors. The appropriate form of inquiry, as I have argued previously, would be a Senate inquiry into banks but I now accept the fact that such evidence as I have tabled here should be placed before the joint inquiry for which submissions close on the 14th of this month. I seek leave of the Senate to table a number of documents, annex A through to X, relating to the allegations I have made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the misdirection of Federal funds and the peddling of misinformation by the so-called environment movement in Tasmania. As most honourable senators would be aware, after a decade of conflict and numerous inquiries which came down on the side of industry but were not implemented due to a lack of political fortitude, the forest industries of Tasmania agreed to participate in the Salamanca process proposed by the then Labour-Greens accord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This process, designed to achieve consensus between the warring parties, has been lauded by Federal politicians, Senators Richardson and Cook in particular, and has been advocated as a model for other States to follow. Participants in the process in Tasmania include the Government, unions, industry, farmers and the Combined Environment Group. It was heavily financed by the Federal Government and had a budget in excess of $10m. </PARA>
<PARA> Fellow senators would also be aware that when the process ended, the resultant forest and forestry industry strategy was agreed to by all participating parties except the Combined Environment Group. Each summer, it would appear, in Tasmania the environment groups launch an area of forestry activity to be campaigned. In previous years, for example, we have had no logging in Jackeys Marsh, no logging in the Douglas Apsley area, no logging in National Estate areas, et cetera. At the end of October the environment movement released its next item on its constantly shifting agenda. It wanted to ban cable logging. When this announcement was made, it was reported in the following manner by the press on 31 October 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Cable logging in Tasmania's forested mountains and hills has caused enormous environmental damage, according to an Australian Conservation Foundation report released yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>The report, whilst it may have been released publicly on 30 October, was in fact one commissioned by the Combined Environment Group as part of its background work for the forest and forest industry strategy. The fact that comments on cable logging from this report were included in the Combined Environment Group's dissenting report means that this report was written well before October, and possibly before September as the forest industries had their comments on the report to the Forest and Forest Industries Council by 13 September. </PARA>
<PARA> So the report is one which was commissioned by the Combined Environment Group and paid for by Federal Government funds. I not sure why the report was commissioned in the first place but, more importantly, I am not sure why it was that a Mr Cadman was paid the fee or the commission to write the report. Mr Cadman, for example, had no tertiary qualifications or expertise in forestry, apart from being a resident of Jackeys Marsh and a notable vocal objector to logging in that area. To engage him as a consultant was thus a blatant waste of Federal Government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that the environmental movement has used the opportunity to fund papers which it would not normally have commissioned, and has provided its mates with some work. I would be interested to know how much Mr Cadman was paid for this report, and perhaps the Minister might be kind enough to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising, given Mr Cadman's lack of qualifications in this particular area, that it was a particularly poor report. It is poor for the following key reasons: firstly, there is no clear statement of objectives. The reader is left to draw his own conclusions as to what the study was about. Secondly, there is no clear statement of conclusions. The reader is required to extract conclusions from the section titled `Summary' and that titled `Conclusions'. Indeed, the two sections yield different and differing conclusions. Thirdly, there is no adequate explanation of how environmental impacts are to be defined, how they are to be measured and what constitutes a serious impact. Fourthly, no photographic evidence is given of examples of environmental impact with sufficiently detailed locational information to allow reinspection in the field to assess significance objectively. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, statements are made which show a basic ignorance of the subject. In Mr Cadman's summary his comments can be interpreted to conclude that environmental impacts of cable logging are serious. Impacts considered are those relating to vegetation, soils, streamside integrity and visual integrity. I will refer to just one of these impacts, soils, which is indicative of the scientific standard, or lack thereof, of this report. There is no explanation of what constitutes a serious impact on soils, or on how this is measured objectively. Nor are there photographs with grid coordinates to back up the comment. The comment relates almost exclusively to erosion and distinguishes between road related and coupe erosion. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of 33 data sheets, one records road batter erosion as massive. No photograph is provided. One records road related erosion as serious. Again, there is no photograph. One records coupe erosion for part of the coupe as only serious, but, again, no photograph is provided. The remainder of the records reveal both types of erosion of soil as `nil' to `some'. </PARA>
<PARA> My conclusion is that there is no evidence of serious soil impact demonstrated in the report. Anyone with some expertise in the soil erosion area talks in terms of tonnes per hectare of soil lost. The more tonnes lost, the greater the impact. Having established the tonnes per hectare, or parts thereof, of soil lost, the significance of the impact then needs to be considered in terms of the impact on such things as plant growth and the possibility of the erosion spots actually growing.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cadman did not estimate in terms of tonnes per hectare of soil lost, nor did he determine the impact in terms of ongoing erosion and the effect on plant growth. The instance I have referred to is indicative of the tenor of the whole report. Mr Cadman presents no significant evidence to back up his conclusions. These, therefore, remain simply as assertions. Yet Tasmanians have been called upon, on the strength of this report and the media machine of the green movement, to question the environmental impact of cable logging. The vast majority swallowed the misinformation as quickly as one could blink. For the industry that defends it, it is too hard to explain properly in a sentence or so, and so it becomes a matter of taking the industry's word against the conservationist's word, and very few, if any, people actually check the facts. So I provide the facts in this contribution tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, cable logging or harvesting of timber is not a new process. It has been used in our State of Tasmania for over 100 years in one form or another. Simply, cable harvesting uses a cable to haul timber to a central point rather than using tracked or tyred vehicles to pull the timber. Cable harvesting is an environmentally friendly method of harvesting timber in particularly steep terrain. </PARA>
<PARA> Like all forestry operations, cable logging must conform to the forest practices code. The code ensures that all environmental factors are taken into account in the planning and implementation of forest operations and that long term impact on the environment is kept to an acceptable level. </PARA>
<PARA> Landscape quality is assessed and harvesting areas are designed such that there is minimal impact on the landscape. This is done by greatly restricting cable harvesting in scenically sensitive areas and controlling it carefully elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Vegetation along streams and water courses is protected to ensure that water quality and aquatic ecosystems are preserved. Areas containing rare or endangered plant or animal species are managed to ensure the continued survival of those species. Usually, this means exclusion of harvesting. Fauna populations are protected in strategically placed wildlife habitat strips, streamside reserves and flora reserves which are not harvested. </PARA>
<PARA> Because cable harvesting does not involve logging machinery moving about over the harvested area, there is typically insignificant ground disturbance. This means that although the terrain is steep, there is typically insignificant erosion in the related harvesting areas. The reaffores- tation of the harvested area is an important consideration in forest planning, and unless successful regeneration is assured, harvesting will not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> After harvesting has removed all the trees, the area is generally burned and sown with seed distributed from aircraft in the particular coupe. Removal of all trees in the coupe gives all the new seedlings an equal opportunity as they are of the same age. This ensures the best trees will grow because they are not forced to compete for light, water or nutrients with older and taller trees that have been left behind after harvesting. The regenerated area is checked after one year and again after two years to make sure the regeneration has been successful. The regenerated area is therefore acceptable from an aesthetic point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to thank the Senate for the opportunity to inform my fellow senators on cable logging and hopefully to dispel some of the misinformation which has recently been touted. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (3) The Australian Federation of Airline Pilots (AFAP) indicated, as early as February 1989, its intention to lodge a claim with the domestic airlines for increased salary levels for pilots. However, the nature and extent of the AFAP's claim was not advised by the Federation until 26 July 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> Given that no claim was lodged by the AFAP until 26 July 1989, it was not possible for the Government or the airlines to predict the nature or the extent of the dispute before this time. Upon lodgement of the claim, the airlines notified the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC), and made themselves available for discussions under the Commission's wage fixing system. Following the AFAP's directive of 17 August 1989 to pilots to work between the hours of 9am and 5pm, the Government and the airlines acted promptly to provide essential air services and to also restore full domestic airline services as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> On 23 August 1989, the Government announced a number of measures including allowing international carriers to carry domestic passengers and the use of RAAF and VIP aircraft. In addition, the airlines arranged for the lease of additional aircraft and crew from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The pilots' dispute was based on a claim for a salary increase lodged by the pilots that was outside of the established wages arrangements of the IRC. In lodging its claim with the airlines, the AFAP advised that they would not work within the established wages system, and wished to pursue negotiations outside of the IRC. In contrast, the airlines reiterated their long standing commitment to the established IRC wage fixing system, and sought the claim to be brought before the IRC.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Australian Airlines advises that the pilots' contract of employment with that airline prior to the dispute did not specify a set scale of entitlements for severance pay. Rather, the agreement provided the AFAP with the ability to raise with the airline the matter of severance pay in the case of redundancy at any time during the currency of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Australian Airlines currently employs 280 pilots. On 30 June 1989 the airline employed 555 pilots.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs approved up to 168 positions under the employer nomination scheme for the permanent entry of foreign pilots between August and the end of December 1989. 104 of these positions were filled. 290 foreign pilots entered Australia as temporary residents after 20 August 1989. I understand that more than 270 of those who entered as temporary residents have already left Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> To be eligible for Australian citizenship, a person is normally required to be a permanent resident of Australia for at least two years. Pilots who entered Australia last year will not be eligible to apply for Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) All of the procedures relating to permanent and temporary entry of pilots were normal operating procedures. The treatment accorded the applications for entry was no different for that normally given to applications from companies with urgent needs to fill positions. That is, where applications are submitted in respect of vacancies which need to be filled urgently, additional processing priority is given to those applications above that accorded to other applications for entry to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are three ministerial councils.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The Conference of Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers (LMC) considers national issues and co-ordination of government activities in areas involving both the Commonwealth and the States on matters such as employment, labour market programs, training, industrial relations and occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Australian Education Council (AEC) promotes the development of Australian education by enabling Ministers of Education to consult on matters of common interest and generally to facilitate the co-ordination of common programs and the exchange of information by providing a forum to discuss policies and procedures at all levels of education; by providing a basis for co-ordinating education policies across all systems; by providing the mechanism for fostering the development of collective approaches to education issues which overlap other portfolios and by exchanging information on education in Australia and overseas by means of published studies and reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Youth Ministers' Council (YMC) is a consultative forum to discuss a wide range of youth affairs issues and to develop co-ordinated youth policies and program services.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) LMC meets twice yearly.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) AEC has two major meetings, and, as required, additional one day meetings, usually held in Melbourne. Each annual meeting is preceded by a meeting of the Standing Committee, which comprises officers nominated by Council members, usually the most senior officers in education portfolios in each State and Territory. The Executive Committee, consisting of the current, incoming and immediate past Chair and five senior officers nominated by Council members, meets several times each year according to need.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) YMC usually meets once a year.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) LMC is jointly chaired by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Industrial Relations. Each State and Territory is represented by the Minister(s) with portfolio responsibility for labour, industrial relations and training. Each Minister is accompanied by the Head of the relevant Department. Other officers deemed essential to the meeting may also attend. New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are invited to attend as observers.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) AEC membership consists of the Ministers of Education of each State and Territory and the Commonwealth. The Chairmanship is shared on an annual rotational basis. The New Zealand and Papua New Guinea Ministers for Education are Associate Members.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers directly responsible for youth policy are the members of YMC. Youth officials representative of Commonwealth and State Youth Bureaux or the equivalent provide support at the meetings. The Chair rotates between the Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Secretariat for LMC is provided jointly by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR), with the Department of Industrial Relations providing the bulk of the administrative support, and Employment, Education and Training co-ordinating matters pertinent to that portfolio. The cost of Secretariat services is absorbed by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) AEC has an independent Secretariat funded on a pro rata basis by the Commonwealth and the States/Territories. The Secretariat consists of a Secretary, a Professional Assistant/Registrar, an Education Officer, an Executive Assistant, a Word Processor Operator and a Clerical Assistant. The total budget for 1990/1991 is $430 654; of which the Commonwealth share is $63 799.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Secretariat support for YMC is part of the function of the Youth Bureau within DEET. The cost of the Secretariat is absorbed within DEET's budget allocation.</PARA>

<PARA> (7) (a) LMC is hosted by each State/Territory and the Commonwealth in turn, and the cost of the venue and any hospitality is borne by the host. The Commonwealth hosted only one meeting during this period, and it was held in conjunction with the Special Ministerial Conference on Training, which was a once-only meeting. Cost to the Commonwealth was $6190.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other costs involved are standard air fare and travel allowances for Commonwealth officers attending the meetings.

They cannot, therefore, be attributed to attendance by an individual at a particular meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) AEC is also hosted in turn by each State/Territory and the Commonwealth, with the host bearing the cost of the venue and any hospitality provided. The Commonwealth hosted a meeting in June 1990. The cost involved was $11 030.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other costs involved are standard air fare and travelling allowances for Commonwealth officers attending the meetings.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Commonwealth and States/Territories host the YMC in turn, and the host bears the cost of the venue and any hospitality provided. The Commonwealth has hosted two of the last three YMC meetings. The cost of the November 1988 meeting was $3390; the cost of the June 1989 meeting was $2 715.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not possible to compile reliable information because much of the information required is not available in published sources or in tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia's taxation law already contains measures to deal with some aspects of tax evasion through the use of offshore companies. These include provisions to counter practices of related entities that attempt to shift profits away from Australia. The Australian Taxation Office has stepped up audit activity on taxpayers with international transactions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking action to prevent the use of foreign companies to accumulate income offshore to avoid Australian tax. The Government introduced into Parliament on 13 September 1990 comprehensive new measures to tax the foreign source income of Australian residents. These measures will crack down on the use of companies and trusts resident in tax havens to defer Australian tax, while reducing the compliance costs of the foreign tax credit system for companies operating in comparable-tax countries. Additionally, they provide mechanisms by which those Australian-controlled foreign companies engaged in genuine business activities in low-tax jurisdictions can maintain their international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is very difficult to estimate the extent of tax avoidance and evasion through the use of companies operating outside Australia to accumulate income offshore free of Australian tax. The estimate cannot be made from information furnished in tax returns because companies not resident in Australia are required to lodge tax returns only if they derive Australian-source income.</PARA>
<PARA> The published annual reports of Australian companies detail the contribution to accounting profits of subsidiaries incorporated outside Australia. However, accounting profits are not always equivalent to taxable income. Because of this, the published reports are very often not sufficient to establish a reliable overall estimate of the amount of taxable income derived outside Australia by all those offshore entities whose ultimate beneficial owners are Australian resident.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the new taxation of foreign source income measures are expected to raise directly $60m-$70m in a full year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 22 October:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that the Minister criticised the Fijian Government for threatening punitive action against academics at the University of the South Pacific in September 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is the Australian Government aware of the fact that an academic at the University of Wollongong is being intimidated by the University authorities over research work he wishes to conduct in the Philippines; if so, does it intend to raise the matter with the relevant authorities at the University.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is pressure being brought to bear on any other academics in Australia concerning their work in the Philippines; if so, why.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. Reports of the threat did, however, lead me to inquire into the position of academic staff at the University of the South Pacific, which is a regional, multi-national institution. The situation is that USP rules require that a member of the academic staff elected or appointed to an official position in any political party shall be deemed to have resigned from the date of election or appointment. The rules also require that Heads of Schools and similar senior academic staff should refrain from public political activities. The University Council has taken the view that these rules are reasonable in a regional body and that they do not unfairly restrict the freedom of University staff to engage in political activity. I am satisfied that the existing rules do not prejudice the integrity of the USP or cut across generally accepted standards of academic freedom, although I would deplore it if they were used, or elaborated, for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I believe that the instance referred to by Senator Vallentine involves an academic in the Department of History and Politics at the University of Wollongong who has sought study leave of a year's duration for 1991 in which to conduct research in the Philippines. I have been informed by the University authorities that the initial application for study leave was referred back to the applicant on the grounds that it was not in accordance with standard University rules and procedures. For instance, the University generally restricts periods of study leave to six months rather than one year. The applicant was therefore requested to resubmit his application and assured that it would be ``assessed by the same rules that apply to all staff.'' Contact with the University does not indicate that the academic concerned has been in any way intimidated by University authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I know of no pressure being brought to bear on any academics in Australia concerning their work in the Philippines.</PARA>

<PARA> Mr D. Cox</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The Terms of Reference for the IDC are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA> (1) In June 1990 the Minister for Defence received a report by Mr A.K. Wrigley titled The Defence Force and the Community, A Partnership in Australia's defence. The purpose of the report was to increase the level of support within the community for Australia's defence and in so doing produce a more capable defence effort using the existing level of resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The report proposes a shift of resources from support functions to capability enhancements and has two main thrusts:</PARA>
<PARA> Greater use of the civil infrastructure and industry; and</PARA>
<PARA> Greater use of Reserve forces.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Defence is at an advanced stage of planning for the proposed introduction of a ``Ready Reserve'' force component. Recommendations on this will be before the Government by March 1991. The IDC will take up the other thrust of the report and develop the concept of greater use of the civil infrastructure and industry to support Australia's defence effort.</PARA>
<PARA>AIMS</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The IDC will recommend a policy framework and principles to guide an increase in industry involvement, use of the civil infrastructure and civilianisation to support the ADF. This will include, but not be confined to, areas such as catering, communications, depot level maintenance of defence assets, transport, medical services and non-military training. Fundamental to this aim is that there should be a major transfer of support activities to industry and the civil infrastructure, but where that transfer would have adverse implications for operations, the implications and additional cost of maintaining those support functions within the ADF should be clearly specified. The IDC will develop and recommend a strategy for implementation of civilianisation and the transfer of support activities to industry and the civil infrastructure, and will report on the proposal for a defence support agency.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The IDC will maintain an overview of relevant parts of a number of studies underway within Defence which are consistent with the report's objectives, these include:</PARA>
<PARA> * the Defence Regional Support Review</PARA>
<PARA> * the Force Structure Review</PARA>
<PARA> * the Defence Communications Corporate Plan</PARA>
<PARA> * the Defence Logistics Redevelopment Project Team and</PARA>
<PARA> * the Review of Depot Level Maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA> OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In its deliberations the IDC should:</PARA>
<PARA> * identify those activities where there is a clear operational requirement for them to remain under military control, in circumstances where the benefits of doing so clearly outweigh the costs;</PARA>
<PARA> * consider the need to ensure competition within industry to provide defence support services;</PARA>
<PARA> * establish a sound costing methodology and an agreed framework for cost-benefit analysis; and</PARA>
<PARA> * consider the implications and costs of the loss of in-house capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The IDC should also coordinate its work with the internal Defence review of the structure of the ADF which is examining the balance between regular and reserve forces, and the study in hand on the flexibility of raising ready reserve components in each Service. The IDC should work in close cooperation with Defence in linking in with these reviews so that the conclusions can be taken forward to Government in tandem.''</PARA>
<PARA> (f) By 31 March 1991</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Minister for Defence</PARA>
<PARA> (h) It is not my intention to release the report of the IDC which will be directed towards assisting the Government to determine its policy approach to the contents of Mr Wrigley's Report.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) In January 1986, the Government announced 19 new awards to enhance and develop the Australian honours system.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) AIDC originally held a 25 per cent shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC). As part of the restructuring of ASC earlier this year when AIDC and Kockums bought out the shareholdings held by CBI Constructors and Wormald, the AIDC equity in ASC was increased to 47.5 per cent. I understand that AIDC traditionally holds 15-30 per cent equity in its investments and in this context AIDC would prefer to hold a similar level in ASC thus freeing funds for other investments. Any changes to the shareholding in ASC are subject to approval by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In accordance with the undertaking provided by ASC in June 1990, arrangements have been made for Kockums to divest 2.5 per cent of its shareholding to a major Australian company by 31 December 1990. This will increase Australian ownership in ASC to 50 per cent. It is expected that the name of the company taking the 2.5 per cent equity will be announced shortly.</PARA>
