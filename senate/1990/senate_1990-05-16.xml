<TITLE>States Grants Schools Assistance Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA>that the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act, 1988 includes legislation, Part III-Changes to Non-Government Schools and New Non-Government Schools, designed to inhibit the establishment, growth and development of these schools in Australia by the imposition of restrictive provisions in the areas of funding, enrolments and approval criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should;</PARA>
<PARA>reconsider the application and implications of this legislation in the light of justice, equity and freedom of choice for parents and have the unfair sections (Sections 8 (2), 8 (15) and 11) repealed.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>

<TITLE>Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned Australian petitioners call on the Australian Government to take real steps to prevent the abuse of human rights of Aboriginals in prison and police custody.</PARA>
<PARA> A Royal Commission was set up to find out in general terms why so many Aborigines die in custody and the circumstances surrounding each death before the Commission. We, the petitioners, would like to express the following concerns:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Aboriginal families and organisations have not received adequate funding from the Federal Government to ensure adequate representation. Yet the Commission faces constant challenge from the powerful police and prison officers' unions in their efforts to shut down the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Royal Commission's report includes recommendations for changes in custodial practices. Yet only some of the recommendations have been implemented, and only in some places, no government body is monitoring the implementation and the deaths continue.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The occurrence of racist attacks, i.e. David Gundy was killed in his home by the Police SWOS. The Coroner's Court verdict on his killing was `death by accident'.</PARA>

<PARA>1. Dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>

<PARA> (a) notes that, once again, the idea is being floated that the USA bases in the Philippines should be moved to Darwin or Northwest Western Australia if the current talks between the US and the Philippines break down and the US decides to move elsewhere;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes, too, that over the years, it has repeatedly been pointed out that Darwin is too far south for a suitable location for such facilities as the Subic Bay naval base or the Crow Valley bombing range and in several other respects could not provide the same back-up that these US military bases require;</PARA>

<PARA> (e) calls on the Government to once and for all state that there is no support for Darwin or anywhere else in Australia to become an alternative location for the US military bases in the Philippines; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) further calls on the government to acknowledge Professor Harris's suggestion that strategic differences in the region need to be brought back to the political level, and that Australia should persuade the US to consult with the region on a foreign policy rather than a so-called defence policy, which is offensive in so many ways.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I introduce this Bill for the better protection of coastal waters in order to draw attention to a need for the Commonwealth to give national leadership in the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said recently about the desirability of the Commonwealth to accept its role as a national government and to assume responsibliity for many aspects of the Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, indicated prior to the recent Federal elections the Government's intention to establish a National Environmental Protection Authority. The Environment Minister, Ms Ros Kelly, has since confirmed this intention. The Minister for Primary Industries, Mr John Kerin, has spoken in favour of a referendum to transfer powers over the environment from the States to the Commonwealth to enable the Government to legislate for environmental protection free of the limitations and impediments that are said to currently exist under our Federal system of Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for such a move has come from an unexpected quarter: the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Nick Greiner, in a statement issued on Earth Day, urged his conservative political colleagues to abandon their ``narrow obsession with States rights'' and to recognise that for some purposes at least, there should be an acceptance of the Commonwealth's role in promulgating national environmental standards. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am encouraged to see the emergence of some sort of consensus on this important question, I don't believe we need to wait for a referendum on environmental powers before translating some of these words into action. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Federation the Commonwealth has possessed a range of constitutional powers which can be used for protecting and enhancing the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's foreign affairs power has been used on a number of occasions to achieve better management of the environment in accordance with Australia's obligations under international conventions and treaties. Without the Commonwealth's assertion of power under the World Heritage Convention, Tasmania's Franklin River and much of Queensland's Wet Tropical forests would not have been saved. Action by the Commonwealth under other treaties has been less dramatic and there is scope for much to be done for the protection of wetlands and estuaries, for migratory bird habitats and, in the future, when appropriate international treaty obligations are established, for many other important components of our environment including our many endangered species of plants and animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade and commerce powers of the Commonwealth, particularly the power to control the activities of trading corporations, have yet to be used in a direct manner for achieving the aims of environmental policy. Since the decision of the High Court in the Tasmanian Dams Case it has been clear that the use of the corporations power to limit and regulate the impact on the environment by companies has been an option available to the Commonwealth. I introduced legislation last year, the Australian Heritage Commission (National Estate Protection) Amendment Bill 1989, intended to realise this opportunity but which has not been debated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth can, and does, attach environmental conditions to licences granted to industrial undertakings pursuant to its power to control exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has full powers of government in respect of the Territories and it has such powers in respect of the coastal sea. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern to me that the Commonwealth, in an initiative of the Fraser Government in 1980, purported to abandon its responsibility for management of the Australian coastal sea and hand this over to the States and the Northern Territory. This was supposedly achieved by the passage through the Parliament of the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980 and the Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Powers) Act 1980, with cognate legislation vesting the seabed in the States and the Northern Territory, and by means of corresponding legislation passed by the Legislatures of the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The coastal sea environment has since then become a cause for considerable public concern and one which the Commonwealth, as the responsible government under the Australian Constitution, ought to be responding. Pollution of the sea from ocean sewage outfalls is no longer merely a matter of aesthetics. It is affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. It is ruining Sydney's famous beaches. It threatens the country's tourist industry. It is bringing the products of the fishing industry, justifiably or not, into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals for kraft pulp mills at Wesley Vale in Tasmania and at Grafton on the New South Wales north coast have raised many of the same concerns. Additionally, there is the justifiable concern that organochlorine compounds which are a component of the effluent from mills of this type will contaminate fish and eventually destroy the economic base of substantial parts of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the Federal Government to these concerns has been unimpressive. The Commonwealth involved itself in the setting of effluent standards for the proposed pulp mill at Wesley Vale not as the government directly responsible for the management of that part of Australia's territory and environment, but merely as the licensor of a proposed exporting industry. It behaved almost as though it were an onlooker, deferring as much as possible to the State Government. On the issue of ocean sewage pollution, the Commonwealth has involved itself even less, treating the problems as matters for State Governments to handle. It has accepted the Fraser Government's attempt to vacate this area in favour of the States as a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill I have introduced is designed to dispel the illusion that the Commonwealth has no direct responsibility for our coastal sea, and to assist in the establishment of uniform national standards for the protection of this very significant part of the Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would amend the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980 in order to give the Commonwealth express powers to formulate codes of practice for the conduct of environmentally sensitive operations within the coastal sea and, in the event that a State does not comply with and apply such codes, to make regulations for their enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill defines an ``environmentally sensitive operation'' to include the discharge of sewage or industrial effluent, the dumping of wastes and fishing within coastal waters which in turn are defined to include the sea bed and subsoil beneath those waters. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 would empower the Minister to arrange for the formulation of codes of practice for regulating environmentally sensitive operations, subject to an obligation to consult with the appropriate Minister of the State and other Commonwealth Ministers, and subject also to a right in the public to comment. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider the provision for public involvement in the formulation of codes of practice to be most important. The pollution standards which the Commonwealth sought to negotiate with the Tasmanian Government and the promoter in the case of the Wesley Vale pulp mill were criticised for permitting vaguely defined organochlorine levels and for their lack of credible safeguards against the contamination of fisheries. Pollution standards for pulp mills subsequently promoted by the Commonwealth have been rejected by responsible organisations such as Ocean Watch which has a brief from the fishing industry in New South Wales to protect its resource. The Commonwealth must ensure that the public is consulted in the formulation of environmental standards and that the codes of practice that emerge reflect a real consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General would be enabled to approve codes of practice so formulated and which specify standards to be observed, practices and procedures to be followed and measures (including restoration measures) to be taken with respect to an environmentally sensitive operation conducted within coastal waters. </PARA>
<PARA> Codes of practice approved in this manner would be advisory, in the expectation that the States would regulate in accordance with their terms under their own laws. In the event that this did not occur, power is given to the Governor-General to make regulations which would prevail over conflicting State laws. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coastal Waters (Northern Territory) Act 1980 would be amended to achieve the same effect in respect of coastal waters adjacent to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my intention in introducing this Bill to draw attention to the unsatisfactory situation which presently exists in this country, where States bid against one another for polluting industries by offering varying environmental standards. The opportunities available to promoters of such developments to ``shop around'' for the most lenient jurisdiction in which to establish a new industry would be curtailed with the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The tendency of less developed States to regard the more polluted condition of waters prevailing in developed areas as some sort of ceiling to which they are free to rise before applying comparable environmental controls, would also be discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to this House. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to amend the Bounty Textile Yarns Act 1981 to provide persons currently eligible for bounty under the Act with an alternative in the form of a once-off capitalisation grant paid in lieu of possible future bounty receipts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision announced on 30 January 1990 to introduce an alternative scheme for textile yarn producers which gives a new impetus for restructuring the industry and achieving the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) plan objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the scheme will generate net reductions in budgetary outlays in net present value terms. Capitalisation grants will apply only to the current bounty period and should not be seen as pre-empting arrangements for the industry beyond June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Production of most textile yarns has been provided bounty assistance since 1982 and this is continuing as part of the TCF plan which is scheduled to run to 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Bounties for textile yarns are an integral part of assistance arrangements for the textiles industry. They have been preferred to tariffs as a form of assistance to help contain input costs to the downstream fabric, clothing and finished textile product sectors. This has enabled those sectors to operate with lower protection levels than would otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The TCF plan provides for progressive reductions in bounty rates to 30% of manufacturing value added by March 1994 and then maintenance at that rate until mid-1995. While costly in budgetary terms ($87.9m in 1988-89), this assistance is phasing down to a tariff equivalent of approximately 15%. </PARA>
<PARA> Spinning of yarns is the most lightly assisted activity within textiles and clothing production and it is at the forefront of the Government's efforts to restructure and revitalise these industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The yarns sector is the vehicle by which we can make real progress in developing an internationally competitive synthetic yarn industry and in adding value to Australia's wool clip and cotton crop. </PARA>
<PARA> A discussion paper was released last September for a review of textile yarn bounty administration by the textiles, clothing and footwear development authority. In subsequent consultations on that paper, a number of firms indicated that a once-off grant in lieu of ongoing bounty would help stimulate the investment necessary for them to become more competitive. In many cases, significant changes to manufacturing operations are required. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence the proposal in clause 8 of this Bill to amend the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 by introducing a new part 3 for ``Capitalisation Grants'', as an alternative to ongoing bounty payments to textile yarn producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that, as proposed in this bill, applications for capitalisation grants will be open to all those who would be eligible for bounty assistance under the textile yarn bounty scheme. Further, introduction of capitalisation grants will be without prejudice to those who elect not to apply and instead continue receiving payments under the textile yarn bounty scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Applications for capitalisation grants must be made to the textiles, clothing and footwear development authority, which is responsible for administering the TCF plan, pursuant to proposed new section 21b on page 3 of the attached bill. Applications should include details of anticipated bounty receipts to mid-1995 under the textile yarn bounty scheme, together with an estimate of the grant sought, and details of how the grant will be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Applications must include a business plan outlining the applicant's business objectives in relation to the production in Australia of bountiable yarn and other TCF products and the marketing of such products, and the applicant's plans for achieving those objectives on a yearly basis against certain criteria specified in proposed subsection 21b (2); notably, the applicant's plans in terms of organisational restructuring, investment, research and development and sales and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> The authority must consider the application pursuant to proposed new section 21c on page 4 having regard to whether the business plan is financially viable, whether it is consistent with the objectives of the TCF plan, and whether the making of a grant is consistent with Australia's International obligations, including obligations under the ANZCERTA agreement with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the authority must have regard to whether the grant sought, or any lesser grant, would be likely to result in reduced budgetary outlays by the Commonwealth (in net present value terms) relative to that which would be the case if the applicant continued to receive payments under the textile yarn bounty scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Following its consideration of the application, the authority must make a recommendation to the minister either for a grant equal to or less than that requested in the application, or no grant at all. The minister's decision must be advised to the applicant with a broad statement of the recommendation of the authority. Where an offer of a grant is made, the offer is subject to the applicant entering into a capitalisation agreement with the authority on behalf of the commonwealth. That agreement may be subject to such terms and conditions as the minister thinks appropriate for achieving the objectives of the business plan pursuant to proposed new sections 21e and 21f on page 5 and 6 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, a failure to meet the terms and conditions included in a capitalisation agreement will, on demand, render the total grant repayable to the Commonwealth, pursuant to proposed new subsection 21f (5). Circumstances beyond the control of individuals however, such as sudden changes in economic conditions, would be an obvious mitigating reason should persons defer, or not be able to fully undertake, a proposed investment which has been nominated as one of the objectives of the business plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and as I mentioned at the introduction of this speech, a person who accepts the offer of a capitalisation grant becomes ineligible to receive bounty in respect of any textile yarn produced on or after the day on which the grant is made, as provided by proposed new section 21h. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the new part to the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act which I have just described is to provide an alternative to bounty assistance that will encourage more rapid progress towards an internationally competitive textiles industry in Australia. Capitalisation grants offer the potential for major investments in new spinning facilities which would operate without bounties and without tariffs for the remainder of the TCF plan. That is, the dawning of an internationally competitive textiles industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not underestimate the challenge facing the Australian Textiles Industry. Already there has been progress, for example, in the cotton sector with major modern facilities in Actil by textiles industries of Australia (South Australia), in Bonds Industries by Pacific Dunlop (New South Wales), and by Rocklea (Victoria and Queensland). </PARA>
<PARA> Capitalisation grants could be of value to firms engaged in restructuring the Australian textiles industry. They could provide for rationalisation and reconstruction of plants by individual firms, mergers between existing players, new entrants combining with existing producers to build new plants. Investment in buildings (provided they are purpose-built), plant, equipment and systems could embrace spinning or related manufacturing like knitting, weaving, dyeing or finishing. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach helps both those who have already invested in spinning as well as vertically integrated producers whose activities extend downstream from spinning. Investment requirements are ongoing and financial restructuring is needed to help those who have modernised get on to the business of manufacturing and international marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial effort is required to restructure and develop the Australian wool, cotton and synthetic fibre industry. As imports gain more liberalised access under the TCF Plan, firms must invest and become internationally competitive. Even more so, new investment is essential if Australia is to meaningfully add value to our wool and cotton crops. </PARA>
<PARA> Capitalisation grants are a potential vehicle for rebuilding Australia's textile industries while, at the same time, reducing budgetary outlays by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> Under current textile yarn bounty arrangements, Commonwealth outlays between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1995 are estimated in present dollar values on a financial year basis as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> $85.96 million for 1990-91; $83.04 million for 1991-92; $81.13 million for 1992-93; $76.67 million for 1993-94; and $74.14 million for 1994-95; total: $400.94 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The capitalisation grant scheme proposed in this Bill as an alternative in lieu of future bounty receipts, is conditional in each instance upon there being a lesser outlay by the Commonwealth on a net present value basis than the outlay required if the applicant had continued to claim bounty in respect of bountiable yarn produced without the benefits of a capitalisation grant. The extent of potential outlay reductions as a result of the new grant scheme will depend however, on the number of firms that apply and are approved, and the nature and timing of their proposals. </PARA>

In other words, despite the fact that the notion on the regulations appears on the Notice Paper in the other place for today, the Minister has indicated he will not proceed in that way and that he wishes to withdraw the regulations from the consideration of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> To go back over what I said on Friday, I made the point that the 1988 review of the Remuneration Tribunal determined that members of the House of Representatives and senators be provided with access to the full range of postal services provided by Australia Post subject to an annual limit of $9,000, and that on 16 August 1989 the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Stewart West, put out a circular in which he stated that members of the House of Representatives would have an increase in their postage allowance from 1 September last year of $30,525 and that existing entitlements for senators would also be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to that, the Honourable Neil Brown appealed to the High Court and the High Court's judgment questioned whether the powers of the Parliament extend to benefits for members having a pecuniary value. Mr West also put out a statement on 1 March this year in which he said that he was advised by the Attorney-General's Department that the High Court had ruled that the Supply Act of 1989-90 did not serve as a sufficient source of appropriation to support the Government's decision to supplement the postage entitlement determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Mr West also stated that legal advice was being sought as to whether recovery of the money was required, and subsequent to that he stated that members of Parliament-and I quote precisely here-`can spend the full extent of their $30,982 postal entitlement confident in the knowledge that no reimbursement will be required in the absence of any further order from the court'. So I drew the attention of the Committee to the fact that Mr West had put out two statements that were in conflict, one with the other. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I am reminded of the fiasco which we had some 18 months ago over the $240 immigration review fee, and I remind the Committee of that fact. In that particular case, we had a government which illegally collected that fee from September 1987 to December 1988, and during the course of that collection the Government sought legal advice. The Government in fact went lawyer shopping in order to get the advice which it sought-that is, the Government sought advice from lawyers until it got the advice that it was okay to go and collect that particular fee. Of course, it was finally the Ombudsman who drew it to the attention of the Government that, in his belief, it was acting illegally. And I suspect that in this particular case the Government has acted in a similar way. We do not currently have before us the advice or legal advice which the Government has received to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would particularly like clarified-and maybe the Government and the Opposition could respond to this-is whether, if this amendment of the Opposition is passed, members of Parliament who had spent more than the $9,000 stamp entitlement would be obliged to return that postage entitlement. Looking at the Opposition's amendment, I believe that that would not necessarily be the case. Even if the amendment is passed, which I would personally see as a very strong moral statement that the Government had acted incorrectly in overturning a resolution of the Remuneration Tribunal, I am in some doubt as to whether that means that members of Parliament who had spent more than $9,000 would actually be obliged to repay that postage. Before speaking any further, I would welcome a response from both the Government and the Opposition on that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins does in fact raise what is probably the most pertinent point. The advice that I have had-and I must say that, though verbal, it is emphatic-from the Attorney-General's Department is that members of Parliament who have expended more than $9,000 during this financial year could not be made to pay back the extra over $9,000 up to $30,000. I am informed that the money will have to be met either by government or by Australia Post to which government has actually made these payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, as I said, the advice was verbal but emphatic. Of course, as with all legal advice, it has to be taken seriously. To be more precise about the timing, it was given to me on Monday evening. As I say, it was emphatic. It says very clearly, first, that the money cannot be recovered from members of Parliament, no matter what side of the Parliament they are on and, secondly, that the only organisation from which government may have a right to recover it would be Australia Post. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we proceed, at the beginning of this debate today Senator Jenkins raised a question about the accuracy of the Hansard report. The following statement is made on page 367 of Hansard:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats will support the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>These were the first words spoken by Senator Jenkins. It is certainly very clearly my recollection of the first words that I heard her speak. Is she or is she not challenging the accuracy of that? I believe that we ought to clear up the suggestion that Hansard has made a mistake before we proceed with the rest of the debate on the substantive amendment that is before the chair. I do not think it is right that this matter should be left up in the air. I do not think any honourable senator would want that. We need to resolve whether or not Hansard was involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I agree with Senator Reid. I was sitting here and very distinctly heard what Senator Jenkins said. In fact, there had been an agreement between the two of us as to what she would say. She did, in fact, say that. She was speaking on behalf of those Australian Democrat senators who would be in fact supporting the Opposition amendment and I would be speaking on behalf of those who were going to oppose it. That is what in fact she said at that time. It does not seem to me to be a matter of great moment. I think it can be fixed up; it is very clear what the situation is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of Senator Reid-and certainly people heard what I said-my actual words were, `I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats who will support the Opposition's amendment'. I realise retrospectively that that was quite an ambiguous statement and Hansard may well have chosen simply to condense my words, which, as everybody knows, Hansard does from time to time when we are over-wordy, repeat things, become tautological and go down the path of a sentence which has no ending, et cetera. We are all very grateful to Hansard on a number of occasions when it puts verbs in our verbless sentences and tidies us up. But the words I actually said were, `I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats who will support the Opposition's amendment'. I hope that is clear as far as the Committee is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those of us who support the amendment, and looking at it purely from the moral point of view-as I also stated on Friday, I know that there are some problems with regard to the legal aspect of it, and it is with regard to those legal aspects that Senator Macklin will speak, after me-the moral point of view being that the Government chose to overrule the Remuneration Tribunal's decision in order to dramatically increase the postage allowance for members of the House of Representatives is something that I believe was incorrect and, therefore, I and some others of the Australian Democrats will be voting with the Opposition on its amendment for that particular reason. Indeed, I would state that it certainly is desirable and democratic that candidates for parliamentary election and re-election should be able to contact their electors, their voters, by mail at least once during the election campaign. The very reason the Government stated it was increasing the postage allowance was so that members of the House of Representatives could make mail contact with their electors. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Canada allows each candidate-whether he or she is a sitting member or not-to have one bulk mail-out to his or her voters as a part of the public electoral funding provisions. That would certainly be a more equitable way of dealing with the situation; in other words, that members, instead of having a postage allowance, have access to a bulk mail-out during the election campaign. It would be more equitable if all candidates, whether sitting members or not, had access to one bulk mail-out so that their electors would know what they were all about and what they stood for. This would make better sense of elections and would be more democratic because it would allow voters to know for whom they were voting and for what those people stood. Indeed, it would present perhaps a more level playing field for all candidates, especially if they are standing against sitting members and especially as far as independent candidates are concerned and new and emerging parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The gross distortion between the $30,000 which was assigned by the Government in the form of postage allowance to the House of Representatives members and the $9,000 which remained for senators, whose constituencies are, by definition, much larger, is untenable. I believe that it is this that the Remuneration Tribunal should be asked to consider. The Australian Democrats who will vote in support of the Opposition's amendment believe that the Government has acted immorally in overturning the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal in ruthlessly, therefore, pursuing its own electoral advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if the Opposition amendment is passed it will be the Government's responsibility to inform the Senate what action it will take. The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), has answered that in part from a legal point of view but not from the moral point of view, and that is what I will be particularly interested in. </PARA>
<PARA> The action of the Government, not the Parliament, has caused the present state of affairs. Therefore I believe it is the Government that has the responsibility to say precisely what it will do. It should also be the Government's responsibility to state whether it has any intention of overruling future Remuneration Tribunal decisions and in what sort of circum- stances it would do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators in this place were denied the opportunity to vote for or against the postage increases for members of the House of Representatives. I believe that it is unconscionable that our much smaller postage is currently suspended, to the detriment of our constituents, while this business is sorted out. For those reasons I and some of the Australian Democrats will be voting in favour of the Opposition's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition amendments before us to the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill 1990 refer to a reinstatement of an amount of $9,000 to both senators and members of the House of Representatives. In other words, it seeks to reduce the amount which is currently set at $9,462 for senators and $30,982 for members of the House of Representatives. I do not wish to canvass what those amounts should be. I indicated very clearly last year and in the second reading debate that I believe the determination of those amounts should be a matter for the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the Remuneration Tribunal vacated the field. The High Court judgment was that there was no one in the field with regard to that particular matter. The High Court judgment states very clearly indeed that what is not permitted is the supplementation of Remuneration Tribunal determinations. It says absolutely nothing with regard to any other area. So there was no determination, as honourable senators who have read through the Remuneration Tribunal determination know; hence there could be no exercise with regard to supplementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that we are faced with is not unique to the postage context. In 1984 exactly the same exercise happened with regard to staff. In 1984 senators and members had two electorate staff. The Government, again, asked the Remuneration Tribunal to vacate the field, and it did. The Government then increased the number of staff from two to three. That is a direct analogy. There is no amendment here which seeks to take the number of staff back to two or to recover the money that had been paid to staff on behalf of senators since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Either a principle is a principle, or it is not. A principle applies legally in all circumstances. We are being asked to determine the legal context with regard to this particular matter. I am well aware that the Parliament has the power to engage in retrospective legislation. It has done so in the past and undoubtedly will do so in the future. But with regard to the particular matter at hand, without any retrospectivity, undoubtedly there was a vacated field, as there was with regard to staff; it was filled by the Government, as it was with staff; and we are asked to deal with one matter rather than all matters. It would have been far better had the amendment sought to deal with all the matters which could be affected or with no such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> But the legal tangle does not stop there. No amounts have been paid to members of Parliament. The money is actually paid to Australia Post. Australia Post is thereby commissioned to provide services to members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post was required to provide $9,462 worth of services for senators and $30,982 worth of services for members of the House of Representatives. What does the High Court say about this? Page 20 of its judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the plaintiff has an interest in knowing whether or not he is entitled to a supplementary allowance, there may be other persons who are not parties to these proceedings whose rights or liabilities would be affected by the making of the declarations sought by the plaintiff-</PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that the High Court refused to make those declarations. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular Australia Post which presumably extends credit to the users of postal credit cards on the faith of a promise of payment by the Minister purporting to act for the Commonwealth. The desirable course to take in these circumstances is simply to allow the demurrer. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the High Court proceeded to do. In the absence of any other judgments of the Court on these matters, I believe it was open, quite properly, to the Government to proceed in the manner in which it did proceed, legally. I am not disputing the proposition whether or not it had a moral claim to do so, but undoubtedly it was able to proceed legally. A member of Parliament was then legally entitled to proceed and use the services offered. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now faced with the exercise of whether we want to proceed with punitive retrospective legislation. This Parliament has done so before and will probably do so again, but on no occasion have I lent my vote to that and I do not intend to do so today. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the moral argument about what ought to have happened, I stand by the argument which I made last year-that is, the Government should not have engaged in this exercise. It ought to have referred the matter to the Remuneration Tribunal and the Tribunal ought to have made a determination. I do not know what the Remuneration Tribunal would make of this proposition and nor does anybody else here. We could not say that it would not make a determination of $30,000 because we just do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that when we try to pursue moral arguments we have to be consistent in a way that we do not have to be with legal arguments. In moral arguments we have to be consistent because we are standing on an absolute principle and that principle refers to all other matters, not just to postage. Although they have not appeared to date, I presume that amendments will be brought forward to rectify all the other contexts which are undoubtedly in identical legal circumstances and were not, in fact, open to members to use. As all honourable senators are well aware, ignorance of the law is absolutely no excuse. So that cannot be used in the case of one or the other. Whether we like them or not we have to accept the particular circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> As I see it, the moral argument is based either on the principle that people should not have gone ahead and used this allowance because there could have been a legal problem-of course, as we now know there is no legal problem with the particular amount that we are dealing with-or on the suggestion that there may have been a rip-off, which I have already referred to. I do not know, and nor does any other senator, what the Remuneration Tribunal would determine. It may be that its determination would be exactly the same as the Government's determination. So there could not be a moral argument based on the notion of a rip-off. </PARA>
<PARA> What the moral arguments boil down to are political arguments. The political argument here is that this money helped the Government. I accept that argument because undoubtedly it was used to attack the Australian Democrats in the last election when senators did not have the same entitlements as members of the House of Representatives. We undoubtedly suffered as a result of that and hence I feel that not only the Government ought not have done it, bearing in mind that the Tribunal was the proper body, but also that we suffered. That does not alter my position regarding moral arguments because a moral argument cannot be based on whether one is politically advantaged or not. It must be based on the absolute principles of whether a thing is right or wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a need to make a judgment with regard to this particular matter on the basis of what is at hand. What is at hand it seems to me, from reading all the relevant documents, reading the High Court judgment, reading the opinions of the legal advisers, is whether the opinions were shopped for or not. I do not know. I think the people who provide these judgments know that they are opening themselves to some type of attack when they do so. Nevertheless, QCs are available to provide opinions. In the absence of the fact that people would not support an amendment so we could actually ask the High Court for such judgments the best we can do within our legal structure is to ask QCs to provide us with them and hope that they are right. </PARA>
<PARA> In those terms, I think it is clearly and unequivocally argued that members of the House of Representatives had every right to expect that they would be able to proceed as they did. That is, as some of them did; others did not. The context at the end of the day is that it will make absolutely no difference what happens with regard to this amendment. The reason for that is very clear. Members have not received anything by way of what the High Court calls remuneration in money terms. Quite clearly the High Court has no intention of making judgments with regard to Australia Post. Therefore, they are the only people whom the Government could get the money back from. I think it would be absolutely outrageous to seek to do so, regardless of whether it is a public or private body, on the basis that in good faith it carried out an activity that it was paid for. That presumably leaves the circumstance with regard to ongoing members of Parliament. Undoubtedly, amendments could be devised where by the money could be sought from those. I am not at all sure what the legal standing would be with regard to those people who were not members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I would like to make is that I am often amazed at how, in terms of judgments that are made with regard to seeking repayments, certain propositions can be advanced if they affect ourselves and other propositions can be advanced if they happen to affect other people. The point of the proposition in these circumstances is that the amount by which $9,000 has been exceeded is $462 with regard to senators and $21,982 with regard to members of the House of Representatives. If anybody was seeking to get a reasonable determination from the Tribunal with regard to both of those amounts I am quite sure with regard to senators that the amount would not turn up as it is. I am quite sure that one would be raised simply on the basis of the constituency which undoubtedly exists. </PARA>
<PARA> This was done by a Minister in the other place. As honourable senators are aware, when they negotiate with Ministers in the other place the Ministers are not quite sure whether the Senate actually exists. Most times they actually forget about it. The Senate does exist. As I pointed out last year, the Senate was the first Upper House in the Western world to be popularly elected. Even the United State Senate at that stage was not popularly elected. The Senate, being a popularly elected House-that is, elected directly by the people-has a constituency in identical democratic terms as the House of Representatives. As Senator Jenkins pointed out, by definition our constituencies are always larger then those of members of the House of Representatives from the same State. Senators need to work with their constituency. I am quite sure in terms of any request put to the Remuneration Tribunal after this matter is dealt with that certainly a submission will be put that any entitlements that are provided be provided on the basis of constituencies. The constituencies of senators are larger than those of a member of the House of Representatives in the same State. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I do not believe the legal situation was such as to make a member operate in anything other than the position as it was presented by the Government and, secondly, it will have absolutely no effect whether this amendment is carried or not. It seems to me that as an exercise it is far better to leave the Bill as it is with the very firm view that the Senate has expressed, and the Government has now accepted, that these matters in the future are matters for the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address a few of the points raised; firstly, the request made by Senator Jenkins and the response by Senator Bolkus. Senator Jenkins asked what would be the effect of this legislation if it was passed in respect of the repayment of the supplementary amount of some $20,000 which was found by the High Court of Australia to be unlawful. I make that point because Senator Macklin in his contribution said that we were validating the Remuneration Tribunal's determination of November 1988 which had become perhaps invalid. I think he said, but I think probably more doubtful, because it did not make a determination in 1989. That is open to debate. I think Senator Macklin was fairly firm on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our understanding and my understanding on the legal advice we have is that the Remuneration Tribunal's determination of 1988 remains on foot. The High Court addressed the supplementary amount of $20,000 odd. That was the basis of its decision. Senator Bolkus said that on verbal advice he received from the Attorney-General's Department he understood that if this amendment went through the Bill would be picked up by either Australia Post or the Government. On past experience on this issue and on advice received from the Attorney-General, unless Senator Bolkus is prepared to give a written copy of that advice and table it, it would have to be in serious doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go back to the whole basis of this amendment. The amendment prevents the Government from validating something which the High Court found to be illegal and doing it retrospectively. That is the whole thrust of this amendment. Senator Macklin talks about moral issues and principles and legal matters. I believe that if the Senate agrees to validate retrospectively something found by the High Court to be illegal--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It found it to be unlawful. If it does that it is setting a precedent which we will regret down the track. What happened? I am reiterating somewhat what I said previously. The supplementary amount of the postal allowance was granted to members of the House of Representatives by the Cabinet, the Executive, without reference to the parliament. It was done for purely party political purposes. It was to enable an incumbent government to entrench sitting members in marginal seats and also to enable a pooling system, which we all know went on, and to use these resources in the pool at taxpayers' expense which were directed at marginal seats not held by them. It was a government which was hell bent to win at any cost-the end justified the means. In this instance it concerned the improper use of taxpayers' money. If the Government is permitted to get away with rorting the system in this way one has to ask what it will attempt to do next time around. I believe that this is a matter of high principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the belief of the Opposition that this cost is one which must be paid by the candidate or his party and not by the taxpayer. I would have thought that the way the postal allowance was paid was such that the postage allowance was issued by the post office, the Government paid and it is up to the Government to recover it. As this was done for purely party-political purposes on the eve of an election, it would seem to me that if the candidate or the member has overspent on incorrect advice, on something that was subsequently found to be illegal, it is up to that political party, if it has any principle at all, to pay him back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened very carefully to what honourable senators have said in this discussion. I wish to take up a couple of matters that were raised by Senator Macklin and to deal with the question of the entitlement of members of parliament to a postage allowance for the purpose of servicing their electorate-whether that be an electorate for a House of Representatives seat or, as Senator Jenkins indicated, our electorates as senators, which cover the whole of the State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Clearly this is a matter which over time has been one for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine. The Remuneration Tribunal in this instance determined the amount, and that determination was in place when the Government made its decision to top up, for its own purposes, that amount. But it was not topping up for the purpose of a postage allowance as determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, because that Tribunal's decision is for a postal allowance for the purpose of the elected member to service the electorate. The topping up in this case was for purely political propaganda purposes. I do not think it really did a great deal of good, because I know of many constituents who were very cheesed off with getting two, three or four letters in the post from the same individual within a month. Nevertheless, let us get the matter clearly in perspective. It is not really topping up; it was for a purely political purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are now in a position of having before us a piece of legislation which will retrospectively endorse that decision taken by the Minister in the other place. The question is whether we support this legislation, which retrospectively endorses that decision. I do not see the amendment proposed by Senator Parer as being in effect punitive retrospective legislation. Such legislation would be punitive only if there were a previous entitlement-and there was not a previous entitlement granted by the appropriate authority, in this case the Remuneration Tribunal. It had not made that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested by Senator Macklin that an analogous case is what happened when the Remuneration Tribunal abandoned the field as to parliamentary staff and it was taken over by the Government. That is a matter which I should like to see back in the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal; but the fact is that it was taken over by the Government and that was agreed presumably by all parties. In this case, however, we have the problem where the Remuneration Tribunal's determination is in existence and there has been a top-up for the purpose that I have mentioned. I heard what the Minister said as to whether the amount of money that has been expended can be recouped even if this amendment goes through. It certainly can be recouped. From whom is a moot point. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Parer that it is one thing to get a verbal opinion, but quite another to get a written opinion, with reasons provided. I think that is the least that we should get here; but even if we got that I am not so sure that the Attorney-General's Department's opinion would necessarily be influential. I wonder whether the Attorney-General was asked by the Minister in the other place for his opinion when the Minister there made the decision to provide this substantial amount of money, $30,982, to each and every member of the House of Representatives. I wonder whether the Attorney-General was asked his opinion on that occasion, and I wonder what opinion he would have given in that circumstance. Was there any opinion available to the Minister at that time-and I am asking the Minister-as to the legality or otherwise of that decision?</PARA>

If he did, it would have been a strange opinion, because subsequent events in the High Court have shown that it did not stand up to challenge. We are being asked by the Minister to reject the amendment moved by Senator Parer on the ground of an oral opinion with which he has indicated the Attorney-General's Department has provided him. I do not disbelieve the Minister. I am sure that the Attorney-General's Department has provided him with an oral opinion.

<PARA>That the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules Nos 88 and 89 of 1990 and made under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been some consultations about this matter in the past hour and it seems somewhat confusing. For that reason it is not my intention, or that of others in this place, to have a long debate at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an unusual situation because in this case the regulations require a positive motion of the Senate for their approval. Nonetheless, they are still subject to the 15 sitting day rule. Moreover the Act under which the regulations operate will not become operational until those regulations are passed. It is a somewhat confusing situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that earlier there was some confusion as to whether the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) was seeking an adjournment of the debate or whether he was seeking to withdraw the regulations altogether. Certainly the Australian Democrats have some difficulty with particular parts of these regulations. However, let me put it on record fairly and squarely, as I did at the time of the debate on the therapeutic goods legislation, that we are in favour of it and we are also in favour of the broad thrust of the regulations. However, we do have difficulty with particular parts-the areas of advertising, fees, appropriate representation and the provision of information to the committees which will make assessments in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the matters which occurred earlier this morning in relation to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) wishing to allow a longer time, it seems appropriate that these regulations should be disallowed at this stage so that the decks are cleared and there are no regulations before either House of Parliament. That leaves the Minister in a situation in which he can, at a later time, bring back these regulations or some amended regulations which can then be considered. The sooner that is set in place, the clearer everyone will be. Then the definitive regulations, in whatever form, can be brought back and debated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated earlier this morning, the Opposition supports this proposal. When the Therapeutic Goods Bill was before us last year, the Senate amended that Bill to provide that the Act itself would not commence until after each House of the Parliament had approved regulations by a positive mechanism-that is, each House of the Parliament had to approve the regulations by a positive vote within a period of 90 days and with certain other technical qualifications. Last week Senator Tate, representing the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) put down a motion which appears on the Notice Paper. Originally it was to be decided today but subsequently, under standing order 77, it was postponed to a later day in order to allow that procedure to be followed. That was a motion that, in accordance with section 2 of the Therapeutic Goods Act, the Senate approves the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 88, made under the Act and tabled in the Senate on 8 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the meantime, regulations were also being proceeded with in the normal fashion in terms of being gazetted and they have attracted the attention of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Through Senator Colston, a motion was put down seeking their disallowance on the grounds that they may not be in conformity with the normal tests which the Regulations and Ordinances Committee applies to these matters. The same regulations attracted a motion from Senator Coulter, who sought to strike them down for different reasons-reasons which go to questions of consultation with the industry; whether they are perceived to be fair and proper on the basis of the charges involved and the exclusion of certain interests relating to herbalists and naturopaths; whether they are over bureaucratic and do not take sufficient account of the information available from overseas testing and licensing authorities; whether the costs and the fees are appropriate; whether there are appropriate appeals mechanisms; and whether there is a duplication of legislation between the Commonwealth and the States covering exactly the same areas of regulation. So, we have got ourselves into a slightly confused situation in which the motions of Senator Coulter, the Minister and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee-all on pretty much the same subject-are all floating around. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the question of whether the regulations have a particular standing under the Acts Interpretation Act, or whether they do not as a result of the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Act, and whether at a subsequent time section 2 of the Therapeutic Goods Act supersedes the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to bring about some resolution of these matters, we think that the course of action now proposed is correct-namely that pro forma, without a debate of the substance of the issues that I and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee have raised, we should simply strike down these regulations and allow the Government to go back and look at two matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters are, first, the concerns about the actual issues which may need consultation. I understand that the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services is prepared to have some consultation with affected parties during the course of the recess. The second is to make absolutely clear, to the extent that we can, the exact legal position vis-a-vis the Therapeutic Goods Act, the Acts Interpretation Act and the regulation making procedures and mechanisms of this chamber and of the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason we will support the motion which has been moved. As a result, the decks will be cleared and in the Budget session the Government can come back, having sorted out the issues of principle and the legal questions which arise about the status of these regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it very clear that the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), as relayed by me to the chamber early this morning, clearly intended that the regulations not be the subject of any parliamentary debate in this session in either the Senate or the other place. What we are trying to do is to deal with the best formal procedural way to make it clear that these regulations do not have any status or effect. There is some confusion as to how to describe the true parentage or the way in which these regulations, if they are in being at all, truly come into effect. There is confusion between the Acts Interpretation Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act. I believe that we can be sure that in the next edition of Odgers a full chapter will be devoted to this saga.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Minister, in putting these regulations together, of course believes that they do comprehensively deal with the matters which have been of great concern and discussion and exhaustive consideration with the various interest groups over a period of some two years. Therefore, I will not be voting for this disallowance motion but we will not be dividing on the motion. Honourable senators should understand that this is a mechanism to make it absolutely clear that the regulations are not in existence as such during the period of further consultations over the winter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to the debate on this clause at some length already and there has been quite an amount of totally unrelated discussion on it. But the Remuneration Tribunal's powers were firmly established by the Parliament and at the time that it was decided by the Government to make this amendment the Opposition made it adequately clear that it saw that this decision was wrong. It served notice on the Government that it was wrong and took it to the court. It was absolutely clear that that was the action that was taken and that anybody who was going to run the risks knew that he was running risks. In addition, the court in its wisdom confirmed our view 5-0. This corridor view that the Minister may have had at the time was apparently worth the paper it was not written on. But it was clear that the payment was unlawful. There is no question about that and no-one has disputed that the payment was unlawful. As such it was legally and morally imperative that the Government should recover it. Moneys paid wrongly or in error or unwisely that are against the law must be recovered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not adequate to pass validating legislation to say, `Oh yes, it was a mistake but it served the purpose and so we will make it okay'. There can be no confusion as to what the action should be. We in this chamber and those in the chamber over the other side make the laws. Surely it is not too much to expect that we should uphold the laws and that we should support the courts in the upholding of the laws. It would be totally and absolutely improper for us to approved retrospectively such a flagrant misuse of public funds. As such, I call on the support of all honourable senators from all parties around the chamber to consider this amendment and to support it totally. </PARA>

<PARA>We agree with the point raised by Senator Parer.

To take the schedule out altogether would in fact be restrictive of the Tribunal. What we sought to do was give the Tribunal a wider scope but not an inclusive scope.

<PARA>The proposal here is, as the Opposition was attempting to do, to leave out that particular subsection, because on our reading it will in fact limit the Remuneration Tribunal's range, and our feeling is that, for a sensible determination from the Tribunal, it must be given the broadest possible scope to look at all these matters and, hopefully, at some stage regularise the entire context. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the study done last year certainly points the way to a wholesale rationalisation. I hope that this Parliament will do that, unlike what it has done in the past with regard to these matters where political advantage has been seen and taken, and that in fact the Tribunal's determination, when it has sat down and worked out what should be done, is allowed. A lot of fine words have been uttered in this debate so far about the Tribunal but, quite frankly, in terms of the history of this place, its reaction to the Tribunal has been, every time it has made a determination, to denigrate that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think one can have it both ways. There may be splendid people on the tribunal, but one cannot say that their judgment is so fatally flawed that, every time they make a determination, it happens to be wrong. If honourable senators believe that it is a good way of doing it, at some stage this Parliament should either commit itself to supporting the determinations of the tribunal or get rid of the tribunal, as I suggested the last time we went through this silly exercise. To do neither of those seems to be simply an exercise in futility-and costly futility at that. Why ask someone to support something that it is not intended should be supported?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not say that every determination of the tribunal necessarily has to be accepted but, on anyone's reading, the way that every decision has consistently been knocked back when it refers to this Parliament, and every decision accepted when it refers to something outside, smacks either of cowardice, political opportunism, or both. If that situation is to continue, if I were sitting on the tribunal, I think that I would say that I would no longer determine matters, because it is wasting time and it is costing revenue. I would go out there and make determinations on all the other matters. Quite frankly, as the Opposition has said, and as this Bill introduced by the Government provides, I think that members of the tribunal are now the correct people to make a determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also said with regard to these matters that I believe that the studies that have been done overseas, particularly in Great Britain by the conservative government, are well worth reading. Unfortunately, I think that the previous debate showed that people had not read those findings. The tribunal, as it did in part this time but did not follow through, and as the various tribunals have done overseas, should seek to start from scratch and seek a determination which is in keeping with the task that people are asked to undertake. Then, the tribunal should go out and argue for its determination. A political problem is always involved in this type of situation, but at some stage we have to stop and say, `It is no longer sensible to engage in the type of lauding that we have carried on today and then also to carry on with the denigration of the determinations of that lauded tribunal'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) has just said, and the Senate agreed, we are debating cognately a traditional package of six Bills-the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1989-90, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1989-90, and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1989-90, Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91, Supply Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 and the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1990-91.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three Appropriation Bills appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures which are additional to those authorised by Parliament in the Appropriation Bills presented following the annual Budget. The three Supply Bills-namely, Supply Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1990-91, and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill  1990-91-seek appropriations for the services, including capital works, of the Government for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1990, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills which will form part of the next Budget, the 1990 Budget, will have been enacted and they will, of course, subsume these Supply Bills. The Supply Bills are in their traditional form. They normally appropriate five-twelfths of the expected expenditure based on last year's expenditure of the Government to get its operations running through those first five months of the next financial year. I have no further comment to offer on those Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming back to the three Appropriation Bills before the Senate, additional appropriations contained in the Bills generally fall into two categories. First, there are additional requirements of an ongoing nature which result primarily from cost and price increases and other parameter variations which have arisen since the Budget was drawn up-in this case now more than nine months ago. To the extent that the forecast parameters at that time were set at overly optimistic levels, a scenario with which we are only too familiar with our current Treasurer (Mr Keating), these parameter variations result in additional expenditures if they have been too optimistically forecast. That is therefore effectively a loosening of fiscal policy, and that is what we are seeing with these Appropriation Bills-a loosening of a fiscal policy which is already far too loose. I will come back to that later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very sensitive about these parameter variations, so sensitive in fact that its contribution, other than in relation to the national wage case decision, to the Additional Estimates is not available for public scrutiny. That allows the Government and the Treasurer to set unrealistic parameters and provide a false view of the economic situation for months before the additional appropriations are brought to account. We have had plenty of evidence of the Treasurer putting his head in the sand over the current state of the economy in recent times. Again, I will come back to that later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> The second general category of additional appropriations relates to those required to meet commitments approved by the Government since the Budget was prepared last year. The amount sought in the additional appropriations this year in gross terms, an amount in excess of $1,000m and a net figure of $664.7m, is huge by recent standards. The net $664.7m compares with $217m last year, 1988-89, and only $89m in 1987-88. That huge increase compared with recent years is evidence of the vote-buying bill that was chalked up by this Government in the months preceding the election, and it is also the result of the gross mismanagement, by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in particular, of the debilitating pilots dispute last year. Of the total additional appropriations sought of $664.7m, nearly $125m is attributable solely to additional expenditures associated with the pilots strike. One can very strongly assert that the pilots dispute and the $125m that it has cost the taxpayer through these additional appropriations are due to the fact that the Government did not have the ability or the courage to tackle the pilots dispute through the proper channels and particularly because it was unprepared to take on the union movement at large as distinct from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots over the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said in his second reading speech in the other place that the additional appropriations add 0.8 per cent to total estimated outlays. That figure is correct in a technical sense, but the additional appropriations do not include special or standing appropriations. The more appropriate measure of additional appropriations needs to consider the percentage increase in annual appropriations only. That shows an increase, not of 0.8 per cent but of three times that, namely, 2.3 per cent. This relaxation of outlays comes at a time when it appears that the forecast Budget surplus for 1989-90 is likely to be undermined by significantly smaller revenues than expected at Budget time and, as I say, accompanied by an expenditure overrun. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the data available for the first nine months of this financial year, the increases in outlays and the shortfalls in revenue suggest that the Government could be facing a Budget surplus around 20 per cent smaller than was forecast at Budget time. The Budget forecast was for a surplus of $9.2 billion. There is every indication on the basis of the first nine months figures that that surplus will come in at less than $8 billion. This is just one manifestation, but one of many, of the loss of control which is evident in the Government's policy settings generally. It is for that reason that I move the following second reading amendment-which I think has been circulated-on behalf of the Opposition to Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA> I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add ``but the Senate notes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the worrying relaxation of fiscal policy, as signalled by additional gross expenditure since the 1989 budget of over $1 billion;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the Hawke/Keating Government should immediately formulate a tighter fiscal strategy involving budget cut-backs;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that this strategy should be accompanied by the announcement of a comprehensive anti-inflationary strategy that must include extensive labour market and micro-economic reform; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) that the Australian economy cannot hope to deal with its stagflationary problems and enormous growth in foreign debt unless the Government adopts a tighter fiscal strategy and a comprehensive anti-inflation strategy as matters of urgency.''</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to look at each of those four points of major concern to the Opposition. Indeed, they are of major concern to the whole nation. In recent days we have seen exposed a government which is deeply divided in its views and in which the senior economic Ministers cannot even agree as to whether the economy is in recession or not. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is clearly in chaos. It is deeply divided. A deeply divided government is a government which cannot govern itself, and a government which cannot govern itself cannot govern the nation. The Government urgently needs to reassess its fiscal position. There is increasing evidence for all to see that the Government's overall economic strategy is falling apart. Continued reliance on monetary policy has left this country struggling to sustain investments which will generate real returns, has crippled tens of thousands of home buyers and has put the dream of home ownership out of reach for many others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should reduce its reliance on monetary policy and tighten up on fiscal policy. Instead of that we find that we are now debating three Appropriation Bills which add up to additional expenditure in excess of $1,000m. The Government comes to Parliament to appropriate those additional funds. Yesterday the Treasurer told the Parliament, and on another occasion the Caucus, that he will look at some spending cuts in the run-up to the August Budget but that it appears the expenditure review that will be undertaken will be essentially a housekeeping exercise rather than one involving major cuts in programs. In his statements yesterday he also ruled out any tightening of wages or monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is virtually admitting that he will not take any further action of a significant nature on the fiscal policy front. He has ruled out any tightening of wages or monetary policy and any change in the wage-tax deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), a deal which has cemented into the Australian economy and inflation rate of the order of at least 7 to 9 per cent, and he has ruled out any real further reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement. Indeed, there is every indication that the public sector borrowing requirement will increase next year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that inflation is the No. 1 economic problem facing this nation. It is equally clear that Australia's record in this area is shameful. In 1988 Mr Keating said, accepted, that Australia's No. 1 economic problem was inflation. He did not address the issue then; nothing has changed since. When, back in February of this year, he was asked how important fighting inflation was Mr Keating was reported in the Australian as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>What we are about focusing on next year is inflation declining to a year average of about 6 per cent. At the moment, the real rate of inflation is running at about 7.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he thought that we might get inflation down to 6 per cent next year and seemed to think that that was an acceptable proposition. But even that prediction looks like coming unstuck. The consumer price index (CPI) was running at 8.6 per cent in the 12 months to March of this year. It has been rising, not falling. </PARA>
<PARA> Our inflation performance relative to that of our major trading partners is disastrous. Our inflation rate is running at about twice that of our trading partners, and has been virtually throughout the life of this Government. Indeed, on a comparative basis, that is, comparing Australia's inflation rate with that of our major trading partners, we have the worst record for inflation in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Bernie Fraser, recently put the Government on clear notice that inflation had to be tackled as the No. 1 problem. He said that the Government should take policy measures to halve the rate of inflation. He said that we need a circuit-breaker, that we are locked into a high continuing inflation rate which is leading to economic slowdown and economic recession, and therefore we have a stagflation situation in this economy. Mr Bernie Fraser pointed out-quite rightly, because it is so obvious-that we must get our inflation rate down and get some sort of circuit-breaker to break the pattern. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to that the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, said, `If we could get a circuit-breaker that would be good but really there is nothing practical we can do'. At least that was one step up on the Treasurer's response which was, quite simply and bluntly, `We do not need a circuit-breaker because we have not really got a problem with the economy or with inflation in this country'. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not tackle our inflation problem all the other fine words, all the other policies that might be adopted by governments, corporations or households, will go for nought. If we could see some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the Government's approach to economic management across the board, then the present level of inflation, serious though it is, might be seen in a longer term context of falling inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not the case. Any serious anti-inflationary strategy by any government that is serious about trying to tackle inflation must have an anti-inflationary strategy that is inextricably linked to labour market and micro-economic reforms. Again back in February the Treasurer himself admitted in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald that the wage-tax deal struck with the ACTU, `would mean the inflation rate'-in Australia-`would continue to remain higher than that of its major trading partners for some time to come'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, I repeat, the Treasurer told the Caucus that the wage-tax deal with the ACTU would not be altered. In other words, the Treasurer yesterday said, `Inflation is going to continue high and this Government is not going to do anything about it'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, though, obviously understands the problem. The problem is this: the accord cannot deliver sustainable wage increases which will allow us to regain our competitiveness or help us to trade our way out of our debt problems. But the Treasurer, having recognised the problem, is unable to deliver a wage system that will encourage and foster productivity because his hands are tied by his union mates. While he is taking that attitude, he is blasting the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, in an incredible vitriolic, public, humiliating outburst, for dragging his heels in economic reform in the areas within the responsibility of his portfolio, namely, tariffs and protection. </PARA>
<PARA> On Monday of this week the Treasurer, in the most outspoken attack I can ever recall a senior Minister making on another senior Minister-and he was doing it, I might add, as the Deputy Prime Minister of this country-had the gall to attack the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce whilst giving the impression that everything that he, the Treasurer, has done has been rosy and has really been working towards tackling the significant problems facing this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing could be further from the truth. The Treasurer's record, the economic performance record of this Government, is the worst in our post-war history, particularly when we compare our situation with that of our major trading partners-and that is what we have to do if we are to look at where this country is going economically in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, above all Ministers, is guilty in that regard. He showed in his comments on Monday in the middle of his vitriolic bucketing of Senator Button, who has just joined us, that he did not have a clue about the state of the car industry and it was about the car industry that he was bucketing Senator Button. He showed that he did not have a clue about the waiting lists and waiting times for vehicles in the industry. He had to be publicly corrected by Senator Button yesterday, and I am glad that he was. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has also demonstrated monumental inaction when after the 1987 election in a power duel with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce he got the then Industries Assistance Commission (IAC)-it is now the Industry Commission-into his claws, because he was going to be the great maestro of micro-economic reform, and he went for months and months without utilising that very powerful resource that he had grabbed in a power struggle from Senator Button-namely, the IAC. </PARA>
<PARA> So when it comes to micro-economic reform, senior Ministers are brawling between themselves over the appropriate rate, the scope of reform and indeed who should be undertaking it. We have seen more rhetoric by this Government on the question of economic reform than we have seen in terms of most of its other activities. Rhetoric is the name of the game with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the Government's record of what has been achieved in micro-economic reform since it placed it high on its agenda several years ago, one sees that the actual results have failed totally to match in any shape or form the rhetoric that has been expressed. In the areas of transport, the waterfront, shipping and telecommunications, which desperately need reform and restructuring, the results have been lamentably missing. Quite clearly, the process of micro-economic reform will not be undertaken by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point in the second reading amendment that I will mention briefly concerns the debt facing Australia, a debt which now totals not far short of $150 billion. Seven years ago, when this Government came to office, the figure was of the order of $30 billion. The debt crisis could not be better demonstrated than by the growth in the current account deficit and the net external deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) since Labor came to power. In 1982-83, the last year of the previous coalition Government, the current account deficit amounted to 3.9 per cent of GDP. It grew to 5.4 per cent in 1988-89 and has been higher on other occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Economic Planning Advisory Council-EPAC-stated in its paper on external debt, which was presented last year, that a current account deficit of around 2.5 per cent of GDP was necessary in order simply to stabilise the debt relative to GDP, let alone get it down. The fact that this Government has failed to reach this target is evident in the ratio of net external debt to GDP, which has grown from a mere 13.5 per cent in 1982-83 to an astonishing and disturbing 32.2 per cent in 1988-89. I say `disturbing' very understandably and meaningfully because our debt is clearly running away at an unsustainable level. We now have a situation where at the end of December last year our gross external debt, as I said, stood at $148.1 billion. Until we have a government which is prepared to tackle the underlying problems which are leading to those manifestations of grave problems in the Australian economy and a government which is seized of those problems and prepared to take action, they will continue to multiply; the economy will continue to recess; and the living standards of every Australian-living standards which have been battered year in year out under this Government-will continue to decline. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriation and Supply Bills that we are debating cognately are only one small part of the total scenario, but they are a significant part because the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance, on introducing the Bills, demonstrated that the Government has no intention, through fiscal policy or any of the other major arms of macro-economic policy, of moving into a higher cog of concern over the economy. It has shown painfully over years now that it has no scope, no ability, no willingness and no skill at tackling the area of micro-economic reform. The lack of purpose on micro-economic reform and the lack of willingness to tackle the macro-economic reform issues are of great concern to this economy and mean that we are in for a very rocky ride ahead. It is inconceivable that the Treasurer cannot even agree with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce that we have a situation of economic severity. The Treasurer is not even prepared to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time the Treasurer got out and saw what is happening in the real world. It is about time he saw what is happening to people, households and small and large business alike in this country and moved himself into a higher cog of concern, because this country is going down the drain. It is going down the drain because of the breathtaking complacency of this Government. For that reason the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition to these Appropriation and Supply Bills is significant in highlighting the problems and the malaise that we are suffering and I hope that it will have the support of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us look at our situation. We have net overseas debts of $117 billion. Much play is made of the fact that this is not Federal government debt. That is a red herring. It is a debt of the Australian economy and the interest on it has to be paid out of the Australian economy. The fact that there is so much overseas debt is because we have been living recklessly beyond our means, borrowing overseas to maintain our living standards. That is the fault of this Government, although the public has not yet sheeted home the responsibility to it. But it will. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest bill on our overseas debt at the moment is about $12 billion a year and this represents 21 per cent of our export earnings-21 per cent and rising.

Certainly, we made a few minor improvements, but our competitors have made greater ones. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, Madam Acting Deputy President, the tragedy was that none of the key issues was closely discussed during the election campaign. The election campaign seemed to be a sort of auction as to who was going to be able to get interest rates down the most and the fastest. Discussion on interest rates seemed to be exclusively on their effect on home buyers, ignoring the fact that interest rates dramatically affect business investment and by holding the Australian dollar artificially high, reduce our international competitiveness. We are members of the world economic scene and the world does not owe us a living. We have to earn it. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought the whole election campaign was a tragic farce and started stirrings in my mind as to whether Australia is really governable. A country becomes ungovernable if the things informed people know should and must be done are not done because of fear of the reaction of voters or perhaps the obstruction of the bureaucracy. This was the reason for the collapse of the Argentine, once probably the wealthiest country per capita in the world. Informed people in the Argentine knew what should be done but they did not do what was needed because they did not dare to. Like the Argentineans, we have to change and our attitudes have to be tackled and changed as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the issues that I do not think were properly discussed during the election campaign. One could not reasonably argue that the environment was not an election issue, or that it did not have a significant effect on the result. Yet, the debate, and the outcome, was curiously unsatisfactory. The problem seems to be that, for many, the environment has become a sort of religion. Yet, like religions, there are many sects. </PARA>
<PARA> First, there are the ex-communists. Many of the greens are re-ducoed reds. They have lost confidence, not surprisingly, in communism but now have a new cause. The one they have chosen might seem surprising because communist regimes, with command economies, have proved disastrous environmental managers-by far the worst in the developed world. Now these re-ducoed reds seem to want us to use the same command economy methods to wreck our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Every religion has its fanatics, and the second green group are those who, to quote John Kerin, would like us to live in caves, eating grass, provided the grass has been killed in a humane manner. I do not think they will have many followers. We must be watchful that they do not influence our environmental policy in foolish ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The third, by far the largest group, comprises those who are genuinely and properly concerned about what we are doing to this earth. Our first task must be to clean up our own country-to stop the degradation of farming land, the salination and poisoning of our watercourses, the overclearing, and the pollution of our atmosphere and of our coastline. These will be costly to cure. But there will be economic as well as environmental benefits. To achieve the cure, the coalition will have to reconsider its attitude to Federal-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The economists have a lot to do too. It is perhaps not their fault that gross domestic product is now used for a purpose for which it was never intended. Yet we do seem to need a measure of economic progress and surely it must take into account the depletion of capital stock and environmental changes. We also need clear indications of the economic costs and benefits of various environmental improvements so that we can make rational decisions after looking at possible alternative uses for those resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Our contribution to world pollution problems is more difficult. We are not major polluters and we must beware of destroying our economy by trying to set an example which inevitably would be regarded as a curiosity rather than something to be followed. We must press for cooperative action on atmospheric and maritime pollution and, above all, on population. Humanity is like a colony of rabbits on a small island, breeding too fast and destroying the island. We must press for world action on all the key problem areas and we must maintain the agreed standards. We must not crucify our industry and destroy our international competitiveness by going beyond those standards. </PARA>
<PARA> We do desperately need economic development. Our basic problem is that we are consuming more than we are producing. And it is bizarre but consistent with the Treasurer's normal behaviour that he should describe as `beautiful' figures which showed a sharp drop in Australian production. </PARA>
<PARA> Our productivity in manufacturing and transport, except road transport, is atrocious. Take two examples: in Japan it takes 15 hours to build a car; in Australia it takes 35 hours. And this does not include the higher quality control in Japan. `Ah', you may say-as I am sure the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is about to say-`but the Japanese have more robots', a point I will come to in a moment. So let us look at something where Australians and Japanese are using identical equipment. A container crane in an Australian port loads and unloads half as many containers an hour as an identical crane in a Japanese port. The whole Australian community, and our exporter in particular, pays the price. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that Australians cannot be productive. Our primary producers are probably, per capita, the most productive in the world. But in the manufacturing and transport sectors we are bedevilled by what must be just about the worst industrial relations and pay fixing system in the developed world. This, too, was barely discussed in the election campaign. As the campaign went on, we seemed to be more and more saying that our policy was not all that different from the Government's. </PARA>
<PARA> Our industrial relations system is an unhappy mixture of three strands. There is the British tradition of multiple unions, often with a craft basis and with a very damaging tradition of `them' and `us', making for constant confrontation. The second strand is one we introduced ourselves, an idea that was popular in the late nineteenth century, a hundred years ago, of a highly legalistic, adversarial and centralised dispute settling and wage fixing system. And, finally, there is the very unfortunate division of responsibility between Federal and State jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The results are awful, seen in our very high level of industrial disputes by world standards and productivity in heavily unionised areas which is about half that of our competitors. Worst of all perhaps is the deplorable wage fixing system, which extorts high wages from businesses able to pay them and then, under the guise of comparative wage justice, inflicts them on businesses unable to pay them, with a consequent loss of jobs-forced on the workers, of course, by the trade union bosses despite the fact the workers might be prepared to forgo the wage rises if it meant retaining their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more extraordinary statements during the last election campaign was that of the Treasurer, Mr Keating, who argued that the Accord-the deal done between the trade union bureaucracy and the Government, with the theoretically independent industrial commission merely a rubber stamp-was essential for wage restraint. It may be essential under our existing disastrous industrial relations system but many other countries, without any such accord and with economies working much better than ours, have managed to restrain unaffordable wage rises much more successfully than we have. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, Madam Acting Deputy President, what we desperately need in this country is an industrial relations system that has three features. First, there must be a single union in each workplace. Secondly, the workers in each workplace must be sheltered from industrial disputes in other workplaces that do not concern them. Thirdly, the workers in each workplace must have an interest in the success of their enterprise, either through profit sharing or some other mechanism that involves them in the enterprise's success. </PARA>
<PARA> Other countries have systems like this, and such a system is vital if we are going to get out of our current economic mess. But the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Government are moving in exactly the wrong direction. They are bemused, for some reason, by the Swedish model and are seeking to amalgamate hundreds of unions into 20 very large ones. </PARA>
<PARA> This would not even remotely achieve a desirable objective. We would not have a single union in each workplace. What we would have is two or three very large ones remotely controlled by distant very large bureaucracies with no real interest in the success of a particular enterprise, except in so far as successful wage deals in that enterprise could be used as a means of passing those wage rises across the board in the name of comparative wage justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a system as this would be a disaster. It is of interest that the Swedish model that the ACTU seems so enamoured of is falling apart. Sweden has now introduced a two-year wage freeze, a two-year price freeze, and the Government would, if it could, have introduced a two-year strike ban. The Swedish system is disintegrating. The only miracle is that it, like the eastern European communist economies, lasted so long. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, one of the things the union movement does not seem to understand is the interaction of wages and interest rates. As I have said many times, we are living recklessly beyond our means and it is essential that we restrain consumer spending power until we can raise productivity so that we can afford to spend more. If we grant a nominal wage rise, not justified by increased productivity, the consequence is inflation which destroys the value of the wage rise. If, on the other hand, what is negotiated is a real wage rise, increasing effective spending power, the only weapon the Government has left itself is to raise interest rates to increase the cost of consumption and thus destroy the spending power that has just been granted by the wage mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: we are living beyond our means; we must hold down our standard of living until we can improve productivity. And after that, we can only justify wage rises which match improved productivity. Without that, we are stuck with disastrous interest rates forever, with all the damage they do to business investment and, through holding the Australian dollar too high, to our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Our inflation rate is predicted by the Treasurer to be 8.6 per cent this year, though, as he must be the worst economic forecaster in Australia's public history, we will take that forecast with a grain of salt-it will probably be worse. The important thing is that no-one can see how, under current settings, the inflation rate is going to go down below 6 per cent. The trouble is that we are building inflationary expectations into our system. Our real labour costs are lower and our profit share is higher than it has been for 20 years. The public sector is in balance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not going to do that. The United Kingdom is having very similar problems to us. Because of these inflationary expectations, we have a high rate of price increase, a high rate of nominal wage growth and high nominal interest rates. The results are, again, awful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The average Australian inflation rate during the 1950s and 1960s was 4 per cent; in the 1970s it was 9.4 per cent; and in the 1980s it was 8.7 per cent. In the 1950s and 1960s we were about in line with the average of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In the 1980s under the Hawke-Keating-Button Government our inflation rate has been about double the OECD average. The damage that high interest rates do is enormous: They make our economy less efficient because they distort effort and investment; they create winners and losers and the winners and losers are not always those who deserve it; they erode the attraction of saving; and they make us less internationally competitive unless we are prepared constantly to devalue our currency. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a government-any government-has a responsibility to ensure the stability of our currency. But it is not a thing that should be trusted to politicians. There is always the political incentive that a little bit more inflation will solve the short term employment situation and be damned to the long term economic implications. All political parties have fallen for this. The economies that are working well have taken the responsibility for stability of the currency out of the hands of politicians and given it to an independent reserve bank such as the Bundesbank. People pressing for inflationary price or wage rises would know that, if they were achieved, the immediate reaction of the Reserve Bank of Australia would be to raise interest rates to destroy the value of the inflationary wage and price rises and that would act as a very strong disincentive, and the only practical disincentive, for such rises being sought. </PARA>
<PARA> An independent reserve bank, committed to the stability of the currency, works in other countries. Our system, obviously, does not work. Why do we not try something better?</PARA>
<PARA> Two taxation matters which were not discussed seriously in the election were, firstly, the capital gains tax and, secondly, the desirability of a consumption tax. I believe the capital gains tax is not primarily for revenue gathering; rather, it is a means of achieving equity between taxpayers and also avoiding distortion of investment. Capital gains are often almost indistinguishable income and it is very irritating for honest taxpayers-income taxpayers-to see capital gainers getting away with it. When people think the tax system is manifestly unfair, tax avoidance becomes an industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I must confess that I was not happy with the speculative gains tax proposed by the Opposition during the election. It did not seem to me to deal adequately with the question of tax equity. Neither am I impressed with the Australian Labor Party's alternative because it creates very severe investment distortions. If we exclude the family home from the capital gains tax, as is done at present, it means that there is a very strong incentive to invest in that area at the expense of more creative investments. As a consequence, we have far too much of our capital stock invested in housing, at inflated prices. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not coincidental that people in Australia, which has vast areas of land but no capital gains tax on homes, pay twice as much for a comparable block of residential land as people do in space-cramped England. We must bring the family home into the capital gains tax system. This, though, is one of the areas which people regard, rightly, as a political minefield. Although it needs to be done, it will never be done unless both major parties agree it is essential. Even then, of course, there will be the chance of a populist party-the Australian Democrats have always shown themselves prepared to be populist-jumping on the band wagon against it. But I think the Democrats can always be relied upon to self-destruct in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The other tax area which was not mentioned in the election campaign, though it has come to the fore since, was the subject of consumption tax. To my mind, the whole debate has been an absurdity, capped off by a piece of monumental farce by the Treasurer last week. What we should be looking at is the balance of our tax collections between direct and indirect taxes and whether such a balance is the right one for our economy. Of course a consumption tax is regressive; it is almost more difficult to avoid than income tax. By international standards, we have a very high proportion of direct taxes which may be damaging our creativity and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems absurd, though, that we are talking about introducing a consumption tax when we raise $24 billion a year from indirect taxation, $18 billion of which is from consumption taxes. What we should be looking at is not whether or not we have a consumption tax-we already have several-but whether our present system of taxing consumption is the most efficient. Our present system of wholesale tax is an absurdity, based as it is on differential rates of 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent and now 50 per cent on different products. </PARA>
<PARA> What we should surely be looking at, without getting into the question of a balance between direct and indirect taxes, which is a different issue, is whether we should bring services into our consumption tax pool, why we do not have a single level of consumption tax so that the Government stops playing favourites and how to produce the most efficient and equitable tax collection. That is what we should be looking at. We should ignore the silly rantings of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the problems we have, as I mentioned earlier, is that the Democrats may seek populist openings if the major parties start tackling some of these problems. They certainly have never been loath to espouse populist causes. In fact, their economic philosophy, as far as it can be determined, is identical with that of the late General Peron of the Argentine. I hope the Democrats will have noticed that this economic philosophy has brought the Argentine from being the richest nation in the world to being an economic basket case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that General Peron always managed to work in a reference to the poor, whom he described as the `shirtless ones'. But, as the previous Democrat leader, ex-Senator Janine Haines, lost her shirt in the last election, perhaps the Democrats can now claim even that similarity to pure Peronism. </PARA>
<PARA> We have real problems with our productivity in the heavily unionised areas which is why it is so important that we reform our industrial relations structure. A recent study of the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd paper finishing plant found that at the time of study Australia was the least productive plant when compared with other plants in Canada, Britain and Brazil. The unit cost in Brazil was 30 per cent and in Britain 70 per cent of Australia's. The study listed the reasons for the low productivity in Australia as being low operating time, high unproductive paid time, union demarcations and poor work and management practices. I think one could say that this Kodak study was typical of much of Australia's manufacturing industry. We have had zero productivity growth in manufacturing industry in the last three years and have been below the OECD average since 1979. It must be remembered that we are improving from a base roughly half that of our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> We must get more investment and people are not going to invest unless they think their investment is going to be productive. We have a long way to go. To get back to my example of the car industry, where the Japanese productivity is double ours, about 25 to 35 per cent of production in overseas car plants is done by robots while in Australia it is 12 per cent or less. Why would someone invest hundreds of millions of dollars in robots in Australian factories when they are going to be used for only 36 hours a week? Only one car plant in Australia works more than a single shift. Surely, if some one is going to invest that amount of money for robots he would invest in a country where they would be used for 168 hours a week-in Taiwan or Korea, or Japan for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a long way to go if we are going to attract investment. Improved industrial relations and attitudes are a vital first step. Our political stability is to be admired but our transport and ports are additional worries for investors. Also, we cause great worries with our environmental campaign. We must create a climate where people spending millions working out a feasible industrial plan for investment in Australia are confident that the environmental rules will not be changed late in the game. It seems, it has been claimed, that we have lost $12,000m in investment because of our environmental uncertainty-Kakadu and Wesley Vale are examples-and these investments could have earned us $3 billion a year. Certainly we must have tough environmental standards but they must be fair and consistent and not manipulated for short term political purposes, as is the habit of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to discuss privatisation but everyone with experience in public administration knows that governments run businesses extremely inefficiently, have severe capital problems and are constantly pushed around by the demands of militant unions which know that businesses cannot go broke no matter how much they lose. We must get the Government out of as many businesses as poss- ible as quickly as we can. Just ponder one fact: during the recent air strike the passenger trains between Sydney and Melbourne were only half full. The reason was undoubtedly the cost. Railways do not pay for their track and do not pay any taxes and should be the most economical way of moving people between major centres. Yet to take a comfortable bus from Canberra to Melbourne costs $45. It costs twice as much to travel by train. The bus company has to run at a profit; the railways make substantial losses, which conjures up mind boggling thoughts of the amount of featherbedding and sheer idleness in the government run railways. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating, like most partly educated amateurs in a technical field, is constantly clutching at gimmicks. Remember the J-curve, which was going to solve our balance of payments difficulties? We do not hear much of that now. Then there was deterioration of our terms of trade, which was causing all our problems. In the last couple of years the terms of trade have improved sharply, but we do not hear anything about that now, though on the previous reasoning of Mr Keating that should have reversed the problems of five or so years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Now he has another gimmick: the balance of payments deficit is represented by investment in plant and equipment which is going to earn us export income in the near future. Quite apart from the fact that, as usual, he has got his statistics wrong and quite a lot of the investment is going to non-export producing buildings and so on, there is no way the amount going to plant and equipment will even remotely pay the interest bill on the monthly balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be admitted that Mr Keating was extremely bold in deregulating the finance markets, floating our dollar and so on, but he failed to deregulate a key area of our economy-the labour market. I think a good case can be made that if one is not prepared to deregulate the labour market, the other reforms are probably, on balance, harmful and it would have been better if they had not been made. I am not against deregulation. But it must be complete deregulation; it must not leave out a key part. </PARA>
<PARA> I have painted a gloomy picture because I am gloomy about our short term economic future under this disintegrating and, to use Senator Walsh's words, spineless Government. We must not lose sight of the fact that, as a country, Australia has enormous assets. We are the only country with a continent to ourselves. We have tremendous natural assets, we have no significant external threat, we have a homogenous and a reasonably well educated population, and we have a generally non-corrupt legal and public service system, which is extremely rare around the world. These are immense assets, but to make full use of them we must face up to our problems and solve them. I have listed the ones that occur to me and, if we can deal with all or most of them, we will again deserve to be called `the lucky country'. But it will not be done by luck; it will be done by courage and effort. </PARA>

<PARA>SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, and nine others I will introduce shortly, will amend the sales tax law to give effect to the announcement in the February 1990 Economic Statement of an increase in the rate of sales tax payable on ``luxury'' motor cars and station wagons (including four-wheel drive vehicles). </PARA>
<PARA> Where the wholesale price for sales tax purposes of such vehicles exceeds $28,793, sales tax will be levied at the new rate of 50%. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of $28,793 is the tax-exclusive wholesale price, on which sales tax is calculated, equivalent to a $42,910 retail price. </PARA>
<PARA> This latter amount is the present upper cost limit on which depreciation is allowable on motor cars and station wagons for income tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The wholesale price above which cars are taxed as ``luxury'' vehicles will alter each 1 July in line with the indexation adjustment to the income tax depreciation limit. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase to 50% in the rate of sales tax on ``luxury'' vehicles will produce a net revenue gain of $105 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also ensure that motor vehicles specially fitted out for transporting disabled persons while seated in wheelchairs are only subject to tax at the general rate of 20%, not the higher 30% and 50% rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue of this amendment will be less than $3 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX (NOS. 1-9) AMENDMENT BILLS 1990</PARA>
<PARA> These Bills declare a new sales tax rate of 50% for goods covered by the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> That Schedule is being added by another Bill in this package to which I referred earlier-the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The goods covered by the Schedule are motor cars and station wagons (including four-wheel drive vehicles) with a wholesale price for sales tax purposes above $28,793. </PARA>
<PARA> A more detailed explanation of the provisions of these Bills is also contained in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies this package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA> Both Labor and coalition governments have in the past supported the protection and wise use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and I hope that this bipartisan support will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been 15 years since the passage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the creation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Over that time practical experience gained from managing the marine park has highlighted areas where the operation of the Act could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to improve the operation of the Act by defining certain terms used in the statutory marine park zoning plans. This will overcome a problem highlighted in a recent case. It was found that the terms used until now permitted commercial operations even though the intention had been that they should be controlled. The Government is committed to ensuring that the short term commercial interests of some individuals do not harm this precious resource to the detriment of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Zoning plans are used to manage the resources of the marine park. By regulating the type of activities permitted within the park the reef is protected from undesirable exploitation but remains accessible to the public for their enjoyment and appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the uncertainties raised by the recent case are common to all of the existing zoning plans it is important to incorporate clear definitions of the terms into the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also ensures that where there is some doubt whether an activity requires permission under a zoning plan, there is a presumption that permission is required. There is no intention to change the operation of zoning plans which have themselves been passed by the Parliament. Indeed the purpose of the Bill is to clarify the original intention of the Parliament that the Great Barrier Reef is to be managed for all Australians and that in the interests of conservation and wise use, some activities must be regulated or even forbidden. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion the Bill represents the Government's resolve to improve the management and protection of one of the world's greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Reid) adjourned. </PARA>

Thirdly, is it a fact that in the last year for which the Minister had responsibility for the IAC that body completed 11 references? Fourthly, is it a fact that last year under the stewardship of Mr Keating the IAC was able to complete only four references and during that period the actual number of references to the IAC was cut by half?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjection is that it took 10 months for the first reference to go. I must say I did answer a question similar to that just asked on 23 May 1988. Senator Lewis asked me a question then on this issue. On that occasion he asked me about an inquiry into non-tax government charges and so on. There was a period of delay at that time. That was because the Government was considering the nature of economy-wide references and there was, as Senator Lewis pointed out today, some delay at that time. I think there were reasons for it. If Senator Lewis looks at my answer of 23 May he may find that it encompasses those reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that in the last year when I was portfolio Minister for the IAC, 11 references were dealt with by that body but they were industry-specific references. Throughout the period in which the IAC was under my administration it had a lot of references and it dealt with them.</PARA>
<PARA> I would further make the point, in case it has been overlooked by anybody in the current debate, that this Government, from the time it came to office until 1987 when there was a proposed change of role for the IAC, adopted the recommendations of every report that we received from the IAC on industry-specific matters, except for two. I refer first to the chemical and plastics industry, where we took a harder line on tariff reduction than the IAC had recommended; that was done on my recommendations to the Government. The other exception was the textile, clothing and footwear industry, where the IAC gave us three options to consider. Sadly, in the course of discussing the future of that industry those three options became the focal points of debate; but we did not adopt the IAC's preferred option in respect of the textile, clothing and footwear industry. I am not sure whether it is true to say, as was said in the fourth part of the question, that last year there were only four references completed by the IAC. But I am pretty sure of one thing: they would be much larger references than the industry-specific references which used to be sent to the IAC in the old days.</PARA>
<PARA> The question asked whether the Minister and the Government were satisfied with the number of references currently being dealt with by the IAC. My answer to that question is absolutely yes. The IAC has a two-year forward work program, which was announced in the last Budget. It includes a number of very important economy-wide issues, such as export franchising and distribution arrangements; the mining and minerals processing industry; the commercial tariff concession system; energy generation and distribution; railways and so on. I table the list of current references to the IAC, which is a very comprehensive work program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There cannot be many more important environmental issues in Australia than that of coastal management. Clearly as a nation we have not managed our coastal waters all that well, especially in the last few decades where we have seen increased pressure on our fishing grounds, and where pollution both from industrial sources and sewage is causing so many problems. That is why the Government took the decision to try to get some coordination into coastal zone management. Obviously, with six States having primary jurisdiction over our coastlines, there have been too many different rules and it has been very difficult for industry, be it tourism or those who discharge effluent, to know what the future holds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have tried a cooperative approach by attempting to get a working group to look at these issues. On 14 February this year we advertised in the national press and in coastal regional newspapers seeking public comment on the task, on the mode of operation and, indeed, membership of the working group itself. I am informed that the public response has been pretty substantial. State governments have responded directly, as has local government, some industry leaders and individuals, as well as environmental groups.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is currently analysing those responses, and the responses include suggestions as to who should actually be on the group. Given the fact that the working group is supposed to have completed its task by July 1991, I would think that in the next month or two the Minister will make the final announcement on its mode of operation and membership. I hope that we can all make sure that the report is completed on time because there is a sense of urgency about getting some rational solutions to the problems of coastal management in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is it correct that the motor vehicle industry currently has an effective rate of protection of 104 per cent and that by the end of the current plan in 1992 it will still be 86 per cent? Is it correct that the current levels of protection amount to $4,000 per vehicle for the average consumer?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all let me say that there is considerable debate about the calculations of effective rates of assistance. There is disagreement among various bodies in relation to effective rates of assistance. However, those rates are high for the motor vehicle industry, there is no doubt about that. In terms of the second part of the question, which relates more to the cost to the consumer, the effective rates of assistance are not a measure which is in any sense useful in determining that cost to the consumer. Effective rates of assistance are essentially used to determine the relative allocation of resources between various industries. For example, in the Opposition's period in government, when tariff rates generally were very high, effective rates of assistance were much more important in determining the distribution of resources between industries than they are now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effective rates of assistance in the motor vehicle industry probably arise basically from differential component costs with other countries and also as a result of the export facilitation program, which is part of the motor vehicle plan and which helps to raise those effective rates of assistance. Those matters will be examined in the course of the Industry Commission's inquiry which is about to take place.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second part of the question, those figures are bandied about a lot. I would not be able to comment on their accuracy. Essentially the consumer is concerned about the price of cars, and the price of cars manufactured in Australia varies of course from one model to another. One assessment has been done by the Automotive Industry Authority in relation to the Toyota Camry which shows that the price of that car is only marginally different from its price in the United States of America, for example. Some of the figures used in determining this issue of what any industry costs this country are a little out of date.</PARA>

As far as the $4,000 per vehicle is concerned, did I understand the Minister to say that he had no idea when he said that he really could not comment on the accuracy of that figure?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="463" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have received a report from Comcare on its first year of performance. I can report that Comcare premiums for 1990-91 are now expected to fall by 25 per cent. The premiums paid for the 194 government agencies covered by Comcare will fall in money terms from $215m in 1989-90 to an expected $174m in 1990-91. This represents a significant reduction of 19 per cent in nominal terms or 25 per cent in real terms for average premium rates. Premiums paid by agencies can be expected to fall from 2.6c to 2c for each wage or salary dollar. It will make Comcare premiums the lowest in Australia for a scheme as comprehensive as this. Although the Queensland scheme, it should be pointed out, is lower, it is certainly by no means as comprehensive as Comcare is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This significant reduction illustrates the effectiveness of Comcare, especially when it is considered that the current scheme, which began only in December 1988, was not expected to break even for its first five years of operation because of the high benefit levels. The primary reason for the reduction is Comcare's success in reducing the incidence and duration of workplace injuries. That has meant that Comcare has developed an integrated approach to rehabilitation. Case managers are located in workplaces where they are able to liaise with management, unions and employees. That has enabled a more personalised care program and a better implementation of the procedures instigated by Comcare. This is a laudable outcome and one that establishes the efficacy of the Government's actions in making the reforms to Comcare that it did last year.</PARA>

<PARA>That has resulted in some discussions between my Department and the Commonwealth Employment Service . . . whose job it is to make those assessments, and we will ensure that those problems do not occur in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Firstly, does the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) have information available to it which enables its officers to adequately determine the employment prospects of an individual in any particular place of residence? Secondly, can the Minister assure the Senate that the Department of Social Security accepts the responsibility of showing that an individual's employment prospects have been reduced and that the onus is not upon the recipient to prove that this is not the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to part 1 of Senator Powell's question, obviously I am not the Minister responsible for the Commonwealth Employment Service. Nonetheless, we have to work very closely with it. I am satisfied that the Commonwealth Employment Service collects adequate data on the prospects of employment in any individual profession or trade as well as taking an overall view of each region. I do not think there would be any way to improve those statistics. They are very regularly updated and I think the CES is pretty thorough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem I referred to the other day occurred because the CES was not taking the extra step of looking at the individual's employment prospects; it was simply relying on the regional profile of an area. We have had our discussions with the Commonwealth Employment Service and been assured that the individual's prospects of employment will be assessed as well. We are now getting that kind of information as these cases arise, and that is why I said that I did not expect that we would have too many of those problems in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> So in answer to the second point: it is absolutely the case that we must in some way make an assessment of the individual's prospects and not put the onus on the individual. As we get more and more of these cases arising, I think we will find that most individuals will know before they have moved whether or not their benefit is going to be affected.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the communications difficulty with the Department is to try to make sure that those contemplating a move understand that there is in place a new regulation which can affect their entitlements, and to do that we are attempting to make sure that, with some of our notices going out generally to those on unemployment benefits in particular, they are made aware that this provision exists. I think awareness of it is rising rapidly, but we always have communications difficulties in the first instance with problems of this kind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, my Department with the Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia, I think representing the ACTU, met Hengyang in Darwin at 7.30 a.m. Darwin time today. Hengyang is a Hong Kong company set up in the Darwin Trade Development Zone and appears there in the guise of Hengyang Holdings and Hengyang Darwin. There is another company, Darwin International Textiles Pty Ltd. Between the three of them they employee 92 foreign workers recruited from the People's Republic of China. The two Hengyang companies are in the business of manufacturing jeans for the United States market and, in the case of Darwin International, producing knitwear for Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the Business Review Weekly last Friday printed an expose of the scandal of the Trade Development Zone in Darwin revealing allegations of award breaches, breaches of contract, underpayments, bad working conditions, the breakdown in the normal courtesies that we would expect in the work force, human rights breaches, and inhumane living conditions. On Friday I indicated, along with other Government Ministers, that I shared the concerns that have been brought to attention by that article and condemn the Northern Territory Government for not exercising its monitoring responsibilities to see whether the undertakings that were given were carried out properly. However, today I can report that a substantial claim will be lodged against Hengyang Holdings for underpayment of wages-the actual quantum of money is being more properly compiled at the moment-and that through the Department of Industrial Relations we are investigating what the underpayment may be for Darwin International, which employs some 22 foreign workers in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA> This morning Hengyang Darwin acknowledged its liability to pay $574,000 as underpayment of wages for 27 foreign workers from December 1988 to February 1990. The final decimal points are to be settled. I am pleased that the company has admitted its liability. I hope that with speed and expedition we will be able to clear up the problems that might be associated with Hengyang Holdings and any liability that arises from our investigations of Darwin International. Hengyang Darwin wishes to repay those workers over a 12-month period at a rate of one-third now, one-third soon, and one-third at the end of the 12-month period. The negotiations are stalled at that point. We are seeking immediate repayment.</PARA>
<PARA> The trade development zone concept is a good concept in our view, but it is a pity that it has been brought into disrepute by the Northern Territory Government not properly honouring its obligations to see that what occurs within the Trade Development Zone is proper, that companies working there honour their agreements, and that there is not the sense of scandal that associates itself with these companies. If the concept is to succeed this sort of thing has to be cleared up quickly; otherwise a cowboy image will linger.</PARA>
<PARA> I have just been handed a press release from Hengyang Darwin which I think is quite extraordinary. It explains the admission of underpayment but makes the point, inter alia, that it was not aware that, being in Australia, they needed to pay Australian rates of pay; they thought they could pay Chinese rates of pay. Now that has been drawn to their attention they say they will clear it up. I think that is a extraordinary admission.</PARA>

There has to be a very careful balance between the interests of the community in unravelling these matters and the proper rules of evidence and objectives of the three types of inquiry which can be held into this matter, namely, the coronial inquiry, the NCA type of inquiry or the royal commission type of inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones was kind enough to give me notice of this question. I might be good at recycling a few good things but I am not good at recycling phone books. I needed the notice. It is true that Telecom has recently signed a contract for a two-year trial period with Cellulose Industries Pty Ltd, a Melbourne based company, to recycle old telephone books into building insulation. The conversion process, which was developed by the company, involves shredding old books and then treating the shredded material with a fire retardant. This product is environmentally friendly and poses less of a health risk to installers and handlers of asbestos or fibreglass. The honourable senator asks about items other than phone books. By the time this industry really gets going I would hope that we would not have phone books in Australia but that we would follow the example of the French and have computer terminals which replace phone books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the question relates to waste paper and magazines for use in cellulose insulating material. Again, that industry supplies about 10 to 15 per cent of the Australian insulation market and uses a fraction, roughly 930,000 tonnes, of waste paper which is recycled by Australian industry today. That industry is developing.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the honourable senator asked me to advise whether the Government had any plans to collect other materials for recycling. A considerable quantity of waste paper and cardboard is already being collected from public service establishments for recycling. That contribution by the Government is only part of an Australia-wide trend towards recycling. Industry is accepting the challenge and using waste materials for recycling. I had a meeting with the plastics industry yesterday, which is concerned to develop recycling in that industry. I am sure that it is true of other materials such as glass, metals, textiles and oils which in the past have been discarded and not used.</PARA>

The answer to Senator Lees's question is yes, I do support the lowering of the blood alcohol limit to 0.05, as of course does the responsible Minister, Mr Brown. I would like to correct one misapprehension that has been bruited about, that the acceptance or rejection of the 10-point package will affect the Commonwealth road funding generally in respect of States. That is not the case. In fact, the Commonwealth has deliberately offered a substantial incentive package of additional road funding in exchange for an agreement for moves to be made by the States in agreement with the Commonwealth to attack two clearly recognisable and definable areas that cause massive loss of life and injury, and, in purely financial terms, great loss to the public purse. I refer to speed and booze.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a personal view, which I am sure is shared by a great many senators, that people who drink should not drive at all. In terms of the individual tragedy, distress and damage that they can cause. I think that motor vehicle drivers should be placed under the same restrictions as airline pilots and should not be allowed to drive with any level of alcohol in their blood. That is my own personal position. But in order to advance some lesson in the carnage that is being wrought on roads around Australia, the Commonwealth has directed an incentive package in exchange for agreement to reduce the level to 0.05.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of States, and certainly my own Territory Government, which are not prepared at this stage to agree to that. The question of the 10-point package is very specific. It is being offered as a package and it can be either accepted or rejected on that basis. If there is no agreement on 0.05, the black spots package, as it has become known, will not be provided to the governments concerned, and I think that that is appropriate.</PARA>

My job and that of the Defence Department is to make sure that we are able to meet either low level contingency threats or future high level contingency threats. That means that we have to build a basic platform in defence so that if in future there is a high level contingency threat we can expand that platform. In my view it is essential that that platform is adequate. But that is not strictly related to whether defence spending should be 2.3 per cent, 2.6 per cent or 2.8 per cent of GDP; that really has nothing to do with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind Senator Vallentine that on 12 March the Prime Minister said simply that the United States had agreed to discuss an Australian proposal to take over and operate the naval communications facilities and the Australian Defence Force facility, rather than keep them running as a joint facility. Under our proposal, Australia would manage the station and facilitate the passage of US Navy signals to US submarines. The primary function of the station is to communicate with submerged submarines. It provides the only means of communicating with our submarines and we use that capability extensively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> North West Cape will become even more important to Australia over the next 10 years as our new submarines join the Royal Australian Navy. They will make the submarine squadron an even more critical element of Australia's defence and our defence self-reliance. The operation of North West Cape as an Australian defence facility will therefore further enhance our drive for self-reliance. It shows that Australia itself is willing to take responsibility for ensuring that the essential element of a submarine capability is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot state the costs definitely because they will depend on a number of factors, including the outcome of negotiations with the United States and changes to the station which should cut operating costs. As a guide, and contrary to the speculation of the anonymous analysts in Washington referred to in the question, the station's operating costs now run at $30m a year. About 80 per cent of that is spent on a staff of over 700. New technologies offer scope to reduce the staffing levels considerably. I add only that, as well as enhancing Australia's defence self-reliance, this forward-looking proposal will also make a new and constructive contribution to our alliance with the United States and support our shared interests in the stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an urgent need for action to be taken on the part of the Government to remedy some glaring deficiencies in the Australian taxation system. These problems are particularly significant with the introduction of partial self-assessment for individuals, and as from 1 July 1990 full self-assessment for companies and superannuation funds. The nine million taxpayers-I repeat nine million-in Australia are nowadays at the mercy of officers of the Australian Taxation Office. The Government, in its haste to introduce self-assessment, has principally addressed those issues that create the framework to satisfy Australian Taxation Office procedures and to increase the revenue. But in the process taxpayers' rights have been ignored. We therefore call on the Government at the earliest practicable opportunity to implement the recommendations of the McKinsey report to reduce the costs of uncertainty, complexity and distrust at present amongst Australian company and individual taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The move towards self-assessment has created uncertainty. Self-assessment demands certainty. Yet this certainty of the legislation has been eroded by a shift of the responsibility for the assessment from the Australian Taxation Office to the individual. As a result, the rights of Australian taxpayers have been ignored, sacrificed and, I believe, plundered by this Government with the introduction of self-assessment because there is no longer a balance between the safeguards for taxpayers on the one hand and administrative convenience on the other. The responsibilities that the new system imposed by self-assessment on individual and corporate taxpayers are now quite enormous. Urgent action is needed in the areas of disclosures, commissioners' rulings, penalties, amendments and objections. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers have to battle with a tax ruling system and a tax Act that is ponderous and riddled with gaps and inconsistencies. The need for a simplified system is urgent. This lack of balance occurs directly from the way in which this new system was grafted by the Government onto the existing legislative framework designed to permit self-assessment. The only significant changes that have occurred were technical in nature and aimed at improving the efficiency and lowering the paper load of the Australian Taxation Office. Today, in this democratic society, as a result of this hasty drafting and introduction of legislation, more power is given to a duly authorised officer of the Australian Taxation Office than is granted to a police officer in the prosecution of a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that there are calls from taxpayers far and wide for a Bill of Rights for taxpayers. A police officer's powers, for example, of search and seizure under the Crimes Act are clearly stated. A search warrant is issued only when a justice of the peace is satisfied of certain specific matters and that its scope will be limited to a particular place. While there might be certain justification for the Australian Taxation Office's much publicised raid on Citibank, the methods used highlight the problem. In fact, some on the other side of the chamber might seek to criticise my choice of this case, but the responses of the judges involved in relation to sections 263 and 264 of the Crimes Act deserve comment, for the judiciary were indeed very concerned at the application of these particular provisions. In addition, the methods used highlight the problems of overzealous activity: thirty-seven officers from the Australian Taxation Office, including a locksmith, arrived unannounced at the Citibank's premises for the purpose of making and removing copies of documents in relation to an alleged form of tax avoidance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> While some of the documents inspected related to the scheme, most of them related to other taxation matters. The Australian Taxation Office, under section 263 of the Act, has the right of full and free access at all times to all buildings, places, books, documents and other papers for the purposes of the Act. This power extends to any appropriately duly authorised officer. Yet the problem is that there is no outside check on whom they contact or where they enter, as with a police officer. In fact, Justice French, commenting on sections 263 and 264 of the Act, stated that the Commissioner and his officers are armed with powerful investigative instruments, and he said that the very width of those powers demands a watchful concern that their limits are not exceeded. Further, Justice Bowen and Justice Fisher felt obliged to make the following observation:</PARA>
<PARA> We consider that it is unfortunate that . . . a degree of specificity was not a mandatory obligation. </PARA>
<PARA>So an officer of the Australian Taxation Office does not need a search warrant. He does not even need to inform under oath a justice of the peace of his specific intentions. In fact, he does not even have to hand the taxpayer a list of the taxpayer's rights or obligations. I would have thought that would have been the first and fundamental thing that he should have done. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a case in Victoria where a man from the Australian Taxation Office walked into a small business and asked for the books and records. There was not a lot of room in which to work. He took the filing cabinet, and that man-a small businessman-was out of business for several weeks before the documents were returned. Not one extra cent of tax was paid; no writ, no summons, was issued. The official produced only his card and said that he wanted the documents. The taxpayer, unaware of his rights, handed them over obligingly, and, of course, his stubs and all these sorts of things-the cheque books, paying-in books-went with them. Had he realised his rights, had he gone to one of the big eight, he would have been told of his rights and what he could keep, et cetera. But we should not have to go to those lengths. We are told that the Taxation Office is supposed to be helpful. What sort of help is given by putting a man out of business for a number of weeks?</PARA>
<PARA> These calls for taxpayers' rights and protection come not from the blatant tax avoiders, for whom we have absolutely no sympathy-I ask honourable senators to take note of that-but from the judges, former members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the former Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Victoria, the Taxation Institute of Australia, other taxpayer bodies and the public, John Citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> These people who have seen or suffered first-hand from some overly zealous action often do not have an axe to grind. They believe in justice, fair play and, in modern parlance, a balanced playing field. I have in my possession information relating to a small milk bar proprietor, who inadvertently forget to return some unused group certificates, duplicate copies of used certificates and, naturally, the annual reconciliation of those documents. It was an honest clerical oversight. The papers were filed in the drawer instead of being forwarded. There was no loss of revenue and scarcely any effect on the efficiency of the taxation administration at all, but what happened? There were no reminders or friendly telephone calls but, rather, a summons, a prosecution and a fine-a prosecution not on one count; the prosecution was for three offences. What did the magistrate do? Fines and penalties of over $800 were imposed through the civil court system. </PARA>
<PARA> This system does not concur with this notion of voluntary compliance-the proper attitude required from the Taxation Office-because `voluntary' implies a willingness on the part of the taxpayer. To misuse the court process rather than use the telephone is a non-achievement of a voluntary compliance-a level of coercion reminiscent of the failed bureaucracies of Eastern Europe. A common advertisement to the community from the Tax Office states: `Your taxes building a better Australia' but, without proper recognition of taxpayers' rights, the community response will soon become: `Your taxes building a bitter Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peter Roach, a former member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, claims that taxpayers may not have adequate protection from harassment by the Australian Taxation Office and he ought to know; it is his day-to-day bread and butter. He says that officers can extend or change the audit at their discretion, especially where they perceive a lack of cooperation or even indifference on the part of the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The business community also is deeply worried about the real scope and the practical exercise of the Commissioner's and his officers' powers of access under the Act. It appears, particularly from the corporate section of Australian taxpayers, that the officers do not always act without prejudice, or without fear or favour. In fact, the business community is beginning to fear that a genuine anti-business feeling is being shown. There has been an enormous shift of resources in auditing the top 100 companies with success, they state, being widely publicised in the press. But the publication of the companies' names implies that they are tax cheats, yet the records actually show that, in percentage terms, corporate Australia is a no greater tax avoider than the rest of the Australian tax paying community. This auditing is combined with frequently publicised newspaper comments from officers of the Tax Office who are engaged in these audits. I mention just one or two to indicate the sort of publicity they are seeking and I quote from one of them:</PARA>
<PARA> When you come to the swamp and you're armpit deep in the slime, it's easy to forget your job is to drain the swamp. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the sort of comments coming from audit officers within the Australian Taxation Office that are grabbing headlines in newspapers. I might say in the Commissioner's defence that he has publicly resiled from these attitudes expressed by some of his officers. He has adopted a much more even-handed approach in the papers he has delivered to various professional organisations. However, the point is that these sentiments must permeate down through the ranks to the audit staff and to the people on the job. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that some of these previous examples that I have given to the Senate today about the abuse of taxpayers' rights and the future practices that these examples appear to condone do not concur with the stated objectives of the Taxation Office. I instance-and I have to be even-handed because I have a lot of respect for Mr Boucher and what he is doing-his address to the tax liaison group. The Commissioner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tax Office aims to become an organisation of people equipped, trained and committed to helping taxpayers and other clients carry out their responsibilities under the law. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a great statement which I think is wholly endorsed. He later went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Our key business is to help taxpayers and other clients do what is expected of them under the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> The key word in both these addresses is `help'. Does the Australian Tax Office encourage voluntary compliance by making examples of people who have made honest mistakes? In the same speech he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The corner-stone of the whole edifice of the ATO-</PARA>
<PARA>that is under self-assessment-</PARA>
<PARA>is voluntary compliance, with service as the key element in achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA>Would not some recognition of the taxpayer and of his rights help in this? Should not the individual be given some protection under the law? Australian taxation officers will then not be encouraged to be what I term overzealous. Then we would have-this was implied-a true spirit of voluntary compliance which should always be encouraged under self-assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> If we examine what is happening with other countries which have gone down the path of self-assessment, we can then compare their performance with ours in Australia. In fact, if we look at five countries, as the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Taxation Institute of Australia did, and compare access powers of revenue authorities, without exception we find that the policy position differed significantly from the current practice of self-assessment in Australia. Australia is the only country in which the revenue authorities have unrestricted access. Accordingly it is felt by many taxpayers that protection must be based on some other criterion that presently exists under the Act. It is recommended that this be developed by having regard to the basis on which a taxpayer's return has been compiled. This is important, given the fact that we have moved away from section 170. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that if a taxpayer has adopted a reasonably arguable position for a particular item-that is, he has adopted his position in preparing his return based on rulings precedented, and internal and external tax advice-then there should not be any basis for a culpability penalty. That should be fair; that should be basic. But we have not got that. This will require a clear definition to be enshrined in the law. It is too fundamental to be dealt with through just the ruling process. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers have 60 days in which to object to an assessment, while the Australian Taxation Office now requires records to be kept for four years after lodgment and it can require an audit in any one of those years-even earlier. The taxpayers have no enforceable rights after the 60-day time limit for the objection. It is considered by many dealing in this area that taxpayers should now have corresponding rights after the 60-day limit for objection. Equal rights would give the taxpayer four years in which to raise an objection. If we have it on one side, we should have it on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of many that where a taxpayer adopts a reasonably argued position in relation to an item in a return, it should not be necessary for him to disclose this fact in his return. This is the position in the United States. It will be reasonably difficult for corporate taxpayers since in the future under self-assessment they will perhaps have no more than a one-page return, and there is a limit to what can be put on that page. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that if the taxpayer's position proves to be wrong in the eyes of the Taxation Office, he should not be penalised for the interest on the penalty; he should be penalised only by the penalty. It would be necessary to keep proper documentation of the contentious issues. If full disclosure was required on these one-page returns, it would effectively be a de facto return to the old system. In addition, in the area of the question of interest, we have a number of problems. Because the payment and receipt of interest are not even, there is a difference between what is paid by the Taxation Office in certain cases of overpayment arising from an objection or appeal. In one case it is assessable; in the other it is non-deductable. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me finish on a very positive note. I have lots of other examples to give but I want to be constructive in this debate, to try to help the Government, which I hope will help the taxpayers. Firstly, I think we should be looking at moving towards a bill of rights, whether enshrined in legislation or, as a minimum, certainly in some regulatory form. As I mentioned, there is no obligation on the Tax Commissioner to notify a taxpayer or give a notification of a taxpayer's rights on audit. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, communications of advice between all registered tax agents and their clients should be confidential from the Commissioner's standpoint. The taxpayers have a right to know of the Commissioner's view on the interpretation of tax laws, especially where contentious issues are involved. An overhaul of the self-assessment system has a number of glaring deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we should make the Commissioner's administrative rulings binding on him. There should be binding commitments between the Taxation Office and the Tax Commissioner in relation to audit negotiations. The making of the tax penalties, especially culpability penalties, should be made much fairer. There is a need for a simplification of the taxation system. I am glad to say that the Government is making some tentative moves in this area, but it is a big job. In relation to self-assessment there is a need for a concept to replace the old full and true disclosure requirement, having regard to the basis on which the tax return has been prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the integrity and the privacy of a man's home and his place of business needs to be respected. Higher regard for the taxpayer by the Australian Taxation Office needs to be encouraged because the taxpayer needs to be able to approach the Tax Office with trust, without fear of prejudice, without fear of excessive high penalties. But the legislation as it now stands is bad law; it needs to be rectified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this matter of public importance was first drawn to my attention the wording seemed to be positively delphic. It took some consultation with a large number of colleagues and others to be quite sure of the nub of this particular argument. Let me address some of the points that seem to me to be raised by the letter, even if they were not all mentioned in Senator Watson's speech. The first is the reference to respecting the integrity of Australians as taxpayers. I assume that by that honourable senator is saying, although he did not actually refer to it, that we should assume that most Australians are honest and deal with the tax system accordingly. Although the honourable senator did not say anything about it I do not have any difficulty with that point. The whole concept of self-assessment and voluntary compliance is based on it, and I think it is a valid point. I am not sure that it takes us very far as a basis of planning but it is correct and I do not argue with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we get on to the nub of the argument, the question essentially of the balance between protection of rights and protection of revenue. It is very important that we look at that balance, that we talk about striking that balance, but nobody would argue with that. There has to be a balance; it is almost a question of definition. The questions are: Where do you strike it and how do you maintain that proper balance? In practical terms this Government has massively redressed the imbalance that had been created. When we came into office, of course, there was an imbalance entirely in favour of people who did not want to pay their tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We now find that a lot of people are paying tax who never thought they should have to pay tax, who thought that the right to be protected was their right not to pay tax, and they are now substantially concerned about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I never noticed any expressions of serious concern about the rights of ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayers who in those days had to pay much more tax than was their proper responsibility because so many people who should have been paying tax were paying nothing. There was great concern about the possibility of voluntary compliance because so many ordinary Australian men and women resented the fact that they were the only ones paying tax: if you were not paying pay-as-you-earn tax you were paying nothing. There is no doubt that that door was wide open. A lot of honest taxpayers were paying their tax and a lot of dishonest people were rorting the system. The key to the change has been the introduction of the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with some of the things that Senator Watson said. I thought that there were some positive elements in his contribution, and I welcome them. There is no doubt that a cooperative relationship between the Taxation Office and taxpayers on the question of voluntary compliance is the necessary key to the tax system because, firstly, most Australians are honest and pay their tax as they believe they are obliged to do-some do not and certainly in the decade leading up to 1983 all too many did not; but there is no doubt that even then most Australians were honest and they remain so-and, secondly, voluntary compliance is vital because there is no alternative. We cannot have a system of large-scale collection of tax without substantial voluntary compliance from the overwhelming majority of honest taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Voluntary compliance-the enthusiasm and preparedness of ordinary Australians to meet their obligations-is significantly undermined when they do not have respect for the integrity of the system under which they are paying. That respect comes from and requires an acceptance that all are paying their fair share of tax, and certainly that has been substantially enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the things that have been done to enhance that respect are part of what has generated the concern to which Senator Watson was referring-for example, the increasing emphasis upon and publicity about audits of the top companies. I make no apology for the increasing emphasis on that. It is an entirely proper use of Taxation Office resources. It is entirely efficient. There should not be publicity about individual taxpayers but about the fact that that process is going on and that it is successful, is entirely proper and appropriate and is welcomed by the overwhelming majority of Australians, and by me. </PARA>
<PARA> In a system of voluntary compliance there are those-I am sure that Senator Watson and all people of good will would agree with me-who have to be made to comply voluntarily and those who require significant encouragement to comply voluntarily. It is important that we continue to have a significant aspect of our tax system putting pressure on those people to so comply. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the administration of the Taxation Office, the tax system, the Australian Commissioner of Taxation and the fact that sometimes the Commissioner and his officers do take controversial decisions in the pursuit of revenue. I refer to a Senate committee decision of 1987. Dealing with the ruling system it said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner is entitled to test the law where he regards it as in doubt, where the Commissioner considers it desirable in order to protect the revenue. Arguably, the Commissioner has a duty so to do. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true, but not that he has to. His obligation to Australian taxpayers is to take decisions to protect the revenue and the Senate committee was absolutely right to find that. However, his administration is not unfettered. His discretions are not and cannot be unfettered because he acts within the body of Australian administrative law-the legal system as a whole and the administrative law framework in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a very well developed legal system and now, due to the legislation of the previous government and this one, a well-developed body of administrative review of administrative actions and a comprehensive system of administrative reforms to assist people in dealing with the Government. All these are appropriate, including the role of the Ombudsman and review available under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and the Freedom of Information Act, et cetera. We have to see that that context within which the administrative initiatives of the Commissioner for Taxation take place are significant protections for the rights of Australians. They are proper protections and significant protections against abuse of power. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition we have had by the Tax Office and the Taxation Commissioner the preparedness to accept the need for powers to be exercised carefully and professionally and, more importantly for the purposes of this discussion, within administrative guidelines. We must set parameters to the circumstances and the manner in which various powers will be exercised. These guidelines are being developed and settled in consultation with tax practitioners, businesses and others. There are guidelines about the conduct of large case audits and about the exercise of access powers. There are guidelines setting out how tax officers should deal with taxpayers, about the provision of assistance and advice, about problem resolution and there are guidelines being developed about the conduct of smaller business audits and settlement guidelines. Senator Baume may not have worked it out but they are not a very well kept secret. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other good things that is happening in the Tax Office is the consultative process. There are representatives of the Business Council of Australia, the various business groups and other welfare and community groups represented on the Commissioner's advisory panel who know how these guidelines are developing and who are properly aware of the processes developing in the administration of the Australian tax system. They do take place. That is relevant within the question of judicial review because as many honourable senators would know there is a substantial precedent to establish the fact that failure to comply with such guidelines can well be taken into account in judicial review of administrative action. This is properly so and the precedent exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this question of the high profile audit has generated some concern because very many people with significant power in our community and with access to the media have been adversely affected and have been expressing very forthright views about the conduct of these audits. There are enormous amounts of revenue involved. It is substantial and proper for any business-like organisation that is applying its resources to take account of the revenue return on the resources it applies as one of the factors it takes into account in determining the distribution and application of its resources. Audits are not merely taking place amongst the largest companies. Small businesses are being audited and individual taxpayers are being audited. Everybody knows, and I assume accepts, because it is so obvious that a necessary corollary of self-assessment is audit. This is properly so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the slightest bit surprising that a substantial proportion of the resources being applied to audit of taxpayers is being applied to the biggest taxpayers not because they are necessarily considered less honest than others nor more honest but because that is where the revenue is. They are the largest taxpayers and it is the place where the greatest majority of errors could have a substantial impact on the revenue. There will be some controversial cases arising out of that. There will be contests about the interpretation of the law. This is properly so because it is a perfectly legitimately process. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly refer to a couple of matters that Senator Watson referred to with which I agree and which are useful for us to put on the record. One is the question of simplification. There is no doubt that a very major requirement of the Australian tax system is simplification. It is a very much misunderstood concept. We cannot have a simple tax system, in some senses of the word, operating within a very complex society. It is a law to regulate complex procedures. It is not going to be as simple as some other pieces of legislation. But it certainly requires simplification in a different sense of the word, that is, making it more comprehensible. Even if it was only presented in a more orderly fashion that would make it much easier. The simplification project which the Treasurer has initiated is a very substantial simplification process. It will not be quick. It has been assessed that it might take five years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But it cannot be quick and the honourable senator would understand that. I want to emphasise, as I have to groups with whom I have spoken in recent times, that no changes will take place in that intervening period. The first stage of that simplification process will be the production of a discussion paper this year. That will be before the end of the third quarter of this year. That process is well under way. It will be a substantial contribution to the debate about the Australian tax system but it will not of itself be a reform. It will be a discussion paper from the Tax Policy Division of Treasury and the Tax Office. It will not necessarily be the Government's view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that we also have an emphasis and expansion of some of the aspects about self-assessment. As soon as possible we need to have full self-assessment for ordinary taxpayers and to provide help to them to enable them to properly discharge their obligations. Those sentiments which are reflected in Senator Watson's speech are appropriate and shared. He said that he respected the way in which Mr Boucher was conducting the Tax Office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to have a long discussion about rulings but that takes me on a tangent. There is one other point about rulings that Senator Watson referred to. That was the question of the need to address the matters raised by the McKinsey report. That is a matter which I have discussed with the Commissioner. I am assured that there has been a fairly tight timetable set down for response to the McKinsey report. I say `response to' because it is a report. Not everything that it recommends will necessarily be taken up, and nor should it, but a response to that will be prompt and comprehensive. A large number of the matters which it raises which are valid have been, and others will be, taken up fairly quickly. I do not want to divert into a big debate on that point. It is a bit of a tangent but I did want to refer to it. I think it is a valid point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that we always have a need to maintain a balance between the rights of individual Australians, not just as taxpayers but as citizens, and their obligations and rights to protect the revenue. If one wants to look at the John Stuart Mill view of liberty where we are talking about one's right to pursue one's chosen course of action in so far as it does not interfere with the rights of others that is a very appropriate step to take. If one pursues one's individual course of action in such a way that one artificially minimises or attempts to avoid one's proper taxation obligations that does impinge upon the rights of others. It is very easy to look at it in isolation and say, `I have a right to organise my activities to minimise the tax and pass the tax responsibility on to somebody else'. That is the point, the nub of the rights argument. When one pursues it in that fairly traditional liberal way, in the proper sense of the word, one passes one's tax obligations to other citizens or deprives other citizens of the revenue base from which they are reasonably entitled to expect assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we have to look at rights and look at them fairly comprehensively-not in the artificial sense of a bill of rights. In so far as this relates to tax, I am not initially attracted to the idea of a taxpayers' bill of rights. The Australian situation is dramatically different from those countries which have looked at that. But in coming towards a conclusion, I am delighted about this new-found concern with rights. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had more comprehensive debates in this Parliament in the few years since I have been here and in the wider Australian community expressing concern about the rights of Australian citizens and about the concept of a slightly wider bill of rights that might have gone into our Constitution. That, however, foundered on the rock of this Opposition across the way. Members opposite with great enthusiasm were prepared to take this narrow and petty view which undermined a proper extension of rights to Australians. But those opposite have now discovered a wonderful passion for a bill of rights for taxpayers, but nothing about a bill of rights for the rest of Australians in all their other body of activities that go on out there in their day to day relations with government and with other citizens. It is a new-found concern, but it is very welcome. It might lead to a review of their attitude to the Human Rights Commission, which they are always proposing to abolish at each election. Fortunately, they keep being rejected and so the problem does not arise. The right to so organise one's business affairs that one minimises one's tax seems to be a much more important right than the freedom of assembly, freedom of association or freedom of speech. That is not a view that is shared on this side of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is important that we maintain a balance between rights and revenue, and it is a matter that needs regular review and review each time the law is changed. There is a better balance now than there has been for a long time-not perfect, but better. There is increased voluntary compliance; there is increased respect because more taxpayers regard the tax system as fair. I make no apology for supporting decisions that have been taken to protect the revenue, to protect the rights of honest taxpayers from those who would pass their proper obligations on to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance has been raised in a climate where there is growing disquiet concerning the way the integrity and rights of the ordinary taxpayer are being treated under our system of taxation. Senator Watson outlined, I thought very succinctly, the difficulties that a taxpayer faces with a system of self-assessment which has been superimposed on a system which was designed for another purpose. The wording of this matter of public importance has been very carefully set out, because we are concerned that the integrity and the rights of the taxpayer and the revenue both require protection. Senator McMullan in his speech said that it is a question of balance, and it is that question of balance which this matter of public importance is designed to address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the last 12 months there has been a tremendous outpouring of writing, discussion and publishing by people who have a genuine concern that the area of taxation law has now become uncertain. If there is one thing that our system of the rule of law requires, it is that the law be certain. We have seen former senior officers of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) commenting on this situation. Mr Ray Conwell recently spoke at a conference and was reported as saying that the growing freedom of action expressed by the Taxation Commissioner, Mr Boucher, is one of the least certain matters facing the citizens of this country. Mr Boucher chose to respond to Mr Conwell's criticisms of the way in which the Taxation Office is presently being administered by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> You see, there is a very strong obligation on those who are critical of existing arrangements to get beyond critical mode, and to offer in a positive fashion alternatives to the situation they denounce. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what this matter of public importance is about. Mr Boucher wanted people to put forward positive suggestions, and that is what is happening today. On 22 April, for instance, a press release from Marketplace Communications dealing with the question of uncertainty and unfairness was put out saying that the Taxation Institute of Australia had expressed the following view:</PARA>
<PARA>Our experience is that individuals using the self assessment system underestimate their tax obligations and this problem would be compounded unless sensible legislation was introduced across Australia. The legislation as it stands could have far-reaching ramifications for the entire economy and each individual in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Institute said that the penalty for misleading or inaccurate information could get as high as 200 per cent of the avoided sum. However, in most cases it would be between 40 and 50 per cent. The Taxation Institute has called on the Government to implement safeguards to protect taxpayers' rights as well as the Government's major revenue collection framework. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, I would go back to an important appraisal, namely the report of the Joint Working Party on Self-Assessment in June 1989. That was a very responsible group of individuals-three from the Australian Taxation Office, one from the Australian Society of Accountants, one from the Australian Taxpayers Association, and one from the Taxation Institute of Australia. That working party set out in its report many concerns. Perhaps I could paraphrase them into simple English, so that this debate is useful to people who are not familiar with the jargon which has become part and parcel of all taxation discussions. That joint working party which reported was set up as a result of matters raised by the National Tax Liaison Group. It was proposed that the Commissioner should agree to the formation of a working party to look at particular concerns relating to the self-assessment system. </PARA>
<PARA> The working party met in June 1989 and made these sorts of recommendations. The first was that there would be a further working party established to carry out some of its recommendations. The second was that the Australian Taxation Office consider separate legislative provisions for the imposition of interest, so that penalty provisions deal solely with culpability-that is, wrongdoing, not innocent mistakes. The third was that a consistent approach be adopted between interest paid and interest received. At present if the Commissioner makes a refund and pays interest on it, that interest is assessable income in the hands of the taxpayer and must be dealt with in the next return. But the converse is not true. The proposal put forward is that there ought to be a consistent and even-handed approach to interest, so that if interest is paid by the taxpayer there be a deduction if interest received from the Taxation Office has to be declared as assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA> A fourth recommendation was that Income Tax Ruling IT2157 be amended to ensure that where there is no legal precedent or income tax ruling pertaining to a situation, no-culpability penalties should be imposed where a taxpayer's stance is genuinely arguable. In other words, with self-assessment having been superimposed on the system that was designed for a taxpayer to put his documentation forward, a bureaucratic decision will be made about it, and either an amendment will be made or subsequently the assessment will be issued. We now have a situation where the taxpayer is obliged at the time of the lodgment of his return to make a judgment about the current system of law. At the time of that lodgment he is not entitled to make what he considers to be a fair appraisal, but he must predict and anticipate what the Commissioner may determine to be his interpretation. So there is no room in the system presently for a fair, honest and legitimate interpretation of how the law stands without risking penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, it was recommended that appropriate actions be taken to make all penalties capable of being reviewed, which is presently not the case. Sixthly, it was recommended the position relating to professional privilege for lawyer and non-lawyer registered tax agents be reviewed to ensure that tax advice be treated consistently. At present if a tax agent is also a lawyer, then privilege attaches to the advice given. If the tax agent is not a lawyer, but an accountant or the like, then no such privilege attaches. This is clearly unfair. By the way, the Australian Taxation Office did not support that--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated earlier, they came from the Joint Working Party on Self-Assessment of June 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The seventh suggestion is that the terms of reference for the suggested working party include the roles, obligations and responsibilities of the Australian Taxation Office, taxpayers and tax practitioners. It is not surprising that the number of people who have their tax returns prepared for them by tax agents is as high as 70 per cent. That is a commentary on the complexity of our system, but in turn, in a way, it makes self-assessment possible and it also makes the next projected phase-electronic returns-possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The eighth recommendation was that the Australian Taxation Office should continue to improve the effectiveness of its education and assistance programs; ninthly, the Tax Office should continue to improve the design of the return forms; and tenthly, the ATO should implement an advisory and assistance program for taxpayers selected for audit. </PARA>
<PARA> The eleventh suggestion is that the Tax Office impress upon its staff the fact that they should adopt a more reasonable approach in applying the substantiation rules in cases where it is obvious that the expenditure has been incurred. The twelfth recommendation is that the terms of reference for the suggested working party-the one which was listed in the first recommendation-should include consideration of the information required in income tax returns and time limits for amendments of assessments. </PARA>
<PARA> The thirteenth recommendation is that the ruling clarifying the operation of section 169a (2)-the one that requires the Commissioner of Taxation to pay attention to questions raised in documents furnished in returns by individual taxpayers-be expedited because there is no time constraint on the Commissioner at present. I understand that there is a ruling pending from the Commissioner but at present it is only in draft form. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourteenth recommendation is that the terms of reference for the proposed working party include consideration of the feasibility of dispensing with the issuing of notices of assessment. The fifteenth recommendation is that the terms of reference should also include consideration of the strategic direction of self-assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, all that happened in June 1989. Perhaps one could say that as a direct result of that review we have received the report by McKinsey and Co. on Tax Office reforms. That was the report that was referred to by my colleague, Senator Watson. It is an important report in that it too makes certain recommendations, again calling for the need for clarity and certainty.</PARA>
<PARA> The report breaks up its recommendations into three categories, the first being the Australian Taxation Office itself. As I have said, this matter of public importance debate is designed to have not only the integrity and the rights of the taxpayer acknowledged but also the rights of the revenue so that this is a balanced discussion. The McKinsey report sets out its concerns about the Tax Office. It is concerned about the undersupply of quality advisings and resources and about significant staff turnover. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of a tax agent, there is uncertainty and complexity in applying the income tax law. For example, once a return has been lodged, and the law then changes, what is the obligation on the taxpayer with regard to amending that return under the self-assessment system? The lodgment program deadlines which were imposed upon tax agents are also of concern to them. Again, for large companies there is uncertainty and complexity in complying with income tax law. Inconsistent execution of the audit program is also a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost question is very real. The sorts of amendments that have been brought about during this Government's period in office have made the law far more complex. These amendments have caused accountants to be in great demand and have also resulted in the loss of expertise from the Tax Office itself because of the growing demands of the private sector to have expertise to cope with the new laws as they are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of benefit to the Tax Office, the self-assessment system is of quite considerable value and one would hope that the current cost of $1.10 for collecting $100 worth of revenue could be decreased to something like 45c. There is considerable benefit to the Tax Office in the self-assessment system, but fundamentally those people who write and practise in the area will say that the only way the self-assessment system can work is if the taxpayer is honest and wishes to comply with the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The way the law is presently framed means that a taxpayer can wish to comply with the law-he may find himself in what we can describe as the newly created culture where people believe that they have an obligation to meet their fair share of taxation-but the uncertainty and the way in which the discretionary powers of the Commissioner are exercised means that it is often a matter of luck as to whether an ordinary taxpayer is determined ultimately to have complied to the satisfaction not of the law but of the Commissioner's interpretation of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Uncertainty in a system which is dependent on the rule of law is not acceptable and this matter of public importance debate is designed to draw the Government's attention to the need for amendments to make it certain so that the honest taxpayer who wants his or her integrity respected by this system can comply with the law, which, in turn, he or she respects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first time that I have spoken-leaving aside a bit of yelling out across the chamber-since I have moved to my new position. After a bit more than 12 years on the front bench, I cannot go much further back without going out the door, as Paul Keating said in similar circumstances about someone else-I have forgotten who it was now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson has long known a great deal about the detail and minutiae of the taxation Act, and I freely concede that he knows more about it than I ever did. However, sometimes I think that this intense scrutiny or focus on detail causes him to lose sight of some of the fundamentals. I believe that to some extent he is being used in this debate today by people much less worthy than himself. I am sure that Senator Watson would never fiddle his tax return or do anything scungy about anything else either, but there are people in the Liberal Party of Australia who have done and would like to continue doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time there has been a campaign-some would even call it a witchhunt-against the Commissioner of Taxation personally and the Australian Taxation Office, organised, I suspect, by a not very large minority but one that is very influential in the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party has traditionally been soft on tax dodgers. The record shows it. In Western Australia in the early 1980s more than half of the Liberal Party finance Committee were ultimately shown to have been up to their ears in bottom of the harbour tax dodging activities. John Howard incurred the permanent wrath of a large part of the Liberal Party establishment because he was the Treasurer who introduced the unpaid company tax legislation in 1982. That is one of the reasons why he is not the leader of the Liberal Party today. He could even have been occupying a higher office than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am moving to the present. The Opposition, through its policy to emasculate the capital gains tax legislation, would expose the taxation system to the same fraud that almost wrecked it in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that the tax legislation is voluminous. The reasons for that result from decisions of the High Court of Australia, to which Senator Michael Baume referred earlier, through the 1970s and early 1980s. The legislation is written with the intention of covering every possible loophole that anybody could think of. Of course, the enforcement rules are pretty tough for the same reason. That is a reaction to the judgments that were handed down by Barwick's High Court. Of course, Barwick comes from that group of people, who are still around in the Liberal Party of Australia, who are soft on tax dodgers and who were involved in it themselves. He was a Liberal politician and a High Court judge. He started doing a bit of tax dodging and finished up doing a bit of forging; but I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was revealed in 1981 that the then Chief Justice of the High Court occupied a house in Sydney which the 1974 records of the Corporate Affairs Commission showed was owned by a company called Mundroola Pty Ltd. It was the Barwickfamily company. The 1974 returns listed Sir Garfield as a director of that company. He occupied the company house. The tax law at the time required that either he declare on his personal tax return an imputed rental-include that as assessable income-or that he would be paying rent and the company return would need to show that he was paying rent on the house and the company would have to declare that as company income. Because of section 16, of course, nobody knows for sure-it was never revealed officially-whether either of those things were done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt that you do regret it, Madam Acting Deputy President. But this is a bit of history that is worth re-examining because a lot of questions have still not been answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, when this was revealed in 1981 the then Chief Justice was acutely embarrassed. But within a week or two a letter turned up-a letter of resignation as a director of Mundroola Pty Ltd, with Sir Garfield Barwick's signature on it, dated 1974. Was that not convenient! The letter of resignation, backdated seven years, appeared shortly after it was exposed that the extant records of the Corporate Affairs Commission showed that Barwick was still a director of the company and that he was occupying the company house. I took some forensic advice at the time about this letter concerning the precision with which the age of paper and ink could be dated. The answer that I got back was that they could perhaps be dated in decades but not in single years. That was most unfortunate because, had it been possible to establish the age of paper to single years and it could have been established that the paper on which that letter was written was only, say, two years old, the document would unquestionably have been a forgery. Unfortunately, that sort of precision is not possible; it can be dated only in decades. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter arises from this. As I said before, in 1981 no returns had been lodged with the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales since 1974 for the company called Mundroola. Of course, that is a breach of the Companies Act. As far as I know, no prosecution was ever initiated against the company for its failure to comply with the Companies Act. I do not know why no prosecution was launched. But let me say that the Sydney legal establishment is widely regarded as having a very permissive attitude to a lot of fairly anti-social activity and this would not have been the first time that the Sydney legal establishment had closed ranks to protect its own. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I am not canvassing any rulings or opinions from the Chair. But I personally regard the actions and career of Garfield Barwick as highly relevant to any matter concerning taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson and Senator Bishop seem to me to be a little bit confused. They recognise that self-assessment on cost efficiency grounds is an extremely good idea and that it will reduce the cost of administering the tax Act. But they will not accept the quid pro quo that, if we have a self-assessment system, we will necessarily have a lesser degree of certainty than if the assessment is done by officers of the Australian Taxation Office. Self-assessment is an efficiency measure. Senator Watson even complained-I think I got his words down exactly-about the measures which were aimed at the efficiency and reducing the paper load of the Australian Taxation Office. I do not see anything wrong with having a system which aims to enhance the efficiency and reduce the paper load of the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there were the references, most of them probably disorderly, to the cash economy, about which Senator Watson, and I think Senator Baume, were complaining. I am also concerned about the cash economy. If they have any constructive ideas about how to deal with the cash economy, I and, I am sure, the Government would welcome their being put up. However, one of the remedies which it is often asserted would substantially damage the cash economy, that is, a movement towards consumption taxes instead of income taxes, would have a minimal effect, for reasons that I canvassed in an article earlier this week. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop gave a number of recommendations from a joint working party of June or July last year, on some of which, I agree, there seems to be a prima facie case for action, although somewhere close to the top of the list was the old argument about taxpayers having to borrow money to pay taxation assessments but being denied the cost of borrowing that money to pay their taxation assessments. Really, I would be extremely surprised if in the real world that actually matters, which, of course, does not exclude or oppose the idea of making some changes in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter raised was that no penalties should be applied where a taxpayer's stance in a self-assessment judgment is arguable. The trouble with that is that it comes down to the judgments of some other people of what is arguable and what is not. It is an invitation to taxpayers to try to extend the law or the principles to their personal advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make is that I do entirely agree with Senator Bishop, with one rider, about the privileged position of lawyers giving tax advice to their clients vis-a-vis the position of accountants. I agree that it is rather absurd that it should be the case that the lawyer can plead the fifth, so to speak, but the accountant cannot. It is particularly objectionable when one is aware of how much the legal profession has contributed-how directly it has connived and contributed-to tax evasion and avoidance in Australia over the last couple of decades. I think Senator Bishop's idea is an excellent idea; it should be done, provided that the privilege now enjoyed by the lawyer is stripped away from the lawyer and that the lawyer has the same status as the accountant, and not the other way around. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start off my remarks today by congratulating Senator Watson on bringing this matter of public importance to the Senate. Senator Watson has done a great service to the Senate and the Parliament with his detailed and diligent pursuit of taxation matters over many years now, and I thought that his contribution today reflected a very deep knowledge of the whole subject of taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think today's debate has been a good debate with one exception, I am sorry to say, and that is that, as Senator Watson intimated in his interjection to Senator Walsh, I had hoped that Senator Walsh, with his long experience as Minister for Finance, would have addressed his mind today to the real issues of today's matter of public importance. He did address his mind towards the end, but I am afraid that most of his contribution was a rehash of the old hatreds that Senator Walsh exhibited so strongly towards certain persons years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put the record straight on a couple of things that Senator Walsh said. He said that the Fraser Government did not take action for very many years on tax avoidance and that, indeed, it required the reporting by Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi for the Fraser Government to act. It may have been just a lapse of memory on Senator Walsh's part, but that is a total historical inaccuracy. The fact is that it was the Fraser Government, with John Howard as the Treasurer, that started and almost completed the legislative process which led to the smashing of the tax avoidance industry. The first Minister for Finance in the Hawke Government, Mr Dawkins-I am not sure whether he did it deliberately graciously-did acknowledge very early in the first term of the Hawke Government that the tax avoidance industry had been smashed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume reminds us that the Commissioner of Taxation at the time agreed with Mr Dawkins's remarks that the tax avoidance industry was largely smashed by the time that the Hawke Government came to office. It was smashed because of the diligence of the Fraser Government and particularly the then Treasurer, John Howard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, the first legislation-I am talking from memory now-to tackle the massive tax avoidance problem that had arisen in the 1970s, not because of the actions of government but because of a highly legalistic interpretation of the tax Act by the High Court of Australia, was brought in by the Fraser Government. The legislation to smash that tax avoidance industry that had built up was introduced in 1978-79, and that was three years before Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reported. So it is very important to set the record straight. Senator Walsh was just plain wrong today on that. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, I acknowledge the very constructive contribution of Senator McMullan to the debate, because one of the good things about the topic for discussion today is that it is not, or it certainly should not be, a party political issue. It is a matter that affects all political parties, but it also affects all Australians in an equal way. What we are saying simply is that, whilst we agree with the general thrust of the movement in the taxation administration area towards self-assessment, there are various deficiencies in the way in which that has been progressed. We have gone from one extreme in the area of tax administration and court interpretations to another. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of balance that exists in the current system is very well described in a paper prepared by the Taxation Institute of Australia-it was a submission on the case of taxpayers' rights under self-assessment of income tax-and I read one of the early paragraphs of that paper, because I think it sums up an important essence of what we are talking about today:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of balance under the current system arises because of the way in which the new system was grafted onto the existing legislative framework designed to permit assessment by the Australian Taxation Office. Only minimal changes of a technical nature have been enacted to give effect to the new system. These have been directed primarily at relieving the ATO of its responsibility to formally assess returns. What this means is that, existing provisions, for example, relating to penalties and to ensuring that taxpayers provide sufficient information to the ATO to enable an assessment to be made, are no longer appropriate where the responsibility for assessing taxable income has been shifted to the taxpayer. For example, applying the current penalty regime, an error in calculation by a taxpayer in an assessment, could be treated as providing the basis for the imposition of culpability penalties on a taxpayer. However, the taxpayer may have merely sought to properly discharge his or her responsibilities under the present law to the best of his or her ability. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the fundamental problems with the tax laws at the moment is that they are so extraordinarily complex that I believe a full understanding of the taxation laws in Australia defies the wit or knowledge of any practitioner in Australia, let alone the average Australian taxpayer who only really takes an interest in these matters when he or she has to fill in the annual return. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an extraordinarily complex set of laws. It is a set of laws that has been added to in the last five years to the tune of, I think I am right in saying, 800 additional pages of tax legislation-an amount that is beyond the comprehension of people to take in. That has also led to an enormous lack of certainty in taxation laws. When there is that uncertainty and that complexity, our view is that it is entirely wrong to put taxpayers in a self-assessment situation where a totally honest mistake can lead to culpability penalties being imposed rather than the normal sort of penalty that would apply to a much lesser inference of offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Until we get a change in the administration and operation of the taxation laws that we have at the moment, we are going to put more and more honest taxpayers at risk. That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about the small number of taxpayers who deliberately rort the system. We are talking about the risks that are now exposed to average taxpayers who are honest and have no intention whatsoever of attempting to do anything other than the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is critically important for the integrity of our taxation system and the integrity of taxpayers that there be public confidence in the administration of the taxation regime in Australia. Every day a worryingly growing number of examples of a lack of confidence in the Tax Office and its administration are becoming public. Senator Watson, I think Senator Bishop and also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) praised the work of the Taxation Commission, Mr Boucher. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that we are not in any way attacking Mr Boucher in our remarks today but what we are saying is that the laudable objectives to which he aspires can be achieved fairly and equitably only if the people who are much lower in the ranks of the Taxation Office than is Mr Boucher in his exalted position, the people who actually have to do the work, take a sympathetic and proper attitude towards their tasks. In recent times there have been several examples of an approach by the assessors to their work that I believe indicates a very dangerous trend, because it tends to cast more and more people in the role of wrongdoers. They are only trying to do the correct thing but, because of the complexity and the uncertainty of the law, they do run the risk of not always getting it 100 per cent right. </PARA>
<PARA> In his remarks, I think that Senator McMullan acknowledged the concerns that we have expressed about this matter today. He talked about the need for voluntary compliance as we talked about the need for voluntary compliance and there is no disagreement on that matter. He talked about the need for greater balance than now exists and we are talking about the need for greater balance. So in principle I think there has been a very healthy meeting of the minds on those very important issues. I have mentioned that the tax laws are incredibly complex. In addition, the Commissioner still has wide discretionary powers. </PARA>

Some taxpayers are then in fact being penalised through having acted in accordance with a particular ruling which is subsequently changed. Because of the change, the taxpayer is then seen to be in a situation that requires penalty. In my view, that is absolutely inequitable and it flaunts the basic rule of law under which we can operate any proper system. So, that is a major problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The penalties are not appropriate in promoting effective self-assessment and the Australian Tax Institute has raised, very rightly, the concern which it has, and which I certainly share, that the hastily conceived measures that the Taxation Office put together to be rushed through the parliamentary system to meet the last year's Budget session indicate that the Taxation Office seems to regard these matters as basically settled and that all that is required is a little finetuning. We believe, as does the Taxation Institute, that much more than finetuning is required. If we are going to be fair and equitable to taxpayers and take proper account of taxpayers' rights-and the protection of taxpayers' rights is one of the fundamental points made in the wording of our matter of public importance today-as well as the equally legitimate requirement to protect revenue, much more than minor finetuning is required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, Senator Watson, it should not be confined simply to problems associated with people who have to pay tax-we all have to do that. One aspect of this matter of public importance that surprised me was that it was confined to people who have to pay tax. The Opposition seems to say that the only people who matter in this area are people who have to pay tax. What about the similar provisions, for example, that exist under the Social Security Act. Senator Watson spoke-and I go to it-about section 263 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, but may I say that blind indifference has been shown to section 164 of the Social Security Act.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hold on, Senator Short. Senator Watson, or it may have been Senator Bishop, spoke about the need for the culture to change. We are not going to change the culture of the country or the way we enforce our law in this nation if concerns are simply confined to taxpayers' rights. What about the social security recipients and the people who have to go before the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales? What about the National Crime Authority and all those things where, over the years, rights have been modified, if not denied? I would have thought that it was a most surprising approach that, when the Opposition speaks to I think the first matter of public importance in the new Parliament, the one thing it should come down upon when talking about civil rights-and this has much to do with civil rights-is the question of taxpayers. That is an area where, I am willing to agree, there have been intrusions on rights and where wrongs have been done to people. But concentrating simply on taxpayers is certainly a very blinkered way of looking at this whole area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the problem associated with what we do is more pronounced in the area of tax collection than in any other area. Opposition Senators say, for example, that they regret-and I accept that what they say is absolutely correct-what happened during the 1970s when, following Curran's case, awful things were done by people to avoid tax. The culture in those days was that it was very smart indeed to avoid tax. The situation is now different. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short said that the great change took place in the days when Mr Fraser was the Prime Minister. It is interesting that Curran's case was not overruled until John's case, which was decided in June 1988. In the context of what Senator Short says, it is interesting to note the comments in a press release by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Special Prosecutor Roger Gyles in his 1984 report estimated that the revenue forgone because of the avoidance and evasion in the late 1970s and early 1980s ran into billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA>He described it as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax avoidance and evasion of this kind in such volume is extraordinary in absolute terms but almost incredible in relative terms having regard to the small Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>When it is said that this is a thing of the 1970s and that the problem of collecting a proper amount of tax is a matter of the 1970s, that is wrong if we accept what Special Prosecutor Roger Gyles had to say. If we look at the year in which the Johns case was decided-the decision was given in February 1989-again that is an indication of the problem that was planted into the taxation law in the 1970s and persisted right throughout the 1980s. It was only with remedies such as the imposition of a capital gains tax, a fringe benefits tax and the substantiation provisions that the tax system was remedied. I do not think people deny even today that there are rorts that go on in the system, but certainly not as much as there was. </PARA>
<PARA> Because things are now better and we have been in a mood of consensus-I hope this is conceded-and we are now in a better situation brought about by the Government that is now in power, people now say, `Since the system is working properly, there is no need for it'. It is a bit like the sorts of things that are said in respect of unions. It is said, `Things are now so good, employers are now so concerned about the employee, that there is no need for laws that protect the safety of workers and there is no need for laws that protect their wages'. The fact of the matter is that as soon as those laws are removed there are terrible examples of the most fearful injuries brought about by the lack of safety, reductions in wages and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that, unless we have effective laws, the system breaks down and what pertained before comes about again. If we did not have a solid tax law, a solid regime by which tax is collected, then the problems that arose in the 1970s and 1980s would occur again. That is not to concede the very valid points that are made that, if a system is set up that needs to be severe to correct a wrong, that severity should last for a particular time only, and that when the worst excesses are removed that severity should be modified. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is this: Too facile a solution has been offered here today, which is to the effect, `Let us remove these various procedures that have been put in place'. It is not only in Australia that we get these problems. If we look at what happened in England with the case of Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Rossminster Ltd, we see the problems that occur. In that case a judicial warrant was given before the Inland Revenue people went about the collection of documents from the particular person from Rossminster Ltd, and still the problem occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Watson made a very valid point when he said that the power resides in the Commissioner of Taxation to issue a certificate to enable his officers to go and collect documents and to investigate. What he is saying-I agree with him-is that there ought to be some sort of regulation of that. Even a judicial warrant, as was shown in the Rossminster case, does not necessarily ensure that. Indeed, I have often wondered-I might delay on this point now-how effective the giving of judicial warrants is, because the judge simply has to go on the affidavit sworn by the person applying for the warrant and there is never really a means of checking it up. I say that there should be. I would have thought that is the sort of thing members of the Opposition would have come out with today in this debate. I thought they would have pointed to something rather practical instead of simply saying, `Things are bad, let's change the law'. </PARA>
<PARA> The real concern in all this, the real hard ball to get, is: How do we change the law? What do we do? That is the difficulty. We do not hit the hard ball by simply concentrating on the taxation Act. We have to look at the system of issuing warrants and of allowing investigative people to collect documents. That has to be considered in an open-ended way rather than simply limiting it down to a taxation area. </PARA>
<PARA> To be fair to the Taxation Commissioner, it has to be said that there has been a growing need for investigative bodies to get documents and to obtain information quickly. Given the way things operate now and the technology of the times, where things are done by computer, documents can be sent rapidly, and people can leave the country quickly, there does need to be a system whereby people who are going to enforce the law can meet the modern facilities that technology gives to people who might be breaking the law. In England the Mareva injunction, which has now been adopted out here, has been developed, as has the Anton Pillar order. If we look at the general context of the problem we have here, we see that there is a need to change the law. The question is whether or not the law has been changed properly not only in respect of the taxation Act, but also in respect of the Social Security Act and other Acts such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this has been a useful debate. It has been a debate that has been much too limited because it has been confined to an area where people do recognise that something drastic had to be done given the erosion of the tax base in the 1970s and 1980s. I do not know how many examples have been given today-I have not counted them-but I do not think there have been very many of where the Commissioner has acted in a draconian way. </PARA>
<PARA> On that subject, people have called for certainty in the law. They have said, `What we ought to do is so define the law, so make the law, that nobody can but know what it is and nobody can do anything but obey it'. It just does not work that way. We have had that tried again and again. The problem always is that, no matter how we define the law in this Parliament, there will be means of getting round it. What has to be done-as has been said here today-is that a balance must be struck between the effective collection of tax and the protection afforded to the taxpayer. Everybody has recognised that, but what they have not recognised here today is that that problem is simply part of an overall problem. I keep coming back to it because I think if anybody deserved a debate in this context it was the social security recipients rather than the taxation payers, because they are the ones who have suffered more from the sorts of things that have been said here today. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be remembered that, in striking the balance, the tax Act is complex because the people, including accountants and lawyers, who have acted in this area over the years have had fertile minds which have got round the various laws that were much more simple. The law is more complex because it needs to be complex. It is very interesting that people criticism the law for being complex and yet in the same breath say that the law ought to be so written that nobody could do anything but know what the law is. </PARA>
<PARA> The two propositions put by the Opposition are mutually contradictory. If we want something simple, we cannot have it certain. That has been shown over the years. What needs to be done, not only by the Commissioner but also by us here today, is certainly to debate it in a rational way but to remember that the quick fix solutions-and that is unfortunately what has been suggested over on the other side today--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We, of course, have only just received the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the environmental impact of development assistance and therefore my comments today will be but preliminary. The response is appreciated because we regard the Committee's report as particularly important. We are also pleased that the Government, it seems, has chosen to accept the bulk of the Committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, the Committee's report was a ringing indictment of the Government's record in this vitally important area, and I remind you of some of the concerns it expressed. The first was the lack of assessment of the environmental impact of programs by the Government. Of 121 projects with potential environmental significance that were examined, 45 per cent had gone through the planning and design phase without consideration of environmental effects. As the Chairman of the Committee noted in his tabling speech, half of the money that was spent on 45 per cent of the projects actually went to projects with negative environmental impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) address environmental aspects clearly from the first stage of the planning cycle-that is, project identification-and conduct environmental impact assessments for aid projects. I am glad to note that the Government has accepted this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> A second concern was the ability of AIDAB to monitor and assess the environmental impact of its projects. That ability was expressed by the Committee to be inadequate. AIDAB did not have personnel to review the environmental impact of aid projects, and that is not surprising as nobody assessed the environmental impact of projects at the planning stage. I note that the Government has also accepted this recommendation. However, although it has set up an environmental group within the Appraisal, Evaluation and Sectoral Studies Branch, the staffing, I regret, does not quite measure up to the Committee's recommendation as the minimum need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee envisaged that six professional staff would be necessary in this area. As I understand the position, the Government has only three professional staff yet working. It remains to be seen whether these officers will in fact be full time on environmental matters but certainly at least the sentiment of the Government within its response today, that is, that it accepts the spirit of the recommendation, is something that we are pleased to note. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area of concern expressed in the Committee's report that I wanted to mention was its concern about the program of aid for environmental projects. The Committee recommended that a much more significant program of aid for environmental projects should be developed by the Australian Government. The Committee's observation makes mockery of the Government's claims regarding its achievements on the environment. The Government, as you would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, has made much of its environment assistance program. Yet if one looks at the fine print of that program one finds that the budget is only $20m over four years. The 4.1 per cent allocated in the year 1989-90 is of course a minuscule proportion of this country's total aid budget. It is interesting to note the reaction of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, which is the peak body of the non-governmental aid organisations. As it said in its letter to Senator Evans on 3 May:</PARA>
<PARA> Statements that 30% or more of country programme funds are for environmentally related projects must be recognised for what they are-a smokescreen to cover the fact that very few of the projects funded under Australia's bilateral aid programme have been specifically designed to enhance protection of the environment or to alleviate environmental degradation. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Government says that the Committee's recommendation is `accepted within the context of the Government's overall resource constraints', only a very small proportion of Australia's aid budget goes to environmental projects and one must regard somewhat cynically the claims that were made by the Government in the last election campaign that a great deal would be achieved by the environment assistance program when that is analysed and seen to be such a small program. </PARA>
<PARA> A fourth area of concern raised by the Committee concerned multilateral organisations, and the Committee recommended a much closer monitoring of the environmental impact of programs carried out. Although the Government has indicated that it concurs with this view it has not set out the measures that would be taken to put this commitment into practice. There is no mention at all, for example, of how it would monitor World Bank programs as they affect the environment. We urge the Government to address this important area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made a number of other worthwhile suggestions which we are pleased to see that the Government has accepted. I hope they will be implemented speedily. Among a few of those that we consider to be more important, I mention AIDAB's obligation under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-75 to make it legally binding by having such obligations spelled out in a memorandum of understanding with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The Committee criticised the lack of a memorandum of understanding, given that the former Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment advised four years ago that such a memorandum of understanding would be negotiated with AIDAB. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also accepted the Committee's recommendation that disbursements made through non-government organisations be assessed for environmental soundness, and that is something that we also support. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Committee has certainly made a worthwhile contribution in this important area, particularly in translating policy into practical application. We are pleased that the Government has picked up and accepted a number of the Committee's recommendations. I have demonstrated a few areas in which deficiencies still exist and we urge the Government to address those deficiencies as a matter of some urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address a few remarks to the Government's response to the report on the environmental impact of development assistance by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I refer in particular to part (c) of the Government's response entitled `Accepted subject to the availability of resources and/or development of appropriate institutional arrangements'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of the United Nations recommended level of development aid, Australia is not performing particularly well and, in the light of that, there is considerable scope for increasing the overall level of aid which Australia gives. The particular constraints to which attention is drawn in this section are usually economic constraints and this is precisely the area in which I would suggest that the Government could move much more forcefully in increasing our aid. Recommendation 4.32 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that a much more significant program of aid for environmental projects should be developed by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In this connection, I think it is significant that right at this time a conference on the global environment is being held in Bergen, Norway. That conference is a follow-up to the Brundtland Commission report entitled Our Common Future. Newspaper reports in recent days have indicated that the United Kingdom and the United States of America in particular have not accepted the recommendations from a number of other countries that the developed world needs to assist the underdeveloped world specifically in environmental areas which are of global significance. Attention has been drawn there both to greenhouse and ozone depletion. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, it is worth remembering that Australia is the third worst country on a per capita basis in regard to greenhouse damage and that, as regards ozone depletion, it is the worst offender in the world on a per capita basis. So not only do we need to direct attention to changing our own technology here but also it would seem to me that, having done so, this is very much an area in respect of which we would be able to and should assist other countries to follow down that road which we will hopefully map out. </PARA>
<PARA> About 18 months ago I went to China to address an environmental conference in Beijing. The principal reason for my going was that China, which has 60 times our population, used at that stage only about 50 per cent more chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) than does Australia. It does not require a great deal of imagination to see what would happen to the stratospheric ozone if a country with a population 60 times the size of ours increased its per capita consumption of CFCs by a factor of 40. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly distressing to find that at the current conference the United States and the United Kingdom in particular are apparently turning their backs quite deliberately on the proposal that they should develop a new and alternative technology and then help less developed countries to adopt that technology. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the response by the Government to recommendation 4.32 does not presage that Australia will follow down that same road but that, on the contrary, will move much more positively into this area to increase foreign aid, specifically in relation to this recommendation, in those areas where considerable global environmental damage is being caused. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I want to pick up is in relation to recommendation 4.34 in part (d) of the Government's response headed `Partially Accepted'. Recommendation 4.34 relates to the World Bank, of which, of course, Australia is a member. The recommendation is that Australia's representation on the World Bank board and at the Asian Development Bank should pass from the Treasury to Foreign Affairs and Trade and that Australian nominees for executive directors should be Australian International Development Assistance Bureau officers. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention here to the fact that historically the record of the World Bank in relation to very many of its fundings of so-called development projects has been absolutely disastrous. Indeed, the World Bank was quite heavily involved in assistance to Indonesia in its trans-migration program which involved the movement of people from heavily populated Java into what Indonesia chooses to call West Irian. That not only had quite disastrous cultural consequences for the people of West Irian but also proved to be environmentally disastrous as a result of the clearing of tropical rain forests. Ultimately it proved to be economically disastrous in terms of the attempts to establish settled agriculture in cleared tropical rain forest areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess it is worth saying here in the context of the threats which have been mentioned in several programs recently in relation to Indonesians wanting to settle in north Australia that my understanding is that the movement of people from West Irian back to Java now exceeds the movement of people from Java to West Irian as a consequence of the failure of those programs. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as the middle of last year the World Bank appointed Herman Daly, a former professor of economics at Louisiana State University, an economist par excellence who has pursued sustainable steady state economics. Indeed, in 1971, I think it was, he edited a book called Toward the Steady State. He has continued to publish extensively in this area on sustainable economics. Herman Daly was appointed as a senior economic adviser to the World Bank. One would hope that, as a consequence of this and various other moves made by the World Bank, the World Bank will move away from the conventional economically predicated view of development towards a more environmentally sympathetic development view. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendation in this respect, based on that same sort of consideration, was that our representation on the World Bank should pass from the Treasury-in other words, from the tight and narrow economic consideration towards one which takes a much broader perspective. It is therefore disappointing to find that the Government is not accepting this recommendation. The Government specifically says that successful candidates for Australia's representation on the World Bank board will be selected on merit by the Treasurer, admittedly in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not detain the Senate for much longer. However, I find that recommendation also rather distressing. One would hope that a body as important and with as much money to spend globally as the World Bank should be influenced more strongly towards a wider range of considerations, specifically consideration of the environment, in the sorts of development proposals which are put before it and which it considers desirable to fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking on behalf of numerous concerned community groups in relation to the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the environmental impact of development assistance. These groups have identified a number of areas in the key Senate Committee recommendations which they believe the Government must deal with. The approach to these recommendations should be taken as a benchmark of the Government's commitment to real change in the aid program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn firstly to the section dealing with Australian aid for the environment in paragraph 2.11. The Senate Committee has recommended that a much more significant program of aid for environmental projects should be developed by the Australian Government. The current level of funding under the environment assistance program was only $4.1m in 1989 or 0.36 per cent of the aid budget for that year. This is less than one-twelfth of the $93m spent on assisting Australian companies to obtain contracts overseas. So in proportion to that effort, it is not a substantial amount. Statements that 30 per cent or more of the country program funds are for environmentally related projects must be recognised for what they are, a smokescreen to cover the fact that very few of the projects funded under Australia's bilateral aid program have been specifically designed to enhance protection of the environment or to alleviate environmental degradation. It is also very wrong to suggest that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) is facing a choice between increasing the level of aid for the environment and seeking to ensure that no aid project has adverse environmental effects. These are not mutually exclusive objectives. Additional funding must be provided so that AIDAB is not forced to make such difficult choices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's response must set targets for the percentage of the total aid budget that will be allocated to the environment assistance program-for example 2.5 per cent in 1990-91, up to 5 per cent by 1992-93, and 10 per cent by 1995-96. The increased funding for aid for the environment should not be at the expense of AIDAB's general sustainable development aid program. This will require an increase in the level of aid, cuts in programs such as DIFF, the Development Import Finance Faculty, which I have heard referred to as the program which assists Australian business enterprises to find contracts overseas, or a mix of these measures. It should not result in a cut in the important areas where the aid budget is already devoted to environment programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in the area of multilateral organisations, paragraph 4.22 of the Senate report, the Committee recommended close monitoring of the environmental impact of Australian funding for multilateral organisations such as the United Nations Development Program and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), without specifying exactly what steps need to be taken. The Australian Government response must explicitly detail the measures that will be taken to implement this commitment. Of course, there is a very big question mark over an agency such as IAEA. It is a case of the nuclear industry monitoring itself. There are not enough checks and balances in that system. And, of course, there is inadequate funding, which is why the Australian Government has been asked to increase, or should consider increasing, the amount of finance available to IAEA but ensuring that it is not a case of the police policing themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area of concern is environmental legislation in developing countries. The Senate Committee recommended that Australia provide assistance in drafting environmental legislation. There is a serious lack of such legislation in Fiji, Tonga, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu-all Australian aid partners-according to a November 1989 AIDAB sponsored workshop on environmental assessment for development planning. It is not enough for Australia to continue to say that we are not providing assistance because we have not been asked by the central finance or planning ministry of the countries concerned. It is hardly likely that the Australian Treasury, if it had been asked about Australia's development requirements in the 1960s or early 1970s, would have placed the lack of such legislation high on Australia's priority list. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a case where the Australian Government really needs to take the initiative. Australia should provide funds through an organisation such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which is specifically earmarked for this purpose. It is likely that there will then be considerable interest from the recipient countries. It is a case of Australia generating the ideas rather then writing for the specific requests to come forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area of concern to non-government organisations (NGOs) involved in the aid area is that of the memorandum of understanding (MOU), referred to in paragraph 6.43 of the Senate Committee's report. It is essential that AIDAB's legally binding obligations under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act be clearly spelled out in a memorandum of understanding and not just letters of agreement, as the Government's response indicates. The memorandum of understanding must do certain things. I will outline four things which an MOU must do. Firstly, it must require environmental assessment of all environmentally significant projects, regardless of cost, location or nature. Suggestions that all projects less than $5m in value should be exempted from environmental assessment must be rejected. One hundred and ninety-eight out of the 258 projects funded by AIDAB over the years 1987-1989 fell into this category, including the Australia-Malaysia and Australia-Indonesia nuclear technical assistance program, about which many NGOs have grave doubts. All projects should be subject to an MOU. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the MOU should contain a list of categories of projects that should be considered to be environmentally significant unless the contrary is established. This is a similar procedure to that adopted under the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. The list could include hydro-electric or irrigation dams, power stations, mines, irrigation schemes, heavy industry, commercial logging in natural forests, commercial fishing operations and the undertaking of preliminary investigations or the supply of equipment or expertise for such projects. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a third area that must be included. There should be clarification that, if an environmentally significant project proposal is referred to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) and the Minister decides that an environmental impact statement (EIS) is warranted, any such environmental impact statement will be released for public comment in Australia, even though it applies to an overseas situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the MOU must require that, in assessing whether a proposed project is environmentally significant and whether an EIS indicates an unacceptable level of environmental impact, AIDAB shall take into account such information as is available to it on the views of people in the recipient country. It should not be acceptable for Australia to ignore the existence of widely publicised and well-supported public concern in another country when making a decision about aid to that country. In other words, they should go beyond governments to get information from the public in the recipient countries and particularly the NGOs in the recipient countries, which, after all, are in a very good position to make their views known and their claims on any aid projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area of concern to NGOs in this country relates to the NGO advisory body. The Senate Committee explicitly stated that a formal body to incorporate NGO advice into the planning cycle should be established. The need for such a body is now urgent. The time is past when Australia's aid program can avoid close scrutiny. Unless provision is made for NGO participation in decision forming processes, the program may be placed at risk by ill-informed criticism. It is not acceptable to suggest that existing structures are a surrogate for the new body the Senate Committee recommends. The role of the AIDAB-NGO committee for development cooperation is clearly confined to matters relating to activities of NGOs and does not extend to include reviewing the suitability of proposed bilateral aid projects. In other words, the government to government projects are outside the terms of reference of the present informal structure. Furthermore, the committee has no representation whatsoever from environment or conservation NGOs. That is an area which we believe should be rectified immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council for Overseas Aid suggests that the proposed NGO consultative committee on Australian overseas aid contain three representatives of development NGOs and three representatives of environment NGOs. It should be chaired by a deputy director-general. DASETT and Treasury should have observer status on that consultative committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area of concern is that of training, as outlined under paragraph 8.14 of the Senate report. AIDAB is currently planning to train its staff in environmental assessment. This is a welcome initiative. However, the Senate Committee's recommendation went much further, in recommending that the training program extend to providing staff with skills in `developing environmental awareness . . . in relation to developing countries'. It is not only important that training cover both positive action to enhance the environment and measures to prevent further degradation of that environment; it is also vital that both staff and consultants be trained. As most of the project design work is undertaken by consultants, it is essential that they be sympathetic to environment objectives and fully aware of government policy and legislative requirements in this area. AIDAB should make the completion of a training course in environmental awareness and assessment a prerequisite for the engagement of a consultant. </PARA>
<PARA> The environment unit, which is referred to in paragraph 8.20, is also of concern. The Senate Committee called for the establishment of an environment unit with six full-time, experienced professional staff working primarily on environmental assessment and related matters. There are currently only three professional staff in the relevant section, with one position vacant and recently advertised. Of the three incumbent staff, only two have formal qualifications in environmental science, and only one is an experienced AIDAB staff member. Given the policy workload on these staff, it is unlikely that any of these staff would have much time available to undertake a significant amount of environmental assessment work. The extra personnel are urgently needed. The Government's response should include a commitment to establishing an environment unit with six environmental specialists, by the end of 1990 at the very latest. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to comments made about the Brundtland report. The Senate Committee called for AIDAB, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and DASETT to jointly review the implications of the Brundtland report for Australia's international relationships. The Brundtland report has far-reaching implications for Australian trade policy, the regulation of overseas investment by Australian corporations, the negotiation of international treaties and international cooperation in a wide range of areas, including through the provision of official development assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be totally unacceptable if this recommendation were to be watered down to a review of the implications of the Brundtland report for AIDAB. Given that the Brundtland report is directed at protection of the global environment, while simultaneously meeting the development needs of poorer countries, it would seem appropriate for both DASETT and AIDAB to have major roles in the task of reviewing the implications of Brundtland for Australian Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual environment audit, referred to in paragraph 9.14, is another area of concern. The Committee's proposal for the preparation of a detailed annual environmental audit of Australian overseas aid projects is strongly supported. This audit should be made publicly available within 14 days of its submission to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Again, the NGOs are stressing the importance of public consultation and public information, which is the hallmark of democratic decision-making. It is not much good if a detailed audit is made available to the Minister but then sits gathering dust on the Minister's desk and never sees the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) also needs some clarification. The Senate Committee recommended that the Government give immediate consideration to a further increase in funding for IFAD. To the Government's credit, it has already acted on this recommendation. However, whilst the additional $500,000 for IFAD announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in March this year was most welcome, and came as a result of community lobbying from around Australia, it really is only a drop in the bucket compared to the $64.3m funding provided to the mainstream institutions-for example, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Australian contributions to IFAD have historically lagged well behind those of countries such as Norway, Canada and Sweden. In the most recent year for which comparative data are available, Australia's total contributions to the World Bank were 139 times larger than its contribution to IFAD. The equivalent ratios for other countries were Sweden 73 times, Norway 48 times, and New Zealand 29 times. The Government should therefore announce a program for progressive increases in the level of funding for IFAD, especially in relation to funding for other international agencies, such as the World Bank. I shall say more on that later. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area of concern is that of advice to Australia's executive directors on the multilateral development banks, which is referred to in paragraph 12.9. The Senate Committee called for transfer of the governorship of the multilateral development banks and face to face meetings between DASETT, Treasury and AIDAB officers prior to the preparation of any advice for Australia's executive directors. In this they were echoing the views expressed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, when the latter body said:</PARA>
<PARA> A proper Australian position on the Bank approach to structural adjustment, Third World debt, or the impact of aid on the environment cannot be achieved by the current resort to telephone calls or faxes. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there needs to be greater community consultation here and that consultation should go far beyond the Department of Treasury. Two all-party parliamentary committees have now clearly stated that the multilateral development banks are first and foremost development institutions, and should thus come under the authority of the Minister with responsibility for development assistance-that is, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts did this in full knowledge of the early December Cabinet decision not to act on the Joint Committee's recommendation. This suggests a need to give serious consideration to its proposals. Face to face meetings between the responsible officers should be instituted immediately pending a review of last year's Cabinet decision on the governorship of the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, I come to a review of Australia's involvement in multilateral development banks. The Senate Committee called for a thorough review of all aspects of Australia's participation in the multilateral development banks to be undertaken by AIDAB, DASETT and the Department of Foreign Affairs. This proposal is of the utmost importance. ACFOA, among many other community groups-and, of course, ACFOA is an umbrella for many of those community groups to which I am referring-would add that the review must extend to include the role of NGOs as well in the International Monetary Fund; the review must involve an opportunity for public input and the final report of the review must be publicly available. Scrutiny of our foreign aid and development issues is very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an increasing body of opinion in the Australian community that is very concerned about how our foreign aid money is spent and that in relation to other areas of budget it should be increased. Any suggestions that this review could be undertaken by Treasury officials would quite understandably be viewed as unrealistic. Treasury officers undertaking an internal review of their own work can hardly be expected to adopt a truly independent approach. We need to get away from the economic rationalist approach as the only approach to Australia's contribution to international funding of development issues overseas. This is where that narrow tunnel-vision approach is inappropriate. If Australia's aid is to be effective, as most NGOs involved in this area would want it to be, it will seek to help people at the grass roots and will be responsive to the calls from NGOs in other countries. Only by involving the community in Australia and by listening to NGOs in the countries that we are seeking to assist will we get a sensible expenditure of Australian taxpayers' dollars in the foreign aid development area. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document</PARA>
<PARA>As this is the first annual report of the Anti-Dumping Authority, I thought that something should be said about it. Obviously it has been written by somebody with a fair sense of humour. I notice that it mentions that on one occasion when the Anti-Dumping Authority advertised for staff there was a response from an employee of a major Canberra garbage tip. The report also details a number of amusing anecdotes about the Authority itself. </PARA>
<PARA> However, dumping is a very serious matter. The report notes-and I am the first to agree with this-that anti-dumping policies are not easily understood. Like so many trade matters, dumping is not simply a case of putting goods onto the Australian market at a price lower than that at which local manufacturers can produce, and very often a dumping case is hard to prove. Some might even suggest that our dumping policies virtually preclude many companies from seeking anti-dumping protection because the product involved has to be identical to their product. It has to adversely affect the entire industry, not just the least efficient, the largest or the smallest, and the injury must be material and outside the normal ebb and flow of the business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Anti-Dumping Authority came into being because of general haphazardness in previous anti-dumping procedures, and it seems that the system works much better now than it did in the past. During the years under review 10 matters were referred to the Authority, and in all the five cases that originated from findings by Customs anti-dumping action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is a mine of information. It would seem that ordinary lead pencils, for example, are particularly prone to dumping difficulties. There have been several successful and other not so successful dumping actions taken against pencils from Brazil. I thought it was coffee that they produced an awful lot of in Brazil, at least according to that country's adage. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has three manufacturers of self-propelled multi-tyred rollers used in road making and, having suffered difficulties with imports from Czechoslovakia, they took action. Canadian evaporated milk has also been dumped on the Australian market, marketed as a generic product, while the one Australian manufacturer sells its product under three different brand names. Perhaps it is not surprising that a Canadian producer looked earnestly at the Australian market when one producer is marketing one product under three different names. There is a refreshing honesty in this report. The Authority notes that at times it gets a little unsure as to why it is doing what it is doing. That sounds a little like some parts of this Parliament on occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little concerned about the growth of the Authority. It started with one member and three staff. Within 12 months the staff numbers have increased to 12, with the temporary secondment of two Customs officers as well. I note that the report advises that the Authority did not retain consultants during the year. That is different from many other Government departments in which a large number of consultants are used. At the beginning the report says that consultants specialising in anti-dumping procedures sometimes get things wrong, and I believe that that is quite understandable. I commend the Authority for its simple, understandable and educational report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take not of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The new arrangements, which the Opposition basically supported, for the control of the Government's involvement in sport are being reported on basically for the first time in this annual report of the Australian Sports Commission. There is no doubt that there is a level of bipartisanship in this area. For example, the Opposition has a very strong and determined sports policy which involves a commitment to fund adequately national sporting associations and to assist national sporting bodies to improve their administration and coaching. There is a commitment to ensure that country athletes will not be restricted in realising their full potential, a determination to maintain sports talent encouragement plans, to ensure that high performance athletes receive direct financial support to help to defray the costs associated with their training and competition programs, and, of course, a commitment by the Opposition to maintain the Australian Sports Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy approach of the Opposition is one in general of very strong support for the thrust of the Australian Sports Commission's objectives. But I stress that the Opposition takes the very strong view that there is a right of all sporting organisations to reject or accept a sponsor. This is a matter which is receiving some public attention and I think it only right that the Opposition should insist that sporting bodies have that right. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention that the Opposition strongly supports the view that Australia should meet its obligations under the Gleneagles Agreement. Of course, this matter will no doubt receive considerable attention in the months ahead because if, as we all hope, the dramatic improvements in South Africa continue towards the destruction of the apartheid system which led to the Gleneagles Agreement and to the banning of sporting links in a formal sense with South Africa by most of the Western world, we can look forward to an end to this unfortunate ban under which, for example, Australians who have continued to want to have sporting links with South Africa have faced substantial bans in Australia from their participating in the sport of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that no-one likes sporting bans. But, as I understand it in Australia, no-one likes the apartheid system. We can all be hopeful that these dramatic moves will lead to our no longer having to face the problems that the Gleneagles Agreement is there to try to resolve. </PARA>

<PARA>The findings and recommendations of the twentieth report of the Committee of Privileges, which the Committee now asks the Senate to endorse and adopt, were the subject of a full statement in the Senate on 21 December last year. For the sake of completeness in the new session of Parliament, I seek leave for that statement, on behalf of the Committee, to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 18 August 1989 the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on visiting nuclear powered or armed vessels, and whether a contempt was committed by a person who made such an unauthorised disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, having established through correspondence with the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, and examination of the newspaper reports he provided, that unauthorised disclosure of the contents of the report had occurred, first investigated a possible source of the disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> One member of the Standing Committee, Senator Irina Dunn, advised the Committee of Privileges that she had orally briefed media representatives about the report, which also included her dissenting report, on the day on which the report was due to be tabled. She also indicated that, while she did not distribute any documents to the media, extracts from the report and the dissent, and media releases, had been prepared in her office in anticipation of the report's tabling, and thus could have been available to the media representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee, in its report, draws attention to a number of circumstances which it took into account when addressing the question of whether a finding of contempt should be made. As indicated at paragraphs 22 to 24, these included the unexpected delays which occurred in the tabling of the report, and the declaration by Senator Dunn that she did not intend to obstruct the Committee or the Senate, as evidenced by her not taking advantage of opportunities to do so at any time throughout the inquiry. In particular, the Committee draws attention to Senator Dunn's apology, quoted at paragraph 23 of this report, and reminds the Senate that, in similar circumstances some years ago, when a comparable apology was made, the Senate took the matter no further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has therefore made the following findings in relation to the matter referred to it: Firstly, the Committee has concluded that, while it is open to the Committee and the Senate to find that a contempt has been committed, in the light of all the circumstances as outlined above such a finding should not be made. Secondly, although a premature briefing of media representatives was given, and the possibility of premature access to embargoed media releases and extracts of the report, including the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on visits to Australia by nuclear powered or armed vessels cannot be dismissed, under the circumstances of the present case no further action should be taken. In making these findings, it also reminds honourable senators of their obligations under the Privilege Resolution and Standing Order relating to unauthorised disclosure, and specifically recommends that the President draw the relevant provisions to the attention of all senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also taken the opportunity to address a number of other matters arising from its consideration of this reference. The Committee comments on the general question of contempt in relation to unauthorised disclosure, the role of the media in these matters, procedures for tabling reports, on which it has made a recommendation that the matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure, and procedures that committees might follow if contemplating the reference of matters to the Committee of Privileges.

<PARA> On 9 March 1989 the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges: whether there was any adverse treatment of Mr Michael Pope by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) or its officers in consequence of evidence given by him to the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and whether any contempt of the Senate was involved. The Committee, after a substantial number of meetings to discuss the matter, including a public hearing held on 29 November, has found that on balance and in all the circumstances, firstly, there was adverse treatment, although to a minor degree, of Michael Pope-firstly, by Cedric Wyatt, in that he instructed that Mr Pope should make formal request in writing before visiting the head office of the Aboriginal Development Commission and, secondly, by Michael Stewart, in that he extended the instruction to apply to all ADC offices and sent a minute to that effect to all such offices; secondly, the adverse treatment in each case was partially in consequence of Mr Pope having given evidence to a Senate committee; thirdly, therefore a contempt of the Senate was committed in each case, although not constituting a serious contempt and, fourthly, in the light of Mr Wyatt's and Mr Stewart's apology to the Committee and to the Senate, no further action should be taken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really had pretty well finished my comments, but to the extent that Senator Tate has invited me to restate them perhaps I ought to do that for his benefit. The matter of some contention before the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing was whether or not a resolution moved by Senator Georges and carried unanimously by the Senate in 1987, as I recall, is still relevant. Some motions continue and some expire at the dissolution of the Parliament. In my view, this is one of those resolutions that carry over parliament to parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resolution, in essence, was that no changes or alterations to the departments of the Parliament be made without approval of the Senate. As the report sets out, there have been some changes to arrangements in respect of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) which was previously located in the Department of the Parliamentary Library but is now in Hansard. There is some doubt in my mind at least as to the virtue or merit of transferring PISO from the Department of the Library to Hansard. It seems that some inefficiencies in respect to PISO exist, and the general argument seems to be that those problems are best overcome by transferring PISO to Hansard. I would have thought that, on the surface at least, they are problems that could have been solved, whether or not PISO is in the Library or in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that some improvements can be made to Hansard also and that they are presently being attended to, and that by amalgamating the two that will lead to improvements in accountability, efficiency of PISO and the quality of Hansard. They are matters yet to be determined, because only time will tell whether the right course has been taken or not. My personal concern, as I expressed at the Committee and as is shown in the report, was that those matters were addressed by the Presiding Officers of the Parliament without consideration by the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, and, in my view, that flew in the face of the resolution unanimously carried by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been put by Senator Robert Ray at least, and perhaps by one or two others from the Government side, that the resolution lapsed when the Parliament was dissolved. It is not my view, and it is not the view set out in the Senate Standing Orders, and I hope in future that any arrangements, whether they be consequential or modest, trivial or almost irrelevant, be brought first to the attention of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee and then brought to the attention of the Senate for its approval before they are proceeded with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assertions of Senator Crichton-Browne need to be responded to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Appropriations and Staffing Committee deals with the Department of the Senate; that is its responsibility. It does not have and cannot have responsibility for the three parliamentary departments administered jointly by the President and the Speaker. Certainly it has been used as a vehicle for seeking information and for consultation about matters touching on other departments-I recall issues about security, cleaning and other matters the responsibility of the Joint House Department, for instance-and it is very reasonable for that consultation to happen, but any such discussion by the Appropriations and Staffing Committee is not strictly within its charter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as advice about what was happening with the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) and its location, the President provided information to members of the Committee during the recess and before the election about what was happening. That provision of information on the part of the President was very reasonable, and there should not be any suggestion that he has not done the right thing about this matter. I believe that he has bent over backwards to provide information, and I would assert very strongly that the Appropriations and Staffing Committee has no right to formal involvement in a process concerning the administration of the Department of the Parliamentary Library and Hansard. There is a library committee which might reasonably be involved in those matters, but not the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Information Systems Office transfer did not require the President and the Speaker, who have to act together in such matters, to consult the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee-and I emphasise that it is the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee, not the parliamentary departments appropriations and staffing committee, even if, as I say, quite reasonably it has been used as a vehicle for relatively informal consultation about some of these matters in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the 1987 resolution, which said that there should not be any changes in the structural responsibilities of parliamentary departments until they have been referred to the Appropriations and Staffing Committee and the Senate has approved the changes and so forth, was relevant to a particular proposal around at the time for a major alteration of the structure of the Parliament's service departments. It did not and could not apply to a situation such as the current PISO situation. Senator Crichton-Browne might have an opinion that it could or should, but that is all it is-an opinion, and his opinion. It is not a matter of his trying to give some ruling as to the meaning of that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the resolution itself and its current status. At the back of the printed version of the Standing Orders there are now these additional matters, which I regard as being there for information, setting out some selected resolutions from the Senate of the past. The Senate did not authorise the selection of those resolutions. Printing them at the back of the book of Standing Orders does not magically give them any special status at all. Certainly it is useful to be reminded of some past resolutions of the Senate, but I certainly do not regard those matters as binding in a new session of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that until matters are formally placed in the Standing Orders and adopted knowingly as Standing Orders, such resolutions, if they are intended to reapply, should be readopted at the start of a new session. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not if the senator tried to give it the same interpretation. I emphasise again that that resolution was adopted in a particular circumstance at the time and I think it is ridiculous to try and say that it therefore lasts for the next 100 years unless it is formally rescinded. It was very local to the time. As I say, if resolutions are to reapply, they should be readopted at the start of a new session and I emphasise that these days a session of Parliament is usually equivalent to a length of a Parliament, because we tend to have only one session lasting for the life of the Parliament. I think that that should apply to the privileges resolutions and also to the referral of annual reports and Bills to committees that were adopted in the last session. Others that are of interest are listed in the back of the Standing Orders. It is of interest that they were expressions of opinion by resolution at the time, but it is difficult to argue that they therefore last forever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is useful to have them collected for reference so they can be used as debating points that such and such happened in 1967, or 1927 for that matter, but not to try to elevate them to the status virtually of Standing Orders by declaring them continuing orders. I think it is crazy to have resolutions that express opinions elevated above Sessional Orders. We have standing orders and then we occasionally adopt sessional orders clearly intended to be temporary standing orders. But we also have these co-called continuing orders, which have been elevated in status above those sessional orders, to be equivalent to standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA> It is outrageous to suggest that such orders should be binding on the Senate when its membership may have significantly changed. This resolution we are talking about was adopted not just in the last Parliament; it was in the Parliament before last-that is, before the 1987 double dissolution. If it is intended to continue the application of some of these resolutions, I think it is important that they be deliberately adopted so that everyone knows their status; that they therefore last for the session rather than just being a matter of selection for printing in the back of the Standing Orders without that therefore giving them any real particular status. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only the comments of Senator Coates provoke me to rise on this occasion. In relation to his comment about the orders of the Senate and their continuing effect, I can well understand the concern of Senator Coates to try to bring about a situation in which the continuing effect of these is constantly at jeopardy. The reason for that is that nearly all these resolutions or orders have had the effect of curbing the power of the Executive in relation to the legitimate exercise of the functions of the Senate as a chamber and all of them have been an attempt to redress the balance between the Executive and the legislature.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Coates's question is that they should last at least as long as we have a government like his, which is determined to do whatever it can, whenever it can, to devalue the Parliament as an institution. That is how long they should last. They should last as long as it is necessary that the House of Parliament elected by the people, or as the Senate, in its representative capacity, has to fight continually against the attempts of the Australian Labor Party to turn the parliamentary institution into another arm of the Caucus, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, or the Labor Party machine in which the rights of individuals or members of parliament are constantly jeopardised by the numbers in the machine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nearly all these resolutions relate to matters of accountability of statutory bodies, the consideration of annual reports, the requirement that Ministers answer questions by a specific time, or at least provide to the Senate information why they should not answer questions by a specific time, why questions on notice continue not to be answered by the Executive, why there needs to be some capacity within the Parliament to ensure that an input to the questions of appropriation and staffing are in fact taken on board and not simply at the fiat or whim of the Minister for Finance of the day, particularly when we have Ministers for Finance who consistently attempt to use the power of the purse to prevent the executive Government being placed under the proper degree of scrutiny which the Parliament ought to impose on them. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of things like Bureau of Statistics surveys, I can well understand why Senator Coates would want to bring about a situation where the rights of Australian individuals are simply chucked out the window if the Commonwealth Statistician thinks it is a good thing to do so. This was the same nub of the debate we had earlier today about the powers of the Commissioner of Taxation. We know full well that the Labor Party's approach in these matters is to take any opportunity that arises to devalue the rights of individuals vis-a-vis the rights of the State or the Parliament vis-a-vis the Executive. That is the very nature, the very essence, the very raison d'etre of the Australian Labor Party. As far as questions relating to responses by the Government to parliamentary committee reports are concerned, of course we understand why it is that the Labor Party would not want any discipline imposed on the Government to respond to parliamentary committee reports so that they can--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of responding to parliamentary committee reports, the Government's record has got better only to the extent that the Senate has been prepared to put in place mechanisms to demand that degree of the accountability and to take necessary action when that accountability was not met. That is why the Senate has these continuing orders and resolutions which have been usefully gathered together in the same book as the Standing Orders. There are even, I might say, questions dealing with, for example, retrospectivity in taxation legislation. Of course, one can understand why Senator Coates would want to say, `Of course, the Treasurer announced something on some day in some press release.' The Treasurer will never make statements to the Parliament about his taxation policy, but if he puts out a dated press release in Oodnadatta, and two years later decides to introduce legislation based upon that--</PARA></TALK.START>

The areas which, as I say, are covered in these resolutions and orders of the Senate of continuing effect do not simply deal with mechanical matters or procedural matters; they are properly the questions of the Standing Orders, but they do, in fact, go to all the sort of things I have indicated, including the establishment of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proper work which that Committee has done-frustrated as it has been by the decisions of Caucus so that people from the Labor Party on the Committee have not been able to exercise a judgment on the merits of the matter, but simply on the basis of the decision which they have been told to go forward and peddle in the Committee-is of some considerable importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore let me make it quite clear that the view which the Opposition takes about these matters is that, so long as we have an executive government which treats the Parliament with the contempt which this executive Government has shown for the Parliament, the resolutions and orders of the Senate should have continuing effect indefinitely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some remarks about the speech that was made by Senator Crichton-Browne. I listened with interest for about eight or nine minutes to the remarks by Senator Puplick but I think most of them were total nonsense and they do not deserve any reply. When Senator Crichton-Browne made a remark about the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing's thirteenth report when it was brought down, he stressed that there was unanimous support of the report; that is certainly so. In making his remarks, Senator Crichton-Browne the other day stressed that part of the report which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The President undertook to keep the Committee and Senators informed of any further proposed changes in the structure or responsibilities of parliamentary departments. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was raised with the President and the Committee by Senator Crichton-Browne on the basis of the Resolution of the Senate of 3 June 1987 which is as follows: . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The resolution which was passed at that time in relation to the structural responsibilities of the parliamentary departments was then quoted. I should have mentioned to the Senate that, although the thirteenth report was unanimously adopted by the members of that Committee, the particular part raised by Senator Crichton-Browne was not supported. The Committee agreed to include Senator Crichton-Browne's remarks as his viewpoint only. Senator Crichton-Browne indicated that if the Committee had not agreed to include that last section in the report he would have submitted a minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the intention and the hope of the Committee that we would not have to have a minority report, that we would have a report that was accepted by everybody, and so that part by Senator Crichton-Browne was included. If one reads it carefully one can see that it does not mean that the Committee agreed with that; it states just that `This matter was raised with the President and the Committee by Senator Crichton-Browne'. He certainly raised it with the Committee. I presume that he raised it with the President as well. We put that comment in the report just so that we could alert the Senate to what Senator Crichton-Browne's concerns were, but we were not agreeing with them. We were able to do that by having a report that did not have to have a minority report attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, what was in the report did not indicate that we accepted that resolution of the Senate as a continuing reference; indeed, the opposite is the case. It is wrong for Senator Crichton-Browne to imply that the Committee supports his views on a particular resolution which we discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> That resolution has received some airing this afternoon. It is my strong view that the resolution bound the Senate when it adopted it, but it did not bind any subsequent Senate. I do not believe that any Senate can institute what is really a constitutional change to which former senators will be bound. Senator Coates outlined quite clearly that if we wanted to have that resolution again and we wanted to have it as one of the resolutions to which this Senate would adhere, we should bring it before the new Senate when the new Senate gathers together. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that resolution was passed back in 1987, 22 of the senators who were here when the resolution was adopted are no longer here. These are the senators who were here at that time but are no longer senators in this chamber: Senators Carrick, Chaney, Coleman, Collard, Elstob, Georges, Gietzelt, Grimes, Guilfoyle, Haines, Jessop, Kilgariff, McIntosh, Mason, Messner, Robertson, Ryan, Sanders, Siddons, Townley, and-wait for it-Vigor-West, who will be back with us shortly, and Withers. Twenty-three senators are no longer here. That being the case, how can we say that those who accepted the original resolution are representatives of this Senate?</PARA>
<PARA> This situation will be even more marked after 30 June when we have further departures from the departures from the chamber. As for Senator Crichton-Browne's being concerned about this particular resolution in relation to the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, I think that he is well off the mark. The resolution referred to parliamentary departments. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate declares that no changes in the structure or responsibilities of the Parliamentary Departments should be made until--</PARA>
<PARA> (a) particulars of proposed changes have been provided to all Senators;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing has examined the proposed changes and reported to the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Senate has approved of the changes. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Coates mentioned earlier, that particular resolution was passed with the background of the possibility of the parliamentary departments being amalgamated or re-formed in some particular way. When we look at PISO we are looking not at a parliamentary department, but at an office within one of the parliamentary departments and it has just been relocated from a place in a parliamentary department to a place in another parliamentary department. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the resolution is still valid-a view which I dispute strongly-it is quite irrelevant to PISO's move. PISO was moved by the Presiding Officers. I am not quite sure whether the Speaker is involved or whether he has to take note of a Senate resolution-if it is still valid-and I do not believe it is valid. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coates" NAMEID="LF4">

It would be quite ludicrous for the Speaker to have to take account of a Senate resolution, just as it would be quite ludicrous if the House of Representatives passed some resolution and our President had to adhere to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, I just mention certain points. Firstly, I think it would be kind of Senator Crichton-Browne to acknowledge the fact that that part was put in the thirteenth report so that we would not have to have a minority report, but it does not indicate the support of those who did accept the thirteenth report for the resolution. Secondly, I do not believe that that resolution is any longer valid unless we actually move it in this place and accept it once more. Finally, the move of PISO from one parliamentary department to another-even if that resolution were valid, which I totally dispute-is not relevant to the resolution. </PARA>

<PARA> The proposed report was circulated to all members of the Committee, who were asked for their comments. I responded by saying that the very kernel of the issue that caused the meeting, caused the commitment by the President and caused, I suspect, Senator Ray to appear-together with a couple of others, who, I had understood up to that point, were to offer apologies-was that I had entered into considerable correspondence with the President, expressing my disapproval that a change had been made without consultation with the Appropriations and Staffing Committee. The change was that the Parliamentary Information Systems Office was given new dimensions and was transferred from the Parliamentary Library to Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I expressed, in a very objective and not unkind way, my personal disapproval and the disapproval of those in my party room, who were unanimous in seeking to have me convey the view I did.

<PARA> The history is important, because the changes have been occurring over the past 10 or so years. The changes emanated from a conference held in Europe, which was attended by people from Australia, when it was mooted that the accommodation in institutions of people with disabilities was really doing them a disservice and that they could regain their self-pride and self-image if they were given the opportunity to take part in ordinary communal life. </PARA>
<PARA> Immediately upon the return of delegates from that conference, the Minister at the time, former senator Don Grimes, instituted an inquiry and widely consulted people with disabilities. Unfortunately, at that time he did not extend that inquiry to include the people providing service to people with disabilities in institutions, and they felt left out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Disability Services Act arose from the Minister's consultations with the patients. Nobody could quibble with the principles and objectives of the Act. The dissenting report-by me, Senator Walters and Senator Knowles-does not quibble with the Act, but with the fact that there are no regulations to the Act, which is being administered by flexible guidelines. This has thrown the industry into consternation, as it is being asked to disband itself and send disabled people back into the community. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not arguing with that; all we are arguing about is the fact that there are no regulations to administer the Act. Similar situations have arisen and were discussed in the Senate today, in the matter of public importance relating to the administration of taxation legislation, and in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Act, the regulations of which were thrown out today. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody could dissent from the sentiments of the aims and objectives of the Therapeutic Goods Act. We dissented from the fact that there were no proper regulations for the Act, which would not come into effect until the regulations were accepted by the Senate and the House. The Senate threw out those regulations today because they were completely impracticable. Similarly, the Disability Services Act does not have regulations by which the administration can be brought into a sensible order. </PARA>
<PARA> The sorts of institutions that are being asked to disband themselves and to return the people with disabilities to the community are all nursing home institutions, except perhaps for aged care centres, cerebral palsy centres, crippled children's centres, multiple handicapped centres such as Multicap Meadows, and centres for the intellectually handicapped. </PARA>
<PARA> Over many years the Government fostered the development of these institutions. It subsidised them heavily, licensed them and insisted on proper standards for them. People developed a lot of expertise in many areas of looking after people with disabilities. One can understand their consternation when all of a sudden they were told that they were no longer wanted and their institutions had to be sold to provide the money for the sorts of services that the Government thought should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The centres had been attempting to concentrate their services so as to give a better service to people with disabilities. I am thinking particularly of the cerebral palsy centres, which had admission facilities for parents to stay with their children while they were accepted into the institution, training facilities, medical aids, special transport arrangements, schools and half-way houses for those who were thought to be capable of getting back into the community. The centres were asked to sell up and provide services of a completely different nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism that the Government used was that the centres would no longer qualify for funding if they did not do what the Government said-sell up and move their patients into the community. Unfortunately, it has taken a long time to explain to the institutions that what is proposed is a better, more progressive and more enlightened system, but we are in a transition phase that has really left them querulous. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the situation is that the centres have to put a plan to the Government of how they will attempt to accommodate the Government's requirements. If this is acceptable to the Government, by 1992 the centres are expected to have transferred all their patients from the institutions into the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Just reclassifying the homes and reclassifying the patients will not solve the problem. If the patients are to be moved into houses that accommodate no more than three or four people, many staff and a lot of support will be needed for those people to be able to manage in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government feels confident that the costs of doing this will be about half the cost of accommodating people in institutions. I think that is an overconfident estimate, because, in the classification of patients, the degree and type of disability are not matters of consequence. People with even the most severe disabilities can be accommodated in small houses, provided there is enough help and the Government will pay for that help. If that can be done for half the cost of what it costs now, I will be very surprised, but I would be happy to be surprised, because I am sure that the system that is coming in is a lot better for the patients than the one we had in the past. What I am quarrelling about is the way it has been brought in, because it has caused so much consternation to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We will uncover a big well of disabled people in Australia who are now being looked after at home, but who will want services provided under the Disability Services Act, which will increase the costs. Without saying any more about it, I draw attention to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention also to the number of people with head injuries who will appear because of the road toll and will qualify under the Disability Services Act. They number in the thousands. Victoria alone had 2,500. We have uncovered the fact that psychiatric disabilities were not covered by the Commonwealth Government, and we have drawn attention to that in the Act. Those affected were always looked after by the States, and they now really should qualify under the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the report and I hope we can act on it. I hope that costs are able to be contained by the Government and that we deliver a better service to people with disabilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very proud to have been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which produced the report before us now entitled Accommodation for People with Disabilities. The Committee was asked to address itself to four specific terms of reference with regard to the implementation of the Disability Services Act 1986 in the area of accommodation for people with disabilities. Concern had been expressed that some people with disabilities-not patients, as was mentioned by Senator Sheil, but people with disabilities, particularly those who are profoundly intellectually disabled-could not live satisfactorily in the community; that the new system of independently styled living in small group homes would cost a great deal more than living in institutions such as nursing homes; that there might be insufficient care available for these people; and, finally, that a less restrictive living environment might prove to have more disadvantages than benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In short, the concern was not with the principles of the Act, which are supported by all political parties, but rather with the implementation of those principles. The principles of the Act are very clearly set out in the report on page 103. In short, those principles espouse that people with disabilities should be accorded basic human rights of dignity, choice, the ability to achieve as reasonable a quality of life as is possible, and to participate in decisions which affect their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the four concerns, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has found that people with intellectual disability have been proven to be able to live in the community in a range of accommodation options, provided sufficient support is available. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, I take the point here which Senator Sheil made: that it is vital that that support is available, otherwise this simply will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with other members of the Committee I saw many examples of such people living relatively independent lives in small homes. For the most part these homes contained three or four people. Some of the houses had to have some minor structural alterations for purposes such as to accommodate a wheelchair going through a doorway; in some cases, bathroom facilities had to be adjusted. In some of these smaller homes the carer lived in; in others the carer had to be there for a few hours in the morning and again in the evening. In some cases additional care was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I saw people with intellectual and physical disabilities who had spent years of their lives, indeed, in some cases all of their lives, in institutions, successfully making a go of living independently in such homes. I think of one case of a 40-year-old woman, a cerebral palsy sufferer, who had lived all of her life in an institution. She was living with great delight in a home with three younger women, one of whom had just celebrated her twenty-first birthday party with great gusto. In another State I saw a home which contained four intellectually disabled men. They also had lived all of their lives in an institution and, again, were making a successful go of it in a group home where they had a carer who lived in. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the funding, the Committee could not report conclusively on that score. Certainly the transitional stage is proving expensive; nonetheless the Committee felt that once the transitional phase was through, then it would not be more expensive but we were given information which led us to believe that it would cost less finally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that people living in the community had access to a greater range of services than those living in institutions who, by definition, had access for the most part only to services which could be provided by those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee concluded that people with disabilities are advantaged by a move to a less restrictive living environment. If there is the possibility of disadvantages these can usually be overcome by adequate preparation and training where necessary before the move is made. In fact, most of the people who moved from institutions to an independent form of living were given training in independent living. Of course, living independently was felt to be the best possible training for that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Disability Services Act is a brave move which requires courage from everybody concerned, including the community at large. Just as caring institutionalisation was seen to be a brave move some years ago, now times have changed. Society has changed and we have moved from a position of, first, a non-acceptance of disabilities to one of acceptance; we moved to care and protection of people with disabilities; and now we have moved to a position of encouragement of fulfilment for people with disabilities in order for them to lead lives of greater independence. </PARA>
<PARA> By necessity some parents find themselves in a state of anxiety and, as I said, very understandably so especially when these parents are ageing and they see their adult children moving from a caring, protective institution to a form of life in which they will have greater independence. Naturally enough, these parents are concerned about their adult children. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it was a very good thing that the Committee carried out its inquiry. We did uncover examples of insensitive communication from the Federal Government Department concerned to institutions which had caused a great deal of misapprehension. I felt that the Committee was able, in some way, to assist in that circumstance although there continues to be a great deal of anxiety out in the community. We have found that some institutions had already moved on a voluntary basis towards the changes mooted by the Disability Services Act and those that had done so were extremely successful. Other institutions are seeking to do that, and I believe that in some cases they may need a little more time than the Act allows because it really will not work at all if the carers of people with disabilities feel that they are forced to make these changes. We saw frequent examples of where, initially, the carers in institutions and the parents of the people with disabilities did not want to make the changes, but, having seen those changes successfully made by others, could not wait to have the changes made for the people for whom they cared. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion-because time is running out-it is up to the States to assist very much in this process. The Commonwealth will rely on States for housing and transport considerations. The story was the same from all the States. They realised that they would have to make a contribution, but the States have suggested that the Commonwealth should put more money in their direction for the application of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> We found that there is some flexibility. In fact, the Department of Community Services and Health informed the Committee that the Disability Services Act is flexible enough to enable those who, after informed choice, choose to remain in their present type of accommodation to do so. I think that statement in itself will set to rest many of the anxieties which are held about the Disability Services Act. It may well be that regulations should be produced. I feel it is better that these regulations be produced at a later stage rather than earlier, because it is by the very application of the Act itself that I think we can see what needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report and a reading of the conclusions and the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first report of the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC), which was established under the provisions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987. Australian listed companies have five months in which to get their reports to shareholders but it has taken until May 1990 for this report to be tabled in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. If this were a corporation listed on the Stock Exchange, of course, this would be far too long a period because, although the report is dated November 1989, it should have been in our hands much earlier. After all, the Parliament was sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 8 of the Act says that the functions of the Corporation are to encourage, assist, facilitate, promote and coordinate the marketing and sales of horticultural products. The principal products dealt with by the Corporation are apples, pears and citrus fruits. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in Tasmania the media have drawn the public's attention to a crisis in the Tasmanian apple orchards. Some orchardists were having to dump large quantities of apples due to a reduced Australian demand for juicing apples. It is claimed that the Australian juice concentrate manufacturers were not buying locally because of the availability of a Chilean product at $1.40 a litre compared with $2.50 for Australian grown juicing apples. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmanian producers were not involved in these sorts of overseas purchases but the total demand for Australian juice was reduced as a result of this product. The information that Chilean apples may well have been treated with the chemical alar has been publicised, so some manufacturers may move their preference back in favour of the Tasmanian brand or the local product. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in following this matter up, it was apparent that local growers hold the Australian Horticultural Corporation, rightly or wrongly, responsible for the present lack of a local market. They thought it was the responsibility of the Corporation to prevent the Chilean product from being dumped in Australia. This, in fact, was not the case. However, the fact that Tasmanian growers vented their frustration at the Corporation is symptomatic of their basic disregard for the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Corporation was formed the Tasmanian branch of the Apple and Pear Growers Association voted at a national apple and pear growers meeting against affiliation with the AHC. They were outvoted by other States on that occasion. However, during its first 12 months of operation, as covered by the report before us, the AHC has been unsuccessful in endearing itself to Tasmanian growers who opposed it in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmanian growers pay quite a substantial levy to the AHC, and one concerned grower told me that he was disgusted with the Corporation because the Taiwanese market has been opened up recently, with an import quota of nearly 50 tonnes, but the AHC sent a delegation of five people for a visit. If this in fact did happen, I too am quite unimpressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other complaints. The upshot of it all is that at the next meeting of the Corporation, to be held in August, the Tasmanian contingent will likely move that the Association disaffiliate itself from the Corporation. If the vote goes this way I hope that the Federal Government will take note, be bold enough to make the tough decision and either axe the AHC or revamp it in such a way that it has the support of the growers of the products that it is supposed to be encouraging, assisting, facilitating and promoting-certainly by acting promptly and efficiently to stop dumping of overseas products on the local market. </PARA>

<PARA> It has been noted that the new Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, has made significant statements with regard to the policies which were outlined during the election campaign. He has stated his continuing opposition to privatisation in the telecommunications area and an objection to complete deregulation. He has been quoted as saying that he takes this position because of concern about possible increased costs that would occur should privatisation or total deregulation take place. In particular, early this month he did so in a significant interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Lateline program, quoted the next day in the Sun newspaper, for one, in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The same Minister is insisting on a degree of deregulation and, in particular, on competition in the telecommunications area, in particular for Telecom Australia. He said in the Melbourne Sun of 3 May that options for the telecommunications industry included the introduction of a private operator to challenge Telecom, or increasing competition between the other Government operators, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) and Aussat Pty Ltd. Of course a number of inquiries are under way in this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition too, it is worth noting, has Telecom in its sights. This was part of the election campaign, of course. As the Sunday Age said on 21 January, the coalition aims at a Telecom monopoly. Opening Telecom to competition and increasing services to the public in the first parliamentary session was a goal of the coalition should it have been returned to Government. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Minister may be opposing privatisation in pushing for a degree of deregulation, he is certainly moving down some of the track that was attractive to the Opposition during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue has been given prominence by the release of the draft report of Austel-the Australian Telecommunications Authority-on mobile telephone services. The most significant recommendation of that draft report, which was released early in April, was that the Government license three mobile telephone service operators to introduce competition in the telecommunications area. This draft report has gone out to industry for comment and discussion before final recommendations are made to the Government. It seems rather unbelievable that a recommendation for three operators in this report comes in a report which finds that there are not three operators in the mobile telephone service area anywhere else in the world and indeed that where there are duopolies there has been no improvement in service or price for the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The report focuses very much on what we should be doing with regard to the Telecom monopoly in particular. Many comments have been made about what appear to be aspects of the report that do not tend to make much sense. The report acknowledges, among other things, Telecom's excellent performance but then went on to recommend competition. It has not been able to find international evidence that having two additional competitors in the market would create any improvement. It simply asserts that. There is concern that this sort of report should be providing far more by way of evidence in making such a significant recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report argues, again I think rather oddly, that changes in technology have undermined the rationale for a continued monopoly and that the market can support three competitive networks without harm to Telecom and, presumably, in the consumers interest. The argument that the development in technology is a good reason to break up Telecom was rejected. It was put by the Fraser Government in the 1982 report of the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunication Services in Australia and rejected by the Labor Government when it first came to power. Yet we now find it again in this report. What I suggest is that the Labor Government should again reject that as an argument in this case. Telecom has proven its ability to utilise new technology and to pass the benefits on to the consumer. I will make more remarks about that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to look at some of the other responses that this report generated in the community, in particular the response from Telecom itself. It is now a matter of public record that Telecom's response was quite strong. In responding to the report Mel Ward, the Managing Director of Telecom, pointed out that he believed that if that recommendation was to come into play the assumption that timed local calls were unacceptable would have to be `retested'. The spectre of timed local calls-they have been opposed on a number of grounds, not least on social justice grounds-was raised again in debate and will stay in debate while ever the question of this degree of deregulation and competition is accepted without evidence. As we have seen already in the Austel report, there has been a proposal without significant evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ward also said at the time that as part of the cross-subsidy ability which Telecom has under its monopoly the subsidies that ensure rural users pay the same price for connection as that paid by city subscribers, even though the actual cost might be many hundreds of dollars more, would also have to be reviewed if Telecom were to face full competition. I quote from the Australian Financial Review of 17 April:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom also warned that if the Government went down the path of greater competition, then Telecom would push-</PARA>
<PARA>I believe Telecom would have to push-</PARA>
<PARA>to be able to commercially set its interconnect charges-charges which would have to be paid by potential new competitors to plug into the basic telephone network. </PARA>
<PARA>That constitutes a warning of potential increased costs unless there is an expectation by potential commercial operators, as competitors, that they will in some way be able to build into their proposed operations an ability to feed off the basic network, which is a public resource in this country and one which certainly, in a nation such as Australia, will have to remain that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a vast country with large open spaces. We require a massive telecommunications infrastructure-probably as large as the transcontinental grid in the United States which, in comparison with our 17-odd million people, has a population of 250 million. It is vital that we are able to have the network and cross-subsidy operation which we have currently through the Telecom monopoly in order to be able to provide to all Australians access to basic telecommunication facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the development of technology is important here as one of the issues in this whole debate is and will be the decision about the continuing monopoly on the first telephone. If the community service obligations of Telecom are defined as being the provision of a single telephone on a hall table inside the home, we may very well in the future be restricting access to basic telecommunications to many Australians. Indeed, the Australian Democrats are concerned that the monopoly might be reduced to something like a connection at the boundary of individual properties, so that private connection can be made from the boundary into the home, because that would further diminish the opportunities for equity in the provision of basic communications facilities to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As telecommunications technology has developed I believe that we have already gone far beyond an expectation that a telephone will do it all. We must leave open the opportunity for all Australians-including those on low incomes and those in isolated areas-always to have access to what is considered basic at the time because of the nature of the technology. </PARA>
<PARA> There may have been a time when Morse discovered his particular technology that there was an expectation that that would be the basic technology, the basic access to communications that everybody would have. If legislative decisions had been made at the time that determined that that was the case and if technological advances had not taken place quickly enough to show that there was in fact something else coming along, those who were not able to provide for themselves and plug into a very expensive network, which it would have been if it were not provided publicly, would have been vastly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the challenges for all of us in the future is that we must not have a divided society. We have a divided society already where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. We must not allow this to happen with information. We are in the information age and this will only increase. We must make sure that all Australians have access to basic information, as they all should have access to basic income support so that justice is served. Social justice ought to be the priority. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are really saying is that in this whole debate about the monopoly which Telecom has, how far that should be broken and in what areas that should be broken, social justice must always be the first thought and the first priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The fairly sharp responses that have come from the Austel report, given the lack of evidence and given the potential for destruction of much of the equity that is inherent in our telecommunications system, were quite justified. There is also the concern that there may be government decisions made before we have had the results of the various inquiries that are currently under way. The editorial in the Melbourne Age on 18 April was headed `Austel report points in wrong direction'. That editorial, amongst other things, many of which I have already pointed to, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Piecemeal inquiries such as that into the development of mobile telephone services imply an acceptance of internal competition without any examination of the broader implications or alternative strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>It concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government should reject that Austel report with the contempt it deserves and appoint an inquiry into the broader implications and options of the telecommunications revolution, how Australia could best benefit from exploiting it, and whether privatisation of some of the services is in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>This reiterates the point that I have made about what is in the best interests of the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move beyond the mobile telephone issue because what we are really talking about is what Paul Lyneham said in the Sunday Sun on 21 January. He suggested that Telecom bashing was a new traditional Australian sport. It does happen a lot. It is one of the things that must be resisted at all costs and at all times. In that article Paul Lyneham used a great deal of evidence, more than I saw in the whole Austel report. He referred to comments made by the then shadow Minister for communications, Senator Alston, when the news came out that Telecom had made a $973m profit. I as a shareholder of Telecom was delighted, especially as Telecom is now liable to pay tax. Like any other major organisation I think we should all have been delighted. We were winning both ways, as people who own Telecom and as people whose national account would be boosted by a profitable enterprise paying its due taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Paul Lyneham pointed out that it all seemed to be a bit of a problem because whenever Telecom has made a loss it has been kicked around the head by people of the ilk of Senator Alston and others and yet when it made a massive profit it was also kicked around the head. He went on to point out that with the staff nowadays numbering 84,000 it is the nation's second largest work force after the Coles-Myer group, another little duopoly almost. He pointed out that there are probably about as many-I will use his term-`bludgers' in that group as there are in the population at large. If we do occasionally see someone in that large work force perhaps not pulling his weight that is probably not something that should surprise us very much. He went on to point out that if we look back 15 years we will see that with 86,000 staff Telecom connected 335,000 new telephones but last year with 2,000 fewer on the payroll new connections had more than doubled to 682,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston had apparently referred to Telecom as a sheltered workshop. Paul Lyneham felt that was pretty good productivity for a sheltered workshop. We should look at the cost of calls. In 1975 the maximum subscriber trunk dialling (STD) charge for three minutes was $2.70. Now it is $1.72. Over the same period a local call has gone up from 9c to 21c, a stamp from 9c to 41c and a litre of petrol from 14c to more than 60c. In terms of comparative productivity, the argument advanced by Paul Lyneham is a positive one, and one with which the Democrats agree. He concluded his article with a comment with which I also agree. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Sure, they've got to keep boosting their efficiency and trimming their charges. </PARA>
<PARA>I would agree with that. I do not stand here and say that Telecom is a perfect entity and a perfect enterprise by any means. I am saying there is a distressing tendency for an increase in membership of those clubs which engage in that new Australian sport of Telecom bashing, quickly taking the place of the weather and mothers-in-law, as Paul Lyneham has said, as a key indoor sport. It is something that we would really want to work against and look at the reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Very recently the Public Sector Union, in defence of Telecom and in a desire to put on the record some of the facts, again jogged along by that Austel report, has produced a document which it is distributing. It is widely available and I commend it to all honourable senators before they decide to engage in this sport of Telecom bashing. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do take the view that deregulation, competition and privatisation are good for their own sake then we have to look at what has happened elsewhere. I will give just a few facts. In the United States the telephone system was deregulated from 1984. I will give a comment made by the director of the Consumer Federation of America. Surely that is what our telecommunications system is there for, the consumers. Five years after that deregulation he said:</PARA>
<PARA> You get a terribly skewed pattern, with the average consumer saving pennies on long distance and paying between forty five and sixty per cent more for local service. Most consumers have higher telephone bills overall than they did before the breakup. </PARA>
<PARA>People who may be impressed by the so-called independent reports that sometimes come out of Monash University and by the arguments advanced by the Australian Telecommunications Users Group that it is those long distance calls which they are trying to force down should look at the American experience. They will see that indeed the local calls did go up. The ordinary citizens, the basic community users and low income families, are the people who pay in that sort of situation. We have the evidence from the United States. As I have already shown, our long distance call charges have gone down in any case. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1989-I am still referring to the United States-the national average residential rate of rental was $359 a year compared with Australia's rate of $140 a year. There are free local calls in very small localised areas in the United States. For example, in Washington local calls stop after 11 kilometres after which STD rates are paid. That contrasts remarkably with the increasing size of the local call zones here in this country and the community call which has a cheaper rate than that of the next zone. There is a good deal more I could say about the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the United Kingdom where a formerly publicly owned enterprise, such as we have here, has been privatised. Competition has occurred only within the lucrative business market. British Telecom is still a monopoly for residential consumers who are on full user pays regimes, including timed local calls. Of course, rural consumers will be very interested by that because full user pays can mean thousands of dollars simply to get a basic telephone line for people in isolated areas, and not just isolated areas but outside the major metropolitan and closely populated regional centres. </PARA>
<PARA> Service and quality have also deteriorated in the United Kingdom and the stories are legion. The consumer magazine Which in the United Kingdom found in a survey after July 1988 that most consumers had experienced no benefits from privatisation and competition. One of the points made to me was that the provision of the telephone directory in many areas has virtually ceased and many directories are several years out of date-which is a great help to someone with a telephone who wants to communicate-which is what telecommunications is all about-but who cannot find a telephone number because the telephone books are not up to date. </PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand deregulation of the telephone network has meant higher prices for consumers. In the main capitals residential rental is $299.60 per year, compared with Australia's $140. User pays, as we have to anticipate here, also means that rural callers pay more than callers on main trunk routes. People in this country on the Sydney-Melbourne route will be salivating over the thought of carving up Telecom, but people elsewhere should not be. There have been higher total charges for residential consumers, and higher charges and poorer services for those outside the major cities. Taxpayer-funded budgetary payments for cross-subsidies, which are now funded by Telecom, would be the answer here. That is a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The proponents of removing the cross- subsidy, an inevitable result of this exercise, are suggesting that this is fine and that low income people or even people in isolated areas can be compensated by a budget line. We all know what happens to government expenditure. It is first carved up bit by bit in what is at the moment called the Expenditure Review Committee. But it is very difficult to get to the top of the priority list payments and expenditures which are there for small numbers of low income and disadvantaged people. There is ample evidence for that across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate about deregulation and micro-economic reform the Australian Democrats urge the Government to keep in its sights the continuing community service obligations of Telecom-not to reduce its thinking about what that entails-so that all Australians can expect the best of service. We are not saying that they already have `the best'. We are saying that they have a very good service, and there are a very high proportion of Australians who have the basic service. This has increased continuously, as some of the figures I have given show. We need to make sure that we augment this service. We do not want to carve it up, destroy it, and reduce the provision of social justice in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the latitude allowed to senators in debating the Appropriations Bills, I would like this evening to address briefly the significance of land to our Aboriginal population. This is a subject of which I am acutely aware at present, having spent some time fairly recently in the West Kimberley district of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was delighted to hear the Government's commitment to `playing an educative and leadership role in bringing about a deeper understanding on the part of non-Aboriginal Australians of the culture, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people'. I am quoting and am continuing to quote:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also remains committed to a genuine reconciliation with Australia's indigenous people. In particular, it will be seeking wide community support and bipartisan political endorsement of an instrument of reconciliation, variously referred to as a Treaty or Compact, between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The form and content of such a document will not and cannot be finalised until extensive consultation is initiated with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians. This process of consultation will be enhanced following the recent establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to achieve broad equality with other Australians. To promote this goal, emphasis will continue to be placed on addressing land, health, education, housing and infrastructure needs and the further development of the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish this evening to make a small contribution to that process. I felt that it would be extremely useful for honourable senators to hear of my experiences in a visit a few weeks ago lasting four or five days to the West Kimberley region. I took the opportunity to visit a number of new communities-communities which were previously referred to as outstations. They are new settlements. Some are very small, with just one or two extended families; other communities number up to 250 people. I believe they demonstrate clearly the value and significance of that association with the land, which is still not fully understood by many Australians who are not of Aboriginal descent. We are now seeing what has happened to the families who, within the last 30 or 40 years, were arbitrarily taken from their own lands and settled in missions or reserves close to towns. We are all well aware of the devastation that this caused, the day to day destructiveness that has manifested itself in the use of alcohol and other destructive substances. We are also aware of the destruction of the dignity of Aboriginals and of their self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few years a number of pastoral properties have been acquired for those Aboriginal families and groups who have expressed a desire to go back to their own lands. It is very gratifying to see the difference that such moves have made to the health and wellbeing of these families and groups. On the whole their living conditions are a great improvement on what they had been in the fringe camps and missions near the towns. Most of the communities are supplied with the prerequisites for dignified living in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that one of the greatest requirements is an all-weather airstrip to make certain that communities a long way from health care will not be completely cut off in a crisis. A good water supply is absolutely crucial-most of these communities have this facility-as is a generator for electricity. Many of these communities are using solar technology in a very effective manner. One sees houses-in some places very good housing, though it varies-provided with solar water heaters. In some communities solar pumps are being used. Other communities-and I know that Senator Powell will be glad to hear this-are equipped with solar telephones. The health of these communities is attended to by frequent visits from trained nurses. The communities have contact with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Communities that are too small to have schools of their own are beginning to use the Kimberley School of the Air. This is possible for these families because the younger parents have been educated and are literate, as I observed. In fact, I saw people in these communities filling out applications to go on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most gratifying aspects of this new life for these families is that they are able to restore their traditional skills. The women who have returned to the Mount Barnett Station are again creating their arts and artefacts and teaching the younger people. They have now returned to the land where the materials that are available to them are the materials with which they were familiar as children. The quality of the art and the artefacts coming from that area is quite remarkable. In fact, this work is leaving the area at such a rate and its marketability is so high that there is now a move to establish a museum in Derby so that the best examples can be kept there as a permanent exhibition. </PARA>
<PARA> The capacity for self-support in many of these communities is being developed through the community development employment projects scheme and I am told that there are at least six Aboriginal communities in the East Kimberley which have their own road building equipment and teams so that they are able to contract to the shires for building roads throughout the area, as well as in their own communities. One community is well advanced in planning to establish a roadhouse on the Gibb River Road, and this will be a way in which that community can engender some self-support. Many other communities have mustering teams which they contract out to pastoralists and, at the same time, the communities are building up their own pastoral properties. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest advantages of these communities is that in most cases they are a long distance from the supply of alcohol. Living at Mount Barnett, for example, means a 350-km drive across a not very good road for anyone who wants to get alcohol. These communities on the whole have determined that they will be dry and thus able to keep their young people much more healthy. They can enjoy a happier and healthier lifestyle as a result. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the return to dignity that is possible in these circumstances-living in decent houses, away from alcohol, with proper education and health facilities and the capacity to develop economic independence, which was very difficult when they lived in close association with the towns. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all well aware of the continuing challenges facing Aboriginal communities, whether they are on remote outstations, like the ones I have described, or on the fringes of towns. Over the last few weeks we have seen reports of the high incidence of childhood infections, particularly ear infections leading to hearing loss. We have also heard of high infant mortality and morbidity rates compared with the non-Aboriginal population. Although the figures are much better than they were in the past, there is also the question of how good the data was in the past. One gets the impression that the babies and little children are well nourished and well cared for compared with the situation 15 or 20 years ago. Still, there are far too many infections which are not properly treated. The quality of housing and hygiene, the capacity to dispose of rubbish and the capacity of communities to have proper sewerage systems are extremely important, as they are with any community, regardless of the ethnicity of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question that is of enormous importance to our Aboriginal communities is nutrition. This is especially so in remote communities where there is not easy access to fresh fruit and vegetables and the tendency is still for the diet not to be particularly good, especially among growing children. There is still the problem of the high incidence of babies being born prematurely and with low birth weights. This in turn points to the lack of good nutrition in their mothers and the fact that many Aboriginal mothers are quite young compared with the population generally. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another problem with maternal health, and that is the need to persuade Aboriginal women-the same as all women in the community-to give up smoking and avoid the use of alcohol if they want to have healthy babies. Gradually these matters are being dealt with and the communities are receiving continually improving care from the medical services generally and the Aboriginal Medical Services in particular. These services are now available in many parts of Australia. I am not saying they are available to everyone, but their availability has greatly improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of violence is still with us in Aboriginal communities, as it is in the rest of the population. Over the past three years we have been conducting a national campaign throughout Australia to help people become aware of domestic violence as a social evil and as a crime. This is just as much a problem in Aboriginal communities as it is anywhere else. As a final phase of a three-year campaign, we have targeted particular groups with our advertising, projects and programs, and these groups include Aboriginal women, for whom a specific video has been made. An education campaign has been developed around that video. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a salutary thought that more women die in Aboriginal communities as a result of violence than young Aboriginal men die in custody. This tends to be as a result of living conditions, stress, and perhaps some traditional practices that have gone quite haywire, particularly with alcohol abuse. This makes the incidence of violence much higher than we might have thought. I have had the opportunity to talk to the older Aboriginal women of the Wantkajuntka community from Fitzroy Crossing about the possibility of a safe house there, and the planning for that is going ahead. The day that I was in Fitzroy Crossing a woman of 20 died as a result of head injuries. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular problem is one that Aboriginal communities themselves would want to approach in their own way and I believe that that should be the case. However, I also believe that as a wider community we have to do what we can to ensure that their living conditions, the circumstances in which they bring up their children and all the opportunities of their lives are such that these difficulties will be reduced to an absolute minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me back to what I started to say-that where Aborigines are able to resume their close association with their land, where they can live as they want to live, in dignity, with self-determination and with the assistance that we, as a wider and wealthier community are able to provide for them, we are able to restore their dignity and their capacity for generating income on which they can live. Thus we can restore their traditional values and skills while ensuring that they have the benefits of civilisation, if you like to call it that, in the form of housing, health and education of the best possible standard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators need no reminder of the public disquiet that exists concerning the state of Sydney's beaches. I have raised this matter several times in this place, largely as a result of sewage pollution. One would think that the poor example of Sydney's sewage pollution management would deter any local council elsewhere or any government department from making the same mistakes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately for the residents of Coffs Harbour, some aldermen of Coffs Harbour Council and the New South Wales Public Works Department want to impose the same fate on the northern beaches of Coffs Harbour by proceeding with an ocean sewage outfall at the Look-At-Me-Now Headland. This development is being urged by them despite strong local opposition to the outfall, the existence of viable alternative strategies to deal with the sewage effluent and the impact that the outfall is likely to have on the environment values of marine areas surrounding the Solitary Islands, which are opposite the Look-At-Me-Now Headland and which have been under consideration as a marine national park. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1987, three years ago, 4,000 north coast residents marched on Woolgoolga Headland to protest against a sewage ocean outfall proposed for that site. Woolgoolga Headland at the time was the Council's preferred site. The march was led by the present Mayor of Coffs Harbour, Alderman Bernie Malouf. Following the public outcry, a commission of inquiry was established. As it turned out, the inquiry was seriously flawed. Dr Sharon Beder, a civil engineer who has completed a PhD on the subject of the Sydney Water Board's sewerage system, said of the inquiry that it had no independent technical expertise and was forced to depend on expert advice from engineers in the employ of the New South Wales Public Works Department and State Pollution Control Commission, the departments that supported the original decision favouring the ocean outfall. Commenting on the thinking of many professional engineers, Dr Beder told the North Coast Times newspaper that `ocean outfalls are traditionally preferred by sewerage engineers because of their education and limited experience with re-use options'. </PARA>
<PARA> While these facts suggest the reasons why the commission of inquiry reached its decision to recommend an ocean outfall at Woolgoolga, the path followed by the Coffs Harbour City Council to its final decision needs further explanation. The Council voted to follow the inquiry's recommendation but to shift the proposed outfall from Woolgoolga to the less populated Look-At-Me-Now Headland. The Council supported this site by five votes to four, a vote which could not be regarded as an overwhelming endorsement. It did so despite widespread community opposition to an ocean outfall anywhere in the Coffs Harbour area and the knowledge that viable alternatives had been put forward by local environmental groups such as the Stop the Outfall Pollution Committee, otherwise known as STOP. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision by Coffs Harbour Council highlights an important problem facing our society today, that is, the overwhelming reliance by decision makers on technical experts. It is a fact that such experts are often influenced in the advice they give by the need to maintain their good standing in conservative, often backward-looking professions with a clear interest in maintaining the status quo. What is especially deplorable about the decision in this case is that they are much the same experts whose advice has been accepted for many years, including advice that has led to the present state of Sydney's beaches.</PARA>
<PARA> Another factor may have affected the thinking of those Council members who voted in favour of moving the site of the ocean outfall to Look-At-Me-Now Headland. They may have thought that, because there are fewer residents at Look-At-Me-Now Headland than at Woolgoolga, there would be less resistance to the proposal. If so, they were proven to be mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA> At the previous local government election at Coffs Harbour `no outfalls' was a major plank in the platforms of many of the record number of candidates. Among the successful candidates who campaigned on a `no outfall' promise were the Mayor, Mr Bernie Malouf, and Alderman Rob Telford. It pains me to have to say that candidates for political office, even at the relatively humble level of local government, are capable of going back on their promises once they are elected. That is what happened in the case of both Mr Malouf and Mr Telford, who not long after their election made statements in favour of the sewage outfall development which they had formerly opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> So decided was the change in approach by Mayor Malouf that on 25 February last year, the Mayor threatened to resign because the New South Wales Minister for Environment, Mr Tim Moore, was pressing the Council not to proceed with the ocean outfall. At that stage Mr Moore was concerned at the effect the outfall might have on the environment of a proposed marine national park for the Solitary Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently the balance within Council on this controversial issue has changed, with Alderman Norma Woods now supporting the anti-outfall residents. Mayor Malouf, who was so annoyed by Environment Minister Moore's interference, was not averse to arranging a bit of his own. The Mayor sought the support of the New South Wales Deputy Premier and Minister for Public Works, Mr Wal Murray, and encouraged his intervention in the matter. A report in a Coffs Harbour newspaper, the Advocate, dated 26 August last year, stated that Mr Murray supported Mayor Malouf's position on the outfall development at a National Party conference in Coffs Harbour which was also addressed by Malouf. Subsequently, concern has been expressed by residents and councillors at the possibility that Mr Murray's Public Works Department might not honour its commitment to provide the usual 50 per cent subsidy that applies to council sewerage developments for the northern beaches sewerage scheme because Council rejected an ocean outfall. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that, if the Coffs Harbour City Council and the residents both support the alternative proposal of microfiltration technology and a dual pipe system to allow treated effluent to be reused for firefighting, irrigation and other industrial domestic uses, other than for drinking water, of course, Mr Wal Murray and his Public Works Department have no business interfering. It would be a great pity to see any repetition of the situation at Fingal Head, which was investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. I refer to the intervention by Mr Murray in November 1988 when he stopped work on four Aboriginal Housing Commission homes. One of these homes was on land that Ocean Blue Club Resorts Pty Ltd was anxious to purchase from the Tweed-Byron local Aboriginal land council for part of its $200m resort project. The comparison is not out of place as resort development is an argument raised by the pro-outfall lobby at Coffs Harbour. Their argument is that Coffs Harbour needs more tourist development and that only a sewage ocean outfall would meet the demand. I would have thought that, if promoting tourist development was the aim, everything possible would be done to keep the area's ocean and beaches in a clean and unpolluted state. It hardly seems likely that tourists will flock to Coffs Harbour to swim in sewage effluent when there are such opportunities to do so in Sydney at Manly and Bondi. </PARA>
<PARA> Mayor Malouf was quoted in the Coffs Harbour Advocate newspaper on 26 August last year as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We should go ahead with the outfall and if studies later show it's not needed we can block it off. </PARA>
<PARA>But, as his Deputy Mayor, Mr Brian Zouch, said in the same newspaper item:</PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that the (alternative) technology is already proven and the proposed outfall is already obsolete. So why spend the $1.6 million?</PARA>
<PARA>Why indeed? The only party that I can think of which would benefit from Mayor Malouf's proposal to build now and block later would be the Public Works Department, whose engineers would be given both jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Look-at-Me-Now Headland ocean outfall controversy provides an interesting backdrop to the New South Wales Premier's rhetoric about the need for better management of the public sector and economic rationalism. It also brings into question his Government's commitment to the Premier's call for better management of the `commons', in this case the ocean, set out at such length in Mr Greiner's Earth Day statement which he made last month. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two ocean outfalls already in operation in the Coffs Harbour area; one is at Sawtell and the other at Coffs Harbour. I believe the New South Wales State Pollution Control Commission sent a memorandum to the Coffs Harbour City Council not long ago asking the Council to monitor the water around these outfalls for organochlorins. These are the substances that have contaminated fish around the Sydney sewage outlets and caused the fishing industry considerable losses. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that government reports on pesticide levels in fish of up to 250 times the allowable limits in the Sydney area were kept from the public for over a year. It is to be hoped that the Coffs Harbour City Council and the State Pollution Control Commission will not repeat that disgraceful example. If the Look-At-Me-Now Headland sewage outfall were to be constructed, all incentive for Council to pursue alternative treatment and reuse systems would be gone. Experience has shown that the temptation to overload and abuse ocean outfall systems is almost too great for any administration to resist. No guarantee can be given by Council against future overload of the ocean outfall system. The proposed ocean outfall at Look-At-Me-Now Headland is not the only environmental problem that this area faces. The headland's continued resistance as a public reserve is under threat. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, Look-At-Me-Now Headland is crown land administered by the New South Wales Lands Department. It was resumed by the New South Wales Government 10 years ago for public use and to protect the area from development. The headland is the site of at least one rare and endangered plant species. It provides habitat for over 100 bird species, including the threatened osprey which builds its nest there. The confluence of southerly and northerly ocean currents off the headland has created a very rich marine environment in which both tropical and cold water fish occur together. </PARA>
<PARA> The headland also overlooks the most popular surfing beach for many kilometres around, as well as three safe swimming beaches which afford sheltered conditions in all weather. Recreational activities such as snorkelling, diving, fishing and bushwalking are available. Behind the headland is the Moonee Nature Reserve. This area joins the coastal crown reserve and provides a buffer for the estuarine system and the wildlife of the seashore and the dunal and heath areas. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 December last year a public meeting was organised by John Allen and Associates of Coffs Harbour on behalf of the New South Wales Lands Department. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the future management of the headland. The demands of the local residents were very modest. They wanted a fenced car park to prevent further damage to the headland by vehicles, and some walking tracks. Mr Peter Evans from the regional office of the National Parks and Wildlife Services told the meeting that the service could carry out this work for $35,000-a very modest amount. An official from the Lands Department told them that his Department could do it for $300,000 and would have to subdivide part of the headland and sell it off in order to raise the funds. Not surprisingly, those at the meeting found the offer from the Lands Department less than irresistible. They voted for Look-At-Me-Now Headland to be taken out of the control of the Lands Department and handed over to the National Parks and Wildlife Service to manage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Lands Department's vastly inflated costing of $300,000 may merely be a measure of its inefficiency. However, given the predisposition of the New South Wales Government to sell any piece of public land that it can get away with, I am inclined to the view that it was an attempt to justify subdivision and sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed Solitary Islands Marine National Park off the coast has been the subject of controversy for some time. The idea of the marine park is more than 20 years old and dates back to 1969. The conservation proposal for the area was downgraded from the original aim of a national park to an aquatic reserve as a result of ministerial and interdepartmental wrangling within the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The marine national park concept appears to have been derailed by the efforts of Public Works Minister, Mr Wal Murray, the Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Ian Causley and the Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Neil Pickard. Should I even bother to mention that the mostly ineffective and politically inept Mr Moore, the New South Wales Minister for Environment, has lost yet another round with the National Party Ministers who really run New South Wales?</PARA>
<PARA> An aquatic reserve would be controlled by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs under the Fisheries Act. I hesitate to say that this authority would immediately clear the way for an effluent outfall from Look-At-Me-Now Headland. But I must observe that the Minister responsible for administering fisheries, the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Mr Ian Armstrong-from the National Party-apparently cares so little about the Department's responsibilities that he is forcing the whole organisation to move from Sydney to a site at Orange, some 300 kilometres inland, which is not even on a river. </PARA>
<PARA> Offshore mining interests are another factor in deciding whether or not the area will be declared a marine national park or an aquatic reserve. While there has been no final decision on mining, a number of exploration licences have been granted. Mining would be unlikely in a marine park because of the restrictions that apply to the approval of mining leases under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, whereas an aquatic reserve established under the Fisheries Act would, on the other hand, offer little resistance to mining. </PARA>
<PARA> The controversy over Coffs Harbour's ocean outfall continues to simmer. My most recent information is that the council has been persuaded to adopt the time-honoured political strategy of giving the matter to a committee to examine and to make recommendations. In this case, the issue is in the capable hands of the effluent committee, as it is called. One can only hope that the name of this committee, which is dominated by the State bureaucracy, is not indicative of the quality of the recommendations likely to flow out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may be wondering about the relevance of this account of provincial affairs to the nation's Parliament. It is this: the matters which I have raised concern, in most cases directly, management of the environment in a part of Australia's territory which is properly the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The ocean off Coffs Harbour is part of the coastal sea, for which the Commonwealth has responsibility under international law and the Australian Constitution. It is significant that none of the many actors mentioned in this account include a representative of the Commonwealth. Issues such as the Coffs Harbour ocean outfall arise in many other parts of the country, yet the government with direct responsibility for the territory and resources most affected is hardly ever involved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time for the Commonwealth to take seriously its responsibilities for managing the environment of this country. There is an obvious need for national standards to be established and enforced to protect coastal waters and their resources. It is no longer good enough for the Commonwealth to look on disinterestedly while the various State governments and numerous local authorities, all with different ideas and interests, struggle to find solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is managing its environment with about as much unity and cohesion as was shown by the German principalities and Italian republics in the conduct of their collective interests in the nineteeth century. Regrettably, I do not see in the Government a Bismarck or a Garibaldi of the environment who can bring us together. </PARA>
