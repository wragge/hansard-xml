<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987/88 the Federal Government paid $6.4 million from taxpayers funds for 61,879 abortions under Medicare Items 6469 and 274/275 alone.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Federal Government grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australia Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies and abolish Government funding of abortion.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows that the 1990-91 Budget of the Australian Government announced on 21st August 1990 will be detrimental to the health and well being of pensioners in that the proposal that the continued receipt of the aged pension is dependent on the production of a TAX FILE NUMBER is a harsh and unconscionable measure that will cause great hardship and distress.</PARA>

<PARA> That the following matters be referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts for inquiry and report by 15 May 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the cost to the Commonwealth, amounting to more than $1m, of the actions of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Australian Customs Service in fulfilling their administrative responsibilities in the handling of the failed prosecution of Midford Paramount Pty Ltd;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the methods of operation of the Australian Customs Service in preparation and conduct of prosecutions and settlements and, in particular, their actions throughout the preparation, prosecution and settlement of the Midford Paramount Pty Ltd case, including the reasons for the Director of Public Prosecutions' discontinuance of the prosecution;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the practice, propriety and method of the Australian Customs Service of gathering evidence for prosecutions and dealing with the public in the course of such investigations;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the actions of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and successive Ministers responsible for Customs in addressing the propriety of administrative actions within the Industry, Technology and Commerce portfolio and the Australian Customs Service, in particular; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) need for effective definition of the lines of ministerial control of the Australian Customs Service and, in particular, the actions of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in oversighting successive Ministers responsible for Customs in relation to the operations of the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have read out paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) in amending the motion, I seek to reiterate paragraphs (b) and (c) so that we can address those in this debate. Paragraph (b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>the methods of operation of the Australian Customs Service in preparation and conduct of prosecutions and settlements and, in particular, their actions throughout the preparation, prosecution and settlement of the Midford Paramount Pty Ltd case, including the reasons for the Director of Public Prosecutions' discontinuance of the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (c) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>the practice, propriety and method of the Australian Customs Service of gathering evidence for prosecutions and dealing with the public in the course of such investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter became of particular concern to those of us who were attending the Estimates Committee, and those members of the general public who have subsequently read Hansard and shared the concern that was raised by the Committee. It was established in the Estimates Committee that the case of Midford Paramount, which had been investigated by the Customs Service and prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), failed because the prosecution relied upon the statement of one Dr Fitzpatrick, an officer of DITAC, who made a statement that the conditions attached to the quota that had been granted to Midford Paramount had, indeed, been breached. Magistrate Falzon, in his summation, discredited the evidence of Dr Fitzpatrick totally, saying that an air of cover-up permeated the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is of considerable concern as the amount of money involved in terms of cost to the Commonwealth in investigation and prosecution, and in terms of damage suffered by the company against which the action was taken, and subsequent settlements being a cost both to the company and to the Commonwealth, need never have arisen if DITAC had carried out its duty in a proper manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fitzpatrick, when asked during his evidence to the Estimates Committee whether he had searched personally, or had asked that any of his officers search personally, for the original documents sourcing the quota, answered that he had not. Yet in evidence, in his sworn statement, he cited this as being one of a series of similar cases and then had to admit in cross-examination that there was, indeed, no precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other reasons why it is important that this matter be thoroughly investigated is that during the entire Estimates hearings the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said he had no knowledge of this case at all until he read about it in an article written by Bruce Jones in the Sun-Herald dated 7 October 1990. This is despite the fact that during the action the defence subpoenaed Cabinet documents from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet actually attended at the court and objected to the release of those documents; and the magistrate refused to accept that submission and, indeed, published those documents to counsel. This is also despite the fact that the Malaysian Government-and this was reported in Australian newspapers-contemplated taking extradition proceedings against two officers of the Customs Service, namely, officers O'Shaunnessy and Robinson. This is despite the fact that, in answering some of the material on the record the Minister said that, despite these things, he knew nothing of this case until 7 October. Quite frankly, I find that is either unbelievable or, if it is so, it is totally negligent. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is particularly serious as the Law Council of Australia has indicated that the behaviour of the Customs Service in many ways is Elliot Ness-like. I have had subsequent correspondence from Mr David Vos of Coopers and Lybrand enclosing copies of correspondence from Mr Kelly to Mr Vos, where Mr Vos was query- ing the ruling of the Customs Service that, indeed, no person who is not a qualified lawyer may act for a company subject to investigation. In this particular piece of correspondence to Mr Vos, Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA>The ACS is a government agency with a total investigative arm that takes matters through to the court processes. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement in the letter dated May 1989 is totally at variance with the evidence that Mr Kelly gave to Estimates that, somehow, it was all the responsibility of the DPP and he really did not know anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if one takes a good look at the record in Hansard, which shows that we took so long to get answers to what would have otherwise have been regarded as fairly simple questions, one sees that Mr Kelly told the Committee on a total of 34 occasions that he did not know the answers to questions that had been asked, including the words, `I do not know' on nine separate occasions. He neglected to bring to the Estimates Committee hearings his records on the issue and on no fewer than 17 occasions told the Committee that his record would have given him the answers had he had it. He suffered from an acute loss of memory. Yet Mr Kelly told us that he respected the position of the Committee to ask questions on a host of issues relating to the Australian Customs Service, and said that is why he was there. He indicated that he had prepared himself to answer questions in the Committee but the evidence in Hansard will show, quite frankly, that, on several occasions, he deliberately did not know the answers where the matter was being dealt with by the Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It became particularly concerning when, in the subsequent debate on a matter of public importance, I tabled three affidavits. One of those affidavits dealt with the question of just when those Customs officers were in Malaysia. An affidavit sworn by an officer of the DPP said that the officers had left Malaysia on 15 September. Subsequently, the affidavit that I tabled showed that as late as 2.30 in the afternoon on 16 September the officers concerned were still not only in Malaysia but also were seeking to seize further documents-in the words of the Customs Service, to `get them in a voluntary manner'. But, in fact, this included threatening or coercing people in that household to hand over documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to that, I have received another affidavit from Malaysia sworn by a manager of the hotel where the Customs officers were staying. He was asked to give a copy of the order which had been gained from the High Court of Malaysia at the institution of Midford Paramount itself, not by the Government as the earlier reports had indicated. The order was given to those Customs officers who then, in the words of the person swearing the affidavit, left the hotel in a hurry on the evening of 16 September despite the fact that they were still booked in and were to remain there until 18 September. In a written answer the Customs Service subsequently supplied information to the Estimates Committee that the officers left Malaysia only after they had completed their investigations. It is indeed a sorry tale. </PARA>
<PARA> Going to the terms of reference, one of the other important matters to investigate is the manner in which settlement was effected. There are reports that the $800,000 compensation that Mr Strang told us had been paid by way of compensation had not been paid. The evidence seems to be-and this needs to be investigated and substantiated-that the Customs Service said it would forgo another 1,300 prosecutions in terms of settling this issue. There was a withdrawal of an authorisation by the Comptroller-General of Customs to sell the shirts which had been seized in small parcels the day before the auction. Indeed, the shirts were sold to the person against whom the action had been taken as part of a settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> This may well be a proper settlement but I think it is important that the nature and the way in which the settlement was conducted is looked at. I understand that the personal private secretary of Mr Beddall, the Minister for Small Business and Customs, could well have been involved in the negotiation of the settlement. The Minister still tells us that he had heard nothing of this case until 7 October 1990 when he read about it in the Sun-Herald. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth term of reference set out in the amended notice of motion, states:</PARA>
<PARA>the need for effective definition of the lines of Ministerial control of the Australian Customs Service and, in particular, the actions of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in oversighting successive Ministers responsible for Customs in relation to the operations of the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA>One further thing that worries me generally about the attitude of the Australian Customs Service is whether it considers it is governed by the law like the rest of us or whether it is above the law. A very worrying letter was written by one Mr Bissaker, who conveniently went overseas on the day of the Estimates hearing. It is not the first time that Mr Bissaker has been unable to attend at Estimates hearings. </PARA>

It was just convenient, I guess, for the Government that Estimates Committee A was dealt with at the end. When I asked for it to be brought on early, the Government subsequently declined to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the point about whether Customs considers itself to be bound by the law or to be above the law. Mr Bissaker, the man who actually released the shirts in the settlement deal because the Comptroller declined to do so, wrote to the Deputy Ombudsman on 12 April 1990. In his letter he dealt with Mr Macdessi's complaints arising from the way in which the conduct of the case was carried out and also with the comments of Magistrate Falzon on 8 February. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Macdessi's complaint stems from the summation by Magistrate Paul Falzon on 8 February 1990 at the conclusion of the committal costs hearing between the DPP and Midford. The substance of the Magistrate's summation questions the bona fides of the ACS in proposing prosecution of Midford and the bona fides of the witnesses used to support the prosecution's case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Magistrate's summation has been studied carefully. It is his opinion. The ACS does not share his view and in fact strongly disagrees with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Bishop's remarks about the contempt with which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has treated this matter. In particular, I was concerned about the contempt with which the Minister treated the matter when it was raised at a meeting of Estimates Committee A. I am sure that we will hear from Senator Button later about how long it took for this matter to be discussed in Estimates Committee A on 12 October. Indeed, it did take a long time for the matter to be discussed in Estimates Committee A on 12 October. It took us many hours to discuss the matter because of the deliberately evasive attitude taken by both departmental officers and by the Minister himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perusal of the Hansard will show that we spent some time trying to find the answers to the questions which Senator Bishop raised with regard to the investigation of the Midford Paramount Pty Ltd matter. Yet, we were stonewalled all the way by the Minister. The Minister did not want a departmental officer who was sitting in the audience to sit at the table. That departmental officer was later to be revealed to be a Mr Strang. I understand that he was the No. 2 man in the Customs Service in New South Wales-a man who knew intimately the details relating to the Midford Paramount case; yet, a man whom the Minister did not want answering questions at the table because of the embarrassment it would cause for his Department and the Government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Button knows, it is true that I do a lot of bobsleighing but I probably would not go downhill as fast as he is at the moment. It can be seen from reading the Hansard of Estimates Committee A of 12 October that Mr Strang was sitting directly behind Senator Button and was shaking and nodding his head vigorously. Senator Bishop wanted to put a number of questions to Mr Strang but Senator Button tried to prevent her from doing so. Senator Bishop asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Minister, who is the gentleman sitting behind you with the pencil between his fingers?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator, that is not a matter which relates to the estimates of my portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>We went on further. Senator Bishop asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the gentleman sitting behind you mysterious? Do we know who he is?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button replied rather smugly:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know, Senator. I am looking at you, I am not looking behind me. I do not have eyes in the back of my head. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Senator Button did not want Mr Strang to come to the table; clearly Senator Button was trying to hide the identity of this gentleman; and it was not until we got another eight pages down the track that we actually found out that he was Mr Strang. This matter may have caused a certain degree of humour for Senator Button; it may have titillated his small mind, while we were trying to deal with the weighty matters of how his Department was being run. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button cannot come into this chamber and accuse those of us who are on Estimates Committee A of wasting committee time because the man who was most responsible for wasting the Committee's time on that particular day was Senator Button. If Mr Strang had been allowed to come to the table to answer the questions that Senator Bishop had put to him, we could have got through the matter much more quickly. Yet now, when we want to refer the matter to the Public Accounts Committee, I think we are going to see that the Minister will oppose the reference to the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to see yet another attempt by Senator Button to hide all the problems that have arisen with this case, hide all of the irresponsibility that his Department has shown, hide all of the ineptitude and all of the incompetence, to save himself political embarrassment, to save himself the embarrassment of having these facts raised in public. It was clearly a matter of concern and embarrassment to him on 12 October. It is clearly a matter of embarrassment and concern to him today because he refused leave to Senator Bishop to have the motion taken as formal, and therefore we had to suspend Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, Senator Button has a vested interest in ensuring that this matter of grave public accountability is not referred to the Public Accounts Committee, that there is no further scrutiny, that there is no further analysis of the waste of taxpayers' money litigating a matter that should never have gone to court. Senator Button does not want us to look into all of the apparent deceptions that occurred before Estimates Committee A, he does not want us to look into why departmental officers gave evidence that seems to be so blatantly contradicted by other evidence that Senator Bishop has so ably been able to put together, evidence coming from as far afield as Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not had any explanation, nor does Senator Button want to give us an explanation, of why departmental officers appear to have left in great haste from Malaysia. He does not seem to want us to analyse why possibly the Malaysian Government or possibly Midford Paramount itself took out an injunction to prevent Australian Customs officers from returning to Australia with certain documents relating to this matter. These are all the matters that Senator Button wants to hide, these are all the matters that Senator Button wants locked away forever in the dark, dim corridors of the Public Service departments, these are all the matters that Senator Button wants never to see the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves: why does Senator Button want to hide from the truth? Why did Senator Button want to prevent Mr Strang from giving evidence at Estimates Committee A? Why does Senator Button want right now for this matter to go away? Why does he not want full and frank accountability of all the actions of his Department? The answer is very simple: Senator Button's Department, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, has acted irresponsibly or negligently or deceitfully, and he, as the Minister heading that Department, is ultimately responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason why Senator Button does not want these matters to come to the light of day. That is why Senator Button wants to hide behind every possible bushel he can. Senator Button does not have a very bright light anyway. These are the things that Senator Button wants hidden from the Parliament, from the public and from the people. For these reasons, I support wholeheartedly the motion that is being moved by Senator Bishop today. </PARA>

In view of the fact that Senator Bishop has quite clearly made her position known and has, in my mind, prejudged the issue to a large extent, I believe and the Democrats believe that this is a fair thing to support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Senator Bishop has raised a number of serious matters in relation to the Australian Customs Service. Earlier the honourable senator afforded me the courtesy of referring these matters concerning the terms of reference to me as the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The matters have been canvassed in a number of forums, including the Senate Estimates Committee. Unfortunately, at that Senate Estimates Committee there were a number of unsatisfactory features, particularly the nature of the answers to justifiable questions from honourable senators. For that reason alone I should have thought there would have been a need for some forum to provide a mechanism for a fuller and more detailed inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, there also appears to be sufficient evidence from court proceedings that the prosecution was grossly mismanaged. In addition, we have been given the opportunity of hearing of affidavits which have been forthcoming which could well add further facts, warranting some form of investigation. I will quote from a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration from a Mr Spanswick, who I understand was former head of the Customs Officers Association. He made the comment that there was a need for a full-scale inquiry into the effectiveness and efficiency of Customs. He believed that a royal commission could properly look at those sorts of issues. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of those inquiries, in my view, we would have some accountability and some new administration of the Service. Again in my view, it would be more appropriate to the needs and requirements of the legislation's administration.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which comprises members of both Houses and of both Government and Opposition, is the appropriate vehicle to pursue this issue in a calm and impartial way. That Committee seeks to ensure efficiency and appropriate stewardship in the discharge of the work of all government departments and utilities on the Australian scene. I support the Senate's reference to that Committee. </PARA>

It is no good coming in here with her student law moot rhetoric, making further unsubstantiated allegations in the course of this matter. I accept that some of these matters could be referred to the Public Accounts Committee. I do not mind that; I am not afraid of any inquiry. I move the following amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, and that Senator Bishop not participate in any hearing of the Committee on the subject matter of this reference.''</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not accepted, the credibility of the Public Accounts Committee must be in question. Senator Bishop sought to amend her motion at the last moment, which we can see if we look at the first draft. I ask the Liberals, the people who are concerned about proprietary and civil liberties, to look at the first draft of Senator Bishop's motion, her private indulgence. Let us look at the quality of that private indulgence and at the wording of her original motion. It condemns people out of hand before the matter has been referred to inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee. She woke up to that at the last moment and went back to her legal textbook, perhaps, or got some advice from one of her advisers. She went back to some semblance of propriety in this matter and sought to change it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the changes Senator Bishop made was, instead of accusing me of failure, to refer to my actions. Well, I am delighted with that because all through the Estimates Committee hearings she was accusing me of inaction. It is a delightful change to have that. If we look at the wording of the original motion, we see right through it in every clause suggestions which prejudge the Australian Customs Service. She seeks to be judge and jury in her own cause-and it is her cause, nobody else's. It is her cause following other causes which she has had in this place. This is now her thing, her launching pad into political success, from the back bench to the front bench, she thinks. Well, I am sorry to disabuse Senator Bishop about that, but if it is her cause, and it is, she cannot sit in judgment on it. That is what she seeks to do by referring this matter to the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make a few other points. There were 60 hours of hearings on this matter in the Estimates Committee. The Senate, the chamber to which we all belong-and to which all the Liberal senators opposite belong-had the opportunity to debate all this last week. Not one of them did so.

<PARA> Senator Bishop seeks a further inquiry into the Customs Service. I cannot resist inquiries into the Customs Service, if that is what people want. I think the Customs Service is a fine service, but it will make mistakes.

I would remind the Senate that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is already conducting an inquiry into Customs.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right. Let me just recapitulate, first, about the processes of the Senate. We have had an Estimates committee which went for 60 hours, many of those hours on this issue. Estimates committees report to the Senate. When they reported to the Senate, Senator Bishop was not here. Senator O'Chee was here-the silent Senator O'Chee: still the silent night Senator O'Chee-when the Estimates committees were here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats also said nothing on this particular issue. I set aside a day, anticipating a lot of discussion in the Committee of the Whole. Nothing happened. The matter is now raised today in the context of seeking an inquiry into the Customs Service. There is already one going at public expense. The Liberals, presumably, support this private indulgence of having a second inquiry going at public expense, and I tell those opposite: you will hear about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate on 8 November-the day on which we might have heard all of this stuff from Liberal senators, if they were interested or concerned-Senator Childs, at page 3730 of the Hansard and thereafter, dealt with some of these issues, and about the wildness and the unsubstantiated nature of the allegations made in the course of the Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as Senator Bishop's motion is concerned, I just repeat that it prejudges every issue which could go before the Public Accounts Committee. She tried to change it this morning. It still prejudges every issue which should properly go before the Public Accounts Committee. I happen to be an old-fashioned lawyer who believes that people should not be judge and jury in their own cause. </PARA>

Senator Bishop would say that, but she is not big enough to do so. That is the problem and that is why I moved the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop is just not big enough to say that, because what she is seeking from this is publicity, limelight, a launching pad-all that sort of stuff. If Senator Bishop understood the principles she pretends to espouse, she would have nothing to do with the Public Accounts Committee inquiry. Having said that, I do not resist the inquiry at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly in this debate because there are matters which I think should be put on the record and which certainly cause me and those on my side of the chamber great concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Button has indulged in a familiar parliamentary tactic of attempting to turn a serious matter into a joke. It is not a joke. On the face of it, the reference to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is for an inquiry and report into the cost to the Commonwealth, amounting to more than $1m, of the actions of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Australian Customs Service in fulfilling their administrative responsibilities in the handling of a particular failed prosecution. I can think of no more appropriate body within this Parliament to investigate allegations of this type than the Public Accounts Committee. In fact, that seems to me to be the proper course of action that should be adopted. The fact that a considerable amount of time was taken on the same issue in the Estimates Committee seems to me to be irrelevant. The Estimates Committee has a particular function and particular types of witness before it, that is, principally the Minister and those public servants to whom the Minister wishes to refer. An investigation into a matter like this may well require the calling of particular witnesses and may well require the powers given to the Public Accounts Committee under its legislation to get to the bottom of these allegations to ensure that the eventual findings are well based on fact. The Public Accounts Committee has been set up as the appropriate mechanism for dealing with these matters. It has a good record and a good standing, and its independence is unchallenged. Therefore I do not understand at all the objection of the Government to the reference itself. </PARA>
<PARA> That really was not the reason I wanted to speak. I wanted to speak about the amendment of Senator Button which seeks to exclude a particular senator from participating in the inquiry, that is, a senator who was appointed by this House as its representative and in this instance as a representative of the Opposition upon this committee. The advice I have received is that the exercise we are going through is unprecedented and, although it may be within the powers of the chamber, when one has the numbers, one can do anything. That does not mean it is right but when the Government has the numbers--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, yes. Let us project this matter one step further into a situation where one party has the majority in this chamber. Anyone would think it would be highly inappropriate if that one party started to dictate to the other side of the chamber which senators it was prepared to have on particular inquiries and which it was not. That is what is being proposed to the Senate today. Everyone comes into this place with certain bias. If one did not have bias, one would not be here and would not be participating within a particular party. I can think of so many occasions when it may be argued that senators have raised a matter of public interest or has sought an inquiry into a particular matter because it was one of their interests. It might be their speciality or area of expertise or it may be they have had a long involvement in that area. There is nothing unusual in that at all. But to prejudge that that person will prejudiced in the outcome of the inquiry seems to me to be totally inappropriate. There is no basis on which it can be done fairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee has operated independently, it has its own internal discipline and it determines who participates in particular inquiries. Rather than allow it to do that in this instance, the Government has joined with the Australian Democrats and has taken this highly undesirable step of voting to exclude a particular senator from participation in the inquiry. I voice a protest in opposition to what is occurring today. I believe it creates a bad precedent for this chamber and one which is capable of being used again in the future in undesirable ways. That will occur because the Government has the numbers, but I regret that Senator Button, who has clearly allowed Senator Bishop to get under his skin in this matter, is now acting in a way which will create an undesirable precedent that will last for a long time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Hill has raised this very important issue because I was going to raise it myself and speak to the amendment moved by Senator Button. Following Senator Button's speech through to its logical conclusion, one finds that it was all about reasons for voting against the referral. He did not advance any principled argument in support of the amendment that would exclude one member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts from sitting on that committee for the purposes of this reference. As Senator Hill said, this is unprecedented. Mr Deputy President, I think it is 15 years ago either today or tomorrow since you and I were elected to this place. In that time I have not heard even a suggestion that an individual senator should be excluded from a parliamentary committee. I recall a number of issues which were raised and I will raise one of them here for the purposes of consideration by Senator Button and the Opposition because I believe that what he is doing will create a precedent. I do not know whose suggestion it was. If it was suggested by the Australian Democrats, they ought to think about it, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If another government comes to power after the next election, we may find that this precedent may be followed then. What happened, for example, when the Viner industrial legislation came forward to this chamber in 1981? A Senate Select Committee was established to inquire into that legislation. I was appointed the chairman of that industrial legislation committee. Clearly I had a view of the trade union movement which had been ingrained in me over many years. I was actively involved in the trade union movement. There was no suggestion that I should be excluded from being a member of that Select Committee. On the contrary, I was eventually appointed chairman of that committee and Senator Button was a member of it, as were a number of other senators. In the event of this occurring again, as it most likely will occur, would the then Government, if it were a conservative Government, using this precedent say that Harradine should not be on that committee or that somebody else should not be on it? I think we would be establishing a precedent and I appeal to Senator Button to reconsider that. If his arguments are strong enough in respect of the matter not going before the committee, then he can vote against the reference to the committee entirely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-It is with some sense of disappointment that I rise to speak to the debate that has ensued since my moving the motion. I notice that Senator Button appears to have left the chamber. Senator Button, instead of addressing any of the issues of substance, attempted to turn this from a debate on serious matters to a debate of some frivolity-this has become a technique which we are well used to in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give an example of how this practice is not unusual but something with which we perpetually live. The sort of flippancy that we have just heard-and, indeed, Senator Button, who one could call the Minister for sound and fury, adopted his own private indulgences as distinct from what he alleged were mine in dealing with a matter of substance-is recorded in the Hansard of 12 October 1990, commencing at page 636. I asked a question about Mr Strang, the man who Senator Button, for a long time, refused to even turn around and look at so that we could identify who he was. He became the mystery man. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Did Mr Strang know about the request for the return of documents from the Malaysian Government?</PARA>
<PARA>At that stage we were going through the farce of Senator Button not allowing Mr Strang to come to the table and answer in his own right. He was insisting that he take the information from Mr Strang and that he would then answer on his behalf. Senator Button then answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me turn to page 647. If we are in the business of timing things we can estimate that each one of these pages covers five minutes of evidence. So it took us one hour and 10 minutes to get an answer to this question that I asked Mr Strang:</PARA>
<PARA>When did you first become aware of the fact that they had the documents?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Strang replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I was in Malaysia at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the sort of obstruction, evasion and contempt that went on during the entire 58, 60 or 64 hours-depending on how one likes to add it up; we have had three different versions from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The long and the short of it is that anybody who chooses to read the record can find example upon example of how it took an hour and 10 minutes to reach the true answer as distinct from the initial answer which one could be uncharitable enough to say misled the Committee. When I say that I would have liked Senator Button to deal with the substantial issues, instead of giving sarcastic side references-as is his norm-I think I can be pardoned for feeling some anger. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I could also be flattered. I could be flattered by Senator Button's attempt to exclude me from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts hearings. I could be flattered by the way in which the Estimates A Committee report was dealt with. For some curious reason, it was determined that the report of Estimates Committee A would not be dealt with before the reports of Estimates Committees B, C, D and F, but, in fact, contrary to the alphabet, would come at the end. I did ask, because I found this curious, that we challenge that arrangement. I subsequently asked, after we had commenced our consideration of the report of Estimates Committee B, that the Estimates Committee A report be brought on before Estimates Committee C report. I was told that, yes, we could do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, and advised him that I had to go to China as part of a trade mission-a trade mission which was attempting to salvage our precarious wool trade, among other things, on the Chinese market; a fairly important issue. Immediately after I wrote the letter to Senator Bolkus advising him of the dates that I would be away, guess what?-the Government said that it would not bring the report of Estimates Committee A up the list; it would stay at the bottom. My private information yesterday was that everybody thought that they were off the hook. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I could be flattered. As a member of the Opposition, I am outnumbered on all occasions by members of Government who sit on the Public Accounts Committee. I might say that they carry out their duties with great honour and distinction. I would not want, for one moment, to reflect upon the integrity of the way that members of that Committee carry out their responsibilities. All of us share the attitude that the interests of the Parliament and the people must be served first and foremost, as indeed we stated categorically in our report The Auditor-General: ally of the people and Parliament. I suppose I could be very flattered that Senator Button felt that I should be denied the opportunity to ask questions. I am very glad that he did not reflect on the Committee or the work that it carries out. </PARA>
<PARA> I also add that in the reservation to the report of Estimates Committee A we foreshadowed that we would be moving to refer this matter to the Public Accounts Committee. I do not know whether the Government thought, and Senator Button thought in particular, that by my not being here when the matter was dealt with in the committee stage of the Appropriation Bills somehow we would not be moving that foreshadowed motion. I cannot see inside his mind. But I do know that Senator Button refused in this Parliament today to deal with any matter of substance at all. Instead of saying, `I am concerned about this issue or that issue and I have an answer here or an answer there', he simply made a personality slur. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, his only reference to this matter was a speech made by Senator Childs in the early part of November in which Senator Childs made the quite remarkable statement that we had the choice of believing Australian Customs Service officers or people in another country. I subsequently asked a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, about the implication that somehow the word of an Australian Customs officer was better than that of a Malaysian who had sworn an affidavit. Senator Evans had the good grace to say, no, he did not agree with that implication. </PARA>
<PARA> By referring this matter to the Public Accounts Committee for further investigation-and I might say that as a member of that Committee, I go into this investigation looking for answers and not looking, in any way, for anything else-perhaps we will find the truth and perhaps the taxpayer, in the end, will find out why at least $1m of investigation money was wasted and why certain methods of investigation were pursued. In the final analysis, we may be able to repair the damage that has been done to our relationship with the Malaysian Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter being discussed when the consideration of the Committee was suspended the other evening was an Opposition amendment in relation to the disclosure of statistical information. If that statistical information was of a sufficient degree of specificity, the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical benefits could be identified through those statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that at the point of the suspension I was asking Senator Tate what reason the Government had for introducing this amending clause, because we were not persuaded one way or the other and we sought some assurance as to the reasons for its introduction. We reported progress, which was fortunate, because there seemed to be some confusion as to why the amendment was being introduced. Since the other evening I have had occasion to speak to Dr David Henry of Newcastle, who provided a very precise example as to why the particular clause should be inserted in the legislation and, therefore, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr David Henry is a pharmacologist who has done a considerable amount of work in comparing the prescription rates of particular drugs which could be used for the same purpose. The example he gave to me was of two drugs, clofibrate and cholestyramine, both of which are used for the reduction of blood cholesterol. Dr Henry had observed that the drug clofibrate had increased in its rate of prescription very considerably, and that the drug clofibrate was the one of the two against which considerable queries had arisen regarding its safety. </PARA>
<PARA> He wished to publish those statistics which had come to him via quite legitimate sources as a member of a committee which looks at these things. But at that stage he was prevented from publishing this information for the benefit of general practitioners and others who may, through that publication, be steered towards prescribing what he and many others perceive to be the less dangerous alternative; namely, cholestyramine. He went on to describe to me a number of examples of situations such as this where, through his membership of the committee, he had become aware of situations in which it was important that precise statistical information be given to general practitioners, and that he would have been prevented from publishing that information if that information was sufficiently precise to have led to the identification of the manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> He also went on to point out to me that the manufacturers have access to pretty good information already through their own sources and that this really goes one step further. So although the objection by the pharmaceutical manufacturers to this clause might have some very slight merit, the merits are not particularly great. On the other hand are the dangers in relation to the prescribing of one drug when another may serve as well or better and may be associated with lessened adverse consequences. The advantages of including this clause far outweigh the disadvantages and, accordingly, the Democrats will be supporting the Government's move to include this clause in its amending Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Australian Democrats have come to that conclusion. I must say that I have a better understanding of the issues now than I did when the matter was first raised in the chamber. I think Senator Coulter is quite correct to point to the fact that, indeed, we can expect that drug companies already have a reasonable idea of the market shares anyway. They have their own information sources from wholesalers and market supply surveys. I understand that a privately owned group, International Medical Statistics, provides a comprehensive collection of retail sales data including pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) data. So that sort of data is around in the manufacturers' own private boardrooms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is to make the information available to the community and to parliamentarians who, after all, have to devote taxpayers' money to support the PBS. I think, as it has been pointed out, accountability to the Parliament and the public for PBS expenditure is a matter which is of major concern. That is the priority. It is quite clear that we need to have some publication of the data that is sought to be published in order to get a proper indication of the way in which particular pharmaceuticals are being made available, perhaps in a way which is leading to overuse. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been put to me, for example, that some government decisions will not be able to be explained without this sort of data. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recently placed a drug on authority because it believed that usage figures showed it was being used inappropriately. As the law stands, those figures cannot be released. I think that is an important matter. Quite often senators and members are concerned about drugs going on authority and so on. If there is a very good reason, or a reason that has been indicated by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which is a most expert committee, then we as members of Parliament would want to know. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this sort of publication of data is also a very useful way in which to educate members of the medical profession about the way in which certain drugs are being used in the community. This cannot always be done by government directives and so on, but the publication of such data into the professional journals is also a very important way by which the medical profession can be informed and that peer pressure which is so important can be exercised in a very beneficial way in order to influence and determine the professional standards in relation to the prescribing of drugs. I believe that publication of this sort of material in medical journals and papers given at seminars can be of great assistance there. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I might mention that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has written to various members of this chamber-I think principally Senator Patterson, Senator Coulter and me being involved in this debate-in relation to this provision of the National Health Act indicating not only its very strong support for the provision, but also its advocacy for it, its request for it and its plea for it, which led to the Minister making this particular provision. I believe that we should respond to the concern expressed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in this way to correct the current anomaly. I am pleased with the support that has been indicated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 29, page 17. proposed section 99Q, lines 1 to 5, omit the section. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is to remove clause 99q (1) and (2) on page 17 of the Bill. This clause relates to the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority and would put a limit on the membership of the Authority to people under the age of 65. We had a similar debate in this chamber on the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill when Senator Michael Baume put forward a similar amendment to take away the discrimination against people over 65. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may express a concern that eliminating a clause such as this would take away the opportunity of having younger people on the Authority. Because of my interests in youth and aged affairs, I feel some sort of pull between the two ends of the age spectrum. In many ways it would be advantageous to have someone over the age of 65 on these bodies who has the wisdom, experience and knowledge in a particular area, particularly historical knowledge of pharmacy and maybe also overseas knowledge of how pharmacy works. In some ways I see failure to employ such people as denying such a group the advice of people with wisdom. We see many people working over the age of 65. A perfect example is in the universities of chancellors in their seventies. We see judges over 65 making major contributions. </PARA>

It has not been reviewed, and we are still waiting. I am particularly interested in the aged and older people. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said what he seems to think about older people in his comments to pensioners in the streets of Adelaide. He will never live that down and he will wish that he had never said it. This is the sort of thing that denies the Australian people the expertise of older people in our community. It is ridiculous to think that somebody over 65 is not capable of making a major and significant contribution to a number of authorities, such as the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put on record that it is the policy of the coalition to abolish the compulsory retirement age, and that flows through to a set age limit for people on bodies such as this Authority. I therefore ask the Minister and the Australian Democrats to reconsider this matter. If the argument comes up again that these people are not covered by insurance, I ask the Government to do something about it. Why has the Government not done something about it? Does it really believe that people over the age of 65 do not have a contribution to make? If the Government believes that, it would behove it to write to the judges, the chancellors of our univer- sities, and all those people over the age of 65 making a significant contribution in our community and tell them what it thinks. It should tell them that their contribution is not worth the effort they put into it. The Minister might sit and smile. One day he will be over 65. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not quite expect that response from the Government, but I am very pleased to note it. I just want to put on the record, because this matter has come up on previous occasions, as Senator Patterson has indicated, that the Australian Democrats support the philosophy which is guiding the Opposition. We hold exactly the same views. I believe that the Government is also moving to accept that, just as we have attempted to remove racism from our society, we are attempting to remove sexism, and so we should also move to remove ageism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dare I say it: I agree with Senator Crichton-Browne's interjection that people should be judged on their merit and not on their age. Indeed, the Minister will see that proposed new section 99W of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 before us states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may terminate the appointment of a member for misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision is already there for people of any age. In relation to age, for instance, there is a form of Alzheimer's disease which presents at quite a young age-people in their 30s and 40s can suffer from that disease. Clearly, those people would be incompetent to serve on such a committee. Equally, one has the shining example of somebody like J.K. Galbraith, about whom there is a long review in this morning's Age, a man of 82 who says some very insightful things about the way in which the Left in American politics has moved towards the Right and voters in America have nowhere to go. As I read that article, I was reminded that he is so insightful that he could well have said exactly the same things about Australia. Heaven help us if we would deny a person of his eminence the ability to make those sorts of statements at a time like this. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the principle which has been enunciated by Senator Patterson. We hope that the Government will move to accept the amendment not just on this occasion, but will go through legislation wherever compulsory things are set down against a particular age-such as retirement, serving on committees and so on-and amend the legislation covering workers compensation so that, in the event that somebody over the age of 65 is appointed or somebody appointed before the age of 65 passes the age of 65 while in that appointment, he or she will, nonetheless, be covered. We urge the Government, which-as Senator Patterson has indicated-we thought was bringing forward legislation this session to deal with this matter, to get on with that task and bring it forward as rapidly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only reflect, in closing, that perhaps the Government was prepared to accept this amendment on this occasion with some alacrity because proposed new section 99Z says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this Division ceases to have effect at the end of 31 March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of this particular authority, it will exist for only five years. We join the Opposition in supporting the principle, and urge the Government to move as rapidly as possible to remove age as a criterion for appointment to a range of committees, authorities and the like which are currently restricted to those below the age of 65. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I am just amazed. I am delighted that the Government is supporting its own legislation at last. As the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) knows only too well, on 21 December 1989 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regulations put down by his Government indicated as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For the purposes of subparagraph (b) (ii) of the definition of ``discrimination'' in subsection 3 (1) of the Act, any distinction, exclusion or preference made:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) on the ground of:</PARA>

<PARA> The hypocrisy of the Government passing that legislation, with all the trumpeting that occasioned that regulation, is indescribable to me when, subsequently, it puts in its legislation that it will discriminate against members of this Pharmacy Restructuring Authority in that they cannot be over 65. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition moved an amendment in an attempt to make the Government abide by its own regulations, the Government in the other place refused to do so, assuring us that it was all too difficult to abide by its own regulations, that for some reason superannuation was a great problem, et cetera. Now we have already passed other legislation through this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that the Australian Democrats told us that they would not support our amendment today. Now that the Government has given in and said, `Of course we will', the Democrats have piously said that, of course, they agreed with us all along. I have never heard of such hypocrisy. It was all too difficult a couple of hours ago. The Government found it too difficult to abide by its own regulations. I am amazed by the Government. It was too difficult to abide by its own regulations. The Democrats found it too difficult not to support the Government. Suddenly, it is all sweetness and light: the Government no longer finds it too difficult to abide by its own regulations and, because, of course, the Government has decided to support us, the Democrats come to heel and say, `Well, naturally we have always agreed with you anyway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly to explain to Senator Walters that our position in relation to age discrimination was made quite clear when we were debating this some weeks ago. On that occasion we made it absolutely clear that we are supporting the same principle that the Opposition is supporting. The reason why we did not support the particular amendment then was that it was made clear to us that there was no protection in relation to workers compensation for those over the age of 65. We sought from the Government an undertaking that there would be a comprehensive review of all of those pieces of legislation which contain clauses like this so that the matter could be properly addressed and include that compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walters is quite wrong in attempting to score a political point against us. Our position has not changed at all. I know that Senator Baume is itching to get up and will point to the Audit Act. We have had a look at the Audit Act. There is a provision in it for the Minister to use his or her discretion in relation to compensation, but that is not the same as guaranteeing compensation in the event that either Gough Whitlam or Dame Beryl Beaurepaire falls over and breaks a leg. </PARA>
<PARA> We are supporting the principle which the Opposition has enunciated. We believe that the Government is supporting the same principle in the same way as Senator Walters has said that a charter which includes this has been acceded to. We are saying that we seek from the Government a comprehensive review of all those clauses. We understand that the Government is moving in that direction. There is no difference between any section of the chamber as a matter of principle. It is inappropriate for Senator Walters to try to turn this into a party political wrangle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly want to congratulate the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) on his very sensible decision to accept the proposition that the Opposition has been maintaining for quite some time, that is, that there should not be age discrimination. I understand from Senator Richardson that the Auditor-General's comprehensive review has been proceeding for some time and, despite what the last speaker said, it had nothing to do with any request from the Australian Democrats. The difference that has emerged between the Democrats and the Opposition on this matter is simple. The Democrats have been prepared to believe the Government that something would be done about it speedily and to persist with this intolerable situation with every new Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats have been prepared to say, `While we are waiting for this comprehensive review, we are prepared to allow all the new bodies being created to have this discrimination while the Government thinks about it. We will be more and more discriminatory until the Government resolves the problem'. That is the Democrats' position. That is why they voted against us in, I might say, a fairly bitter debate in the Senate Committee of the Whole on the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill. They voted against our amendment seeking to remove age discrimination. Quite frankly, it is beyond me and, I am certain, beyond all members of the Opposition, how the Democrats can have this intellectual agility to be able on the one hand to say with their hand on their heart that they are opposed to age discrimination while on the other hand they are prepared to increase in the community the volume of age discrimination as the Government keeps adding more and more bodies and including in all those bodies this retirement age of 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The incredible logical flaw and the intellectual hollowness in the Democrats' position-they are saved from further embarrassment in expressing their extraordinary attitude by the good sense of the Minister in this case-are exposed by the fact that the National Library of Australia, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum of Australia have no age provisions and are managing to survive without the world falling in. The Australian Democrats have chosen in the past to accept what had been the Government's view that, in additional legislation, it should follow the course set by those bodies that do have a 65 year age limit, such as the Institute of Sport and the Australian Tourist Commission, and not follow the course set by the other bodies I have mentioned, along with the Australian Heritage Commission, which one would think is timeless, and it is. It is intriguing that today the Democrats have said that there is no disagreement with the Opposition when we have fought for this principle vigorously without the support of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> It is remarkable to hear the Democrats say that their position has not changed at all and that their reason for not being prepared to go along with the Government deferring this bringing of justice in getting rid of age discrimination was that there was no protection. I put this to the Democrats: if there is no protection and the lack of protection is improper, how is it possible that the Government still has the ability to make, and has made, appointments of people to all of those bodies, for example, the Australian Film, Radio and Television School, which has a 70 year age limit, and all of those bodies are above that compensation problem level? All I want to say is that I am sick and tired of the Australian Democrats putting their hand on their heart and claiming that they have the purest of all possible motives when they have voted against this removal of age discrimination knowing the facts and knowing that the Audit Act provides a protective device with the retirement age limit being up to the Minister's discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> The big question is what we do while we are waiting for this detailed, comprehensive review being conducted by the Attorney-General on how age discrimination works? Do we increase the unfairness? Do we keep extending the range of this discrimination or do we say, `No, we will block that discrimination'? It would provide a far greater incentive to the Government to correct things if we were forcing it to stop going on with that age discrimination. That was our objective. Our objective was to bring forward, to hasten, this review instead of allowing it to drift on. While I am particularly disappointed with the quaint assertion by the Australian Democrats that their position has not changed, which would have meant, in other circumstances had the Government persisted in not accepting this amendment, that they would once again have voted against the removal of age discrimination in this Bill. The Democrats disappoint me. I commend the Minister and the Government for the decision to accept this amendment. </PARA>

The normal arrangement for producing and distributing pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) books is that they are printed and dispatched to arrive at pharmacies and doctors' surgeries two to three weeks before their date of effect.

The agreement between the Commonwealth and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which was signed on 23 November 1990, includes new mark-up and dispensing fees which become effective on determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These mark-up and dispensing fees were included in a proposed December 1990 PBS book. It had been anticipated that the Tribunal would speedily give effect to the terms of the agreement in accordance with sections of the National Health Act and to this end the PBS books have been prepared to reflect the terms of the agreement. When it became apparent that the Tribunal was not going to make the determination with effect from 1 December 1990 new PBS books were prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the postage to pharmacists of the December edition of the pharmacists PBS book was completed by the printer on 30 November.

There is a major effort going into explaining the pricing system. I am sorry about the difficulty in relation to notification to pharmacies of the mark-up and dispensing fees.

The undertaking I am giving is that the Government will seek to understand the situation that has developed in the last couple of days and if there are real detriments, it will try to deal with them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, as I understand it we have been dealing with division 4, which relates to pharmaceuticals. We are told that the commencement date of that division will be the date of royal assent. On that day the preceding provisions of division 4 presumably will come into effect. One of those preceding provisions relates to the extension of the pharmaceutical concessional benefits to recipients of the family allowance supplement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one begrudges assistance to low income families with dependent children. But I point out something to the Minister and I would like his response. Does the Government see a need to look at the situations of families caught in poverty traps where their income prevents them from receiving the family allowance supplement but where family allowance payments do not assist them sufficiently to meet all their family responsibilities?</PARA>
<PARA> Family allowance is really not a welfare issue. It is, in the words of former Senator Don Grimes, the then Minister for Social Security, a tax transfer system. It recognises that families with numbers of children have more costs imposed on them, including taxation costs, than families without children. </PARA>
<PARA> I am hearing more frequently these days from parents and friends groups and from people with whom I mix that the people who are in the area just above the family allowance supplement are the ones who are hurting. The burden is falling on them and that burden is not being lifted. For example, such families could have six or seven children. The children may have problems such as asthma or eczema. Somehow eczema seems to develop into asthma. I do not know how it does but a number of children in their early years who have eczema tend-I might be talking through the back of my head here-to get asthma. That may be wrong but there are other examples where families require medication. Such families have even greater imposts placed upon them just because of illness. Nothing in this Bill enables those families to overcome the unfair burdens which they carry. I put this question to the Minister: will the Government and the Department examine this question again and consider the unjust situations in which these families have been placed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has taken the opportunity to raise a matter that he has brought to the attention of the chamber on many occasions. It is his firm conviction that the family allowance is best described as a tax transfer rather than as a social welfare payment. I think that has been the foundation for that payment as opposed to the family assistance supplement over the years of its operation. It will always be the case that some families will fall just above the threshold at which the family assistance supplement cuts out. Although Senator Harradine is right to point to the unfortunate position in which some families might find themselves, it is a difficulty that will always be faced depending on where that threshold or cut-off point is put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is already a safety net arrangement in terms of provision of pharmaceuticals to a family. Senator Harradine mentioned the case of an asthmatic child who requires constant medication. I think I recall that a figure of $300 is provided in terms of the amount that a family might be expected to pay for pharmaceuticals. Families do not have to make expenditure above that in any year as the pharmaceuticals are provided free. </PARA>
<PARA> I also recall that there is a more generous safety net provision for families who receive, say, the family assistance supplement. I think $150 is the point at which families no longer incur expenditure if they require pharmaceuticals. I think those provisions were inserted in this chamber. I recall debates led, I think, by Senator Chipp, relating to the provision of that safety net. I believe that there was an indication there of the Government's awareness of the cost of pharmaceuticals to Australian families. An attempt has been made by that method to deal as practically as possible with the sorts of concerns raised by Senator Harradine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer very briefly to the schedule to the Bill, which deals with the consequential and minor amendments to the Child Care Act 1972. The schedule seeks to omit from the definition of `child care' in subsection 4 (1) of the Child Care Act the words `during the day'. A statement made on page 258 of the explanatory notes of the Department of Community Services and Health to Estimates Committee C refers to the primary objective of the child-care program being `to support work force participation by families with young children', with a secondary objective of supporting `non- working parents'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a question as to whether the ultimate result of those objectives is to facilitate the higher participation rate of mothers in the paid work force at a time when jobs are just not available for mothers in the paid work force, or for many fathers, or for young people. It also raises the question as to whether the Government would explore ways of assisting mothers of young children who wish to raise their children on a full time basis by helping them to cope with economic pressure. It raises the question as to whether, in fact, the thrust of this whole program is to limit ultimately the number of child-care places for mothers who choose to be almost full time at home, so that they can use occasional child-care for various situations, including appointments and shopping, and for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the priorities of the Government need looking at. The Federal Treasurer, Mr Keating, boasted the year before last that we now had a situation where families had two and sometimes three incomes. That is nothing to boast about. I thought that wage rates and the taxation regime of a government should ensure that a family could exist on one income. I would hate to see this measure go through without questioning the Government's policies, and questioning them very seriously, as to the end result. This leads me to the provision in the original Child Care Act which deals with research grants. Section 13 of that Act provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) The Minister may, in the discretion of the Minister . . . make a grant of moneys to any person for purposes of or relating to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) research in child care and related matters; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the initiation and development of methods of child care. </PARA>
<PARA>The schedule to the Bill that is currently before us omits the words `in the discretion of the Minister'. It also omits the words `make a grant of moneys' and substitutes `approve the making of a grant'. I am not sure precisely what that means, whether there is difference in the meaning at all. But, clearly, the grant should be made to people and organisations who do not have a vested interest in the child-care industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Attention should be given to some very thoughtful papers that have been produced on the long term effect of child-care. I refer to an article in the Australian of 25 October 1990 by Barry Maley, a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies and a Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Commerce at the University of New South Wales. That article had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's recent initiative expanding formal, tax-subsidised childcare raises many issues of equity and economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it fair, for example, that the majority of those who will take advantage of the subsidy are two-income families who will be subsidised, in effect, by the taxes from single-income families? Is it fair that highly-educated mothers will tend to profit more than less-educated or less-employable mothers?</PARA>
<PARA> Taking these two things together, formal, subsidised childcare begins to look like another middle-class welfare rip-off at the expense of stay-at-home mothers and their worker husbands. </PARA>
<PARA> But just as important as the equity issues are the economic efficiency outcomes and, more deeply, the long-term social and human consequences of a trend to put preschool infants into care by professionals for several hours a day, five days a week, in order to help both parents work full-time. </PARA>
<PARA> All parents, at one time or another, need someone to look after their infants for several hours at a time or, more regularly, for a few hours a day several days a week to allow them to work part-time or to do other things. </PARA>
<PARA> Usually they call upon members of their own families, or friends or casual helpers. This is predominantly `informal', unsubsidised care (at least until recently), and there is nothing new about this. </PARA>
<PARA> What is new is the increasing demand for subsidised, formal, professional care for very young children for greatly extended periods by the increasing army of young married women re-entering or staying in the workforce full-time after the birth of a child. </PARA>
<PARA> We are witnessing a strong social shift that is quantitatively and qualitatively different from the recent past. It is time to assess what it means. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure what the amendments to the original Act meant about research grants in that particular area. Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), could tell me what, if anything, they mean. But I feel that the Government itself should examine in depth the effect that its economic policies are having, including its high interest rates policies which have forced many persons into the paid work force who otherwise would prefer to not be there and who have more important things to be doing-policies which create great pressures on single-income families. But that is not the worst situation. The worst is the effect it is going to have on the children. As Mr Maley says:</PARA>
<PARA> Can we expect strangers, no matter how professional, to bring to the care of their charges for several hours a day, five days a week, the kind of emotional involvement and the capacity for self-sacrifice that has been shown, over and over again, to be the essential distinguishing feature of the natural parents or close relatives?</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say, and this is my final quotation:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the name of `attachment theory', a great deal of evidence has accumulated in recent years to show that secure attachment to the mother is vital to the benign development of an infant. </PARA>
<PARA> When it is firmly established, secure exploration of the world and anxiety-free learning take place. But when the bond is broken, or not firmly fixed in the first place, anxiety and even grief and depression follow, undermining the potential for effective learning and anxiety-free development.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that it is very important for the Government to take those factors into consideration in pursuing the policy that is currently being pursued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issues raised by Senator Harradine range widely over a number of issues, if one wants to look at them in that way, go to the heart of a great number of social policy matters and are broad-ranging, as the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) pointed out. When we began the committee stage of this Bill this morning we thought it would take only 10 to 15 minutes and we are nearly at lunchtime now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These matters were raised in a broad context by Senator Harradine and I would like to say a few words about where the Australian Democrats believe this type of discussion should lead. The Australian Democrats are committed to what we believe is a much better solution to these sorts of problems, particularly the issue of poverty traps, which Senator Harradine raised. Our solution is to provide every citizen in Australia with what we call a national support income. That would be income provided by the Government as of right to every citizen irrespective of income, not subject to the means test and not subject therefore to the enormous bureaucratic complexities to which Senator Harradine has drawn our attention. The income which a person then chose to earn over and above that would simply be income on top of that national support income and the total income would be subject to taxation. Therefore, most of the national support income paid to those in our community who have high incomes would go back immediately by way of tax. However, people would be in a much freer position to choose how they would spend that money on a whole range of social services and would immediately avoid the problem of poverty traps because the income earned would be money on top and would not be subject to a means test. It would also have the enormous advantage of removing the very complex bureaucratic processes which are currently necessary and which in themselves provide some of the problems to which Senator Harradine has drawn our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that would substantially simplify a large amount of the social justice and social welfare legislation which passes through this Parliament and would also leave the citizens of Australia in a much freer situation to make their decisions about the way in which they want their money spent for their welfare and benefit and for the welfare and benefit of their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To the extent that the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 deals with substantive matters, it completely fails Australia. The legislation fails not by what it contains, but by what it omits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of technical amendments to several Acts. It is not my intention to deal with all these amendments, but simply to concentrate on the major amendments relating to this legislation, which are about the position of certain members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the most important part of the legislation, the compliance provisions in the Industrial Relations Act, so far as employers are concerned in relation to contributions to superannuation funds on behalf of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation does absolutely nothing about the more important broader issue of general compliance measures. That is why the Opposition in the committee stage of this debate will seek to amend this Bill by inserting into it provisions which were first introduced in the form of a private member's Bill late in 1987 by Senator Chaney, as he then was, and subsequently by myself as amendments to the then new Industrial Relations Bill 1988 to vest in the Industrial Relations Commission and also in the Federal Court of Australia certain injunctive powers in relation to non-compliance with awards by organisations and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not oppose the Bill as a whole, but it certainly will seek to have those amendments passed. The Opposition will obviously seek the support of the Senate and particularly the Australian Democrats for these amendments. We will not oppose the Bill as a whole because we accept that, if it is the law of Australia that superannuation be part of the award fixing mechanism, it is only fair and proper that the law sees to it that people who are entitled to and are awarded superannuation benefits should receive those benefits. To the extent that any employer is falling short of his or her obligation to make those payments, it is only fair and reasonable that proper restitution be available to employees. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is in the spirit of that award compliance that the Opposition believes that the other side of the ledger should be considered. We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about the need for a level playing field across a whole range of issues but particularly economic issues. It is also very important that the level playing field apply in the area of industrial relations. The Opposition takes the view that, if it is good enough to oblige employers to stick to the terms of an award and some constraint is placed upon them should they fail to do so, it is only fair and reasonable that the same approach apply in relation to organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, as did earlier industrial relations legislation put forward by the Government, completely fails to remedy the impotence of the Industrial Relations Commission to enforce its decisions. Let me remind the Senate that as long ago as 14 May 1987, when the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, introduced the first Industrial Relations Bill, which was to replace the old conciliation and arbitration legislation with an updated Bill, he described compliance provisions as an essential element of the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to point out that the current bans clause procedure, which was in operation at that time, was disreputable and substantially moribund. In that original 1987 Bill penalties tougher than those under the existing Conciliation and Arbitration Act were to be imposed. They were to include fines, alteration to an organisation's eligibility rules to exclude specified groups from membership and the imposition of conditions as to future industrial conduct. A serious continuing breach of direction by an organisation or its members would lead to deregistration. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when this Government shelved that Bill for its own electoral convenience when it called the unnecessarily early 1987 election it also dropped these tougher compliance provisions. The Government subsequently blamed employers for that, but it was quite obvious that it was the pressure of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) which forced the Government to back down on that issue. The then President of the ACTU, now a member of this Parliament and, indeed, a Minister in this Hawke Labor Government, Simon Crean, was quoted in the Australian Financial Review of 17 August as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>They-</PARA>
<PARA>they being the Government of course-</PARA>
<PARA>can still introduce a Bill but it will have to be one which does not do anything on compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same month the then ACTU Assistant Secretary, Mr Gary Weaven, claimed that the shelved Bill should be scrapped because it held `little comfort for the unions'. If this does not spell out the intentions of the ACTU I certainly do not know what does. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, many employer groups, including the Confederation of Australian Industry, expressed opposition to the original Bill on the grounds, among others, that it did not go far enough to strengthen enforcement provisions. The end result was that, in the subsequent legislation which the Government introduced and which was passed as the Industrial Relations Act in 1988, the Commission was nominally given a great number of powers but it had no effective enforcement mechanisms to back up those powers except, oddly enough, against unions which declined to amalgamate, which is the subject of another piece of legislation which will be debated later today. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this legislation which we are now debating provides a greater level of enforcement against employers who fail to meet the superannuation requirements of awards, it still does absolutely nothing to level the playing field and provide adequate enforcement provisions to ensure that employees and unions, in particular, comply with the directions of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties believe that employers and employees should be free to make their own agreements on employment conditions and wages. That is the policy that we will introduce when we are elected to government in a couple of years time. However, while we still have a system of conciliation and arbitration as the central feature of our industrial relations system in Australia there must be provisions to ensure that parties who are subject to Commission rulings comply with its directions. So if our amendments to this legislation are not supported in this chamber today, we will certainly enact legislation when we achieve government to ensure that there are effective sanctions for those who fail to comply with the decisions and orders of the Commission. This will enable the Commission to issue directions to stop or prevent industrial action and it will also ensure that such directions would be enforceable by injunctions issued by the Federal Court of Australia. Failure to comply with those injunctions would indeed constitute contempt of court. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, any person who suffers damage or loss as a result of industrial action which is in breach of a direction would be able to sue the responsible organisation for damages in the Federal Court. We would also review all penalties in the Act to ensure that they are appropriate and effective. Under the current legislation, unions, or employers for that matter, are free to flout those decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission with impunity. Only with enforceable and equitable compliance provisions can an industrial relations system, involving arbitration, operate fairly and effectively. It is for those reasons that, in the Committee stage of this debate, we will be moving those amendments yet again and we hope that on this occasion they will achieve the support of the Senate. It is important generally, but most particularly in a time of economic downturn and turbulence, that the directions and decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission are complied with. </PARA>

<PARA> As to an absolutely definitive commitment that in every possible circumstance those ships would automatically be committed to war, the answer is no. That is a decision the Australian Government would have to make. As allies, one would expect some forewarning. But I would have to say also that it would be exceptional circumstances if Australian ships were not there and were not involved in any conflict-only the most exceptional circumstances. I do not want to detail those, but I think the Senate can imagine some of the more bizarre circumstances that I would rule out. That would mean, of course, very tight time lines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only has my attention been drawn to the article; I also viewed the adjournment debate last night in which both Senators Loosley and Chapman contributed. I say at the outset that I take Senator Chapman at his word that his intentions were of the best. Nevertheless, I do not think the statement has been at all helpful in the way in which he expressed it. It is only natural that spouses of service men and women that may be in the Gulf, and the women are only on the Comfort hospital ship, would express some concern about the return of their loved ones for the festive season. I believe that that is only natural.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has not been a case of there being constant whingeing. There have been one or two newspaper articles about it. I think that characterisation by Senator Chapman is most unfortunate. I think it is equally unfortunate that this was all stated because we were worried about our image as wimps. We are a more mature society than that. We have to accept that not every family can react in exactly the same way. Some will find it very difficult for their relatives to be away at any time, let alone in these existing circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> I say this to Senator Loosely so that the record is straight: I do not endorse his remarks, I regret that they were made and, as Minister, I have to go on the public record to say so. I do not doubt his intentions. He may have been well intentioned, but it was a very poor use of English and a very poorly constructed statement that he made. In spite of whatever his intentions may have been, his statement will not be portrayed according to what he wished. I would hope that Senator Chapman could clarify his position, and I give him that opportunity now. He might like to rephrase the way he has placed those particular statements. It is not an issue of bipartisanship. It is nothing to do with that.</PARA>

I do not think he went far enough in terms of the language he used, and the effect that that language will have will be distorted in its transmission. Certainly last night he did not address the issue of `We don't want families saying this because we'll be a bunch of wimps'. He completely overlooked that. So I invite Senator Chapman to make a correction. If he does not, I invite the leadership of his Party to make that correction.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Did the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) release its bulletin on industrial disputation for Australia last week? Do the independent ABS figures show that the consensual approach to industrial relations under the Hawke Government has produced a continuing trend of a low rate of industrial disputation in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5005" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 November the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its latest series of industrial disputes statistics in Australia. The series shows a continuing decline in the number of days lost because of disputes and in the incidence of disputes per head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the month of August 1990, 49,000 working days were lost in Australia in 110 disputes. These were the lowest figures for August in any year since 1964. I point out to the Senate that the work force is about 70 per cent larger than it was in 1964; therefore, the per head figures are down around our socks. The number of working days lost for the year ended 1990 was 877,300, which was the lowest year ended August figure since 1967 when the work force was 69 per cent smaller than it is at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the lower rate of disputation, that works out at 137 working days lost per 1,000 in the year to August, which is the lowest figure since the measure was first published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In particular sectors, the August figure showed that disputes in the coal industry fell sharply; that the metals and machinery sector had the lowest level of disputes in total days and in days per 1,000 employees since the measure was first introduced; that disputes were low in New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory; and that 53 per cent of all disputes were of less than 24 hours duration, meaning that they were a typical 24-hour stoppage or some period less than that.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Childs asked me whether this shows a continuing advantage for the consensual approach to industrial relations that the Hawke Labor Government promotes through the accord. One of the elements in these lower figures, which I have acknowledged publicly, must be the fact that the economy is flatter, and that works against industrial disputation. In saying that, I point out that this Government has had an unparalleled record in reducing the number of days lost independent of the state of economic activity. For example, economic growth averaged over 4 per cent in the financial years 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90. In these years industrial disputation was, on average, over 60 per cent lower than working days lost in the last full financial year of the Fraser Government, 1981-82-a year in which the economic growth was 1.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, in a high growth scenario there was still a dramatic fall in the level of disputes under the accord and during the period of this Government. That leads to the comparison that there has been a drop of 62 per cent in the level of industrial disputation comparing the life of the Hawke Government with the period immediately following that of the Fraser Government. If we want to put that in a reverse way, we could say that Liberal industrial relations policies impose a $2 billion handicap on the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of reports that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in conjunction with the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) Society has launched a new investment fund called the Development Australia Fund? Can the Minister inform the Senate of the details of the fund and its relevance to the broader issue of the availability of capital to new high growth industries in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="5006" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the existence of that fund and I congratulate the parties involved, particularly the ACTU, which has been pursuing the idea for some time. The AMP Society, the ACTU and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures announced this fund at a launch today. It is to be called the Development Australia Fund. It is backed by a tripartite agreement between the parties on how superannuation funds should be invested, and the fund will be managed by the AMP Society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fund has been designed to provide union and employer superannuation funds with the opportunity to participate directly in the development of Australian industry. That is an opportunity I fully support. While the fund will include traditional listed equity and fixed interest components, it will also include a sizeable low cost housing finance component and a significant development capital component. This development capital component will be managed by the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) with the aim of making `patient' capital available to Australian firms. I should say that the AIDC is, I think, the largest manager of development equity funds for Australian industrial companies and has done that, I think, with considerable success. The fund will develop companies and projects which encourage employment creation, the expansion of exports and import substitution, the development of new technologies and technology transfer, and increased Australian ownership and participation.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable senator will be aware, I have for some time been expressing concern at the apparent lack of capital available to fast growing Australian businesses. It is a matter of public record that earlier this year the Treasurer and I had some discussions with the major superannuation funds on this issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Brian Howe was not asked. That is a typical smart interjection-wrong again. These discussions occurred because it appeared that these major financial institutions play a much smaller role in development capital markets in Australia than their counterparts in countries such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should state that at no stage has there been any attempt by the Government to prescribe or direct how superannuation and life offices should invest their funds, or whether a set proportion of funds should be set aside for development capital purposes. The discussions were about the perceived constraints on the larger funds investing in these areas, and whether these constraints have arisen in Australia for any particular reason. I accept without qualification that the investment practices of superannuation funds must be dictated by their own commercial considerations and judgments.</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background the fund which has now been established, and the AMP Society's central role, is a very welcome initiative. The AIDC's role in this fund will be one of its strengths. As I said, it has a proven performance as a provider of development capital, and this new source of funds will provide it with the opportunity to enhance its operations in the future. It is to be hoped that the Development Australia Fund will become something of a model for other superannuation fund managers and trustees.</PARA>

I have said in all of those answers-and I note that the Prime Minister did so in a written answer to Mr Webster in the other place recently-that there is no accepted poverty line, so I am not prepared to put a figure on how many Australian children are living in poverty or how many are likely to.

<PARA> In any recession there will be families in trouble. That has to happen. If we are in a recession and people go out of work then, clearly, their economic circumstances will be worse and that will put pressure on Australian families.

I hope that during the next two years we can begin to lift those levels up a bit and do all that governments can do to make sure that no children live in poverty. However, irrespective of whatever government income security payments there might be, I do not think a government could ever guarantee that no child would have that kind of problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators opposite for the opportunity to ask my question a little earlier than normal, and I direct it to the Minister for Social Security. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the position of the States regarding exempting the $2.50 a week pharmaceuticals supplement for pensioners and beneficiaries from assessment when setting public housing rent levels? Can the Minister also report on the progress of discussions with the States on the issue of the Commonwealth providing a direct debiting facility for State housing rents?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all honourable senators would be aware, from 1 November all pensioners and beneficiaries who were previously entitled to free pharmaceuticals received either $2.50 a week or a $50 a week advance to compensate them for the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme announced in the August Budget. After March all of those in the higher income levels who receive a part pension will also receive that $2.50.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, wrote to State and Territory housing Ministers on 23 September to ensure that this $2.50 for pharmaceuticals was not assessed as income when the State housing commissions were determining levels of rent. Unfortunately, only the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have so far formally agreed to this request, although the indications are that the other States will go along with that request at least until March. What happens after March is a matter of some concern.</PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that that $2.50 fully compensates all of those affected for pharmaceutical charges, the Government has decided that that amount will remain as a supplement, that it will be tax free and that it will not be taken into account in setting nursing homes and hostel patient contributions or in assessing child-care fee relief. Obviously, it is absolutely essential that that $2.50 be kept fully available for pensioners and beneficiaries to use when they are purchasing prescription items.</PARA>
<PARA> Even though the States have indicated that they will quarantine that amount only until March, we live in hope that we will get some positive response as to what will happen after that. Pensioners and beneficiaries are entitled to certainty before that date as to what will happen. The Minister, Mr Howe, is attending a meeting today, as I understand it, of State housing Ministers so that he might very forcefully put the view, not on behalf of the Commonwealth Government but on behalf of pensioners and beneficiaries, that the States keep their hands off that $2.50.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that at the moment the States are campaigning very strongly to have the Department of Social Security agree to the direct debiting of rents from social security payments. If the Commonwealth was prepared to look at that it would be doing so on a totally voluntary basis. It would be up to the client to determine whether he or she wanted that deduction to occur. As a minimum response the Commonwealth would expect the States to quarantine the $2.50 permanently. Were the States not to do so, they could hardly expect the Commonwealth to cooperate in the direct debiting of rents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have an answer to this question. It is not a matter on which I am expert, but Senator Cooney has pursued me about it before. He has a great interest in the topic. The answer is that a professional artist is able to claim as a tax deduction, under the so-called taxation incentives for the arts scheme, the value of a painting which is donated for inclusion in a collection maintained by the Australiana Fund, a public art gallery, library, museum or art bank. Under the scheme certain gifts of works of art and other comparable property qualify for deduction on a more liberal basis than other gifts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Broadly speaking, the scheme allows a deduction for a qualifying gift to be based on its market value rather than on its costs. The scheme also does away with the requirement that the property given must have been bought by the taxpayer within the previous 12 months. The deduction for qualifying donations is generally based on the market value of the property at the time it was donated, which is determined by reference to the average of two or more valuations obtained from approved valuers. However, in certain circumstances the deduction will be based on the cost of acquiring or producing the property. This will be in a case where an artist or an art dealer donates in the ordinary course of business a painting which is not from his own private collection.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. I congratulate the Minister on the intention behind his Offshore, What For? campaign launched recently which aims to encourage Australian tendering for Federal Government contracts, and is directed at both suppliers and purchasers. However, in light of the fact that Australia's boat building industry was not even asked to tender or quote for a multi-million dollar cruiser purchased by a Qantas Airways Ltd subsidiary; and in light of the fact that this 3,500 tonne boat is being built in a Fijian Government shipyard, before returning to Australia to take away business from established private operators, I ask the Minister: does this not contradict the objectives of Buy Australian, Advance Australia, and Offshore, What For? campaigns? Is he not embarrassed by the investment of taxpayers' money in a ship built offshore without even giving Australian industry a chance to bid for the contract?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator O'Chee has a couple of basic misconceptions about the Offshore, What For? campaign and also has a misconception about government purchasing and the structures within which that purchasing is conducted. What he has to acknowledge and what has of course been driving politics on his side of Parliament for some time is that we have recognised that we do not have artificial barriers to purchasing within Australia. The aims of efficiency and building a competitive industry in Australia are best enhanced if we do not have those sorts of artificial trade barriers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the first point I make. We have moved away from the policy of compulsory acquisition of goods made in Australia. Secondly, the campaign of Offshore, What For? and the Buy Australian campaign have been in operation now for a couple of months. They have been conducted not only on a Federal level, but also in recent weeks we have obtained support from all State governments and Territory governments across Australia for it because those governments recognise the advantages to the Australian economy of educating government purchasers, particularly in an era where purchasing policy dictates that departments go off and buy their own. There is a certain degree of devolution of purchasing power and authority, an autonomy within individual departments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator Alston, if he were a bit patient and did not show the normal arrogance he shows in Question Time, would actually learn something from the answer. Governments across this country recognise the advantages of educating purchasing officers. One of the basic reasons they recognise that is that governments across Australia have a purchasing bill of $30 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That purchasing bill, if it is exercised in a way that emphasises the quality of Australian products and emphasises the need for Australian producers to produce products of quality, will mean not only enhanced purchasing from within Australia but also that Australian producers will enhance the level of quality of their products and will be able to compete internationally as a consequence thereof. Had Senator Alston been listening, he would have heard that within what I have said so far I have mentioned that there has been a devolution of purchasing power and purchasing autonomy and responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of Senator O'Chee's question refers to the tendering process of a subsidiary of Qantas for a particular vessel. I will redirect that particular question to the Minister responsible for Qantas and its subsidiaries who will come back to us. Having said that, I stress the fact that the Purchase Australian campaign has just got off the ground. It is one that is also being appreciated by Australian industry. Opposition senators can sit over there, marginalising themselves, playing in the nets while we are on the main pitch, but the reality is that the campaign will continue. It has support, and it has support from the business community. It is a pity those on the other side do not show a bit of support as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The signing on 23 November of a memorandum of understanding between the USSR and Australia, aimed at expanding mutually beneficial trade and economic co-operation between the two countries, and the subsequent signing of a credit agreement totalling $400m between Austrade EFIC and the Soviet Foreign Economic Bank, Vnesheconombank, for the purchase of wool and other Australian commodities by trade organisations in the Soviet Union represents a watershed in our relationship with the USSR and is good news for our embattled wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian offer to provide credit to facilitate trade was made in response to a request from the Soviet Prime Minister, Mr Ryzhkov, to Mr Hawke and was designed to permit the resumption of normal levels of trade. It is expected that the wool industry will be the largest beneficiary as traditionally it accounts for three-quarters of the trade concerned. However, the Australian offer is predicated on the Soviet side paying by the end of this year all the moneys owing for wool and other products shipped earlier in the year. The Soviet authorities have confirmed their intention of meeting this condition.</PARA>
<PARA> Soviet officials have indicated their eagerness for a quick return to the wool market, as Soviet wool mills are in urgent need of Australian wool supplies. The benefits of the credit arrangement will not be confined to wool. The Soviet side showed strong interest in purchasing Australian butter. A Soviet delegation recently arrived in Australia to discuss the purchase of up to 100,000 tonnes of Australian mutton. In addition to wool, meat and butter, discussions also covered a major Australia-Soviet joint venture for the production of alumina and the supply of Australian bauxite, alumina and manganese. Negotiations in these areas were not so promising, but may result in the development of trade in these commodities at a later date.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, recently announced the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile, and procurement of information technology systems by Government agencies will be expected to conform to GOSIP. This will be mandatory from 1 August 1991 and Government departments will be required to develop strategic plans that outline how they will move to open systems. The Information Exchange Steering Committee is the body charged with furthering the development of GOSIP. This is only a first step towards adoption of the wider concept of open systems and is consistent with the direction being taken in information technology in developed countries throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These markets are currently dominated by the proprietary systems of a few major computer vendors. Consequently it is often difficult for their customers to transfer data and generally communicate between different systems; to attach peripheral equipment from alternative suppliers; to expand by upgrading from one system to another, sometimes even while staying with the one supplier; and to run applications easily on more than one brand of equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> As open system standards become fully defined and more widely available, they promise to overcome these difficulties. Users, including Australian industry, should benefit from the more competitive markets that result, particularly industries like software suppliers. Smaller suppliers, such as the many Australian companies with expertise in both software and services, will have access to wider international markets using open systems. Presently these firms target particularly proprietary systems and it can be difficult for firms to grow in that environment. The benefits of these larger, more open and competitive markets will only come if there is assurance that products adhere to the agreed standards. Accordingly, it is important to have locally developed software tested for conformance to open systems. I am encouraged by some proposals which have been put to the Government for conformance testing in Australia and these have recently been brought to the close attention of Ministers.</PARA>

I understand that a booklet or proposed listing of the various prices was printed in anticipation that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal would make its determination in accordance with the Act in a way which would enable the period of notice or the information to be given to pharmacists, and doctors for that matter, as speedily as possible. For one reason or another that did not occur, but I understand that the postage from the printer was completed on the night of 30 November and that it has gone out. I understand from advice received today that all pharmacists in Australia can expect to receive the booklet or listing by today. Many of them will have received it by yesterday. I understand that that important set of information is now in the hands of pharmacists. The new list of prices and so on was made available to the Pharmacy Guild midway through last week. It covers about 90 per cent of retail pharmacists, so it was available to them to distribute through their system. I do not know whether it did or not. I understand Senator Herron's concern about this matter. The printing has been completed and the distribution has taken place, so I am advised.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it a fact that a shipment of 85,000 sheep was recently rejected by Saudi Arabia because of the presence of the disease scabby mouth?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A shipment of Australian live sheep left Australia in October for Saudi Arabia and on 22 November, upon arrival at Jeddah, was refused entry. The ship contained 85,000 Australian sheep. There were at that time unconfirmed reports of infection, which was contagious, of pustular dermatitis, otherwise known colloquially as scabby mouth. I understand that there was an Australian veterinary surgeon travelling with the ship. Subsequently, I understand that Dick Austen, the Chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) is reported as saying that some scabby mouth infection was included within the flock on board the vessel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To answer the second question, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation directs exporters under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act on pre-voyage checks for health and for quality controls before sheep are dispatched from Australia. The directions that they operate under are directions that have been worked out previously with industry, which has a vested interest in maintaining quality in order to consolidate and enhance the Gulf trade on live sheep.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also a fact that a vaccine has been considered by the industry and the AMLC to determine what can be done to guarantee disease free sheep on arrival. Those considerations have resulted in industry and the AMLC rejecting the proposal. However, in view of the rejection of this shipment of 85,000 sheep, a number of options are now being considered, including the vaccination option.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the public comment of the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, that growers would be out of their mind or mad if they did not embrace the vaccine, it should be said that there are a number of problems with the vaccine. Firstly, the vaccine is live; it causes scabs and can transmit diseases itself. Secondly, it is not commonly used on farms because of the possibility of transmitting viruses during storage. Thirdly, it takes 40 days before the scabs stop appearing after the administration of the vaccine. I am advised that if one contains the vaccine on a vessel during voyage it could result in a disease outbreak itself. I am also advised that it requires long preparation times before a departure. All those things are matters to be considered on our side.</PARA>
<PARA> We also have to consider the importing country's view of the vaccine and the attitude it will have to the implications of its use. However, the matter is under consideration with a number of other options and obviously a decision will be made in due course. This is a vital trade to Australia and the Government is committed to sorting out the problems with that trade as speedily as possible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 November Senator Panizza asked me a question about a locust outbreak in Western Australia. I have now been supplied by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, with an answer to that question. As it is a long answer, I ask that it be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>I am unaware of any request from the Western Australian Government for assistance from the Commonwealth Government in the current plague of the Australian plague locust.</PARA>
<PARA>However Wilson Tuckey M.P., member for O'Connor, made a written request to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for a pro rata contribution from the Commonwealth equal to one quarter of the annual amount it would contribute to the Australian Plague Locust Commission (APLC). This funding was to assist in the control campaign against the Australian plague locust in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>A reply was sent by the Minister in early October indicating that the APLC was funded on the basis that its Charter directs it to control locusts which pose a threat to agriculture in another member State. Should a locust outbreak occur in one of the member States which does not constitute an interstate threat, control of the outbreak becomes the responsibility of that State and not the APLC or Commonwealth. The locusts in Western Australia do not pose a threat to agriculture interstate.</PARA>
<PARA>The APLC receives 50% of its funding from the Commonwealth and 50% in varying proportions from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Agricultural Protection Board of Western Australia (APB) requested that two of their staff, who would be key officers in the coming campaign, receive some training from the APLC prior to the campaign commencing. The members of the APB were included on a training course run by the APLC on locust survey and control techniques in early August at Longreach, Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>The APB have also made several requests for chemical from the APLC. The loans were made on the proviso that an order for replacement chemical be placed immediately as the locust season in eastern Australia was likely to be busy with the possibility of aerial spraying operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Initially 46 tonnes of technical fenitrothion were sent in mid August 1990 to enable the APB to organise their own chemical distribution prior to the outbreak. A further loan of 36 tonnes was made in late October-a total of 82 tonnes representing 80% of the Commission's chemical stocks.</PARA>
<PARA>A request for a further 50 tonnes of technical fenitrothion was received from the APB in late October. At the time the Commission was engaged in its own spray operations against a moderate scale outbreak in central southern Queensland. As it was still early in the locust season the Commission felt it unwise to deplete its chemical stocks further. The Commission currently has 24 tonnes on hand and aerial spraying operations are likely to recommence in Queensland in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was able to loan the APB 35 tonnes of technical fenitrothion.</PARA>
<PARA>The most serious plague of the Australian plague locust in the eastern States, since the Commission's inception in 1974, took place in the Riverina of New South Wales in spring 1984. One hundred tonnes of technical fenitrothion was sprayed by the Commission during this time. Judging from the amount of chemical being requested by Western Australia the plague must be very serious indeed. Dr Gordon Hooper, the Director of the Australian Plague Locust Commission. spent a week in Western Australia observing and advising during mid November.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This report includes a number of statistics which indicate a serious situation within our society. It details the latest cumulative figure relating to divorces and the latest cumulative figure relating to children affected by divorces. In my view, extra efforts need to be taken to promote marriage stability in light of the cost of divorce to community and individuals. Added to the financial costs must be the even greater cost in terms of the breakdown in human relationships and the effect that this has on children and society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Without denying individual responsibility, it must be said that the Federal Government has contributed to the pressures against marriage and the family. It has done so in a number of ways, including making it impossible for many families to live on one income; failing to recognise the financial value to society of the full time home-maker; turning Family Court counsellors into counsellors for divorce; giving de facto relationships the status of equal value to marriage in certain circumstances; promoting a promiscuous society by its support of a hard core pornography industry; and insufficient funding for marriage reconciliation counselling services and for marriage education for the young. </PARA>
<PARA> Some years ago I sought to amend the Family Law Act to require marriage partners intent on separation to undergo counselling for the purposes of considering the legal, social and financial consequences of divorce and, in particular, the effect that divorce would have on children. Under my amendment, an application for divorce could not be filed unless such reconciliation counselling had been undertaken at least 12 months beforehand. While some Government members considered that the proposal had merit, the Government voted against my measure. Had my measure been adopted, thousands of marriages could have been saved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good the Government bewailing the cost of divorce if it fails to give legislative support for the institution of marriage. The latest figures that are supplied in the Family Law Council report that is now before us, show that in the 13 years since the Murphy Family Law Act, which allowed for easier divorce, became operative in 1976 there have been 599,496 divorces and 705,279 children have been directly affected. I believe that that should be noted. I believe that we should always have that in the forefront of our minds when considering the issue of family law in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The summary in this annual report tells us a great deal about this Government's parsimony in providing funds for the appropriate and proper description of the incredibly rich and diverse flora and fauna of this country. In the summary the Resources Study says that it is terribly grateful that the Government has increased the amount of funding by $1m in 1991-92 and has promised a further $1.4m in 1992-93. They are incredibly small sums of money when one recognises the vast job lying before us in properly describing the flora and fauna of Australia; the habitats in which those plants and animals live; the ecological relationships which exist between animals and animals, animals and plants, and plants and plants; and the relationships which exist between them and the environment and habitats in which they live. Indeed, only several weeks ago I was speaking to a world expert-who shall remain nameless-on one whole family of organisms. He expressed the view that, at the rate at which we were going, we would not complete the biological survey of Australia until the year 3000. In other words, more than a thousand years from now we will still be describing the incredibly rich and diverse and in many cases unique plant and animal forms which share this land with us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime we are destroying species in this country almost as fast as we can go. We have one of the worst records in the world as regards the extinction of vertebrate animals. The list of both animals and plants which lie on the verge of extinction, which are threatened and which are regarded as endangered species is long indeed. Against that background we have a very small sum of money set aside to describe properly what is in this country before it disappears forever. </PARA>
<PARA> To take one example, it has come to my notice in recent weeks that the numbat is an animal which was prevalent right across southern Australia at the time of white settlement. It was last described in New South Wales in the 1860s, and it is now confined to about 200 animals in one small pocket of Western Australia. The number of numbats has seriously declined in the past 10 years. Not enough is known about the breeding habits and the ecology of that species to guarantee its survival. It may well be that into the next century there will be no numbats anywhere in Australia, anywhere in the world or anywhere in the universe. It is our responsibility to ensure that the numbat and a number of other species survive so that they themselves can carry on the long, detailed and involved evolutionary process on which they are embarked and future generations of humans can also enjoy the experience of those animals and the rich environment they helped to create. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, the Australian Democrats in our alternative Budget would have increased the amount of money going to the biological and environmental survey this year by another $11,339,000. That is the sort of money which should be put into this very important task of describing the flora and fauna before they become seriously depleted. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to that section of the annual report of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories on page 183 that relates to the activities of the Supervising Scientist and the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. This departmental report could demand much more than the brief time we have available to look at it. For that reason I will confine my remarks to the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS). We are aware that recently the Supervising Scientist tabled a Sir Humphrey Appleby-written report in this Senate. Section 1.5 of that report is a particularly well executed piece of bureaucratic nonsense, containing over a dozen half-accusations of incompetence and confusion on the part of the Northern Territory Government and generally painting a misleading picture of confusion and environmental danger in the Kakadu National Park in much the same pseudo-scientific rubbish we have been hearing for years. </PARA>
<PARA> A few favourable recommendations culled from the Taylor review, which is referred to on page 183 of the report we are considering, were also discussed in the OSS report. However, one recommendation not discussed concerns the transferring of the OSS Sydney head office to Darwin. The current Government has long suffered the ridiculous situation where logic, efficiency and cost effectiveness have been thrown out of the window to satisfy the personal preferences of a few bureaucrats. That is, the transfer, which would decrease costs, improve efficiency and allow the office to work towards a much needed credibility cannot take place because a handful of highly paid public servants refuse to move to Darwin. This refusal is then rationalised by totally outrageous claims about the costs of the transfer. I have heard figures of over $5m, yet the Northern Territory Government can recruit senior staff and move them and their families from almost anywhere in Australia to Darwin for less than $15,000 each. This means that the Northern Territory could do it for less than $400,000. I therefore seriously raise the question that arises from recommendation 43 of the Taylor report, that the OSS head office be moved to Darwin. What is the Government proposing to do about this?</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Taylor also stated that it is unacceptable for the Northern Territory to override the advice of the Supervising Scientist and recommended that the Northern Territory be required to give effect to the advice of the Supervising Scientist in respect of adherence to the environmental requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Taylor made 47 recommendations in his review of the OSS, one of which was that the Commonwealth-Northern Territory working arrangements be amended to give regulatory powers to the Supervising Scientist in respect of environmental requirements. Since there has been no breach of environmental requirements, such power is unnecessary and would simply amount to a duplication of function of the Northern Territory regulatory agencies. A second regulatory power would open the door to interference in the regulatory process. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fry, the Supervising Scientist, calls for the Commonwealth to support Professor Taylor's recommendation that he be given greater regulatory power. Mr Fry is very selective in the recommendations he chooses to support. This particular recommendation, if adopted, would see a further expansion of the OSS in the Northern Territory, with further costs to be borne by the mining companies, and would serve to create further confusion in the regulatory process. The Industry Commission recommended that the OSS be transferred to the Northern Territory to resolve the regulatory conflict, which would offer a far more cost effective solution to the problem if one in fact exists. This section of the report should be studied seriously by government and all parties interested in this area. I would certainly be looking in the coming 12 months to ensure that the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories looks very closely at the recommendations of the Taylor report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks about the section of the annual report for 1989-90 of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories which deals with tourism. As the report indicates, tourism is now making a major contribution to Australia's balance of payments. According to the Department in its report, the foreign exchange earnings from tourism are now of the order of $6,500m per annum. That is a stupendous amount of money which has put tourism proceeds and receipts well ahead of the returns from many of Australia's traditional export industries. Tourism is now well and truly up the list of our major foreign exchange earners. In 1989-90 some 2.1 million visitors came to Australia from other countries. That is a large figure indeed, down only marginally on the number of visitors who came to Australia in 1988, the year of our Bicentenary, when a number of special events were held. It was the year of the Expo in Brisbane, and that drew a number of tourists to Australia. But in 1989, despite the impact of the disruptions to domestic aviation caused by the pilots dispute, there were still 2.1 million overseas visitors to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that one of the great successes of the Hawke Government has been in generating international tourism to this country. The number of overseas visitors to Australia has more than doubled during the Hawke Government's period in office and it has certainly been a key priority of this Government. In the three years to 1988, for example, we had massive annual increases in the number of international visitors to this country, averaging some 25 per cent per annum. Certainly that has been a very important contributor to our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that this report from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories points out that visitor numbers have in fact increased again since the termination of the pilots dispute, with the number of international visitors to this country in the first half of 1990 being up 7 per cent on numbers for the same period last year. The Department has provided very welcome information on the state of our tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we expect the growth in tourism to continue. It is forecast that the number of visitors coming to this country will continue to grow by around 7 per cent per annum, with some five million international visitors to Australia by the turn of the century. It sounds like a large number of visitors, but it would certainly appear to be sustainable over the course of this decade. Of course, such numbers will continue to add foreign exchange receipts to our economy and in that way will not only help to improve our balance of payments figures, but will also help to offset domestic and internal economic cycles in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> At page 40 of the report the Department refers to the new state of play in the airline industry. With regard to international airlines, it is noteworthy that we now have two new agreements with airlines flying to this country. Swissair Pty Ltd and Korean Airlines are the subjects of those agreements. Korean Airlines began services to Australia in April and Swissair is likely to begin services next year. Of course, there are reciprocal rights for Qantas Airways Ltd in both Switzerland and Korea. </PARA>
<PARA> The two airlines policy was terminated on 31 October and we can expect that the increased competition in the domestic airline industry will be of major benefit to Australian and international travellers. No doubt leisure travellers and tourists, in particular, will benefit from the cheaper air fares being offered as competition spreads into the domestic aviation sector. That is very important because some 45 per cent-nearly half-of all visitors who come to Australia each year use the domestic airlines in Australia. So certainly increased competition in that area will be of benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice also that the Department is acting as the secretariat for a committee to look into shopping by tourists and how to boost spending in Australia by tourists. I understand that that committee reported in June this year and that that report is now with the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is interesting to read this report in conjunction with press reports today about the increasing import penetration of the Australian economy. Maybe we should look at spending by international tourists on international products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks about the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories annual report 1989-90 and, in particular, the structural adjustment packages of the wet tropics of Queensland. The Department seems to be reasonably good in its front line activities concerning the environment, but it is certainly not very good at tidying up the loose ends. I was rather amused to read in the report this comment referring to the structural adjustment package of the wet tropics of Queensland:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Auditor-General conducted a compliance Audit on the Departmental responsibilities under the Structural Adjustment Package in February-March 1990 with a satisfactory result. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that rather amusing, as $7.6m of taxpayers' money went out of the environment department and has been lost. Nobody seems to know what has happened to it. So I am rather amused to see in the report that the Auditor-General found the results satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise again in this Senate the question of the structural adjustment package. I have raised on a number of occasions the $200,000 to $300,000 owing to a number of Ravenshoe businesses. I have received assurances from various Ministers that it would be looked into and that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, would be approached to give some sympathetic consideration to the loss that these people have suffered. To date I have had no response at all, and I will continue to raise the matter until some response is given. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggested to the last Minister who was interested in the matter-I think it was the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, who promised that he would refer it to Mrs Kelly-that I would try to think of some way that the compensation could be paid without creating a precedent. It occurs to me that maybe the Minister could reopen applications under the structural adjustment package to allow those who have lost money as a result of the World Heritage listing of the tropical rain forest to claim under this package. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out to the Senate on many occasions past, there is still money left in the package that can and should be spent. It is only a very small amount of money in the overall picture. I would again urge any of the Government Ministers or others who might be interested in the matter to look further into that for the sake of those 12 Ravenshoe families whose livelihoods are about to disappear because of the Government's inaction on this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Another part of the report says that the Cairns office of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories provided assistance to the people of north Queensland in relation to the structural adjustment package. The way it did that has caused some uncertainty. Recently I had comments from people who had applied for the structural adjustment payments. They were assisted and advised by the Department's office in Cairns, but it seems that the advice was not given terribly well in certain aspects. I have written to the Minister pointing out some anomalies and again asking the Minister to look at the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a further section of the report as it deals with the environment-that is, the section on the Cape York Peninsula. The report notes that Cape York has been identified as an area of significant natural heritage, wilderness and Aboriginal value. The report also notes that the region has been identified as having future economic potential in industries such as tourism and mining, as well as the proposed spaceport. The report goes on to say that the provision of a balance between these two things has emerged as a major public issue for the 1990s. It certainly has. I hope that the Department can give a lead in this balance, particularly in giving some timetables-some certainty-both to those who want to save the natural environment and those who want to develop it. Governments, both State and Federal, must give some guidelines so that people wanting to develop the Cape, such as those involved in the space base, have some timetables and know with certainty whom they should be dealing with and how these matters should be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has not drawn attention to the need for a reform of the environmental impact statement or impact assessment process and to give environmental considerations a fair and unbiased hearing. That bears very much on the remarks of the previous speaker, Senator Macdonald. It is passing strange to the Australian Democrats that at a time when the Government has said that it has a commitment to the development of a sustainable economy-it has used the term `sustainable development', meaning development which is sustainable in the long term and not simply present industries being sustainable; in other words, those processes which will ensure the biological integrity of this continent for 100, 1,000 and 10,000 years into the future-and has given at least some oral commitment to that ideal, it is suggesting that it wants to reserve certain areas of Australia for exclusive exploitation and exclude them from the operations of the environmental impact statement or environmental impact assessment process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would have thought that if one had set in train mechanisms such as the Resource Assessment Commission, one had set in train the thinking which would move us towards sustainable development and the very last thing the Government would be seeking to do would be to remove from consideration any part of Australia so that that area could be used exclusively for exploitation for a particular purpose, such as forestry or mining. I think that the previous speaker's remarks bear very much on the potential failure of that process with respect to Cape York where a land use survey has been put in train and is expected to take 10 years to complete. The honourable senator asked for some assurance as to timing, yet it would appear that decisions will be made with respect to the building of a spaceport well before that land use survey is complete and some comprehensive assessment of the values of Cape York can be made. I point out in passing that Cape York is probably the last remaining area of tropical rainforest which is substantially undisturbed anywhere in the world which can be kept in that state for future generations not only of Australians but also of world citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the procedure which the Senate has adopted whereby citizens can seek redress under the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988, which relates to the protection of persons referred to in the Senate, is a very fair and reasonable procedure which the Senate has introduced and which is not widely known in the outside community. On this occasion, Sir William Keys has used that procedure in order to take the opportunity to defend his reputation against remarks made in the Senate by Senator Herron and I recently while we were debating a matter of public importance. This is an excellent procedure which is available to citizens and I do not in any way criticise Sir Williams Keys for taking the opportunity which the Senate has made available to people such as him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in his response, which was tabled in this Parliament in the Privileges Committee report, Sir William Keys said that I referred to him as a Government `stooge' because of his support for hospital integration. At that time we were debating a matter of public importance which the Opposition brought on concerning the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) regarding integration of repatriation hospitals and the fact that the promise was being broken. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Williams Keys went on in his response to say that he believed he had had the respect and confidence of his own constituency, as the principal negotiator for war veterans and dependants of Australia for 27 years, 17 years as the National Secretary and 10 years as the National President of the Returned Services League (RSL). He claimed that he was nobody's stooge and he never has been; that the views he expresses at all times are his own; and that as National President of the RSL he negotiated the integration arrangements-that is, for the hospitals-with Prime Minister Hawke and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). Unfortunately, maybe Sir William Keys is not aware that it is his role in that integration as well as his role in negotiating a new Veterans' Entitlements Act which has left many of his constituency-the veterans of Australia-very disappointed in his representation on behalf of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Sir Williams Keys was incorrect in thinking that this was the reason for my one word of interjection when Senator Tate was speaking in that debate, because I was not in fact adverting particularly to his role in the integration negotiations; I was thinking back to 1987 when Sir William Keys was travelling in the Prime Minister's VIP jet during the election campaign. I was in Townsville campaigning for local candidates and I heard Sir Williams Keys give interviews about the defence policy of the Government and the defence policy of the Opposition. That was the incident which stood out in my mind as I made that interjection. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose to read some correspondence which passed between me and Sir William Keys at that time. That will indicate why I called Sir William Keys a `stooge'. On 25 June 1987 I wrote to Sir William Keys, as National President of the RSL, as follows--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I think that Senator Newman is taking advantage of the Committee of Privileges report to give a justification for using the term which she did. She is using this occasion to repeat the term, as she did just then, and is now offering an explanation or justification, from her recollection and some correspondence, for what she said she had in the back of her mind but never explained to the Senate at the time of the original remark which gave offence. I believe, therefore, that she could be contravening the clear understanding of this particular procedure, which is to give a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia an opportunity to respond to a charge or an allegation or, in this case, a misdescription of a person. I believe that to take up the terminology and then try to justify it merely compounds the offence-if I may put it so highly-which allowed the Privileges Committee to come to the conclusion that this particular response ought to be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order: Mr Deputy President, you will be aware-as obviously the Minister is not-that when the Privileges Committee makes a report to the Parliament it makes no judgment on the material contained therein. You will also be aware, as I have already stated, that when I referred to Sir William as a `stooge' it was by way of a one-word interjection on a speech by Senator Tate. I had no opportunity after that to explain why I used that word and in what context. Clearly in Sir William's response, which was published in the report of the Committee, he took it to be based on the integration of the hospitals. I am now endeavouring to explain that in fact it was quite a different matter. I think the Senate is entitled to know the reason for that, as Sir William Keys is in fact entitled to respond if he believes that this is an incorrect description of him, based on a totally different set of circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I am writing to express my deep concern and anger at your comments on Government and Opposition Defence policy which have been widely reported in the media yesterday and today. </PARA>
<PARA> My strong outrage stems from the clear bias and inaccuracy in your remarks which hardly accords with your position of National President of the RSL, where neutrality and accuracy are expected. That they were also made when you were travelling with the Prime Minister's election band wagon only makes them more deplorable and partisan. I first heard your remarks only hours after I had attended a meeting with Army and RAAF service wives in Townsville. At that meeting, during discussions of the plight of servicemen and servicewomen and their families, they pointed out that numbers of other ranks with children were at, or below the poverty line, and that a Sergeant (Level 4) with five children would only be $5 worse off on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA> The disgraceful decline in living standards of our service personnel, which you choose to ignore, makes your selective comments so outrageous. Worse, conditions of service should be a prime concern of your organisation, but seem to be totally ignored. I cannot believe that your indifference reflects the views of the RSL, but as far as I am aware, yours is the only statement during the election campaign, from the RSL. </PARA>
<PARA> If you had even read the Opposition Defence Policy you would be aware of the practical thrust of our proposal to help service families, but at the same time ensure capital purchases are maintained in the long-run. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an increase of 74% in total wastage, and 102% in officer loss in 1986, compared to when Labor took office. In the light of the numbers who resigned from the services last year, and which appear that they will be repeated this year, action has been taken to retain those trained personnel who are needed to operate our capital equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Party is not intending to renege on capital equipment programmes, as you inferred! We believe that the high costs of training 8,000 men and women we need to replace last years losses, is evidence enough of the savings which can be made within the Defence budget, if we can stem the bleeding. Just the basic recruit training for the replacements of last years losses will be approximately $8,500 per recruit. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, I clearly will not have time to read all of this letter in which I spelled out to Sir William Keys the details of the problems Australia was facing with its defence force personnel. I concluded the letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> By your statements you have given moral support in a very public way to the Government Defence Policy, while failing to draw attention to its defects in the area of personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I clearly recognise the right of the RSL to criticise the policies of both the Government and the Opposition, indeed, this can be a very valuable contribution to maintaining the debate on defence at a public level in the nation.

<PARA> It costs approximately $2m to train a pilot simply to the stage where he joins his Squadron. We recently lost a Squadron Leader instructor who had already cost the tax payer $15m for his training. But it is not only pilots who we are losing; senior NCOs and Middle-ranging officers are leaving in unacceptable numbers. The present Government has so far, over the past 4 1/2 years, only made gestures at improving the lot of these servicemen, and their families who are leaving the ADF, particularly because their families are finding service life so much tougher than it is in civvy street. </PARA>
<PARA> The application for pay increases by the Chief of the Defence Forces is opposed by his own Department and they are delayed interminably. They live in substandard accommodation, on unsatisfactory rates of pay, with educational problems for their children and employment difficulties for their wives. </PARA>
<PARA> This very Government which you defend, has taken away 2% of their retirement pension paid under the DFRDB Scheme, originally for one year, but now continuing, apparently, forever. </PARA>

You would have saved yourself a lot of time and the taxpayer a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA>As a politician you should surely understand how the press takes things out of context and how they distort the true meaning of what you have said. I have given a full report of my visit to Townsville and Weipa to the National Executive and I enclose a copy of that report with this letter. </PARA>
<PARA>Might I conclude by saying that I greatly resent your suggestion that I have acted against the interest of the people in uniform. The RSL has been battling for years to improve conditions of service and my visit to Townsville with the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister was to lobby for improvement in areas that we felt needed attention. You of all people should know that the three absolute requirements of successful lobbying are, first, to have a good case, secondly to be talking to the right people and thirdly, to be talking at the right time. All of those conditions applied in my discussions with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who is Sir William Keys, the man described by Senator Newman as a Government stooge? Sir William Keys served with distinction in the Second World War and the Korean War. He was 10 years the National President of the Returned Services League (RSL), he was National Secretary of the RSL from 1971 to 1978, he served under Prime Ministers from Menzies right through to Hawke, and he was regarded by many people in that area as fair and impartial and a great defender of the rights of veterans and ex-servicemen. He was also a man who could negotiate adequately, strongly and intelligently with governments of all persuasion, and yet Senator Newman uses this chamber to vilify that man, that great Australian, and call him a stooge. This is why we have a system of allowing someone who is lambasted, vilified and defamed in this place to respond to the Privileges Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Newman, having abused this place, ought to apologise to Sir William Keys and, in passing, given the report of the previous Privileges Committee, ought to apologise to that public servant who was found to have been doing his duty in the most appropriate way. Senator Newman would neither be woman enough nor man enough to do so, but I challenge her to do it for once and to make sure that the name of this Senate is not in any way brought into disrepute by her actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that there needs to be a formal mechanism of notification to a senator after the Senate Committee of Privileges makes a decision relative to that senator. Honourable senators will be pleased to know that I was completely unaware that my statement relating to Sir William Keys was referred to the Committee and that the Committee had made a decision that a response be incorporated in Hansard. However, I was disturbed that the first intimation that any of this had occurred was a verbal communication from the Chairman of the Committee a few seconds before the Senate session in which the report was tabled. It seems to me that it is a discourtesy to a senator if a person can reach agreement with a committee of the Senate and this decision is not immediately and formally conveyed to the senator before the report is tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir William Keys addressed the National Conference of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) on 26 May this year and said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a relative new boy to this whole question of the various professions, their place in Australia's community and national life and the way in which professionals come into Australia as part of the migrant flow, I look forward very much to obtaining thoughts and ideas from you and discussing many of the issues that present obstacle  . . . So let me say immediately that I am here very much more to learn than inform, and I would hope we can work together, be frank with each other but agree on a common objective-</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, I want the AMA to assert its leadership role in this matter. In my view it can best do that by:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Actively seeking to extend automatic recognition of medical qualifications beyond the present limit of New Zealand and the United Kingdom, while allowing those without automatic registration the opportunity to demonstrate their competence. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Actively promoting and participating in the development of national competency-based skills standards against which overseas medical practitioners not automatically recognised can be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>In his statement to the Privileges Committee he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The merits of the points I made were specifically endorsed by the Australian Medical Council which, as a result of its own review, greatly changed the assessment procedure to make it a far more practical process and thus give overseas trained-doctors a far greater prospect of obtaining recognition and registration. </PARA>
<PARA>On 3 August, the former Chairman of the Australia Medical Council Committee, Professor Ralph Blacket, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Just as entry into (Australian) medical schools is limited for high school leavers, so too should entry of foreign medical graduates into Australia. At present we have reverse discrimination against Australians . . . The number of foreign graduates sitting the examination for the first time has grown from 119 in 1978 to 307 last year. </PARA>
<PARA>If the number of candidates continues to grow at the same rate they will equal the annual output of four Australian medical schools by 1994 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On 5 August, Dr Bruce Shepherd, the President of the AMA, said:</PARA>
<PARA>With over 900 foreign medical graduates sitting for the Australian Medical Council examination next year the figure has now reached something like three quarters of the total number of medical students graduating in final year medicine in Australian Universities. </PARA>
<PARA>On 11 October, the Australian Medical Council produced an interim report, which has been circulated. It expects to produce its final report early in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> In the press yesterday the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and the AMA President, Dr Bruce Shepherd, jointly announced:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the paradox of an oversupply of GPs in cities and a shortage in other areas meant that they would have to look closely at medical workforce issues. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Australian newspaper today, the Reader in Physiology at the University of Queensland, Dr R. B. Cross, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In a quiet year we admit the equivalent of the output of up to four small medical schools, and this might soon increase to the point where few existing schools could be justified. </PARA>
<PARA>I revert to Sir William Keys's statement, and I think this proves my point. He arrived back five days before this meeting, not a day, as I said. He said that he was a relatively new boy to this whole question and he then stated a position completely out of touch with the vast majority of informed opinion, an opinion that could only have been that of the Government. My case rests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment merely on the procedures that have been adopted during this debate which I think bear on the matter that Senator Tate attempted to raise initially. It seems to me that we have here a situation in which somebody has been mentioned in the Senate, and I will not make any comment about whether those remarks were derogatory or not. But a remark was made and a mechanism has been provided wherein people have a right to correct in their minds any objective or subjective perceived slight on their person. It would seem to me that it is very unwise of the Senate to now in any way reopen that issue. The mechanism should be closed at that point. Otherwise further things may be said-and may, indeed, have been said-in this debate this afternoon which will cause Sir William Keys to come back and perhaps seek a further hearing before the Privileges Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I merely want to put before the Senate the proposition that the processes that we have seen in train in the last 35 minutes or so are potentially dangerous and very time wasting. Perhaps the Senate should refer back to the Privileges Committee the rights of senators to appear before that Committee and thrash the matter out there before the reports come back into the chamber. I can foresee that we could well get into very considerable time wasting-slanging between senators in this chamber and people outside the chamber-with no really satisfactory resolution at all. I simply make that point and put it to other senators that perhaps we should refer back to the Privileges Committee for some sort of report the procedures which we have seen adopted here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a member of the Privileges Committee. Of course, I do not speak for the Privileges Committee; I am speaking to the motion before the Senate that the Senate take note of the report of the Privileges Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I disagree entirely with Senator Aulich, and it was his speech that brought me to the chamber. I suppose I do not deny him the right to come in here and give a hyped-up speech against a senator from his own State whom he happens to think is a target that he can attack in this debate. I think Senator Aulich's comments were extravagant. While, no doubt, he has the good intention of defending a person who, in his view, has contributed to Australia so very well-Sir William Keys-that is no excuse for the attack that he made on the right of freedom of speech and the right of senators on both sides of this chamber, including Senator Newman and Senator Herron, to make statements. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I disagree with Senator Coulter that it is inappropriate for the Senate to take note of any report from a committee of this Senate. Whilst there is, of course, the danger of something else being said about a person who has been mentioned in the Senate-it has actually happened on at least one occasion-the procedure is still appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I directly defend Senator Newman's right to speak here this afternoon. I believe that it is entirely appropriate for Senator Newman to speak to the motion. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard a point of order from Senator Tate in which he asked the Chair to rule whether it was appropriate for Senator Newman to be speaking in the way that she was. I believe that the Chair ruled correctly against Senator Tate's attempted point of order, that it was entirely right for Senator Newman to continue in the way that she had begun. I noted that the Deputy President said that perhaps, if there were any substantial dispute, it could be referred to the Privileges Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say, therefore, in defence of all 76 senators in this place, that it was entirely appropriate for Senator Newman, being a person mentioned in this report, to get up and speak as she did. It is right for her to give a response to a statement that has been made by a citizen of Australia in a form acceptable to the Standing Orders and the Privileges Committee. She said what was in her mind when she made an interjection. She gave evidence through letters that she had exchanged with Sir William Keys, which showed her very real grievance against what appeared to her to be a bias, or a selective assessment of the policies of a government and an Opposition with regard to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter arose during a debate on a matter of public importance in which Senator Tate spoke for the Government and Senator Newman and Senator Herron spoke for the Opposition. Real concern was expressed in this place about what is best to be done to provide for veterans whom we honour. </PARA>
<PARA> Accusations were made by the Opposition, quite rightly, that the Government was not serving veterans to the best of its ability. The Government speaker, the Minister, Senator Tate, quoted Sir William Keys as a very well qualified witness to support his case. Sir William Keys was brought into the debate as a highly qualified witness in support of the notion of integration of hospitals to provide care for veterans. Senator Tate may well express that view. But, in relation to Senator Newman's interjection, she has explained what was in her mind that led her to say, `This witness is not in every respect a person whom we can accept as bona fide in making objective judgments about policies'. Our senator has the freedom of speech to make such a statement. It is unfortunate that in an interjection of two words it is not possible to express all that is in one's mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to give any defence of Senator Herron. He has made his position very clear. He has every right to speak of his own disappointment at the contribution made by Sir William Keys at a conference he attended. As a former President of the Australian Medical Association in Queensland, it is entirely right for him to give that assessment. The fact is that Sir William disputed two or three of the statements that were made on factual grounds. That is no longer disputed. Under the procedures of the Senate any citizen has the right to appeal to the Senate or to the President to have a matter referred to the Privileges Committee. The Privileges Committee has the right to accept a matter without giving any assessment of its own as to the rights and wrongs of the statement on the basis that the statement is the genuine statement of the aggrieved person, who has been mentioned in the Senate, and that the words are in the form required by the Standing Orders. That is all. It is entirely right for freedom of speech to continue in this chamber and for any senator to say what is appropriate when the Senate takes note of a report. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Senator Herron's initial point, that there ought to be a more fail-safe procedure for alerting senators to their being mentioned in any report of the Privileges Committee. I personally have had discussions about this matter in recent days. I have already placed the item on the agenda of today's meeting of the Privileges Committee. I believe that senators ought to have very good notice that a report that concerns them may be coming down. In this case, the Privileges Committee considered the matter on the same day as Sir William Keys agreed to a form of words in the statement eventually brought to us, the subject of the report before the Senate now. It was only when we were dealing with the very first item of business the next morning that the report of the Privileges Committee was tabled in the Senate. It was a very quick procedure and I think embarrassment was caused to two senators because they were inadequately warned that the report was coming down. They had no knowledge at all of the submission of Sir William Keys to the President of the Senate, as only the Privileges Committee knew of that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those reflections on my own part. I believe that we have a satisfactory procedure. When we adopted this procedure two years ago, we made sure that we affirmed that this would in no wise restrict the freedom of speech of senators in this chamber. If there was any thought of any restriction of freedom of speech in this chamber, I believe that there would be a great rush of senators into this place to join with me in affirming the right of Senator Newman and Senator Herron to speak as they have done today. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a reference was made to an earlier Privileges Committee report with regard to asbestos in naval ships. I do not need to defend Senator Newman; she has done so very adequately herself. But the matter in that reference to the Privileges Committee was not about Senator Newman; it was about whether a public servant had or had not misled the Senate. On the evidence it was entirely appropriate for a senator having doubts, having misgivings, having prima facie evidence, to have this matter referred to the Privileges Committee. It is a grave failing on the part of any public servant or any witness to a Senate committee to mislead that committee or to mislead the Senate. In this case we looked at the evidence carefully and we found that there was not a misleading. </PARA>

The relevant definition of a stooge is one who acts on behalf of another, especially in an obsequious, corrupt, or secretive fashion. To use those terms about Sir William Keys is to engage, under privilege, in what I would call a real vilification of a great Australian. The freedoms and privileges of this chamber carry with them responsibilities as far as the words that we utter are concerned, particularly when those words are uttered about a citizen who has no recourse. However, now the Senate has provided, very properly, through the Privileges Committee, a process whereby those remarks can be, and have been, answered.</PARA></TALK.START>

Sir William Keys has sufficiently answered the points that Senator Herron raised as matters of fact. Senator Herron has acknowledged that, as to matters of fact, he was wrong. At least he had the grace to do that. However, Senator Newman's response to this letter from Sir William Keys, which the Privileges Committee has determined ought to be presented to the Senate, has not been in such terms.

<PARA>THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</PARA>
<PARA>PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5 (7) (b) OF THE SENATE OF</PARA>
<PARA>25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>In the Senate on Thursday, 15 November, I was the target of most insulting remarks from Senators Newman and Herron. I write to ask that my response to these attacks and to the issues from which they arose might be presented to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Newman referred to me as a Government ` `stooge'' because of my support for hospital integration. Let me begin by saying that for 27 years, 17 as National Secretary and 10 as National President of the RSL, I was the principal negotiator for the war veterans and dependants of Australia. In this role I developed sound working relations with Prime Ministers from Robert Menzies to Robert Hawke. I believe I also had the respect and confidence of my own constituency and the Ministers and Governments of the day, regardless of their political persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA>The results achieved for veterans and dependants over that period are a matter of record and speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I briefly retrace this history of my efforts for veterans and dependants to make the point that Senator Newman's interjection was not only deeply offensive, it was untrue. I am nobody's ` `stooge'' and never have been. The views I express are at all times my own. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not the personal attack on me which concerns me: rather, it is the attack on the concept of integration. As National President of the RSL I negotiated the integration arrangements with Prime Minister Hawke and Veterans' Affairs Minister Humphreys. The views expressed in my letter, quoted by Senator Tate, represented views adopted by organisations such as the Korea and South East Asia Forces Association and the TPI Association. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, in supporting Senator Newman's attack, Senator Herron was incorrect in his statement to the Senate in relation to a National Conference of the AMA on 26 May at which I spoke. </PARA>
<PARA>He said I had returned from overseas that morning. In fact, I had returned 5 days before. </PARA>
<PARA>He said I had delivered a speech that I had not actually read. In fact, the speech I read was the third draft of an address on which I had worked with the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) in which I provided the general thrust and the professional people provided the supporting data-a fairly normal procedure for such a speech. </PARA>
<PARA>He is correct in saying that I did anger my audience. I told them if they did not adopt a more flexible attitude to the assessment of the professional skills of overseas-trained doctors, they were in danger of becoming irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA>The merits of the points I made were subsequently endorsed by the Australian Medical Council which, as a result of its own review, greatly changed its assessment procedure to make it a far more practical process and thus give overseas-trained doctors a far greater prospect of obtaining recognition and registration. </PARA>

In the course of the debate to do with the integration of the repatriation hospital system with the hospital systems in the States and Territories, the word `stooge' was uttered. Any listener to the broadcast or any reader of the Hansard record of that debate would have drawn the conclusion that Sir William Keys was being called a stooge in relation to that particular issue. Senator Newman could have taken the opportunity, had she thought she had been misunderstood, on the adjournment that night or by seeking leave immediately after the debate, to clear up the situation and to say, `No, it was not that'.

<PARA> Senator Newman says that this happened about three years ago, this terrible event in the annals of the political process in Australia. The honourable senator ought to take account of what John Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition, said at the opening ceremony of the RSL National Congress at the Australian Defence Force Academy on Monday, 5 September 1988, which is after her apparent dispute with Sir William. Mr John Howard, whom I think most Australians would take to be a very honest and fair man-certainly to my knowledge he has never been asked to withdraw a defamatory comment in the House of Representatives about an Australian citizen-said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can certainly say on behalf of my colleagues that Bill has been a very faithful representative of your organisation-a hard bargainer, and a reasonable person to deal with as well. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the description by John Howard of Sir William Keys. I think it is miles removed from the description which Senator Newman used of Sir William Keys, and I believe that the Australian people would accept the judgment of John Howard rather than Senator Newman in regard to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Might I speak for just a minute or two on the report in a general sense. When these provisions in the Standing Orders were being deliberated upon and were circulated for comment, I was the first to write to the committee looking at them, embracing them. I suspect it is not an exaggeration to say that there was nobody subject to more vilification, more lies and more personal attacks than I was for some years prior to coming into this Parliament. Those attacks were conducted by Senator Walsh, much to the enjoyment of a number of his colleagues on the other side who are now so indignant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Deputy President, this matter is inexorably drawing to a conclusion while, of course, the benefits of the report will continue to flow on. It continues to unravel. There is one particular matter I want to address in the very short time I have available to me that relates to a particular incident. The concern I have is that it reflects, frankly, on the competence, the capacity and the integrity of some of our sporting officials which has led to the problems we have now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interim report disclosed that the assistant manager of the Australian track and field team for the Edinburgh Games, Mr Maurice Plant, had sought to cheat by trying to get, and he succeeded, from a young Australian athlete who was subject to his direct supervision, a clean urine sample and to substitute that for the urine sample which was supposed to be given by an athlete who had just competed in an event. Mr Plant assumed that that athlete had cheated by taking anabolic steroids and therefore would test positive and thus be disqualified. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee, of course, had some concern about that matter and thought it sufficiently serious to inquire as to what steps had been taken by Athletics Australia Inc. to inquire into the matter-I would have thought not an unreasonable concern or request. As a result of that, Athletics Australia was written to on 9 March 1989, at least on the first occasion, and it responded on 22 August, some five months later. The response was from a Jeanette Brown, acting general manager, and she advised the committee that Athletics Australia's inquiries had been particularly limited-she did not say so, but that was the upshot of her correspondence-because Miss Jane Flemming, the young athlete from whom the sample had been solicited, declined to comment on the matter other than to say that she had produced a sample. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the problems that arose with Miss Flemming not prepared to make a written statement, a mail vote to Associations conducted at that time amended the law regarding investigations to read:</PARA>
<PARA>``If the person or club or association concerned fails to respond to the request for a Statutory Declaration within the specified time, the person, club or association shall be suspended forthwith until such time as the response is received.''</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, it sought to ensure that Athletics Australia had a proper mechanism in place to allow it to inquire properly as to matters of this nature. That motion and that rule were introduced because Miss Flemming was not only unhelpful but, in fact, she covered for Maurice Plant and she actively obstructed the inquiry. However, no inquiry appeared, to my knowledge, to have been made in respect of Mr Plant. Accordingly, Athletics Australia was written to and asked a number of questions relating to Mr Plant. On 6 August, it wrote back to the Committee and observed:</PARA>
<PARA>The I.A.A.F.-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the International Amateur Athletics Federation-</PARA>
<PARA>which is Athletics Australia's governing body, and the British Amateur Athletic Board have both investigated these specific matters and have resolved to continue their professional relationship with Mr Plant. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Athletics Australia believes it would be counter-productive to impose any continuing penalty on Mr Plant in these circumstances. As stated in our letter of March 12th, 1990, Mr Plant will not be appointed to any managerial positions with Australian Athletic Teams and it is therefore our firm request that the matter should rest. </PARA>
<PARA>Following that correspondence we were told that the International Amateur Athletic Federation had inquired into the matter. I wrote to that Federation and asked what correspondence, facts, circumstances and events it took into consideration in making the inquiry in the determination which was referred to us by Athletics Australia. The response from the International Amateur Athletic Federation was in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>IAAF has not specifically discussed the incident in Belfast. It would not be appropriate for us to do so, as the meeting concerned was not one conducted directly by IAAF. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federation went on to say that it understood that the matter had been satisfactorily dealt with by Athletics Australia, which was a clear contradiction. The correspondence we received from Athletics Australia was, frankly, thoroughly untrue. The Committee was misled. There was no inquiry by the International Amateur Athletic Federation and, if I had not bothered to write to the United Kingdom seeking that information, to this moment that knowledge would not be available to us. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other point I will touch on in the very few moments that remain to me in this debate. I inquired what Mr Plant's duties were and his relationship with young Australian athletes on the International Amateur Athletic Federation grand prix circuit. I was advised by Athletics Australia that the IAAF council decides from time to time in its discretion both to establish commissions and to determine the membership thereof. Athletics Australia is not involved whatsoever; consultation is not sought. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I raised those questions is that I thought it was very inappropriate that a man who had conducted himself in the way Mr Plant had should still hold that position. But I was assured by Athletics Australia that he was in that position and that the appointment was made without-to quote Athletics Australia- `even their consultation'. They had no input into that appointment. I wrote in respect of that matter to the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which wrote back to me in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Plant was nominated by the IAAF-</PARA>
<PARA>and then one sees in brackets-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . (and with the approval of Athletics Australia) as a member of our IAAF Grand Prix Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>In one letter from the IAAF it repudiated what had been said and found two lies that had been told to me and to the Committee by Mr Prince, a member of the Australian Sports Commission, and by Mr King, the Executive Officer for Athletics Australia. It is for these fundamental reasons that we now find ourselves setting up a publicly funded Australian Drugs Sports Agency because we cannot trust the integrity or the honesty of officials of this calibre at this level to conduct themselves in a proper and appropriate way. They cannot be allowed to be involved in testing because we cannot be satisfied, and clearly nor can the Government, that we will receive the facts and that the tests will be conducted in an uncorrupted way. It seems to me a great indictment that people of this calibre are on these bodies. </PARA>

<PARA>As a member of the Joint House Committee, let me say that by and large it works effectively, however sadly it finds that much of its time is occupied-perhaps preoccupied-with matters of no great moment and consequence, while other matters which are perhaps more fundamental to the functioning of the Parliament are not addressed. That is not a criticism, but simply is inevitable as a result of the limited time available. It should be remembered that the Joint House Committee is only an advisory body to the Presiding Officers.

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my remarks in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The report which I have just tabled deals with construction of a network of over-the-horizon radars, together with associated facilities. This network will consist of radars in the Longreach area of Queensland and the Leonora region of Western Australia, a coordination centre at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia, and a number of very small, remote beacons and sounders. The cost of the public works aspects of the proposal is $95 million. </PARA>
<PARA>The Jindalee radar works on the transmitted signal from an object being reflected off the ionosphere before illuminating a target area on the earth's surface. Use of the ionosphere enables the radar to `see' over the horizon for distances up to 2000 kilometres from Australia's northern coastline. </PARA>
<PARA>Referral to the Committee was based on an agreed ceiling price of $125 million for the public works aspects of the project. During the Committee's considerations, the cost estimate was revised to $95 million. Based on revised tenders, this was made up of $40 million for each of the radar facilities, $10 million for the coordination centre and $5 million for the remote beacons and sounders. We have asked for details of the split of expenditure on the antennas and other facilities when a contract is awarded. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee accepted that there was a need to establish the Jindalee network to carry out effective surveillance of ship and aircraft movements up to 2000 kilometres from Australia's northern coastline. To provide optimum performance, radars need to be located in the Leonora area of Western Australia and in the Longreach area of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Defence proposed that, instead of using the more traditional `design and construct' method, it would use the `turnkey' approach. In this approach, all works will be provided by the prime equipment contractor as an integral part of building the radar and all the services which go with the prime contract. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has recommended that Defence provide it with an analysis of the effectiveness of the turnkey approach at the end of the project, concentrating on its cost, co-ordination and timing aspects compared with traditional project delivery systems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has a continuing interest in the efficient use of energy and was very concerned about the forecast consumption of fuel at the radars together with problems associated with connection to the Queensland state power grid. Accordingly, we have recommended that a high priority be given to overcoming these problems; that the use of alternative energy sources, especially solar energy, be fully investigated for their application to the project; and that discussions be held with adjoining landowners being consulted about connection to the state grid. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Department of Defence believed it had carried out an adequate program of consultation with the Longreach community, we have recommended a further program be undertaken, based on that which was part of the public environment Report process in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Longreach area, there were community concerns about the project, and some submissions opposed it. There were also submissions in favour of the project and a considerable number of individual expressions of support. We took an amount of evidence in Longreach, from both groups, and believe that after Defence personnel had given evidence on a range of issues these local concerns had largely been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>These concerns centred on the effects of electromagnetic radiation as people, stock and buildings would be within a 25 kilometre radius of a site proposed for the transmitter. A considerable amount of evidence was taken, and supplementary material provided, on this subject and Committee accepts advice that the appropriate Australian Standard and design standards are being applied. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, it believes an urgent independent assessment should be made of the electromagnetic effect of a Jindalee transmitter at the site proposed near Longreach. </PARA>
<PARA>This was a particularly interesting inquiry which saw the Committee inspect likely sites in the Leonora and Longreach areas, hold public hearings in Kalgoorlie and Longreach, and visit the existing Jindalee Facility at Alice Springs. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all the people who helped us during that long and eventful week. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the eighty-fourth conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I seek leave to make a short statement on this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was privileged to be a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) delegation, together with the Speaker, Leo McLeay, the Hon. Clyde Holding, Mrs Kathy Sullivan, and Mr Max Burr. I hope that, despite the heavy load on honourable senators, they will take the time to read this coverage of the eighty-fourth conference of the IPU, as it includes a number of very important and most topical resolutions and recommendations. With due deference to time constraints, I would like to run through some of the major issues as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I wish to highlight two supplementary and emergency items. The first detailed support of all parliaments for the United Nations resolutions condemning the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq and the search for means likely to re-establish peace in the Arab-Persian Gulf. The second emergency item related to support for United Nations Security Council resolution 672, concerning the violence against Palestinian civilians in the holy places of Islam on 8 November 1990 and the need to adopt appropriate measures to protect the Palestinian people. The full text of these resolutions is provided on pages 93 and 99 and both resolutions were passed with acclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The conference agenda focused on two major issues: firstly, eliminating colonialism and its consequences in strengthening cooperation between developed and developing countries, and exploring different models of regional cooperation; and, secondly, an issue in which I was especially interested and monitored all areas of the debate was literacy and education as essential factors in the liberation of women and men to promote their participation in the democratic life and necessary instruments for development. </PARA>
<PARA> These two major items for debate involved six plenary sessions and 157 speakers. Madam Acting Deputy President, as you can appreciate, the sessions were lively with extensive debate resulting in numbers of resolutions going into the Inter-Parliamentary Union committees for further study and, hopefully, action. The conference devoted three sittings to the general debate on the political, social and economic situation in the world in which the leader of the Australian delegation, the Hon. Leo McLeay, spoke of Australia's commitment to promoting freer trade. As members of the Australian delegation, we were all delighted that Mr McLeay was also successful in being elected to the IPU executive committee. I am sure that all senators will congratulate him not only in his capacity as representing both Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important outcomes of this eighty-fourth IPU conference was the increased participation of women parliamentarians, which now stands at 16 per cent of all participants at the latest IPU conference, that is, 59 women from 39 countries. Women parliamentarians met for one day prior to the conference, and a number of us met on the final day to assess progress and future action. Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you will be interested to know that it is only a few short years ago that the response from the IPU to requests for women to have a special session was to invite them all to an afternoon tea. Clearly, a great deal of progress has taken place since that somewhat paternalistic response. The women parliamentarians were not only vocal at their own day conference but also were very visible in all areas of the conference during the week. Participants at the special women's meeting proposed this item for inclusion in the agenda of the eighty-fifth conference:</PARA>
<PARA>Policies to put an end to violence against children and women in private life, in social customs and in situations of marginalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>We were very pleased that that was adopted by the full and final session of the IPU. Other recommendations of special relevance to women and children are detailed on pages 35 to 39. I am sure all senators will welcome initiatives to focus greater attention on women within the IPU and, therefore, women around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kathy Sullivan was a member of the drafting committee on the item of the elimination of colonialism. I am sure that, as the first permanent woman member of an Australian IPU delegation, Mrs Sullivan will continue to actively monitor a range of issues, especially as it was her item that was approved by the women's conference to amend the statutes of the IPU to include gender as a criterion for selection to all important and influential drafting committees. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that all countries are now requested by the IPU executive to include at least one woman in their delegations. Regrettably, not all countries are complying, but Australia has had a very good record, certainly this time with one permanent delegate and me as the second woman of a five-person delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> Time prevents my detailing other important outcomes of the eighty-fourth IPU conference. However, I would like to draw special attention to the resolution relating to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which in summary: welcomed the declaration and plan of action of the World Summit for Children; urged national groups to press governments to early ratification and implementation of the convention and to ensure adequate financial resources; and called on national parliaments to monitor the implementation of the World Summit for Children plan of action and the convention. I trust that all senators will support the Government when formal ratification proceeds. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to take this opportunity to say it is regrettable that there has been such a campaign of misinformation against the convention. Perhaps in the spirit of the season we can all focus attention on the need for governments in Australia and, indeed, around the world to focus more specifically on the needs of children and to ensure that more adequate resources are directed towards children. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it would be remiss of me not to congratulate Mr John Dyer and the officers who were responsible for the very speedy completion of this report. I understand that on some occasions reports from IPU conferences can be much later in their finalisation and tabling. I would like to congratulate them on this most comprehensive report, and the fact that we are able to table it today and see just how relevant so many of its resolutions are. I commend it to all honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter related to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. The Bill enforces the Government's stated policy of encouraging unions to amalgamate and makes relevant the provisions in this legislation to make that process easier. It is the teeth behind this entire proposal. In considering this Bill, it is very important that we place the attitudes of the Opposition into context on this matter so that we can fully understand and appreciate why it does oppose a number of clauses, and reject its position accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was suggested at the second reading stage by some Opposition senators that this Bill and the Government's push for amalgamations was simply a result of the Government trying to appease the Australian Council of Trade Unions and various undefined union interests. It was further argued that because of this only evil left wing union bureaucrats would benefit. Conspiracy theories are not new or even very novel things, but that particular one would have to be one of the silliest that I have ever heard. The facts are there for all who choose not to ignore them. </PARA>
<PARA> Five independent studies have identified the reduction in the number of unions as an important step in achieving a more cohesive and successful industrial relations system. This Bill in particular will achieve that aim in place of irrational debate on the merits or otherwise of this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> At the second reading stage the Opposition merely pointed to a document produced by Bill Kelty three years ago which argued for reforms along similar lines to those being proposed by the Government. Before we know it, we have a conspiracy on behalf of left wing trade unionists! This initial suspicion of the Bill seems to have tainted it completely in the eyes of Opposition members because they seem completely unable to deal with it on a rational level. Their opposition to this clause is indicative of this phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA> At the second reading stage their criticisms of the amalgamation provisions fell into one of either two categories: either the proposal is no good because it will not achieve its stated aim of reducing the number of unions in each individual workplace or, more importantly, in the eyes of Opposition members it is bad because entrenching large unions would make it even more difficult for the Opposition's much heralded policy of enterprise bargaining to be implemented if and when the unfortunate happens and members of the Opposition stumble into government. </PARA>
<PARA> Occasionally when speaking on this matter, Opposition members stray from these criticisms on to less relevant but no doubt more satisfying areas of out and out union bashing. It might be worth looking at these remarks, if time permits, for if anything could be said to be the intellectual underpinning of the Opposition's position and its direct rejection of this clause, this is it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Eighty-two per cent of workers in this country are covered by private sector awards. Unfortunately, some 47 per cent are not receiving, according to the latest statistics, the superannuation entitlements accorded them as benefits under private sector awards. Clearly, something is seriously wrong when almost half the workers in the private work force who are entitled to superannuation are not receiving it. The proposed amendments in this Bill to the Industrial Relations Act go a substantial way, I hope, to addressing the problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of background, until five or six years ago the vast majority of private sector workers received no superannuation at all. The lucky few who did tended to be in industries that had very substantial bargaining power in terms of their union representation; they tended to be concentrated in higher paid jobs; and they overwhelmingly tended to be male. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the accord process, this Government initiated the introduction of superannuation for all private sector workers in this country. In my view, it is one of the most significant reforms to be carried out. Not only do workers have 3 per cent superannuation but also the intention is to ensure that this should increase to 6 per cent over the next four years. That in itself will not provide totally for persons in their retirement but it is a major achievement of this Government that we have come so far in such a short time. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that such a significant number of workers are not receiving their legal entitlements under private sector awards? From my experience as a trustee of an industry fund known as Host Plus, which covers the hospitality industry and which currently has membership of 70,000-this is expected to grow to 250,000 in the next year-there is a mixture of both ignorance and deliberate evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> From my experience in the hospitality industry, there is certainly considerable ignorance by employers about their obligations in respect of industry superannuation. I suppose that is not unexpected given the nature of superannuation and the requirements that are necessary under the various awards. However-and I regret to say it-in many instances there is deliberate evasion by employers. </PARA>
<PARA> It annoys me particularly that although employers I deal with would quite ruthlessly deal with workers who steal money-that is, they would dismiss them and quite rightly so because stealing cannot be condoned-a significant number of those employers are stealing from their workers by not providing their superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example, it has been drawn to my attention that in some instances in the hospitality industry employers simply do not provide workers with the appropriate documentation for superannuation, which they are required to complete. In fact, they deliberately discourage their work force from completing that documentation and, hence, they avoid paying superannuation. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that in many workplaces in the hospitality industry there is a 100 per cent compliance in terms of the work force and yet in other workplaces there are many instances of 100 per cent of the work force not receiving superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, this is because many employers deliberately discourage employees from belonging to funds in order to avoid their 3 per cent obligation. Clearly, if that is allowed to continue, it can only become worse in the sense that workers over the next four years will become entitled to 6 per cent under the accord. The retirement policy of this Government and this nation will be severely weakened if employers do not meet their award obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to see the amendments before the Senate today which provide effective mechanisms to ensure that employers meet their obligations. They provide effective mechanisms in the following way: firstly, it certainly seems to me absurd that if an employer is caught not paying the award obligation in the case of superannuation, interest is not payable on the outstanding amount. I would like to demonstrate the cost to the employee of the failure of an employer to pay interest. With your consent, Madam Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate a table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table I wish to incorporate contains an actuarial set of figures prepared by an insurance company. It is based on wages ranging from $10,000, $20,000 to $30,000 a year; a calculation is made in terms of a 3 per cent contribution; interest of either 12 per cent or 15.5 per cent is added-it obviously will vary; and then a final figure, including interest, is given of the amount a person would be entitled to after 25 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one excludes the interest figure-in other words, if an employer is able to avoid paying interest on the moneys, the 3 per cent that he or she is obliged to pay-the effective amount of money that a worker receives is 83 per cent less than that worker should have received. In other words, referring to the first line of the table, a worker receiving $10,000 a year and receiving a 3 per cent superannuation contribution, which earns an average of 12 per cent interest over a 25-year period, should receive $44,800. However, if that worker does not receive his or her interest-and this is one of the important aspects of this amendment; it ensures that where an employer has not paid his or her superannuation contributions interest will also be required to be paid-all the worker receives is $7,500, not $44,800. This illustrates the appalling situation that has been occurring where employers have been caught not paying their superannuation contributions. Even if employers do pay it after having failed to pay it for some period, in many cases years, they are then obliged to pay that sum of money, including the interest that the employee has missed out on. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the major part of this piece of legislation about which I am concerned and I am very pleased to see that it is being introduced into the Industrial Relations Act. In addition to that, there is also a mechanism by which employers are required to keep records for six years. Of course, there is no practical effect in having those sorts of provisions and enforcement clauses in awards if employers are not required to keep their wage records, because it becomes very difficult to work out what employers owe their workers-whether it is superannuation or any other wage entitlement-if there are no wage records. It also becomes very difficult to prove that in a court should it become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I commend these amendments to the Senate. They are very important and they clearly mean that some hundreds of thousands of workers in this country who are not receiving their legal entitlements to superannuation will find it a lot easier to secure them through the courts if it becomes necessary. I also commend the campaign being conducted by the Arbitration Inspectorate at the present time to ensure that superannuation payments are being met by employers. I believe that the policy of this Government in terms of retirement packages and in terms of ensuring that workers receive superannuation has been one of the greatest advances for people in this country. It is an excellent example of what the Labor Government has accomplished under the accord, in very stark contrast to the miserable attempts by those opposite to ensure adequate retirement benefits for workers in this country. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the Opposition's only amendment to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. It is an important amendment and a rather lengthy one. It has been circulated and I presume it is available to senators in the chamber. The Opposition proposes to add a new clause 12a to this Bill to insert a new procedure, which would thereby make new sanctions available to improve, in our view, the enforcement provisions under the Industrial Relations Act. The code that we are suggesting is fully set out in the amendment, which has been moved in another place and I am sure is well known to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who is at the table, and to those honourable senators who are interested in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The features of the amendment include the provision that, where the Industrial Relations Commission is aware that some industrial action is taking place or is being threatened, it may, through the exercise of its conciliation or arbitration powers, give such directions to the various people concerned in that industrial action as would prevent it from occurring further. The amendment sets out to whom these directions may be given. In general terms, they would be given to those who are taking part in an industrial dispute, who may be members of an organisation, or to the organisation of which they may be members and so forth. The directions would be in the wide form of a direction to observe an award or to perform work in accordance with an award and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> That direction having been given by the Commission, it could then be enforced in the courts, such as the Federal Court of Australia. That jurisdiction could be invoked by either a Minister or a person who is a party to the dispute or who is bound by the award. If the court is satisfied that there has been a breach of a direction or relevant conduct which is similar to a breach, such as aiding a breach or something or that sort, it can do two things. It may grant an injunction to stop that sort of behaviour occurring, and we are familiar with on what grounds court injunctions can be issued. It can also award damages for any loss or damage suffered by a person if that person can establish to the court's satisfaction that that loss was suffered as a result of a breach of the direction. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the framework of the Opposition's amendment. It is a proposal of some standing in the industrial relations debate. It is not something new; it has a history over the last three years. The proposal was embodied in a Bill that Senator Chaney, the then Opposition's shadow Minister for industrial relations, introduced in the chamber in, I think, 1987. Although it failed then it was reintroduced as an amendment to the Government's Industrial Relations Bill which was passed by this chamber at the end of 1988. A similar amendment was moved at the committee stage of our consideration of that Bill by Senator Chapman on behalf of the Opposition. That amendment also failed. The Opposition is now taking the further opportunity of an Industrial Relations Act amendment to press forward its proposal once again. The Opposition is doing so because it attaches great significance to this proposal and it represents a very important feature of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Opposition's argument in support of this proposal is that when legislation imposes obligations on employers, as the Industrial Relations Act certainly does-it imposes obligations on employers to abide by awards-it should also impose enforceable obligations on employees who benefit from an award. The Bill which has been introduced by the Government, to which we are moving an amendment, proposes to improve the rights of employees who have benefits under an award. Those improved rights relate substantially to occupational superannuation, which is a new feature of awards. Difficulty has arisen in enforcing the obligation of employers in relation to their contribution to occupational superannuation funds as required under awards. </PARA>
<PARA> As that has been covered in the second reading debate, I do not propose to expand on it. But the reality is that the Government is strengthening the enforcement rights of the beneficiaries of the awards. We think this is another opportunity to emphasise the fact that this ought to be a mutual process and that there ought to be a similar provision in the Industrial Relations Act to give employers who are affected by industrial action by employees or by organisations of employees to require observance of the recognised standards of industrial behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a proposal which has been suddenly dreamt up in the last few years by the Opposition. It is a proposal that has been in the industrial relations debate for many years. It was the reason behind the introduction of bans clauses, or the power to insert bans clauses in awards, a number of years ago. Unfortunately, nobody seems to believe that the bans clauses have been very successful. A former Minister for Industrial Relations in this Government, Mr Willis, had the carriage of the major rewrite of the industrial relations legislation in October 1988. He first introduced legislation in 1987 to give effect to the Hancock Committee of Review of Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems and referred to the need for an industrial relations system which would provide equal protection to both sides of a dispute-namely, employers, or employees or their respective organisations. I do not need to go through the history of what happened to those proposals except to say that ultimately they were abandoned. The new Industrial Relations Act 1988 did not make any further improvements than the old legislation had provided. We believe, as obviously Mr Willis believed, that the Act would be improved if there were such a balancing between the rights of both sides to industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought this would be an attractive approach for a Labor government which is so committed to maintaining the existing industrial relations system with all the paraphernalia of the Commission, the award-making process and so forth, because it provides for a system of enforcement and sanctions to which employers or their organisations, or the Minister or the Government, can have recourse to ensure that the conduct of employees or their organisations does not offend the general standards that are expected in a system of conciliation and arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> When trying to conciliate or arbitrate, members of the Commission make a judgment-it is not made by a court-as to whether a certain conduct should cease. I would have thought that feature would also have been attractive to the present Government. The proposal does not take away common law rights or other legal rights under, say, section 45d of the Trade Practices Act, but it gives employers or their organisations an alternative right to seek sanctions within the existing system and thereby be very much under the control of the high priests of that system in the Industrial Relations Commission. It does not assign the same powers of outsiders as actions in common law or actions under the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Although, as I have said, the Opposition is not proposing any change in that availability to that recourse as a matter of law, and would resist suggestions that that should be the case, nevertheless, we are proposing an alternative system that would be very attractive, in our view, to employers and more acceptable to employees as indeed it was clearly acceptable as an alternative to a former Minister for Industrial Relations and the Government of which he is a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition puts forward the proposal as one which would improve the existing system. Despite our deep concerns about many aspects of that system and our other proposals to make major changes to it, we assume that for some time to come there will be a need for the present system to operate in much the same way as it is and has been doing. This is a way of providing a fair way for both sides to have recourse to enforcement provisions. Apart from the final decisions of a court, the circumstances which will give rise to those legal rights will remain very much within the control of the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing an amendment which is directed at the principal Act through the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. Senator Durack said that the Opposition places very great significance upon what is proposed for this Act. So great is the significance that he has not approached the Australian Democrats on this amendment at all. Despite conversations with Senator Durack yesterday about Opposition amendments, I knew not of its existence until it was tabled here last night. Senator Durack has not approached me since. We will determine whether the significant amendment stands or falls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must agree with Senator Durack that it is in fact a very significant amendment. It touches upon some of the most provocative areas of industrial relations. It touches upon the areas of sanctions, the right to strike and, in fact, a whole clutch of issues that were so provocative that the original legislation that was before the Parliament in 1987-the legislation that he is now seeking to amend-was pulled off before the election at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The New Right threatened to expend $9m to bring down the Government if it did not withdraw that Bill before the election before last. This amendment addresses some of the most provocative areas of industrial relations in this nation. They are so important, in fact, that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has given assurances in this place and elsewhere that they will be addressed separately in an amendment Bill in the next session. In fact, it is hard to imagine more critical or more provocative areas of industrial relations legislation than those that are addressed by this amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack did not have the courtesy to come to me, as the spokesperson in this area, and say, `We are addressing this area and it is extremely important'. This is despite the fact that we had discussions with the shadow Minister, Mr Howard, with Senator Durack and with the Minister for in excess of four months leading up to this moment. This is indicative of the contemptuous attitude which the Opposition has adopted towards this whole area of legislation. In fact, at a certain point along the line of our negotiations with the Opposition, the shadow Minister, Mr Howard, said to me-representing the Australian Democrats on these Bills-that in fact the Opposition would oppose any amendments we moved that would strengthen the legislation, and it would support any amendments which would weaken it. I do not know of a more contemptuous attitude towards the process of legislators-which they are-than is inherent in that fundamental position. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I am disgusted by what happened just yesterday, when we sought the Opposition's amendments from Senator Durack's office. We were thwarted in our attempt to get amendments to the other Bill. We sought only three lines: Senator Durack advised me that the amendments to the other Bill would be only three lines. He did not mention at any point that it was the intention of the Opposition to introduce whole new dimensions at this stage of the debate. I think that is simply indicative of the contemptuous attitude that the Opposition has adopted towards this absolutely critical legislation. I will have more to say about that later, because I feel very strongly about it. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last three days Opposition members have stood in this place and abused us on all sorts of issues. They sought, two or three days ago, to have us join them in a farcical process of blocking Supply to bring down the Government so that they could shift from their side of the chamber to the other. Presumably they would have expected us to tolerate this same contemptuous attitude in the formulation of legislation when they became the government. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say to the Opposition in relation to this amendment that this is not the place and not the way to address these very serious dimensions of industrial relations in this country. The Minister has indicated that there will be another opportunity in the next session, or the session after that, when an amending Bill addressing this whole area responsibly, deliberately and with the appropriate lead times will come before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to Senator Durack that he start negotiating with us now about any serious attempts to address the areas of sanctions, the right to strike, the industrial court and other extremely critical and serious dimensions of industrial relations and not try this stupid stunt-and it is stupid-that does little more than offend us, whose cooperation the Opposition will require if it ever makes government. It is an affront to the processes of the chamber and it is purely and simply an extension of the crude principle that was laid down to us by the shadow Minister months ago in his approach to this serious legislation. The Democrats will be opposing this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some comments I would like to make about the amendment and the compliance provisions that are before us. I am not going to be drawn by the headmasterly lecture that we have just received. I did not come to this place to be addressed in such a manner, and I would suggest to Senator McLean that there is a far more constructive way to go about things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The things that I would like to say in addressing the amendment that has been put forward by Senator Durack on behalf of the Opposition relate to what I believe is the importance of having balance in an industrial relations system. Honourable senators in this place, particularly on the other side, would know that I have some difficulty with the current industrial relations system in this country. Nonetheless, I have said on a number of occasions, and I will repeat it here, that I do believe that people have to operate in a society within the law. As such, one recognises the importance of making sure the provisions that do exist in the law are observed. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this observation about part of the direction of industrial relations policy in this country at this time: I believe that almost every form of initiative and independence is being taken away from employees. Under this Bill employers will have a legal obligation to keep records. </PARA>
<PARA> In another situation, employers are paying for training and superannuation. I ask: what fundamental and everyday rights or independence or choices will Australians next have taken away from them? It is a direction that I certainly do not like. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment Senator Durack has moved is all about balance. I think it is important that, in an industrial relations system where there is compliance, there be equal compliance on the other side. That is what this is all about. If there is no balance, there is a misuse or an abuse of power. We have consistently seen that in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I will not go into detail on this matter, but will just highlight the situation in the Australian meat industry. I believe that is the perfect example of systems getting out of balance and one side abusing the law and consistently getting away with it. I emphasise to the Minister and to other senators in this place that it is important even under this industrial relations system, which the Minister espouses and supports but which I have some difficulty with, that we have a balance between what is applied on the one side of the equation and what is applied on the other. The amendment before us today is purely and simply an endeavour to keep some balance in the current industrial relations system in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder how the Government or the Australian Democrats even propose that we overcome the dreadful reputation we have overseas of industrial disputation that is second to none; it is absolutely appalling. The Industrial Relations Commissioner comes down with a decision and the unions say, `Not on your life; we will go on strike'. And indeed they do; they hold the country to ransom; Qantas Airways Ltd has held its passengers to ransom; and builders have held companies to ransom and sent them broke, et cetera. What did the employers do? The employers are not permitted to shut out employees-and nobody suggests that they should be. I am not suggesting that, if an employer does not like the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission, he shuts out his employees and says, `I will not abide by that decision'. But the unions do that; indeed, they have said, `We will stop work until we send you broke unless you abide by our decision'.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is this the way any responsible party should behave when the country is at risk?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was quite extraordinary the other day in the Senate: Senator Newman was putting up an amendment and had the support of the Democrats-until the last few minutes of the debate. Then Senator McLean came over and did not tell her but told me as he walked past that they were no longer supporting us. When I said, `Hang on, you told us a few minutes ago that you were', he said, `We listen to the debate; we don't come in here with preconceived ideas'. That is what he told me. His Party had promised us support, but he said, `We listen to the debate'. Now he is saying, `Because we were not consulted-after all, we are the power in the Senate, and it is up to us whether this amendment goes through or not-we are not going to support you'. He did not listen to the debate. This is the idiotic way the Democrats treat Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is in real trouble, whether the Treasurer (Mr Keating) likes it or not. I do not believe he deliberately engineered what has occurred in this country today; I sincerely hope he did not. He says that he did; I sincerely hope that he did not, because we are in real trouble. Our reputation overseas on industrial relations matters is appalling-it is the dregs. It does not matter which country we go to. Japan just laughs at us and other trading partners tell us that they can never rely on our goods turning up on time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is trying to do something about that matter. The Government cannot do anything because it kowtows to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). So there is no way it can break free from that shackle. The ACTU is panicking because it is losing its membership. Its membership is down now to 41 per cent of the total work force and 34 per cent of the private sector. Because the Government is shackled to the ACTU, it has put amendments in this Bill to ensure that the Commissioner confers with the ACTU before making a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment before us says that the Commission should be independent and should make its decision independently and then have teeth to enforce that independent decision and say to the employers, `This is what we want. You cannot lock out your employees. This is what we want you to do', and likewise say to the union, `This is what you must do and you cannot withdraw your labour on that account'. If this amendment went through, I do not believe for one minute that the Commission would not act in an independent fashion and would not be of great service to this nation but, because of some childish hurt feelings on the part of the Democrats, because they have all the power and they have not been consulted on the issue, they tell us that they are not supporting us. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the media picks up that angle because the Australian public must be informed that the Democrats made it very clear that, because they were not consulted and because they are the big boys who have the power in this place as to whether the amendment goes through or not, they will not support it. It really does appal me that this is a group of people who are meant to be responsible. They do, unfortunately, have that power and the people have got to understand that that is the way they use this power-just on some hurt feelings that they have not been informed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in responding to some of those comments made by Senator Walters. She referred to a conversation that I had with Senator Newman the other day about a procedural motion-something that comes up quite spontaneously. The Australian Democrats often come in and sit and listen with open minds. They listen to what is being said about an issue and they make a decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walters chose to draw a comparison between that sort of procedural thing which occurs in the chamber on an hour by hour basis and this quite different process of consultation over an extended period. I emphasise the fact that I began consultation with the Opposition four months ago on these Bills. At the time, we did not know that there was a second Bill. I continued that consultation through until yesterday when I approached Senator Durack and asked him about the amendments. We would have been prepared to listen then because, in fact, we are listeners. In fact, I think I opened my discussions with the Minister's staff about four months ago by saying, `We have got an open door and an open mind'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is terrible confusion here-quite unethical and deliberate confusion-between the procedural processes in the chamber two or three days ago, only one of which Senator Walters referred to, and the responsible, deliberative, rational consultation about the laws of the land, to which Senator Durack, on behalf of the shadow Minister for this portfolio, was not prepared to even give one minute in relation to this particular amendment. The comparisons that are being made by Senator Walters are clearly, simply and deliberately irrelevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is debating Senator Durack's amendment to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. I do not deny that Senator Durack has the right to move such an amendment at all. The fact is that, although the main amendments to this legislation deal with the ability of employees to ensure that breaches of awards are properly attended to, which, of course, includes recovery of moneys, there is nothing to stop any senator from moving amendments which go to the principal legislation. As such, the amendments need to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question is whether now is the right time to be dealing in depth with this amendment, the subject matter of which, as Senator Durack says, has been kicking around for a number of years. The Minister has indicated that the Government itself is looking at the question of compliance provisions in the Act. Presumably there will be opportunities provided by the Government next year for these matters to be debated again at length and in depth. I am not convinced that at this point in time there is a situation of such grave industrial relations crisis manifested in strikes, stoppages and the like, that we should be dealing now with this question of compliance provisions in depth. </PARA>
<PARA> I disagree with my colleague from Tasmania Senator Walters. No, I do not disagree with her because the place is in a mess. There is no doubt about that. The economy is in a mess, but I do not think the bone can be pointed at the unions. I do not think the bone can be pointed specifically at any organisations which are undertaking industrial action at this time because, quite clearly, as has been stated here, the level of industrial action at this point in time is very small indeed. In those circumstances, I feel that we should perhaps wait until a more opportune time has been given to the Parliament by the Government after it has considered the question of the adequacy of compliance provisions in the legislation and comes up with some measures next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has just been said, this is an amendment proposed in the committee stage to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. It is an amendment that deals with the penal clauses, sanctions or compliance provisions of the Act, whichever heading takes one's fancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine and Senator McLean have said that the Government will review the provisions of the Act next year. I should say on behalf of the Government that that is true. I announced in April of this year that we would review those sections of the Act relating to union amalgamations as a priority. We will go on in our review and deal with other matters where there is broad consent between the parties, and pick them up in any amendments where we can. We will review at greater leisure, in 1991, the more substantial questions where there is conflict and disagreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the two Bills that are to be dealt with this afternoon, this one, the No. 2 Bill, is a Bill in which there is substantial agreement between the parties about superannuation provisions and so on. As a consequence, it will go through, as it did in the House of Representatives, relatively untouched and uncommented on. The other Bill is the end of the process, as far as the Government is concerned, on the union amalgamations approach. </PARA>
<PARA> What I intend is to open up the process of a general review of all provisions of the Act at the National Labour Consultative Council being held next week. In that process I expect, and everyone would imagine, that there will be attention to the compliance provisions or the sanctions. As a consequence I imagine, too, that when I bring forward amendments to the Act in the Budget session next year, there may be in that Bill some dealings with these matters. It is true that in 1991 there will be a long process of consultation to which all parties can contribute. Probably, at the end of that, there will be some legislative change in which the Senate can participate in debate. I make that explanation to underline the points made by Senators McLean and Harradine about the approach of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have here is the ritual amendment moved by the Opposition whenever industrial relations matters come before this chamber. It does so to make its own points. It has made them again this afternoon. I do not want to deal in great detail with all of those points, except to say that it comes down to a fundamental difference in approach between the Government and the Opposition on industrial relations. Where there is a dispute the penchant of the Opposition is to look for revenge through penalty and pain, and inflict it in whatever way it wants on one or other of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's view where there is a dispute we seek resolution. We seek enduring peace by changing whatever are the relationships that are necessary to bring it about. We seek to build a cooperative spirit between the parties, engender harmony in the workplace, remove divisions which give rise to disputes and hopefully, generate greater productivity that can then be shared in terms of profit and wages. That is a fundamental difference which may illustrate itself again when we next debate industrial relations. A lot of the concerns of the Opposition spring from its obsession with penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I resume my seat, I would like to deal fairly quickly, as I think I am bound to, with some of the aspects of the amendment that need to be mentioned. The amendment introduces a compliance system heavily and inequitably weighted against the trade union movement and in favour of employers-so much for the argument of balance! Some of the inequitable features of the amendment are that there would be no appeal against the making of directions; there is no defence to an alleged breach of a direction; a person may sue for damages incurred as a result of a breach of a direction, even though no injunction has been issued by a court. They are some of the inequitable features. They just prove that this lopsided approach to compliance seems better calculated to provoke what is called the destructive adversarial behaviour in industrial relations rather than eliminate it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those features of inequity in the amendment that I have identified, it suffers from other deficiencies which are likely to hinder rather than promote good industrial relations. Let me just briefly mention a couple. It derogates from the role of the Industrial Relations Commission by providing a fast track to the Federal Court of Australia. The grounds on which an injunction may be issued are vague. The Court need only be satisfied that a person has engaged or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes, or would constitute, a breach of a direction, an attempt to breach such a direction, aiding counselling or procuring a person to breach such a direction, or inducing or attempting to induce a person to breach such a direction, being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in or party to a breach of such a direction or conspiring with others to breach such a direction. It has to be said that the availability of direct and immediate access to such a process could well be used to thwart and frustrate efforts by the Commission to resolve an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Paradoxically the proposed scheme might delay the availability of remedies for industrial action. There is a clear risk that enforcement proceedings in the Court could undermine attempts by the Commission to resolve the underlying issues. Given the severity of the remedies and the lack of any sensible process for cooling off, it would be understandable if the Commission and employers treated directions as a process of last resort and were reluctant to use them for fear of inflaming a dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that it is hardly conducive to sensible industrial relations if an interim injunction can be obtained without any examination of the merits of a claim. An application could be made on the strength of a mere apprehension that a union is proposing to attempt to induce a person to breach a direction. It is self-defeating to introduce processes which will completely undermine the commitment of the trade union movement to the conciliation and arbitration process. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposals are also quite contrary to the objective of encouraging commitment to sensible grievance procedures. The Opposition has simply forgotten the lessons it had to learn, not at its cost but at great cost to the community in the 1960s, when the coalition Government introduced processes for dispute resolution and access to the enforcement of bans clauses was permitted. It expressly acknowledged that there were two main deficiencies in the existing processes which gave virtually immediate access to penalties. These were the immediacy and availability of enforcement measures. The processes did not allow the Court to take hold of a dispute between the parties and endeavour to assist them to resolve it. These fundamental weaknesses are reinstated by the Opposition's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from being a prescription for improved industrial behaviour, these proposals represent a return to the discredited confrontationist approach to industrial relations of the Fraser Government. They will make disputes worse and, as has been said by one judge in relation to the common law action in industrial disputes, leave `a legacy of bitterness between the parties'. I oppose the amendment. I note that the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine have indicated similar opposition. I therefore expect the amendment to fail. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.55)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in so far as the numbers in the chamber are concerned. We did not propose this amendment in any expectation that the numbers would be with us on this occasion. But it will probably not be long before they are. Leaving the political comments aside, I shall make a few remarks in response to some points that have been made in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am grateful that Senator Cook advanced some reasons for criticism of the Opposition's proposals. It is interesting to note from Senator Cook's speech-we read this in a recent public statement and Senator Harradine certainly saw the same reference-that the Government is giving some consideration to better compliance provisions which presumably will be directed at getting a better balance between the enforcement provisions of the award and greater fairness in the interests of improving the action that can be taken by the employers or employer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said when I spoke in introducing this amendment, one of Senator Cook's predecessors, Mr Willis, who was the Minister for Industrial Relations for some years in this Government, had proposed, not in the same terms, to address this problem in the legislation that he, on behalf of this Government, introduced. The Opposition certainly will look with interest for any new proposals from the Government. We do not have a closed mind on the actual wording of this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I was rather intrigued with some of Senator Cook's criticisms, which can all be easily dealt with by amending the amendment. For instance, the suggestion that there would be no appeal from a Commissioner's direction is something that could be readily fixed up by an amendment if there was any serious interest by this Government in redressing the imbalance that exists in this whole system to which it is so utterly devoted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government failed when it tried to do something before about redressing that imbalance. It will fail simply for the reason it has failed before-the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) will tell the Government that this is simply not on. That is where the Government's masters are and that is where, in the end, it will get its riding instructions from. The Government will be told, `Come off it, we will not have anything to redress the imbalance which suits us down to the ground; we will stick to the benefits and the privileges we have got. The Labor Government and the Labor Minister, whether it is Senator Cook, Mr Willis, even Mr Hawke or whoever, had better mind their p's and q's'. Certainly it was clear from the response of Senator Cook that the Government has not failed because it had some problems with this proposal here and there. It is simply because Senator Cook is not allowed, and never will be allowed, by his masters in the ACTU to support or to introduce any proposal which will alter this unfairness and the imbalance that exists in the enforcement provisions of the awards. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that Senator Harradine has indicated an interest in achieving some improvements, although I can understand why he may want to wait in view of the Government's stating that it will try to do something about it. Obviously, he has more faith in the Government than the Opposition has had in this regard. The position he has taken up is a fair one. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it is hardly worth doing so, I suppose I should make some comments on Mr McLean's rather strange speech. Every time I come in here and listen to Senator McLean he seems to be in a state of great emotional excitement, or disturbance even, about something or other. The fact is that Senator McLean did not present any arguments against the Opposition's proposal. He said that the Democrats had not been consulted about it. He said that there had been consultations going on with him, the shadow Minister and me about another Bill. That was so. He believed that he should have been consulted about this amendment as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment the Opposition had proposed to this Bill was moved by my colleague, Mr Howard, in another place on 17 October. Here we are on 5 December and Senator McLean apparently is not aware of what happened in the House of Representatives some weeks ago. I know he was overseas for some four or five of those weeks, but he has been back for a while. I do not think it is credible that he did not know what had happened in the debate in the House of Representatives, but that was the posture that he adopted here. </PARA>
<PARA> The real reason why the Democrats are not supporting the Opposition here is not that they have not been consulted, but that they seem to be totally opposed to this proposal. When it was last moved here in the debate on 12 October 1988, the Democrats all supported the Government, all voted against this selfsame proposal. Senator McLean comes in here and postures about the fact that he has not been consulted, the great balance of power that he has, that he ought to be consulted and all this business. The real reason the Democrats are opposing this proposal is that they have consistently opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean is in the division lists of 12 October 1988, as large as life, voting against the selfsame proposal. He has the hypocrisy to come in here today and say that he has not been consulted, and if he had been consulted the Democrats might have supported the Opposition. I suppose they might have, come to think of it. The Democrats never remain consistent about anything for any length of time. Senator McLean is fully aware of the terms of this amendment; he has been for at least two years, if not more. Even if he had not been told or found out what happened in the House of Representatives, he has had notice of it and it is perfectly familiar to him. The Democrats are voting against it for the very good reason that they do not agree with it. They agree with the Government's attitude to industrial relations, and that is the long and short of it. Let us not have any more of this hypocrisy about not being consulted. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I do not propose to add anything further to this debate. I think the Minister is quite right; it ought to be put to the numbers and disposed of. </PARA>

I wish to preface my specific remarks with some more general comments as to how we arrived at these amendments so that, hopefully, the Committee will be more understanding of what we are attempting to do. All the way through the second reading debate, as Senator Durack has quite rightly said, we have said that we support the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill in principle. We believe that it is well-intentioned legislation, that it is well-drafted, but that it is not beyond improvement. Nor have we apologised at any stage for identifying with a centralised model of industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a number of contexts we have emphasised that we have serious reservations about the alternate model, from which Senator Durack argued at the second reading stage and presumably will argue in this committee stage. We have serious reservations about the deregulated labour market because we think it will create big winners and big losers. Therefore, we have simply addressed this Bill, from the beginning over a period of about four months, positively and hopefully constructively. Our 13 amendments hopefully will be judged to reflect that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a lot of consultation, initially with the Opposition, starting four months ago. That petered off for the reason which I have mentioned-that it was simply unproductive. We have had a lot of consultation with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), with members of his staff and with departmental officers. I would like to express a very sincere appreciation for the extraordinary cooperation that we have had in that process of consultation in an attempt to improve the legislation. The amendments that we will be moving in the next hour or so reflect that long process of consultation. I think it was probably hundreds of hours of consultation with community groups, with the Government and, as I said, initially with the Opposition but less so in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> From our consultation with community groups and from our first reading of the legislation, it was apparent to us that we had about nine areas of concern. These areas mainly centred around the rights of individuals. I will be returning to that and flagging the concept of an industrial ombudsman which focuses precisely on some continued reservations we have in that area, and I understand that the Minister will speak to that concept later. </PARA>
<PARA> Through this process of consultation, these nine areas have been dramatically reduced. Over the four-month period we have had seven or eight papers from departmental officers and other sources explaining and elaborating various aspects of the legislation. So, slowly but surely, we have narrowed our areas of concern down to relatively few. I believe that this legislation is very well intentioned and that it has been very well drafted. However, it has been our intention to attempt to improve it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not adopted the same attitude as the Opposition, whose bottom line attitude, as I said earlier, has been to simply oppose it in to, irrespective of anything. I know that the Opposition will consider some of those amendments for reasons which it has given. However, it believes that some of these amendments will weaken the Bill and, therefore, it will support them. The Democrats believe these are amendments which will strengthen and improve the Bill. It is a question of how one interprets these things. </PARA>
<PARA> These first three amendments focus on clause 10, which addresses section 118 of the principal Act. It is an area of concern which evoked a lot of reaction from organisations that came to us and expressed that concern. We believe that there was a lot of unnecessary fear about the implications of clause 10. Clause 10 requires that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission consider whether or not it should consult with peak councils in relation to certain matters. I emphasise that this clause simply requires that the Commission consider whether it will consult with the peak councils. The fear arose through a misinterpretation that it was placing a requirement upon the Commission to consult with peak councils; in other words, a requirement to consult with the Australian Council of Trade Unions or a requirement to consult with the Confederation of Australian Industry. Clause 10 places no such requirement on the Commission; it places a requirement on the Commission to consider whether it would be in the best interests of its processes to consult with those bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendments simply place an obligation upon the Commission-if it does decide to consult with peak councils from various sides of the argument-to report publicly the outcomes of those processes of consultation. In other words, the consultation will not be behind closed doors and the outcomes will not be secreted away somewhere but rather-if there is consultation-will be signalled publicly and become public knowledge. We think that that is an improvement upon the process, and we believe it will placate some of the undue fear that surrounds this clause dealing with section 118. I seek leave to move the first three of the Democrats amendments, all of which relate to clause 10. The first amendment requires an insertion and the second and third are consequential upon that first insertion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is opposed to clause 10 being in the Bill. It replaces an existing section in the Act, section 118, which may have created a few problems. That section deals with demarcation disputes, but it is in the nature of those sorts of disputes that there are going to be lots of problems with them and I do not know that any legislative formula is going to solve those problems. I am not suggesting that section 118 is a perfect instrument, but the Opposition has some very real concerns about the substitution of the existing section 118 by these new provisions to be known as 118 and 118A.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats' amendments have been made, with the consent of the Committee, to both the proposed new sections 118 and 118A. I do not think that the amendments were necessary. They were certainly not ones that one would want to oppose, and so we have not opposed them. It gives the Democrats some comfort, I suppose, if their amendments get up because they then think that they are making a major contribution to the legislation of the Parliament. It is clear enough, as the Minister has already said, that they were not necessary, although they are not something one would oppose. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not see those innocuous amendments making any difference to our opposition to the proposed new sections. The Opposition's major objection in relation to proposed section 118 is that it increases in a major way the role of peak councils. It provides that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission must consider whether it should consult appropriate peak councils which are representative of the organisations involved in the matter before it. Having considered that, it may then consult with them. It is not as offensive a formula as it might be if it ordered them to consult, but it seems to be a diplomatic way of saying the same thing. In other words, it is certainly giving a greater position to the role of peak councils in the Industrial Relations Commission. The Opposition does not believe that is a good development. In practice it is largely to increase the role of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Opposition objects to it from that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 118A widens considerably the role of the Commission compared to existing section 118. The powers that are repeated in 118A are widened, however, beyond the demarcation disputes. Section 118 in the principal Act gives similar powers in relation to demarcation disputes, but proposed section 118A widens the area of controversy well beyond a demarcation dispute to organisation coverage generally. The Opposition's concern about that is bound up with its concern about the whole purpose of this Bill to hasten the process of amalgamations to herd as many employees into as few unions as possible. It almost seems to be giving the smaller organisations a second serve because it is giving the Commission the power to make orders about whether they will represent those employees in particular industrial disputes. It is something for which the Opposition has an in principle objection for the same reasons as we have to the whole purpose of this Bill, which is not only to hasten the amalgamation of unions, but also to reduce to 20 the number of unions from a present level of over 300. I am only repeating the argument the Opposition advanced during the second reading debate, which was a full argument, and I do not see the point of doing that. However, the Opposition's objections to proposed section 118 are based upon the same concern that the Government is quite determined to reduce the role and significance of smaller unions in the industrial relations system at the expense of creating much larger unions than the workers choose to be members of, and to operate within. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission could here order that an organisation of employees is not to have the right to represent under this Act the industrial interests of a particular class or group of employees who are eligible for membership of the organisation. The existing organisations which seem particularly concerned about this are the professional organisations and one can see why because their coverage in relation to a particular class or group of employees may well be removed, not simply to resolve a demarcation dispute, but also, as far as coverage is concerned under the pressure of larger organisations, to force them into an amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, our objections to this clause are bound up with our objections to the whole purpose of this Bill. Nevertheless, as this clause has been singled out for attention in this debate, the Opposition wishes to register strong objection to it. However, the Opposition maintains its objection generally to this legislation and we will record that objection further by voting against the third reading of the Bill as we voted against the second reading. I do not propose to divide the Committee on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not support this amendment, the intention of which is to delete this whole clause. We are seeing now the beginning of the Opposition's strategy which is simply a hack and cut and paste exercise. I can understand that. The Opposition comes to the debate from a different philosophical position. It supports the alternative model. I have said over and over in these debates that this is legitimate, but I have also said to Senator Chaney previously and to Mr Howard recently that the Democrats do not come at the legislation from that position. We see it as an integrated body of legislation and we attempt to improve it. Frankly we do not see the cut and paste approach to things as appropriate, nor do we see, as I have said in other debates, an attempt to fit square pegs into round holes-in other words to force, into legislation, amendments which are borne of the alternative model and do not logically fit there-as being an appropriate approach to our role as legislators. This attempt simply to hack a portion out of an integrated piece of legislation we see as an inappropriate approach and we will oppose this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>``10,000''. </PARA>
<PARA>Probably one of the most publicly controversial aspects of the legislation was that it was interpreted as creating mega-unions. After all, this legislation is about dramatically reducing the number of unions in Australia from around 300 down to who knows how many. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been a strong recommendation from five major reports to the Parliament over an extended period. It is accepted as a rational and appropriate direction for Government legislation to take and that is the essential intention of this whole Bill. This gives rise to the question of how one gets there. It was hoped that earlier legislation would induce the process of amalgamation, but it did not. The process of amalgamation has been slow, so the intention of this clause is to accelerate it-in other words, to set targets, to induce action and get some response. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that we need to dwell on what the precise number will be. In earlier debates Opposition senators said, `Why put a number on it at all?'. But if we do not put a number or a time on it we will not set a target or induce any response. What that number will be is really of relatively little consequence. However, we take the position that 20,000 is frightening to the community at large. It suggests mega-unions and I do not think that was the intention. We believe that a more realistic figure is a compromise figure of about 10,000, which can be achieved in shorter periods of time. That is why we have proposed 10,000. I believe that that is not unacceptable to the Government because it has the effect of inducing the process of amalgamation-which is what the intention is. Imposing a time in a later clause will have the same effect. The outcome will be fewer unions, which is in accordance with the recommendations of five major reports to the Parliament. Nobody knows what the size of those unions will be. </PARA>

Therefore, the only purpose of putting a figure on it is to set a goal and to induce the process of amalgamation which has not happened effectively. We believe that 10,000 is a less frightening figure; the psychology of it is sounder; and it will have the same effect- in other words, it will induce the process of amalgamation which we identify with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with the amendment to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, I would like to bring some figures to the attention of those of us who are involved in the debate. Before I do that, I will refer to a few things that have happened here tonight and some of the comments that have been made. I would suggest to Senator McLean that there is only one person in this debate who is a square sitting in a round hole, and that is himself. The only way he will get into a square position is by hopping over to the other side. All he has done to this point is vacillate; he has not really contributed anything whatsoever to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of reducing the figure from 20,000 to 10,000, let us look at a few facts and see how many people and organisations this will scare. Currently, there are some 140 registered Federal employee organisations in Australia. One hundred and two of them have fewer than 20,000 members and 90 have fewer than 10,000 members. So all the honourable senator is talking about is 10 registered employee organisations. I do not believe that what the honourable senator is saying has any substance in terms of creating fear about those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take it a little further in the context of this amendment. Whether we are looking at the 20,000 figure or the 10,000 figure, the stated objective is to improve industrial relations in the workplace. I am sure that all honourable senators have seen the survey that was conducted by the Business Council of Australia. That survey indicates that by making these changes we will create a situation where there will be an average of just over four unions in each workplace as compared with the current figure of five. I suggest that this will not have the impact that it has been suggested it will have. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the whole scenario a little further and consider whether efficiency in the industrial relations system will make us better off. I believe we will find that a whole group of organisations which were previously registered organisations under the Federal system, will move to become deregistered organisations. That has already been suggested to me. I have already indicated that I have great reservations about the current centralised wage fixing system. If people think that will improve the situation, I would suggest that they are very wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that amalgamations will overcome problems in the industrial relations system. Let us look at a pet subject of mine-the damage that is being done now in the meat industry. The first point I want to make relates to measuring industrial disputation in this day and age and the way that the tactics have changed in relation to that. It is not the size of the union or the number of days lost that is really the crucial point; it is the dollars and cents that an action costs the community. Often one sees a very small action in relative terms of the number of people who are out of work. But the flow-on effect through integrated industry and integrated systems results in the loss of millions and millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at one union-the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU)-in terms of this amalgamation process. I am disappointed that there is little balance in the presentation of this process. That organisation has 45,000 members around Australia. The amalgamation process will make no difference to their attitude to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I see that Senator Cook is looking across and probably checking the figures. The figures I received today indicate that the total membership of the AMIEU is 45,000. As far as the meat industry is concerned, the process will have no impact whatsoever on the activities that have been occurring. It will have no impact on the massive losses which are amounting to close to $100m. There have been some 20,000 days lost in working time-which, incidentally, is very close to 25 per cent of the total time lost in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this so-called magical figure-whether it be 20,000 or 10,000-will contribute to a better industrial relations system in this country. I do not believe that it will assist in overcoming some of the problems that we have at the present time in some of our major industries. Over the last two or three years there have been problems in two main areas-the meat industry and the coal industry. Millions of dollars have been lost in these very important resource-based industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot support the setting of a number of members, whether it be 10,000 or 20,000, because I do not believe it will achieve the objectives. I believe that this legislation will create a situation where we will see more and more organisations moving away from being registered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted earlier this evening I was saying that almost all coalition honourable senators who spoke in the second reading debate claimed that reducing the number of unions from the present 299 to an ideal number of 20 would have no effect on the number of unions representing workers in individual workplaces. I think the chances of that happening would be fairly small. I would have thought that the likely result would have been a significant reduction in the number of unions per workplace. That would seem to me to be logical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's major complaint, however, is that this process of amalgamation would forever prevent the possibility of a system of enterprise bargaining gaining a foothold in our industrial relations system. I am not sure if this is a particularly relevant criticism of the Bill directly, but it is an interesting example of the lack of real understanding that honourable senators opposite have of the industrial relations system in this country, and their complete inability to see past their own outdated prejudices in constructing a relevant, realistic and achievable industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look first at this system they champion so loudly-this system of enterprise bargaining. What the Opposition wants is for workers to negotiate terms and conditions directly with their employer, perhaps through the agency of a company-type union, limited in its scope to that enterprise alone. This type of structure, based very much on models drawn from Japan, would allow negotiations between employers and employees to be based on the individual firm's ability to pay wages and other conditions without being forced into centralised arrangements which can have dire effect on the productivity of individual firms. It does not sound too bad in theory. The Opposition supports its theories with case studies of firms which have adopted such arrangements to find that the successful firm ends up paying lots of money to its happy workers. As I said, that does not sound too bad. But the practice of enterprise bargaining does have its own down sides. If the firm is having a rough time, there are no prizes for guessing whose wages get the chop. And if the union is confined to the enterprise, one wonders how much industrial muscle it will have to prevent this occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese system, as it classically operated, had a slight variation to it which overcame some of these problems. What they used to do was have different classes of workers. The permanent workers were the elite: they belonged to the union; they belonged to the company; they were part of the family. They were given company homes, health plans, even superannuation in some cases. They were very well looked after. Seasonal workers, taken on for given periods, were another story all together. They did not belong to the union. They worked longer, harder hours. They had no protection. They were not looked after if they fell ill or even if they were killed. If the company was unprofitable, they were laid off. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the happy tale of enterprise unionism which honourable senators opposite are apparently intending to inflict upon an unsuspecting public. It creates a permanent underclass of one shape or another. Either one union is stronger than another, or one enterprise is more generous than another, or one worker is in a weaker position than another. It has that potential to create a permanent underclass which we as a humane society should not and can not tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would recommend that before honourable senators opposite make impassioned speeches about the need for increased efficiency through enterprise bargaining, they sit down and read a book called Japan in the Passing Lane which details the dark side of the Japanese economic miracle. All is not as it appears on charts of economic growth and efficiency, and no responsible government, nor even a responsible opposition, should discount human factors in formulating policies on industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Centralised waged fixation protects workers in positions of relative weakness, as well as providing for predictable and responsible wage outcomes. Enterprise bargaining provides no such guarantees. It is not as if enterprise bargaining, as envisaged by the Opposition, is even a realistic or achievable aim within the confines of our industrial relations system. The policies which those opposite proclaim so loudly as their glorious vision of a deregulated future were soundly rejected by the Hancock Committee of Review of Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems for the very simple reason that they were in practice unachievable. </PARA>
<PARA> Employer groups conceded as much in their submissions to the Hancock Committee. It was left to the gung ho reactionaries of the lunatic right and self-styled right wing think tanks-I use that term advisedly-to argue for the position that the coalition now endorses. The Opposition still has not come to terms with what Professor Hancock termed the `industrial realities': the existence of long-established industrial structures and practices which will not readily adapt themselves to fulfil the ideological dispositions of the Opposition. To believe that over 100 years of industrial relations practice can be altered to fit into the Opposition's views on what should or should not happen is almost childish. </PARA>
<PARA> How does it intend to control wage outcomes if a system of enterprise bargaining were implemented? If we moved away from centralised wage fixation, it is apparent to any reasonable observer that industrially strong unions would prosper. All that would be needed would be a flexing of their industrial muscle. Weaker unions would find it difficult to achieve such success, and their members would thus be exposed to any employer who wanted to take them on-a different underclass to the one I mentioned earlier with regard to Japan, but an underclass nonetheless. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no predicting what the wages outcome would be under such a system. Certainly a wages policy would be unachievable, and an accord-type arrangement unworkable. So not only would managing the economy become a practical impossibility but also wages would come to reflect the industrial power of the unions which represent the individual workers, and any concepts of equity would go out the window. This is the society those opposite so loudly clamour for. It has been suggested by the Opposition that this Bill would prevent the introduction of such a system in this country. All I can say is `Ah well, so be it'. We in the Government see that as a good thing and I believe that most Australians support us in that belief, and I sincerely hope they always will. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two arguments put up by the Opposition which I would like to deal with. The first is the argument that these mega-unions will be unresponsive to the needs of their members. It was, I believe, Senator Chapman who advanced these arguments most forcefully. There is no question that these unions will be bigger in a bureaucratic sense than their predecessors. It does not necessarily follow, however, that this will mean less effective representation of workers' interests. Certainly no evidence was brought forward to show that this would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Factors such as the number of members per union organiser, the ability of individual organisers, and the importance individual unions place on direct contact with their members are far more important in determining the value each member gets from his or her union. There are very good big unions and there are very good small unions. Some unions, both big and small, do not come up to scratch. If people are unhappy, there is always a reform team running in union elections these days that members can vote for. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more unsavoury elements of the Opposition's attacks on this Bill was the pathetic allegation of union thuggery and corruption. It is a bit much when Senators Chapman and Walters make unsubstantiated allegations of-and I quote Senator Walters-`the intimidation, the strongarm tactics, the abuse and violence' as being commonplace at union meetings. When challenged by the Minister, Senator Chapman was unable to come up with a single example of such thuggery. That inability to come up with one concrete instance is, I believe, indicative of the reality of the situation, which is that such things are rare and notable exceptions. To refer to such things in the casual manner to which they were referred in the second reading debate is misleading, unhelpful and brings no credit on those who propagate these tired old stereotypes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know all about it because I have been involved in it all. The final point that I would like to make with regard to the criticisms of this Bill made by the Opposition on the second reading is this: Senator Durack made the comment that the process of amalgamations would of itself cause industrial unrest. He did not feel the need to prove the point in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The evidence is that industrial disruption is not necessary or even likely to occur as a result of the amalgamation process. Some 10 major amalgamations in the last two years have not resulted in any industrial trauma that I am aware of. But there is an interesting, logical inconsistency with arguing for enterprise structures and a radical and overwhelming change to the structure of unions in this country and then, in the same speech, arguing against amalgamations of unions on the grounds of the industrial dislocation that this would cause. But I will leave it to those opposite to ponder those inconsistencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has one very simple aim: to make easier the process of amalgamation of unions in this country, thus facilitating an historic rationalisation of the number of union structures which operate within our industrial system. A key area of reform undertaken by this Government in all its terms has been reform of the system of industrial relations. Our achievements in that area have underpinned a successful wages policy which is now in its sixth form. But, whilst there has been a great deal of real reform in the area of industrial relations, one unhealthy aspect of the system still remains, and that is the archaic union structures which operate within the system. Many unions have been in their present form for over a hundred years, and it is obvious to all that structures which existed when Australia was a loose federation of States, with an economy based almost entirely on minerals and produce, require rethinking in a modern economy. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major criticisms of our system of industrial relations is that it produces a complexity in any bargaining between employers and employees because of the multitude of unions involved in any one workplace. A survey commissioned by the Business Council of Australia showed that one or more unions were present in 95 per cent of all sites surveyed, with 50 per cent of workplaces having to deal with four or more unions. Within the public sector, there are some stark examples of the complexities which are faced by employers and unions. </PARA>
<PARA> In Telecom, there are presently 21 unions or staff associations; there are 22 such bodies representing employees in the tertiary-university sector; there are more than 50 unions within the Australian Public Service. The need for rationalisation is overwhelming. This is made even more so by the urgent need for this country to improve its international competitiveness. As has been said time and time again, this need has been recognised in independent inquiries since 1975. Now is the time to undertake this reform, and amalgamations are the logical and achievable way of doing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason the Government has proposed that the minimum size of unions be 20,000 is to provide a positive incentive for unions in this country to comply with resolutions that they unanimously carry at peak meetings of the Australian Council of Trade Unions at the biennial congress of the ACTU to reduce the number of unions. One would say, by perusing the minute books of those councils, that there is indeed a wide unanimity of opinion that the number of unions should be reduced. But there is a lack of action despite the commitment made, and one of the ways of procuring action is to make this amendment. The fundamental reason, however, for the Government wanting to make this amendment is that we are a government, and I am pleased to say that in this sense we are joined by the Australian Democrats, it appears, which is committed to micro-economic reform of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition fails to recognise that over the last seven years of our administration massive change has been undertaken by virtue of restructuring of awards that govern wages and working conditions for ordinary Australians. The old demarcations are breaking down. The old craft system is going out. We have sponsored change which has been massive in scope to achieve a huge reduction in the number of classifications and positions under awards, to promote skills based advancement by training people with higher skills, opening career possibilities for them to do that, and to remove the old demarcation barriers so that in the building industry-where there are something like eight different trade classifications-we could end up with one trade classification: building tradesperson. In the metal industry, where there are several different trade classifications, we can reduce the number so that Australians are multi-skilled and increasingly a more flexible work force that can work across the whole range of industry and accommodate technological change as it arises. </PARA>
<PARA> They are significant changes in the economy. They will produce massive boosts in productivity per head. To give those changes an organisational coherence, the organisations that represent those old craft based skills need to be changed as well. That principle is recognised by employer bodies in this country. That principle is recognised by unions themselves. This Government recognises it. The Australian Democrats recognise it. It is about time the Opposition recognised that if it wants to see the achievements that are possible to be made in this economy realised it too should support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The Opposition sat here politely and silently through a second reading speech being delivered by Senator Foreman for a quarter of an hour. He was ending the speech that he was making on the wrong Bill earlier today, but the Opposition did not make any objection to that. It was totally irrelevant to the question before the Chair. Here we now have the Minister compounding the problem by also making another second reading speech on the clause. The question before the Chair is in respect of a clause which is to increase the minimum number of members of a union from the existing 1,000 to 20,000 and an amendment moved to that clause by Senator McLean to reduce that from 20,000 to 10,000. That is what the question before the Chair is. I would suggest that the proper course is for the Minister to address that issue, not to make a second reading speech.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in fact doing that, Mr Temporary Chairman, despite the opportunism of the interjection and the opportunity that afforded Senator Durack to make a speech. What the provision in this Bill to set a minimum size seeks to achieve is the mechanism to propel that change. That is something that is sought by the unions themselves. The figure of 20,000 is an appropriate figure, in the Government's view, to set, with the recognition that where unions have a particular case there should be a provision for exemptions. That is something that I will say more about later when we arrive at the appropriate part of the amendments to deal with that. But I certainly share the view that is widespread: where there are particular special cases, leave of the Commission should be able to be given for unions with less than the 20,000 figure to continue to be registered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats have moved that there be a reduction from 20,000 to 10,000. I must say that the Government's view is that we would prefer to remain at the 20,000 level. We believe that is the right and proper level. However, I recognise that the Opposition will not be supporting the 20,000 figure and in those circumstances there would not be a majority for the Government to stick with the 20,000 and reluctantly, therefore, I must accept the Democrat amendment, and so do, and support the 10,000 amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate on this matter a number of things have been said, some of which ought to be appropriately answered. Senator Crane cited the Business Council of Australia in terms of a finding it publicised. The first thing that should be said about the Business Council of Australia is that it is not, nor does it seek to be, a front-line industrial relations organisation. It does not field an advocate typically in landmark cases that appear before the Industrial Relations Commission and it is therefore not involved in the engine-room of industrial relations in this country. It preserves for itself the right to make observations across the landscape about industrial relations and many people do that, often with little interest, little backing or little experience in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that the Business Council of Australia is a body in which the eligibility for membership is that a company must be one of the top 100 in this country. The top 100 companies' spokesmen say that small is beautiful: unions are not allowed to get big; unions should remain small. The largest 100 companies say that small is beautiful. If they believe that and are conscientious about it I expect that they will break up their organisations into small companies rather than remain as the large conglomerates they are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They express this opinion regularly. Senator Crane should know about it, and that is why I am telling him about it. Secondly, Senator Crane said that he could not see any advantage to the meat industry, which is his latest obsession, in terms of this legislation. I can accept that Senator Crane cannot see it. He has told us and I believe him; he must be right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me propose for the rest of the Committee what some of the advantages for the meat industry may be. I am not saying that there will be advantages, but there could be. Where we are talking in this Bill about having an industry focus for union amalgamations-that is to say, unions are to be encouraged and facilitated to amalgamate along industry lines-in the case of the meat industry the possibility arises that it could be a constituent union in a food industry union in Australia; it could be one of the constituent parts in that. These amendments would facilitate that occurring. That means that all the multifaceted unions that make up the food industry would blend into one, speaking on behalf of the entire industry and giving an industry focus for Australia. That would mean that the clerks, the transport workers and those in other classifications in the food industry, including sanitary inspectors and others, could be part of one union with an industry focus, and that union could be organised along enterprise lines. That would be a big benefit to the economy if it occurred. I hope that these amendments facilitate that. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats ordinarily would not be accepted by the Government. In the consultations we have conducted we have sought to persuade the Democrats to accept the 20,000 figure. They remain strongly wedded to their lower figure of 10,000. We recognise, though, that that would be a significant improvement upon the current provision and in those circumstances reluctantly accept the 10,000 figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard a lot of rot tonight from both the Australian Democrats and the Government. I start off by saying that the Democrats said that they did not believe the Government really wanted megaunions because they would frighten the community; that the Government really did not mean the figure of 20,000 that it had proposed. So the Democrats have proposed a figure of 10,000 instead and the Government has been forced to accept it. But both the Government and the Democrats use almost identical words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fascinating to me to hear the Australian Labor Party definition of democracy. Both the Minister and Senator McLean have said, `We want the unions to amalgamate. They are not moving fast enough, so we will force them to move. We will tell them that they cannot have the figure of 1,000 and are now to move to 10,000'. The Government says 20,000; the Democrats say 10,000. They are forcing the unions to amalgamate. They are saying to the unions, `You are not moving fast enough; we want you to move faster. We want you to get going on it'. This is the ultimate description of democracy by both the Labor Party and the Democrats. </PARA>

The Minister was talking to this clause when he was saying all this. I am just saying to him, `Wonderful'. Ye gods!

<PARA> The Government has dragged us down from having one of the highest standards of living to what we have today. We have had debates in this place on how many more children the Government wants living in poverty before it decides to alter its ways. The Government's industrial relations policy has been part of it. The Minister says, `This is what it may do, this is what it can do, this is what it will do'. We have been waiting for the J-curve for how many years now? The Government's industrial relations policy has done nothing to help the economy. The situation Australia is in is absolutely disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said a little earlier, we had the Treasurer saying that he engineered it all deliberately. I do not believe that that is the way Australians want to go; I do not believe that the answer is bigger unions. The Minister said in his speech on this clause that industry unions are not appropriate in Australia. Let me tell him that Australians believe that industry unions are appropriate. Let me give him and the Committee a good example of where industry unions could have worked if only the Government's industrial relations policy was not as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take the Committee back to the Mudginberri dispute. Remember the Mudginberri dispute? That was an industry union. That was a negotiation between the employees of that particular company and the employer. The employees came to the decision, through their negotiations, that they would ignore their union. They decided that they would work a little harder and that they would not stick to the union stipulation of how many beasts they could kill in a day, and the employer said, `If you do work a bit harder you will get more pay'. That negotiation was a very happy situation, until the union said, `We'll have none of it. You will come back under the union thumb. We say you can kill only so many beasts a day. You will not negotiate privately with your employer, and we will bring you back to what we demand'. </PARA>

I can assure the Committee that the union, the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU), was thwarting 27 employees-not 20,000-who had negotiated with their boss for better conditions and better wages, until the AMIEU interfered. What did the Government do? The Government said, `We will not allow our inspectors to cross the picket line'. Mr Pendarvis, who had overseas contracts to fill, was unable to go ahead and fill those contracts. Because he was unable to fill those contracts, eventually, when the dispute was over-because the union had to back off when it went through the courts-it was all too late and that company went broke. It went broke as a direct result of this Government's policy on its union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet the Minister has the hide to stand in this place today and tell us that the big unions are better-that 20,000-member unions are better for the country-and he will not tolerate these 27 men negotiating with their boss for better conditions and better wages so that they can fulfil overseas orders. No wonder we are in the mess we are in; no wonder our exports are falling; no wonder the Government made such a disaster of the whole thing; and the Minister has the hide to stand here in this place and say: `Industry unions are not appropriate in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator McLean does not like to hear this. He is supporting the big boys in the union movement, so he takes a point of order and says I am not speaking to the clause, but I am speaking directly to the clause and, what is more, I am quoting the Minister when he was speaking to the same clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole thing is just one hypocrisy: the Labor Government professes to be caring for Australia as a whole but really is doing nothing but protecting its ACTU affiliates. Because it is tied to them, because it cannot get funding and cannot get in without them, it has to do what it is told. As I said a little earlier, because the unions have lost membership to the extent that they have only about 36 per cent representation in the private sector, the ACTU is panicking and demanding of the Government that it increase the size of the unions and make 20 large unions. The Government is terrified of these small industry unions getting under way and negotiating for the workers better conditions and better wages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night Senator Walters threw down a challenge to me but unfortunately I was engaged in ministerial business and could not be present in the chamber when she attacked my role in relation to the financial plan for the Bay View laundry in Sandy Bay. I regard Senator Walters's attack as an attempt to undermine efforts to develop a constructive long term strategy to guarantee the future of Bay View Fabricare laundry in Sandy Bay. I believe that her continuing criticism of the Government's efforts and my efforts to assist that laundry are counterproductive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, let me tell you that, during the last election campaign, a group of concerned parents from Bay View visited my office in some distress and said that they had been attempting to get the support of the Department of Community Services and Health for some funding to overcome a crisis, a cash flow problem at Bay View, which had largely been exacerbated, though not entirely due to, the pilots dispute. I undertook to telephone the State manager of the Department and I relayed their concerns to the State manager. The State manager indicated that funding could be made available within a certain time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, would be made available within a certain time. I did not hear anything more about it. Naturally, I assumed that the matter had been dealt with. I did not regard myself as being in the old-fashioned politics of giving promises during an election campaign. I had merely helped a group of concerned parents make contact with the correct Government official. I thought no more about it. In fact, I visited Bay View Fabricare laundry at least three times between March and November including, on one occasion, a full tour of the laundry. At no stage did the management or any of those associated with Bay View mention the failure or the difficulty they had experienced in getting the funding about which we had spoken in February or March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was an absolute surprise to me when on 25 November I received a letter from the concerned parents expressing their dismay that the funding had not come through. The first I had heard about it from them was when I got that particular letter. I understand that they had contacted members of the Opposition and Senator Harradine quite independently of writing me that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> As soon as I became aware of their predicament, I contacted the new State manager, Mr Peter Fisher. I want to pay a tribute to Peter Fisher and to the person in the office of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), Mr Warren Gardiner, who has dealt with this matter since I brought it to their attention. It is due to their efforts that the matter of financial assistance for the laundry has now reached a satisfactory stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole basis of the approach by the Government has not been to go for a temporary quick fix to deal with the aftermath of the pilots dispute and the difficulty in retaining certain long term contracts which the laundry has lost, independently of the pilots dispute. We needed a sound business plan to help the laundry reorganise its operations on a solid footing. Senator Walters seems to favour the temporary quick fix approach. I do not. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I believe the consultancy undertaken by Peat Marwick Hungerfords Management Consultants was extremely important. This particular consultancy to find a style of management, a team, which could get the laundry into a viable state cost the Government, not Bay View, $42,000. That is why a comprehensive financial report was required and a detailed strategy has emerged for overcoming Bayview's problems, thereby securing the future of the 37 disabled people who are presently employed there. That is the crucial matter on which all senators would agree as being the true focus of our concern rather than political points scoring. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Minister, Mr Brian Howe, yesterday approved a special payment of $45,000 to overcome immediate cash flow problems. I understand that is required to go from a Canberra trust account to Hobart and then to the organisation. This morning the management of Bay View telephoned my office quite independently to say that it was delighted with that and quite happy with the way in which it is being processed. </PARA>
<PARA> Further funding which will bring total assistance to a figure of not less than the $183,000 initially sought by Bay View will be paid by the end of this month in order to implement the consultants' recommendations. That is the key. The funding, at least $183,000, resulted from the recommendations of the consultants and as a result of the money being available. It may well happen that more dollars are required in order to put Bay View on to a firm financial footing. I am completely satisfied that the Department has acted responsibly and in the best interests of the employees of Bay View. I believe that we now have a sound basis for future operations of the laundry. Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank you for your support for Bay View during this period along with the support of Senator Harradine and Mr Duncan Kerr. </PARA>

The parents of the disabled people at the Bay View laundry had not had that promise fulfilled. Eight or nine months later I am delighted that it has been fulfilled. I agree with the Minister that the method being used for the long term assistance is of great advantage. I do not think it is appropriate for the Minister to say that the whole thing has been carried out in a just fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> These people had had the promise of $183,000 immediately following the election. They were even given the time frame of six weeks following the election and it is nearly nine months later when they have finally received their money. I am delighted because I believe the Minister tonight has clarified that the amount will be at least $183,000. I am delighted with that response because I agree entirely with the Minister that that organisation is very hard working and very worth while and it does a great deal for the disabled people of Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister has said, the laundry will now get some long term assistance as to a managerial role and I can do nothing but say how appropriate that is. I do not think that the Minister is at all just in saying that the subject should not have come up last night and that the promise that was made to these people should not have been carried out within the period of time mentioned rather than being delayed for nine months. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) to (9) The five Councils are each answered separately under their respective headings:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Health Ministers' Conference</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australian Health Ministers' Conference (AHMC). The objectives of the Conference are to:</PARA>
<PARA> * provide a mechanism for regular consultation between Commonwealth, State and Territory Health Ministers on matters of mutual interest concerning health policy, services and programs;</PARA>
<PARA> * promote a consistent and co-ordinated national approach to health policy development and implementation; and</PARA>
<PARA> * consider matters submitted to the Conference by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Membership of AHMC comprises all Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers directly responsible for health matters. The Chair of AHMC rotates annually amongst members.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) A permanent secretariat to AHMC and its advisory council (AHMAC) is located within the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. The Secretariat comprises three positions-all of which are occupied part-time on AHMC secretariat functions. The cost of the AHMC Secretariat is shared between members in line with procedures agreed to by AHMC and the Commonwealth in 1988. Before 1988, the Commonwealth met the full cost of the Secretariat. AHMC/AHMAC Secretariat salary and administrative costs were $92,000 for the 1989-90 financial year.</PARA>

<PARA>Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy (MCDS) was established in April 1985 at the Special Premiers' Conference on drugs to deal with all matters related to drugs of dependence and to oversight and co-ordinate the activities of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Prior to 1989 twice per year-from 1989, annually.</PARA>

<PARA>The Commonwealth hosted only one of the above meetings-Canberra, November 1987. Costs associated with the provision of venue, equipment, ground transport, lunch and teas for this meeting totalled approximately $3,400.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to readily obtain the Commonwealth's costs for travel and accommodation for Commonwealth attendance at meetings as costs are from Ministers' budgets and specific program budgets from seven Departments/authorities. Additionally, MCDS meets back-to-back with other Ministerial Councils, such as the Australian Health Ministers' Conference, to save resources and it is difficult to apportion costs to the individual Councils.</PARA>

<PARA>Housing Ministers and Officers Conference</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Housing Ministers Conference provides a forum for consultation and discussion of housing issues. The meeting also sets the research priorities for the Australian Housing Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Annually-although, in 1990, an additional meeting will be held.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Membership of the Conference consists of Commonwealth and State/Territory Housing Ministers. The New Zealand Government is also invited to attend. The venue is rotated each year amongst the participating Governments and the meeting is chaired by the host Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There is no permanent secretariat. Secretariat duties are undertaken on a rotational basis by Departmental staff from the Housing Department in the host State/Territory. Secretariat costs are borne by the host Department.</PARA>

<PARA>Planning Ministers Conference</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Planning Ministers Conference. The Conference provides a forum for consultation, discussion and exchange of information on a wide range of planning matters. The meeting of Ministers also sets the priorities and makes recommendations to the Commonwealth on the funding of projects under the Housing Development Program (The Housing Development Program is administered by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Once a year for two days, unless there is a need for a special conference.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Membership consists of all Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers directly responsible for planning matters. The New Zealand Government and senior officials are also invited to attend. The venue is rotated each year amongst the nine participating governments and the meeting is chaired by the host government.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Council is served by a part time Secretariat currently located within the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. The Secretariat comprises one position which is occupied only part time on Planning Ministers Conference secretariat functions. As Planning Ministers' Conference meets back-to-back with other Ministerial Councils it is difficult to apportion costs to the individual Councils.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Three annual meetings of the Planning Ministers Conference have been held during the last three financial years, as follows:</PARA>

<PARA>It is not possible to identify costs to the Commonwealth for travel and accommodation for attendance at meetings as costs are from Ministers' Office budgets and specific program budgets.

<PARA> (1) Can the Minister explain the disparity which exists with respect to section 78 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which provides tax deductibility for all donations to tertiary institutions, but allows only those donations to secondary schools which are of a capital nature to be used as deductions?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The two types of educational institutions referred to by the Senator were added to the gift provisions at different times. The inclusion of secondary schools in 1954 was to promote the expansion of infrastructure in education facilities, to assist in the advancement of learning in Australia. The Government would have reservations about widening the scope for tax deductibility of donations for schools as this would have the potential to bias Government support for primary and secondary education, through tax revenue forgone, in favour of the wealthy and at the expense of those not so well off. For this and other reasons the Government prefers to provide its support for schools through the expenditure side of the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Statistics of gifts allowed in income tax returns of individual taxpayers are classified into gifts to organisations and charities which provide assistance in Australia, overseas aid funds and approved school building funds. Gifts to tertiary institutions are included with other gifts in the category of gifts which give help in Australia. As statistics of gifts allowed in this category do not separately identify the various organisations and charities to which the gifts are provided it is not possible to provide an estimate of the revenue cost resulting from the tax deductibility of donations to tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allowable gifts to schools and colleges are of a capital nature and as such are recorded for statistical purposes as gifts to approved building funds. Separate information is not available for gifts to secondary schools. As complete details of gifts allowed are not available from income tax returns for the year ended 30 June 1989 estimates have been prepared from 1987-88 data, the latest year for which complete information is available. Based on information included in income tax returns for the year ended 30 June 1988 the revenue lost from the tax deductibility of donations to schools and colleges is estimated to be $32 million.</PARA>
