<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Social Security. What number of Social Security clients came forward to declare overpayments during the period of the recently concluded amnesty? On that basis, does the Government expect the Budget savings estimate of $55m attributable to the amnesty to be met by the end of the financial year? How many amnesty application forms did the Department of Social Security mail out during the six-week period? Did the mail-out include persons whose names appeared on suspected overpayments facility listings? Were some of these persons suspected of having received overpayments in circumstances which would not have entitled them to protection under the amnesty arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston may be aware that I got back from overseas this morning. I arrived at Parliament only 45 minutes before Question Time, so I have not had time to get across everything that has happened in the last two weeks. My understanding is, however, that the number of people who came forward on the amnesty is around 20,000. I will get an accurate figure for the honourable senator, if not today, then certainly tomorrow. I understand that the numbers are fairly close to the numbers that we expected to come in in the amnesty. However, it would appear that the amounts that we look like recovering are not as high as we had estimated. I will not be able to tell whether or not the figure will come in substantially lower than the Budget figure until we make an estimate of how many people simply cancel their benefits from the Department of Social Security on the basis of the publicity associated with the amnesty, and there was some factoring in of a figure for that in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know exactly how long it will take for me to get those final figures, but if Senator Alston wants an estimate-that is all I can give and it has to be fairly rough given, as I said, that I have literally only just got off the plane-I think the figure is likely to be close to 40 million rather than to 55 million. The honourable senator will have to give me some leeway on that matter as I will not be certain for a few more days.</PARA>

I hope that, at the same time that he provides the additional information, he will be prepared to indicate the basis on which the original estimate was made and, therefore, the reasons why the actual figure is below that estimate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Batteries, actually. There was a fire at 5.30 p.m. last night in the building on the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) side of the Canberra Airport, which houses the switchboard equipment for operating the runway, taxiway and visual approach slope indicator system lights at the airport. The damage was extensive. The cause of the fire at the moment is unknown. I am told that I will have a report later on this afternoon on the full extent of the damage but, as already reported to me, the fire damage is extensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Maguire has alluded to the extinguishing of the runway lights and the taxiway lights. The RAAF managed to install last night, I must say very rapidly, an emergency system of lighting powered by batteries at the airport. That system is still being used. I am assured by the airport operators that that system will be quite safely and effectively used, but I will be able to give a fuller report on when full services will be restored through the switchboard at a later stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Social Security explain the nexus between a medical impairment and work force incapacity which currently determines eligibility for the invalid pension? Is it a fact that persons with as little as a 15 per cent medical impairment have been held to have an 85 per cent incapacity for work?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2672" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difference between impairment and incapacity has been at the heart of the debate on invalid pensions over many years. What has to be compared is the level of medical dysfunction with the way that that medical impairment will affect a person's capacity to work. Obviously, it is arbitrary by nature and that is why, I think, we are always going to have difficulties and disagreements about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The changes in the Budget this year moved more to the medical impairment than was the case in the past. In the calculations for incapacity we had a range of factors-such as age and even language-that had been taken into account, in my view, too much. We have moved to take the calculation away from that and look much more at levels of medical impairment. It is possible that, in the past, 15 per cent levels of medical impairment have led to calculations of 85 per cent incapacity-that has occurred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question in the light of that response. Is the invalid pension to be replaced by a disability support pension because the Government is not satisfied with the current basis for entitlement and, if so, why will the new scheme not come into operation for another 12 months, when Professor Bettina Cass identified these problems more than two years ago?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2672" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we are going to have a new payment to replace the invalid pension. We have had reviews on this question going back to 1984. I think it was a very significant reform that we announced in the Budget. At the heart of it was our belief that some of those persons going on invalid payments can be streamed into an active stream where rehabilitation and training can be sought, and where some employment prospects will exist. Given that, we have to make sure that the numbers of rehabilitation places and training places are available and also that the system is explained to those who will be affected by it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe we should approach major reforms of that kind by announcing that they will start very soon. We have taken the time to ensure that there will be places available in rehabilitation and training, and to make the community aware of this very fundamental change-one which, I am sure, most people in the community will support and certainly one that has been supported by organisations for the disabled.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. Is the Minister aware of the findings of Hobart-based consulting engineer, Mr Andrew Boon, that proposed changes to Australia's maritime radio safety network may derive from incorrect engineering data and may, therefore, represent additional risks to professional fishers and small boat owners in Tasmanian waters? Has the Minister read a report in the Hobart Mercury of 26 September 1990 in which the chief of Tasmania's police search and rescue unit, Inspector Maurice Massie, suggested that the proportion of radio calls from Tasmanian waters which can be quickly and easily received by authorities will drop from over 90 per cent to 70 per cent if the closure of Hobart Radio proceeds? Can the Minister give an assurance, firstly, that the closure of Hobart Radio will be reviewed in the light of these findings and, secondly, that the performance of any new radio safety arrangements will at least equal those of the existing network?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2673" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly give Senator Coates an assurance that, providing boat owners are responsible enough to re-equip their craft with equipment capable of using the new state-of-the-art technology which the Federal Government has now in place rather than the obsolescent technology that was formerly employed by OTC Ltd, those services will certainly be at least the equivalent of the current radio services being provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of the withdrawal of Commonwealth support for OTC was a matter for debate at a meeting of State and Federal Transport Ministers-the Australian Transport Advisory Council-some several meetings ago. There was agreement from all State Ministers, including the New South Wales Transport Minister but not the Minister for Transport in Tasmania, about the basis on which the Commonwealth made that decision. Quite simply, the Commonwealth has established state-of-the-art technology for maritime search and rescue. That is administered through a ground station at Alice Springs in the Northern Territory which transmits by landline to the Sea Safety Centre in Canberra and operates both an effective system of high frequency radio communication and EPIRBs-the emergency position indicating radio beacons.</PARA>
<PARA> Some small fisheries, particularly in Tasmania, are affected to some degree by the removal of local radio systems because these fisheries, in particular the lobster fishery in Tasmania, operate very close to shore-in fact under cliffs in some cases-and were not even properly serviced by OTC radio.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the report that Senator Coates has referred to. At the moment it is being technically assessed by officers of my Department. I have not had an opportunity yet, because that assessment has only just begun, to look at it, but I will certainly be addressing that report. I am happy to provide Senator Coates or indeed the Senate with a more detailed response after I have read it.</PARA>
<PARA> But the basis of the Federal Government's position quite simply is that we have installed state-of-the-art technology which fully meets all of the obligations of the Federal Government under the international treaties that provide for sea safety, search and rescue. That system is currently costing the Commonwealth $11m a year to run and the Commonwealth simply took the view-and I think correctly-that it was not reasonable to expect the Commonwealth to fully fund a brand new state-of-the-art system at $11m a year while at the same time maintaining the obsolete system that it replaces, which, in the case of Tasmania alone, costs half a million dollars a year. However, having said that, I will be happy to address the concerns raised in this report after I have had an opportunity to examine it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Is the Minister aware of the declining employment opportunities in the sawmilling industries of south-eastern New South Wales and east Gippsland in Victoria which are due to rapidly increasing use of pine timber for construction purposes and the increasing mechanisation in the sawmilling industry? In view of these trends, does the Government intend to assist in the development of alternative industries to generate employment in these areas and to establish hardwood plantations to meet any remaining future demands for hardwood timber, financing such initiatives in part out of higher licence fees and levies on export woodchips from non-National Estate forests? Does the Minister agree that this is a more sensible strategy than the Government's present short-sighted course of destroying old growth National Estate forests which in any case will not safeguard jobs in the longer term?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2674" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pros- pects for employment in the timber industry have been at the centre of this debate for a long time. The Commonwealth has over the past few years attempted, in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, to maximise those employment opportunities while still hopefully protecting as much as we can of our old growth forest. Senator Powell attributes as a reason for the decline of employment in sawmills a rapid increase in the use of pines in the building industry. That is certainly occurring. I would have thought that the improvements in technology in the last few years might have had an effect almost as great as the use of pines in the building industry on that employment in the sawmills. I am not sure which would be greater, but certainly they are both significant reasons for that decline in employment. If one goes back to the agreement with Tasmania in 1988, one will see that the Commonwealth was involved in looking at hardwood plantations then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not certain as to the exact state of negotiations in Gippsland now. But my understanding is that a report has been given to the Victorian Government which the Commonwealth has yet to discuss with it. Obviously, in respect of the south-eastern forests of New South Wales, there has been an announcement of some note in the last 24 hours. My understanding is that hardwood plantations will be considered there again. I will have to find out from Mrs Kelly exactly where that discussion on hardwood plantations is up to.</PARA>
<PARA> As I think everyone in the Government has acknowledged over the past few years, hardwood plantations are certainly one of the answers that the industry will have to look to if it wants to have a secure future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I thank the Minister for his answer, as far as it goes. But I ask him to address what was the essence of the third part of the question, that is, does he not agree that all that destruction of old growth forests in the National Estate can do, if it goes ahead, is safeguard jobs in the very short term? Does he not agree that it would be a far better strategy to finance initiatives in the shorter term by higher licence fees and levies on export woodchips which are currently going out of those areas from non-National Estate forests?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First off, National Estate listing has never meant that exploitation of the area was forbidden under all or any circumstances. I might say that that was never even part of the origins of the National Estate, which, of course, had its foundations in Whitlam's term of government. It was always the case that we were recognising special areas of Australia. But, equally, it was always the case that this was being done on the basis of whether or not there were prudent and feasible alternatives for development. That is a principle that has applied ever since that legislation came into the Parliament. So my first point is that exploitation of old growth forests in the National Estate has never been prevented by the legislation that set up the National Estate in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of their destruction being a short term job saving exercise, I am not certain whether that is right. It is the case that the industry would claim that with proper-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer. I am not attempting to duck any part of it. Just give me a chance. I must admit that I am not thinking at 100 miles an hour today. I do not think one can be certain that that is the case. The industry will certainly claim that in its management of old growth forests in the first place, and then what replaces them, proper sustainable forestry will mean that jobs will not be lost and, theoretically, could increase if forests are exploited properly. That is a claim that industry has made for ever. Being certain about its truth, of course, is a matter of defining what is sustainable logging. I have always personally had a difficulty in coming to grips with a definition because it has changed so much over time. But on the assumption that it is possible to have sustainable logging, it is not necessarily the case that jobs are protected only in the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell says that there is nothing profound about it. That was an unnecessary comment. We do not expect too much profound coming from him. When it comes to higher licence fees, the Commonwealth has been of the view that some States have charged ridiculously low licence fees in forests for far too long. Certainly, the Queensland Government, with which Senator Boswell was associated, was one of the worst culprits in this respect. I would have thought that licence fees, not just in relation to export woodchips but in relation to the exploitation of forests generally, have been too low in Australia for too long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, however, has been remedied in large part in the last couple of years because all State governments have come to the view that resources were going out of the door too cheaply. In terms of the woodchip industry itself, I would have thought that, rather than simply looking at questions of higher licence fees, what the Government, the industry and certainly conservation groups must look at is an improvement in our secondary processing. I would much rather see that happen. Rather than export our jobs elsewhere, we could have them here.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I perhaps should answer this question in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters. The Government's commitment to equal opportunity remains as strong as it ever was, which is well ahead of any other party in this Parliament. It has been the pioneering Government in Australia in establishing the right for opportunity in employment to be created for particular groups who are disadvantaged. Those groups are Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders; people with disabilities, who are traditionally discriminated against; workers from non-English-speaking backgrounds, who also have discrimination visited on them and are not regarded, it seems, by employers on an equal basis with others; and women. The Government is committed to those objectives. Equal opportunity is high on our social justice agenda. It is something that we have pioneered in government and we will continue to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since there has been some newspaper speculation-some of that speculation was picked up in the question from Senator Reynolds-may I say that the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, who is in charge of funding and structures within this area, Minister Wendy Fatin, who is the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, and I, in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service matters, met last night and resolved the matters that were in contention. The result of those discussions is to increase the level at which the equal employment opportunity position should be supervised within the Public Service Commission, and to agree to advertise that position for applicants to apply from both within and outside the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA> The new Public Service Commission structure which has been agreed to as well establishes a balanced arrangement based on a workload that provides for, as I have said, a higher executive representation of equal employment opportunity. The new position will be that of a new First Assistant Commissioner who will be responsible, and designated as being responsible, for human resource policy and who will manage, in addition to the equal employment opportunity responsibilities, issues of staff mobility and recruitment. We have agreed as Ministers that we will provide this new structure, will review it in about two years' time, and see how it is functioning; and if it needs to be changed or improved then, based on its track record, we will do so. I table a press release with the new structure attached to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I refer to the artificial sweetening substance aspartame, marketed in Australia as Nutrasweet.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that in July of this year doubts about the safety of aspartame, which is marketed in the United Kingdom-were reported in the Guardian newspaper. Concerns were expressed by Dr Millstone of Sussex University about the authenticity of original research work on aspartame. I referred these concerns to the Australian Food Standards Committee, as this Committee is responsible for the development and review of food standards in Australia. I am now able to report the outcome of the examination carried out by the food, science and technology subcommittee, which is responsible for providing advice on the assessment of the safety of food additives and contaminates in food. Of course, copies of Dr Millstone's papers were supplied to that subcommittee for review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the concerns expressed by Dr Millstone were initially raised by him during the mid-1970s and the issues had been reviewed by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1979 and 1981, by a public board of inquiry in 1981, and by an investigation conducted by the United States General Accounting Office in 1987. All these United States authorities had rejected the claims made by Dr Millstone. The food, science and technology subcommittee was familiar with these inquiries and their recommendations. There was no new data supplied which had not been considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council when it approved aspartame for use in specific foods at restricted levels in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> No change to present approvals for use of aspartame has been announced by the United States or the United Kingdom Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who had also reviewed Dr Millstone's data. I believe that consumers who are concerned about Nutrasweet can rely on the expertise of our scientific review.</PARA>

Australian and overseas authorities have rejected allegations made by Dr Millstone. I believe that consumers of foods with this additive can have their misgivings laid to rest. The use of Nutrasweet for foods in Australia will continue to be monitored by the food, science and technology subcommittee. Any request for extension of use in other foods will be evaluated by that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly want to take this opportunity to comment on the participation by the Australian delegation in this most important United Nations conference held in Cuba dealing with organised crime and the treatment of offenders. I particularly want to comment on the participation by Senator Barney Cooney, who, at great difficulty and hardship to himself, went to Havana in order to superbly lead the Australian delegation. He was aided in that by the South Australian Attorney-General, Mr Chris Sumner. Ten other members from the Commonwealth, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales membership made up the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The congress must be regarded as a most successful one. Many international conferences, even national conferences, as honourable senators will know, can just result in resolutions which are grandstanding or platitudinous being passed. But Senator Cooney insisted on behalf of Australia-and got his view across very effectively-that the resolutions of this conference be very practical in their outcome. In particular, the conference looked at modern bilateral treaties and the help that we could give to those countries which did not have a practice of treaty negotiation in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result the congress adopted two model bilateral treaties on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters which had been sponsored by Australia. These are the model treaties which Australia uses in its own treaty negotiating program. They are designed to ensure that there should be no safe haven in the world for those who indulge in criminal activities, particularly nefarious criminal activities such as drug trafficking and major fraud, and that offenders should not be able to escape due punishment by fleeing to some safe haven where extradition treaties are not in place. The mutual assistance in criminal matters treaties are also a very important part of the necessary international cooperation in dealing with these criminal activities where the criminals, of course, do not regard national boundaries as any threat or hindrance to their activities. Of course, governments have to take the same point of view.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the importance of these two model treaties sponsored by Australia and adopted by that particular conference, they have been referred by the Congress to the United Nations General Assembly separately, rather than by way of inclusion in its general report. The contribution made by Australia to the successful outcome of both the Congress and associated workshops was the subject of favourable comment both by other delegations as well as by the secretariat. It was an excellent example. I hope it is a precursor to the meetings which are to be held later this month between the Prime Minister and the Premiers. It is an excellent example of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in the achievement of objectives in a recognised international forum. I hope to present to the Senate a formal report on that congress at a later time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The JET scheme, which has not been in operation for all that long, is an important step in how the Government assists those women who are receiving the sole parent pension but who wish to gain employment. We are still speaking predominantly about women in looking at sole parent pensions; it is only 3 per cent or 4 per cent of such pensioners who are not women. In the first 9,000 interviews under the JET program, approximately 6,000 women indicated that they would undertake some training if it were to become available to them. The others basically indicated that parenting was for them the way they wished to proceed. I think it is the Government's duty to look at those women and to respect their wishes on either side of that equation. For those who have been seeking training, the JET program has been introduced. It will be expanded over time and, hopefully, the Government will be able to take into account the needs of all those women who will seek some training. In doing that, at the same time we will have to build up the scheme as we build up the numbers in child-care-the Government has already announced some schemes to do that-because obviously the lack of child-care can sometimes act as a disincentive for those women who may be seeking employment. So the initial reactions to the JET program are encouraging, encouraging enough certainly for the Government to seek to expand it over the coming years.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of the Treasurer's commitment to continuing the regime of high interest rates, does the Minister agree that the referral to a committee which will report several months and possibly a year hence, is little more than a device to get the issue off the political agenda? Does the Minister agree that Australian industry, small business and primary producers are in urgent need of interest rate relief? Is the Government prepared to refer immediately to the Prices Surveillance Authority the specific issue of the banks' operating margins, which are now almost double what they were in 1988 and among the highest in the world?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has asked me a number of questions about bank interest rates and the proposed inquiry by a parliamentary committee. The answer to the first part of the question asked by Senator Spindler, relating to the widening of terms of reference to cover corrupt bank practices put on record by Senator McLean,-`Will those terms of reference be widened to cover that?'-is no. The terms of reference are yet to be finalised by the Treasurer and they will be made public in due course, but that is not what the inquiry is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the second part of the question, Senator Spindler makes the allegation that the referral of the committee is some sort of political exercise to get the interest rate issue off the political agenda. The answer to that question is no. The issue for the committee is not whether interest rates should remain relatively high. After all, that is a matter for the Government to determine, in terms of the tightness of monetary policy, and there has been a statement made by the Minister and the Government every second day about that for the last 18 months. The issue for the committee is the question of competitiveness within the banking system following deregulation of the banking sector and the admission of foreign banks. That is the issue which the committee will be fundamentally addressing.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Spindler asked whether I agreed that small business and primary producers are in urgent need of interest rate relief and whether this issue could be referred to the Prices Surveillance Authority. The answer is that this issue will not be referred to the Prices Surveillance Authority. As the Treasurer has stated on numerous occasions and as I have stated on numerous occasions here, no-one wants interest rates to remain high for longer than necessary because of the sorts of consequences-often difficult and sad consequences-pointed out by Senator Spindler in the body of his question.</PARA>
<PARA> A Treasury Reserve Bank analysis of recent trends in bank lending margins has revealed, in summary, the following information: namely, bank margins have widened since the end of 1989. To date, the rise in average margins has increased bank revenue by $160m above what it would otherwise have been. If these greater margins were maintained, their effect would be to increase bank revenue by around $1,000m in a full year, and that figure would almost totally compensate for the increase of bad debts on bank books, estimated currently to be $1,200m.</PARA>
<PARA> Those are matters of fact which might help Senator Spindler in his consideration of this matter. I think it is important to have those facts on the record, as distinct from some wild allegations that have been made about some of these matters on all sides of politics.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say is that this must be the best question in Question Time today. I just want the record to show that it came from the Government side. The answer to the question is: first, yes; secondly, yes; and, thirdly, let me enlarge on it. It is well known that this Government has shown greater policy initiative, greater courage and greater foresight on micro-economic reform than any other government in the history of this country. Events over the last few weeks bear that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe, and I said to the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, that the building and construction industry in Australia should not be exempt from going through a process of micro-economic reform. We see it as basically a cost-plus industry able to pass its costs on to the consumers of buildings. On average, there is between 20 and 30 per cent lost time on central business district construction costs around Australia. In this industry there is little or no on the job training and little or no research and development. There is great employment insecurity in this industry, leading to work practices that at times encourage projects to be prolonged beyond their normal expectation. It is an industry typified by the lowest tender winning the job, but with a capacity for rise and fall provisions in its final contract arrangements, which usually means rise and rise provisions. It is typified by problems between contractors and subcontractors, bankruptcy and a high accident level.</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the corporate high-fliers of recent memory have helped tarnish Australia's international reputation. Where funds are borrowed abroad to support major construction projects in Australia, we are now finding that the lenders of those finances are citing the spectacularly unsuccessful records of some of the corporate high-fliers as reasons why they want to see some change in Australia before they lend to those types of entrepreneurs.</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of all this, I have put a reform package to the building industry, both to the AFCC, which Senator Burns has asked me about-and that was at a dinner-and to the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, which is the dominant union in the industry, at a lunch.</PARA>
<PARA> The terms of our reform package are that the industry should adhere to the new employment practices that are proposed, the new ways of working on the sites that we are proposing and the new industrial relations principles that are being proposed. If it does not, we as a Commonwealth Government, as a major consumer of buildings in Australia, and of our own volition-but where we have support from State Governments too-will exclude from our tender bid list those companies that do not affirm those practices. We will, in effect, hold the ring in terms of fair play in the Australian building and construction industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I might say that a number of leading companies in Australia-a number of resource development companies-have also said that they would be interested in joining us in holding that ring too to ensure fair play for all.</PARA>
<PARA> The strategy that we have in mind will be policed by a national tripartite body to oversee it. It will have specific working committees coordinating the industrial relations aspects of reform, and the levels and areas of Government assistance and involvement in the process. We will-in concert with construction companies who wish to be part of this reform, and with the building unions that have affirmed that there is a need for these sorts of changes-be establishing model construction sites. We believe it is not simply a matter of proclaiming policy objectives but, rather, it is a matter of having demonstration examples of what those reform practices can achieve.</PARA>

This means that Australian oil producers are able to trade their product on the world market and/or obtain world parity pricing for it within Australia. Thus, the value of oil produced in Australia is at world rates not at some artificially lower rate contrived by overt regulation-which might be what the National Party of Australia would prefer in an area of its interests, but is not what a government committed to a mixed economy with a strong free enterprise dimension wants to see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, this means that Australian oil prices follow world trends. The prices we are seeing at present on the spot market are not to be regarded as any indication of what the longer term price for oil will be on the world market. Indeed, the truth is that supply of oil in the world is currently matching demand, notwithstanding the fact that we are moving into a northern winter in which traditionally there is a higher demand for oil. Supply is matching demand. What we are seeing is speculator activity on the spot market where the faintest of rumour or a whiff of a gunshot in the Gulf causes the spot market to reflect all sorts of speculator instability in prices. It is not a basis for making a long term policy and it is not a basis for this Government to change any of its commitments to world parity pricing and a free market in Australian petroleum products.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 September Senator Crane asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question regarding the Australian Wheat Board. I have received a reply from the Treasurer. With the honourable senator's indulgence, I will have the reply, which is somewhat long, incorporated in Hansard. I seek leave to have the reply incorporated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The reply read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's prior payment performance in relation to wheat sales have been exemplary, and despite the uncertain situation in the Gulf the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) is treating the situation as a temporary suspension rather than a cessation of its contracts with Iraq and expects that in time normal commercial relations will be resumed.</PARA>
<PARA>In any event there is a four month waiting period after payments are overdue and before any claims are payable. In this context the Senator should note that the bulk of the total exposure to Iraq is not yet overdue. Indeed, only about one third could result in claim payments this financial year. The four month delay also means that the first claim payment would not be due until December, and given the volatility of events in Kuwait it was and is by no means certain that claims will be made.</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, if claims are made, it remains our expectation that payments will ultimately be resumed and that any claims paid will be recovered. The Government will therefore have to make a decision later in the year as to whether claim payments should be refinanced pending recovery or met directly from the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 September Senator Coulter asked me a question regarding greenhouse gas research. The answer inevitably is a long answer and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The reply read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been the main international forum for discussion and development of the greenhouse issue. Australia has provided strong diplomatic and technical support to the IPCC process including strong support to Working Group I which undertook a scientific assessment of the greenhouse problem. Indeed, Australia was one of five areas in the world singled out for calculation of the likely climatic results of various greenhouse scenarios. Australia was chosen because of the advanced climate modelling work done by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology; that is some indication of Australia's scientific standing in this field.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is giving a high priority to ensuring that national, southern hemisphere and regional concerns are taken into account internationally. We have promised to provide at least $5.7m over the next three years for greenhouse research. In 1989-90 the Government provided $3.462m to funding core research on monitoring of greenhouse induced climate change. The research is being undertaken through CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology and the Department of Defence's Permanent Committee on Tides and Mean Sea Level.</PARA>
<PARA>This research involves modelling of the climate system, research into regional climate processes and monitoring of the climate system to identify special regional characteristics. In addition, modelling to improve regional predictions for greenhouse induced climate change and linking with overseas ocean circulation and climate models is being developed. Other work currently being done by CSIRO is on providing control strategies to limit emissions. A major factor in this is improving the efficiency of resource utilisation practices.</PARA>
<PARA>A national research grants scheme is being established and is to be operative this year under the administration of the National Greenhouse Advisory Committee. The scheme will complement existing greenhouse research, by focusing on research that is ineligible for support from either core research funds or other existing grant schemes. Proposals for funding must relate to research into understanding the scientific processes which underlie greenhouse induced climate change, understanding the impacts and development of adaptation and mitigation responses. Over 100 expressions of interest have been received and are currently being considered.</PARA>
<PARA>Greenhouse research may also be funded under other programs, for example the Grants for Industrial Research and Development (GIRD) Scheme. The Government has decided to establish a new generic technology within the GIRD scheme on Waste and Environmental Management Technology. The Industry Research and Development Board has allocated $3.5m for projects to be approved this year. All projects will involve a commercial firm and are aimed at the development of commercially exploitable technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter's question referred to activities which I have initiated, but naturally many of my colleagues also have an interest in these issues. Greenhouse gas research projects in areas such as: renewable energy (solar, hydro-electricity, wind and biomass); energy efficiency improvements; natural gas in vehicles and methane collection from mines have been funded by the Government under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program (NERDDP). To date, a total of over $74m (since 1978) out of a total NERDDP budget of around $250m has been directed at greenhouse related research to assist Australia develop timely and cost effective energy responses.</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth, State and Territory energy departments are also working together to identify areas where further reductions can be achieved and current programs and policies enhanced. In particular, energy departments are targeting energy efficiency in domestic appliances, new homes, commercial buildings and passenger vehicles. The Australian Mineral and Energy Council (AMEC) have produced a report which provides details on current and proposed action to address greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector.</PARA>
<PARA>AMEC is but one of a number of bodies, including ANZEC, the Victorian Solar Energy Council, the Prime Minister's Science Council and the Prime Minister's Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which are investigating the development of climate change issues in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>PENSIONER HEALTH BENEFIT CARDS</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="2685" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston asked me a question on 19 September regarding pensioner health benefit (PHB) cards being received by pensioners not entitled to receive them. I have an answer for him. The announcement in the Budget of new arrangements to maximise the income of pensioners was accompanied by a commitment that no existing pensioner health benefit card holders would lose their cards because of the changes. Because many pensioners might want to get a higher return on their investments and would act to do so after the Budget, arrangements had to be operating from 22 August to ensure that PHB cards were not withdrawn where income increased above the fringe benefit level of $95 for this purpose. It would be unfair that pensioners who maximise their income before 1 March 1991 implementation date would lose their eligibility for the PHB card.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Changes were made to the pensions computer system on 22 August to ensure that cards were not withdrawn. As a result, a very small number of people over the PHB income limits for reasons not associated with the income maximisation changes were issued with PHB cards by the Department of Social Security (DSS) through its computer system. This is because by Budget night we had to have in place a system which ensured that current PHB card holders would not lose their cards. Because of time constraints, it was not possible to develop a computer program which differentiated between those who went over the fringe benefit limits after maximising their income in response to deeming and those who exceeded the limits for other reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> A computer program that can differentiate will be developed by October. The computer systems changes involved are complex and require considerable development and testing. DSS staff have been instructed to ask for the return of cards from persons who are not eligible and where they come to notice. The cards which are not returned will be valid only till the end of 1990. It should be appreciated that less than 14 per cent of the total pensioner population do not attract PHB eligibility. Of those only a very small number have been issued with cards. My Department is currently investigating the actual number involved. Although precise figures are not available, it is unlikely that there will be any significant additional cost to the States. There will be a very small additional cost to the Commonwealth for pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA> When consultations are held with State governments soon about longer term rationalisation of fringe benefit eligibility, the situation I have described will be explained. I am sure that all honourable senators, including Senator Alston, would be more concerned if those who were entitled to keep their cards had lost them. The Government has acted to protect those whom it promised in the Budget to protect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Committee is taking action because such notices must be given within 15 sitting days of tabling. The notices are in respect of six instruments made within four portfolios. Some of the Committee's concerns relate to possible breaches of personal liberties. In one of these instruments a statutory authority is given an inappropriate power to demand certain information from any person. In another a public official is given an apparent power to determine whether a person is guilty of an offence. One instrument does not appear to provide a right of review of an adverse exercise by a public official of a discretion to waive or remit fees. Other concerns of the Committee relate to parliamentary proprieties. In one case, material may have been incorporated invalidly. In another, payment of Commonwealth money may have been authorised twice. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the concerns of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Wool Marketing Regulations (Amendment)</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1990 No. 203</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations, among other things, provide that the Australian Wool Corporation may direct any person to provide information relating to the wool tax payments on wool sold under the Reserve Price Scheme. A penalty of $1,000 is provided for failure to comply with a direction.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very wide power which may be unintentional due to a drafting oversight. The Explanatory Statement which accompanies the Regulations advises that the intention of this provision is to enable the AWC to seek this information only from registered wool brokers. Such a provision would have been reasonable and appropriate. However, the actual drafting of the provision empowers the AWC to require information from any person at all.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee questions whether such a wide power was intended. If it was, then the Committee would require detailed justification for such a power being granted to a statutory authority. If it was not, then the Regulations should be amended. In any event, the Committee asks why there is a discrepancy between a provision of an instrument affecting personal liberties and the explanation of that provision in the Explanatory Statement.</PARA>
<PARA>Control of Naval Waters Regulations (Amendment)</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1990 No. 206</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations are made under powers contained in the Control of Naval Waters Amendment Act 1978. That Act remained unproclaimed for more than 12 years, until 1 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>The Regulations provide that the Superintendent of Naval Waters may cause to be removed from certain waters, or from the foreshore of those waters, persons who ``have contravened these Regulations.'' The parent Act, as amended in 1978, authorises the making of Regulations in those terms. Nevertheless, the drafting of the Regulations, while within power, may be a breach of personal liberties. If the power is to remove people who have been charged and convicted of contravening the Regulations, then such a provision may be fair. The actual drafting, however, appears defective. As drafted, it appears that the Superintendent is the judge of whether an offence has, or has not, occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a basic principle of personal liberty that a person is innocent until proven guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction. In this case the Committee believes that the Regulations should be amended to clarify their intention.</PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Regulations</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1990 No. 231</PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations provide administrative detail for a scheme established by their parent Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 for the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. The scheme is intended to protect public health and people at work.</PARA>
<PARA>The Regulations prescribe fees for purposes of the scheme. Some of these are very substantial. In one case the fee is $28,000, in another $25,000. The Regulations give the Director an unfettered discretion to waive or remit fees. The only criteria for the exercise of the discretion is that the Director must think it ``fit'' to do so. There is no provision for Administrative Appeals Tribunal review of this discretion.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee always questions provisions which grant discretions to public officials with no external right of review of the merits of an adverse decision. In this case there is the additional deficiency that there are no suitable criteria to limit or guide the exercise of the discretions once the conditions for their exercise arise. In addition, it may be that in this case the Regulations could provide for mandatory waiver or remission of fees once certain objective criteria had been met. The parent Act properly provides for AAT review of important discretions. In these circumstances it may be appropriate for the Regulations to be amended to remove the discretions altogether or at least to provide for AAT review.</PARA>
<PARA>Determination TAFE 7/90 under s.13 of the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Determination TAFE 8/90 under s.13 of the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA>These Determinations approve technical and further education proposals and determine amounts to be paid to different States in 1990 in respect of the proposals. The earlier Determination, TAFE 7/90, determines $1,621,040 for eight projects in four States. Determination TAFE 8/90, made three weeks later, determines $2,699,852 for eleven projects in five States. Five of the projects appear to be approved and to have identical amounts determined in both Determinations. The Frankston College of TAFE had $46,135 determined in TAFE 7/90 and then another $46,135 determined in TAFE 8/90. Logan, Rockhampton and Balga Colleges of TAFE similarly had projects approved and amounts of $277,500, $341,625 and $297,280 determined twice in three weeks. Hobart Technical College (Clarence Campus) had $195,500 approved twice. A single Explanatory Statement nine lines long was provided for 10 of these Determinations, which determine some $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if delegated legislation is not clear in its effect and accompanied by adequate explanatory material. On the face of the later instrument there is no intention to restate or amend the amounts in the earlier Determination. The legal effect of the later Determination appears to be to approve a cumulative payment of equal amounts.</PARA>
<PARA>Livestock Export (Merino) Orders (Amendment)</PARA>
<PARA>Livestock Export Orders No. 2 of 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee questioned the validity of some aspects of these Orders.</PARA>
<PARA>Some instruments of delegated legislation incorporate other material, which then becomes part of Commonwealth legislation. In the last year the Committee has scrutinised several instruments which have incorporated thousands of pages of material. Such incorporation is legally valid insofar as the material is already in existence at the date the instrument comes into effect. The incorporation of future material, or material as amended from time to time in the future, is invalid unless such material is part of an Act or a regulation or rule made under an Act. In addition, the parent Act may expressly authorise incorporation of future material or material as amended from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA>The present instrument incorporates a variety of material. Some of this incorporation is valid, such as an already published set of auction dates designated as such by the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders Ltd (``the AASMBL''). Other material is less obviously valid. An auction is required to be subject to the ``Guidelines and Conditions for Export Sales,'' determined and published by the AASMBL. Neither the instrument nor the Explanatory Statement indicates whether that is an existing publication. There would also problems if it was intended to amend the Guidelines. A further problem appears to exist with another provision which refers to dates for auctions ``as published prior to the commencement of each subsequent export ram selling season...'' Such publications were not in existence at the time the present Orders came into effect.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee seeks clarification of these incorporations, in particular whether there is some provision in the parent Act or Regulations which authorises what may be invalid provisions. It may be appropriate to amend the instrument to place its validity beyond doubt.</PARA>

<PARA>This report received some publicity when released some two or three weeks ago as to the fact that as a government owned enterprise it had had a very successful financial year. It made a net profit of $235m; it paid a dividend to the Government of $104m; its return on equity was 38 per cent-in all a very handsome report. </PARA>
<PARA> The real reason I wish to make some brief remarks on this matter is the debate that has taken place in the past three months in the community and in the Government about the future of telecommunications in Australia. Everyone will be aware that some three weeks ago the Australian Labor Party took a decision to merge OTC Ltd and Telecom Australia into a new publicly owned communications carrier doing both domestic and international communications. In doing so, we have created an organisation that will have gross revenues of probably around $11 billion on present estimates for its first financial year. It certainly will be the largest employer in Australia. It will be able to compete effectively in the international market not only in the straight provision of telecommunications services in and out of Australia, but will provide opportunities--</PARA>

I think that we can all look forward to the workers in OTC being able to continue to provide an excellent service as they have been providing it as outlined in the present annual report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on the 1990 annual report of OTC Ltd. I make the comment that in modern society telecommunications, both domestic and international, is becoming increasingly important. Not only do Australian citizens rely heavily on our communications systems for their social cohesiveness, but as a nation our national efficiency and security is largely dependant on these systems. Much has been said lately of OTC in the context of the restructuring of Australia's telecommunications industry, and the Australian Democrats' opposition to this restructuring is by this stage well known in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Putting aside the considerable strategic reasons for maintaining public ownership of our communications networks, the financial results contained in OTC's 1990 annual report provide very compelling support for retaining public ownership of OTC. In comparison to 1989 results, OTC has increased its net profit by 24 per cent from $189m to $235m. Its return on equity in 1990 was an impressive 38 per cent, far in excess of the return shown by many of Australia's private enterprises. The value of OTC's assets increased by 15 per cent to over $1.3 billion and its dividend increased by 24 per cent to $104m. </PARA>
<PARA> When looking at such impressive financial results as these, we should always keep in mind that while OTC remains in public ownership these benefits accrue to all Australians. We all benefit from the performance of OTC. It is also worth recalling that, despite OTC's enviable financial results in 1990 and in the past, the Federal Opposition has stated a commitment to selling off OTC to private enterprise. At the same time as producing these results, OTC managed to keep the costs of international calls to amongst the cheapest available in the world. It is a common experience to hear overseas visitors expressing surprise at how much cheaper it was for them to call home than it was for them to call Australia from their country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the Government's plans to combine OTC with Telecom Australia, it is interesting to analyse the close relationship the two have had in the past. OTC currently plugs into the Telecom network and it also relies on Telecom to prepare its bills. This relationship has worked marvellously in the past and I am certain that the amalgamated Telecom-OTC will continue to provide Australian citizens with exceptional telecommunications services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Whilst I do not oppose the motion, I want to take this opportunity to express a few growing concerns about the state of the Notice Paper and the business program of the Government. I understood from the red Order of Business today that the Acting Manager of Government Business, Senator Richardson, would be here to move the motion which has just been moved and I would have been able to address my concerns to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The state of business for this week is totally unsatisfactory. We understood that we were coming here to debate the broadcasting Bills this week. Then we found they have been pulled off the list. We were then made aware that for the last three full sitting days of this week we were to debate the social welfare legislation and the social security and veterans affairs legislation, which the Government knew was to be sent off to a committee. In other words, there was to be no debate at all on those pieces of legislation, leaving a three-day total gap. </PARA>
<PARA> We now understand that the Government is struggling to find some legislation for the House of Representatives-the tax Bills are being suggested-which will be rushed through there and brought into this place to be debated without further notice. That in itself is an unsatisfactory practice. It is certainly not the way in which we have normally done business in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> This mess that the Government has got itself into is all the more appalling considering that the Senate has hardly sat this year and, therefore, there has been more than ample time for it to work out an orderly program. The result of this unsatisfactory situation will be that a mountain of legislation at the end of this session will be dealt with unsatisfactorily by the Senate. The situation that we have criticised in the past is not only to occur again but we suspect, as it appears now from the state of the Notice Paper, is to be accentuated. </PARA>
<PARA> So I want to use this motion to indicate the Opposition's dissatisfaction with the way in which the Government is programming its business. Not only is it annoying to us, but it results in a lower quality of legislation than we would wish passed in this chamber. I ask that the Government get its affairs in order in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in continuation, and the technical aspects of the Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill have been discussed previously. I continue the debate by saying that no-one has to be told that Australia's rural communities are in crisis. Commodity prices are plummeting while interest rates, labour costs and other inputs are rising, and the Australian dollar is at a record all-time high. Much of Australia's rural future depends on the subsidies problem being addressed in the coming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round of discussions. Its future will hinge on the abolition of subsidies and price support schemes. Currently, we are seeing trade-offs between the United States and its farmers, and the European Community and its farmers are having discussions at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The future of Australia's rural industry depends fairly heavily on a successful round of the GATT negotiations. What is going to come out of these negotiations? That is what the world is asking. Many people are saying it will be a win for free trade. Some are predicting that GATT is dead and that failed negotiations will mean an increase in tariffs and protectionism. The question also has to be asked: Will the smaller nations, in agricultural world trade terms, be able to force the United States and the European Community into making some concessions to cut subsidies and protection? These are the questions that need to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's agricultural industry is fast becoming a dying industry, not only because of the Government's financial incompetence-that has played a fairly massive role-but because of international pressures. The effect of the subsidy war between America and Europe is being felt in Australia-and not only on the broadacre farms; it is reaching a crisis point and devastating smaller industries. Sultanas, apricots and currants are joining the long list of Australian horticultural industries which are suffering from cheap, dumped and subsidised imports flooding onto Australia's domestic market. The list is endless: pineapples-Senator Kernot recognises the position of the pineapple growers-bananas, strawberries, peanuts, dairy products, rice--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I know that Senator Bell is concerned about potatoes because he comes from Tasmania. The list also includes orange, apple juice, and Canadian pork, and even the humble navy bean is being subsidised by overseas countries. Queensland growers tell me that the pea and bean industries are now suffering huge cuts in their production. Last quarter alone an extra 1,000 tonnes of imported frozen peas and beans came into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I know that you will be surprised to learn that every month Australia imports $150m worth of foodstuffs. That is $2 billion a year. It is 10 per cent of our trading deficit, and it is food that Australia can produce. This bill is made up not of caviar and champagne but of everyday foods that are appearing on the supermarket shelves. One has to question the community responsibility of some of our chain grocery stores and their attitudes in this matter. The numbers are here for all Australians to look at. The figures for the month of July were $1.4m worth of meat products, $30.3m worth of fruit and vegetables, $31.65m worth of fish products, $9.23m worth of cereals, and $29.26m worth of coffee, tea and spices-a whopping bill of imports worth millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the dried fruit industry, as we are discussing the Dried Fruit Levy Amendment Bill. Let us take currants, for example. In the growing year ending--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk to the Minister about this privately. I have some problems with his Department, but I will discuss that later with him. In February of 1989, 566 tonnes of currants were imported into Australia. The majority of these came from Greece. At the end of the 1990 growing year, the figure has almost doubled to 957 tonnes; 827 tonnes also came from Greece. The amount is almost 25 per cent of the Australian market for currants, and most of those imports attract an export subsidy of $1,300 a tonne. How can our farmers compete against that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us take sultanas. In the last growing year, 4,968 tonnes of sultanas were imported into Australia and 1,846 tonnes of apricots also were imported. Most of these came from Turkey, where rural interest rates are subsidised down to 5 per cent, and they are available to the farming community. Our farmers have to face rates of around 22 per cent, and they are losing their farms. They are not only losing their product onto the shelves, they are now losing their farms. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian farmers are losing markets progressively to imported foods which are sent to Australia with the added backing of export subsidies, or which are just plain dumped. Not only do schemes like this cost government a lot of money, but also they mean that a product is more expensive to buy in the country of origin than it is on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Japanese Government spent over $6 billion subsidising its domestic rice market. A kilo of rice bought in Japan costs six times the world market price. The cost of the United States farm Bill ranks in billions of dollars. The total direct payment to wheat growers reached a high of $3.86 billion in 1986 and payments to corn growers in 1987 were $7.74 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the negotiations to reduce agricultural subsidies and protection for farm products are going on. The three largest trading nations in the world are blissfully continuing their supportive practices and have not made much noise in the way of concessions. The negotiations are due to be completed in December, and one of the negotiation groups is discussing agriculture at the GATT Conference. There is no set agenda, however, and countries have made submissions on the amount they are willing to give. </PARA>
<PARA> There are few people who would argue that free trade is the ultimate goal where goods are exchanged openly and fairly. If this were to occur, every Australian farmer would be about 300 per cent better off. There would be no limit to the demand for Australian products. But there is no gain in being the only country which makes these moves. The world has to move towards free trade-we all agree with that. The Democrats are supporting that too. We have to move with a united conviction to that goal, but Australia is out in front with a banner and drum and no-one else is joining the parade. The rates of assistance in Japan are estimated to have decreased from a staggering 76 per cent in 1986 to a current level of 72 per cent, a drop of 4 per cent. The Japanese have really taken a stick to their protection!</PARA>
<PARA> The European Community's assistance rate is estimated to be 38 per cent-a reduction from 48 per cent in 1989. America's rate is 27 per cent. It has reduced it from 40 per cent in 1987. The three major trading blocs are setting the standard of rates of assistance with the average rate worldwide of 39 per cent. Australia has done the right thing. We have shown our credentials, and we have made a real commitment to free trade with a rate of assistance to agriculture measured at 10 per cent in 1989. I just want to mention some of the things that we have done to reduce our rates of assistance. Market price support for dairy produce as well as domestic pricing for wheat and sugar have been removed. I did not necessarily agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the support of the Australian Democrats, we were able to secure for the sugar industry some sort of protection. Price underwriting for wheat has been replaced by a government guarantee. Tariffs for dried fruit, tobacco and citrus juices have been reduced. The import embargo on sugar has been replaced by a specific declining tariff. In New South Wales, the main egg producers have abolished all production pricing and monopoly powers of the Egg Corporation. All of these measures will considerably reduce the level of assistance in Australia, which currently has the second lowest level in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development range of countries. New Zealand has the lowest level with 5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we have only a number of small countries cutting back their tariff levels, the big producers are continuing their subsidies and support programs and are gaining a particularly unfair advantage. A glut in wheat production in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres together with the impact of the United States (US) subsidies has prompted a drop in wheat prices to a 40-year low. US prices for export wheat are expected to average $124 a tonne in 1990-91. Farmers are receiving $30 a tonne from the Government of the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has our wheat industry been hit; we are also exposing our industries to an increased disease risk. The acceptable risk policy which has been adopted by the Government is inevitably exposing our farmers to trouble. The Federal Government is playing Russian roulette with the agricultural industries in Australia. Every time we raise the subject of disease, Senator Cook jumps up and down and accuses the Opposition of trying to use quarantine as a trade barrier. I do not think he knows the first thing about rural industry. That is not what we are on about. The Minister simply does not understand what the effect will be of diseases such as transmittable gastroenteritis on the pork industry, black sigatoka and moko disease on our banana industry, fire-blight on the apple industry, or even the threat of disease on our valuable disease-free status in world agricultural trade. People buy from us because they know they are going to get a disease-free product. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has made a decision to lift a longstanding embargo on fresh, chilled and frozen pork from Canada. There are 22 subsidies going to the Canadian pork producers. There is an 8c a kilogram countervailing duty levied by the American Government, but we have let the pork in here for free despite the risk that it can carry transmittable gastroenteritis, commonly known as TGE. The majority of State government veterinary officials and Department of Primary Industries and Energy officers strongly recommended against the importation of fresh pig meat, yet Senator Cook, with his gung ho attitude, said that it was going to be an acceptable risk. It is not his risk; he is not carrying the risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem we have is that of countries classified as developing. If that is the case, they are automatically given a 5 per cent reduction of tariff for all imports coming into Australian markets. One hundred countries are on the list, including the Bahamas, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Saudi Arabia-the richest country in the world; no, it is the second richest. Brunei is the richest, and it gets subsidies too. Our farmers are granting cheap entry into our domestic market to the richest man in the world, the Sultan of Brunei. America and New Zealand both cut off the developing country tariff preference once a product from a developing country has captured 20 per cent of the market, but developing countries can take 100 per cent of the market in Australia. They are doing that or are going to do it in some of our industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Our domestic horticultural industries are on the verge of bankruptcy now, and they will not be sustainable. Australian rural production in 1989-90 was $23.87 billion with the rural sector contributing some $15 billion to our exports. While our farmers are contributing this much to our economy and working hard to adjust the positive side of our balance of trade, they are paying an average of $6,000 per year for tariffs on farm inputs. I want to say that everyone wants free trade. It is desirable. It is important for our rural industries and for our exporters. Yet what price are we going to pay for this goal? We have already played all our bargaining chips. We have shown our hand and reduced our tariffs below the target level before the negotiations have been concluded. It is not a very good poker player that exposes his hand without getting a guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> While this attitude may let some of our officials have a warm inner glow, it is not doing a lot for Australia's rural industry. Free trade is fine. We all support it. Tariff reduction is fine. But the continued viability of our industries is also essential, and the two different objectives must both be achieved. We have already made our commitment and, by the way, so has New Zealand. Its economy is in a worse state than ours. </PARA>

We have to travel the road because smaller underdeveloped countries are going to be able to sustain an agrarian economy to give their people some hope for the future and some goal to achieve. They are not going to get into any high technology.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1990, which seeks to increase the levy on dried fruits from $5 to a maximum of $10 per tonne. I want to pick up some of the remarks made by Senator Boswell and others because it is very concerning to hear the tortuous and illogical path woven by members both of the Government and of the Opposition in an attempt to, in some sense, reconcile the idea of an ideological commitment to free trade and market forces on the one hand and protection of rural industries on the other hand. It is an ideological position which is not reconcilable, and I think Senator Boswell's speech a moment ago indicates just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather, the position that we should be taking is one in which we seek to serve the interests of Australians-we are, after all, the Federal Parliament of Australia-and also seek to provide a level of independence and self-sufficiency in each country, which is not necessarily served by the objects of free trade, however defined. Senator Boswell did not define what he meant by free trade, but I want to get into that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> What is usually meant by `free trade'-we have heard this both explicitly and implicitly from members of the Government and members of the Opposition-is the comparison of the end price, the retail price of goods. If the price is higher in one country than another, then the country which has the lower price simply takes a larger slice of the market in a market situation. In the case of the Australian fruit industry, which is what we are discussing here, as Senator Boswell has pointed out, we have seen the importation of such things as dried apricots from Turkey and orange juice concentrate from several South American countries at prices well below the price at which the Australian producer evidently can produce. Members of the Opposition and members of the Government have criticised Australian producers as being inefficient, as judged by that retail price. </PARA>
<PARA> Many legitimate costs go into production in various countries. One cost, which we are dealing with in this Bill, is a levy to do certain things in relation to dried fruits. Other costs are legitimately and rightfully borne in the production of rural products in this country. We have certain requirements as to wages and working conditions. Do members of the Opposition want Australian workers to work for $2 a day, as happens in many competitor countries, which go into the cost structure of the products which they produce?</PARA>
<PARA> Turkey, which produces dried apricots, has the worst record in the world of mine disasters. Several months ago some hundreds of people were killed in a mine disaster. The conditions which we rightly impose on Australian miners translate through into the cost of electric power, part of which is used by the rural industry and is therefore partly reflected in the price of things such as dried fruits. Do we want to adopt the very low standards of industrial health of Turkey simply to compete? Of course we do not. </PARA>
<PARA> We rightly impose conditions in relation to environmental standards. We do not allow the application of certain pesticides and herbicides in this country. We have stringent controls over the registration and regulation of those pesticides, all of which translate into the costs which are borne-and rightly borne-by the rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The glib words `free trade' need to be heavily qualified. I use this opportunity to ask members of the Government and the Opposition when they talk about free trade to think more in terms of the legitimate costs which go into production in each country and, in striking tariffs, not merely to arbitrarily reduce tariffs-say, to strike them at 40 per cent and reduce them to 25 per cent, 15 per cent and then zero per cent. If we are serious about a level playing field and we are competing equitably with other countries, then surely we need that tariff protection which exactly and correctly represents the costs legitimately put on to Australian producers which are not borne in other countries. That may well mean striking a tariff of 16.25 per cent, or some arbitrary and inexact figure such as that which represents the costs which are legitimately borne by Australian producers. Under those circumstances we have no doubt-I share this view with Senator Boswell -that Australian producers, primary producers, are more than adequately able to compete on world markets. We should certainly not be merely arbitrarily reducing tariffs, assuming that the product price, the retail price, is a fair representation of the efficiency of production and the adequacy of the protection of worker health, environmental health and the other factors which go into that production. </PARA>
<PARA> This dried fruits levy is just one of the costs which are borne in Australia and it should be reflected in a tariff which protects the Australian producer against imports. If we were to modify our attitudes in relation to the term `free trade' to that extent, then we might agree that we could all compete on a level playing field and, indeed, Australian primary producers would be much better off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1990, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support my Senate leader, Senator Boswell, in the comments he has made in respect of this particular Bill and the dried fruit industry and also in respect of the plight of primary producers throughout this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very clear that Australian primary producers are paying the cost of Australia's high moral position when it comes to international trade.When we look around the world we see the level of subsidy that primary producers in other countries are receiving. As Senator Boswell has said, we have seen reductions in the level of subsidy for Japanese primary producers over the last couple of years from 76 per cent to 72 per cent, while at the same time the average level of government input to farm income in this country is one per cent. For those who ask what that one per cent is, it is the one per cent that the Government pays to people on the rural adjustment scheme who are thinking of leaving the farm. It is not a subsidy or a support for farmers at all; all it is is a rather ironical and bitter nail in the coffin. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian primary producers-and 170,000 families across this country live and work on farms-are facing bankruptcy at record rates, yet the Government does nothing about it. The representative of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in the Senate, Senator Cook, who would not know a wheat sack from a wether, seems to believe that every time we on this side raise the problems associated with trade in primary production, every time we raise the issue of proper quarantine, and every time we raise the issue of barriers to protect Australian primary producers from disease being imported from overseas, for some reason we are trying to cosset Australian farmers. The fact is that Australia is an island and it has a natural advantage in being shielded from diseases that are rampant overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take, for example, the banana industry, which is worth over $100m to this country every year. The banana growers in north Queensland have put up with low prices and with the effects of cyclones for the last couple of years and have not been complaining. They are very concerned at the moment that their industry will be undermined by imports from Equador and elsewhere-countries where the diseases of black sigatoka and moko are rampant. If Senator Cook and this Government believe that these are not real concerns of Australian banana growers, then they are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of the Government, let me outline the consequences of moko being introduced into this country. Moko is not a disease like black sigatoka which affects the leaf, nor is it a disease like panama which will affect the fruit: moko is a disease that gets into the soil. Once this disease is in the soil, there is no known way of eradicating it. That means that if we allow these cheap banana imports to come in from Ecuador-bananas that have no proper testing and no proper export control-then we run the very real risk of introducing moko into the soil in this country and devastating the banana growing areas of Australia for 10, 20 or 30 years to come. I ask, and the banana growers of north Queensland ask: Is this a reasonable risk for us to be taking? The answer, quite clearly, has to be no. </PARA>
<PARA> I disagree with Senator Coulter in one respect: I do not believe that proper protection of primary industry is incompatible with free trade. We in the National Party of Australia accept and believe that free trade is essential for the future of this world as we go into the next century, but we believe that it is also important to have fair trade and safe trade. What this Government does not offer us is safe trade in agricultural products, nor does it offer us fair trade. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have already seen, the level of subsidy to overseas primary producers-especially in the United States of America and the European Community (EC)-is wholly unacceptable compared with what Australian primary producers have to put up with. It is not just the level of subsidy about which we have grave concerns; it is also the level of costs, because Australian primary producers face a much higher borrowing cost. For example, while in this country it costs 18 to 20 per cent to run an overdraft account, a primary producer in Europe-in the EC-can run an overdraft account at 10 per cent. Of course, this has dire implications for all of those Australian primary industries that are on the ropes, because it is just another nail in the coffin of Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian primary producers are the most cost efficient primary producers in the world. It is said of the Ukraine that it is the bread basket of Europe. Here in Australia we have the potential to supply large portions of the world with all the wheat, wool, peanuts, citrus fruits and dried fruits that it needs, yet Australian primary producers are having grave difficulties surviving because, at a time when things are toughest, the Government allows cheap imports to flood Australian markets. At a time when peanuts are ploughed back into the fields or allowed to rot in Kingaroy because farmers cannot get a market, we find cheap imported peanuts from China, the United States and Israel being allowed to flood this market and sit on the shelves under the label- and I find it rather ironic-`home brand' peanut paste, when, of course, the last thing they are is from home. This is the legacy for which this Government will be condemned by primary producers across this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn, in particular, to the problem of the dried fruits industry. I received in my Cairns office a representation from some manufacturers of dehydrated and frozen tropical fruits-people who trade under the name of Sunmade. Their dilemma is this: for four years they have held an export licence and have been trying very hard to break into the export market. Finally, after four years of unrelenting effort they have succeeded in getting a small export contract to Japan on the promise that, if the goods are exported at a satisfactory price and in satisfactory condition-that is, satisfactory to the Japanese market-more orders will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> One can imagine that, after four years of effort, the people at Sunmade were ecstatic-until they found out on 21 September that there is a new range of inspection charges that will hit them called the fee-for-service, or FFS, charging system. The consequence is that there is a processing establishment charge of $530 per establishment; a charge of $59 per half hour or part thereof for inspection of the product in the field; plus an additional $5 per quarter hour or part thereof for all the paperwork that the officials have to do when they get back to the office. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs van Slooten, who is one of the proprietors of Sunmade, advises that the quarantine inspection branch has told her that she should budget for a minimum inspection charge, for this very small order, of $1,000. That inspection charge will be equal to the profit that she is going to make on the whole deal. Her comment to me was, `Why should I bother trying to earn export dollars for this country; why should I bother spending years and years and years trying to get our produce overseas into new markets to pioneer the way, when, just at the point that I am so close to tapping into the market, the Government hits me across the face with new charges?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs van Slooten was referring to the charge that was introduced on 21 September. In the long advice that was provided to her, she was told the charges were going to increase again on 1 January next year to bring them into line with what the Government believes is a reasonable amount to charge. The point that I make is that it is wholly unreasonable for the Government to mouth off at one time about how it believes it is important to have an export culture, and how it believes it is concerned with the level of export dollars earned-especially by primary producers-and, at another time, to impose arbitrary charges that are going to cripple many small Australian primary producer exporters. It is wholly inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the level of subsidies that farmers get overseas-levels of subsidies between 40 per cent and sometimes 60 per cent in the European Community and high levels of subsidies in the United States-I believe that this Government's penny-pinching, niggardly attitude towards primary producers shows that it has absolutely no interest at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I was surprised to read last week, for example, that Mr Brian Courtice, the chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force-the man who is charged with the obligation of advising the Prime Minister on the plight of rural Australia-had the audacity to say in the Australian Rural Times that he did not believe rural Australia was in crisis. He should tell that to the peanut farmers in Kingaroy, the cattlemen around Aramac or the woolgrowers around Roma and ask them what they say. They would say, I am sure, that Mr Courtice does not know what he is talking about, that this Government is badly advised and that it is selling the export capacity of this country short. That is the sad truth of this Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said that when they bury a farmer in the United States they bury him only two feet down. The question is: Why do they bury him only two feet down? The answer is: So that even after he has died he can still hold his hand out. Australian primary producers do not ask for anything special. All they ask for is a fair go. All they ask is for a government to have a responsible attitude towards exchange rates and interest rates, and that is not too much to ask, because that is why people put governments in. All they ask is that when they finally come to win an export contract after four years of endeavour, they should not be slapped across the face by governments and bureaucrats who are just interested in raising a few extra dollars in charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The final irony of this very sad case of Sunmade dried fruits is this: Mrs van Slooten, the proprietor of Sunmade dried fruits, was in fact the woman who travelled to Canberra earlier this year to lecture departmental officials from the quarantine inspection branch on how to inspect dried tropical fruits. Instead of being congratulated on her effort and her contribution to the Australian export industry, what happens? The Government raises the inspection charges, so much so that this will be the one and only export from Sunmade dried fruits to Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only wonder how many other small primary producers are in the same dilemma; how many other primary producers who currently hold an export licence, in the hope of one day breaking into the export market, will just cancel their licence altogether? That is my very real concern, and with it go the hopes and dreams of many of those 170,000 farm families across this country. For those reasons I believe that this Government stands condemned for neglect, a failure to understand, and a failure to care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on this most important Bill, the Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1990. Honourable senators will know that this method of ensuring that there is a sufficient flow of funds for research into our rural industries is one that has been well tested in the Australian community. What the Parliament is doing on this occasion is agreeing to a request from the dried fruits industry, together with the Dried Fruits Research Council, that the maximum rate of levy for dried vine fruit be increased from $5 to $10 per tonne. The Commonwealth Government will then enter into dollar for dollar matching of that levying which is undertaken by the industry. Thus it is that the rural industries in Australia play a very crucial role in the progress of the better production of their various products, which are then able to be marketed with that enhanced quality which comes from the research which is undertaken to such good effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1990. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill, although I will be moving, on behalf of the Opposition, a second reading amendment later. The Bill amends the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961 to convert the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories-more commonly known as CSL-to a public company which is to be called Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd. The Bill will also remove a variety of statutory controls which inhibit CSL's commercial operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is said by the Government to be a major step in implementing the reform package for CSL which the Government announced on 16 August 1989 and which is part of the Government's comprehensive program, so it says, to improve the performance of government business enterprises. I might interpose in that context-I will come back to it later-that with very rare exceptions the best way of improving the performance of government business enterprises is to stop having those enterprises owned by government and, rather, let them be owned by the private sector in the way that most productive activity in Australia is conducted. That is an overriding consideration on the part of the Opposition and it is an essential part of Opposition policy. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL has a long history of achievements in serving the Australian community. In many ways it is a fine organisation. I know that there are differing views on the directions in which it has headed over the years, but it was established in 1916 as an arm of the quarantine service so that Australia could be self-sufficient in vaccines and sera in times of war and peace. Of course, 1916 was right in the middle of the First World War. In 1923, CSL was one of the four laboratories world-wide to produce insulin and, in 1944, CSL enabled Australia to be the first country to supply penicillin to its civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1952 CSL commenced the fractionation of serum provided by voluntary blood donors and collected by the Red Cross into life-saving blood products, a function which it continues to perform today. CSL has developed antisera and antivenoms against specific Australian pests and diseases, the most recent being the funnel-web spider antivenom in 1988. CSL is the only manufacturer of human vaccines in Australia and it is one of only two producers of biological veterinary products. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL became a statutory authority in 1961. At that time its charter focused on the performance of national interest functions, in particular the manufacture of prescribed biological pharmaceutical products and serum fractionation. Provision was also made at that time for limited commercial operations, using any excess manufacturing capability. At that stage, of course, it was just bringing the excess manufacturing capability into commercial operation rather than giving any specific priority to commercial operations per se. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) said in his second reading speech, with support from successive Ministers of both major parties and successive governments, CSL has, since then, evolved into primarily a commercial organisation. Significant changes to the CSL Act by both the Fraser Government and the Hawke Government between 1980 and 1985 removed the restriction limiting CSL to manufacturing solely biological products and placed CSL's operations on a commercial profit-making basis. At the same time, CSL continued to perform some national interest activities for the Commonwealth under a reimbursement arrangement. Those changes to the Act also allowed the establishment of subsidiaries, joint ventures and partnerships. Nowadays, CSL markets a wide range of prescribed human pharmaceuticals and veterinary products both in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL is a very large operation. In fact, it is based, I am pleased to say, within a quarter of a kilometre of where I live in Melbourne. CSL currently employs over 1,200 staff and it has over 2,000 product lines. As such, it is the largest pharmaceutical company in Australia and it represents a unique pharmaceutical manufacturing capability. Most of those points were made by the Minister in his second reading speech. They are points with which I agree. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL has had some notable successes in recent times. It has won several export awards. Indeed, the future of CSL and the future of most manufacturing companies in Australia realistically must lie very importantly not only in the development of new products but also in looking outwards to new markets overseas as well as in Australia. In my view and in the Opposition's view that is one of the important reasons for the need to make CSL as commercialised, efficient and competitive as possible. That will happen only if the company is allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise that can respond quickly in the marketplace and is free from day to day regulatory controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees the reform package-to use its term-included in this Bill as a further significant step in the continued development of CSL. The Government says that the objective is to establish CSL as an efficient and commercially focused organisation able to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the domestic and international marketplaces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition agrees very strongly with the objectives underlying this move to establish CSL as a company. What we are very disappointed about though is that this Bill represents only a halfway house. If the Government were really serious about giving CSL the resources and the wherewithal to develop and commercialise itself and become as profitable, efficient and competitive as possible in a highly competitive industry which operates in a highly competitive international environment, in our view it would not be adopting this halfway house proposal of turning the organisation into a company which still remains 100 per cent publicly owned. Rather, it would privatise the company immediately and expose it to competition and efficiency which is provided by private sector ownership. Experience has shown time and again this to be the only way in which most government business enterprises will have the wherewithal to find the capital, the expertise and all the other facilities that are needed for a company to operate successfully in today's world. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Government saw the light in that respect with Australian Airlines Ltd at its recent special conference in Sydney. It was the only thing it did see the light on. It went a partial privatisation route with Qantas Airways Ltd by agreeing to a 49 per cent private stakeholding. </PARA>

That decision had nothing to do with a genuine desire by the Government to make Qantas an even more efficient and competitive operation. Of course-and I will come back to this if time permits-the so-called special conference in Sydney not only failed to move far enough--</PARA></TALK.START>

It not only failed to move far enough in relation to Qantas but it also failed abjectly in its attempt to bring greater competition in the private marketplace into the telecommunications industry when it voted to set up a 100 per cent mega-organisation-megacom; monstercom -by merging Telecom and OTC Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition regrets that the Government has refused to take the necessary step that would be required to put CSL onto the basis that it, and certainly the Opposition, believes is required. Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add `but the Senate is of the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Commonwealth Serum Laboratories should be fully privatised immediately; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) there should be a full and complete divestment of all the Commonwealth interest and control in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories rather than the half way measures proposed by this bill.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the Government is adopting only halfway measures and taking a halfway house approach to CSL at this stage will cause CSL some considerable difficulties. For example, as I understand it, CSL will still be limited in its capacity to have access to capital funds by the Government limit on global borrowing requirements determined under the Premiers Conference Loan Council requirements. That is a very significant inhibition on the ability of the organisation to find the necessary capital and funds for its development, particularly for the development of new products and research into new markets and the like which is so essential in this rapidly changing world of pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Government is going only halfway, turning the organisation into a publicly owned company rather than a privately owned company, will not solve some of the essential problems of capital scarcity that CSL has. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other concerns which the Government has produced with this Bill and of which the Opposition is critical. For a start, the Bill has taken a long time coming into the Parliament. The announcement of these measures was made, as I said earlier, on 16 August 1989, but it took one whole year for the Bill to actually arrive in the Parliament. That, I must say, is indicative of the difficulty the Government seems to have in managing its affairs competently and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> This delay between the announcement of the decision initially and the introduction of the enabling legislation is typical of the delays that have been occurring in a whole host of areas. It is very unsettling, it is very debilitating, particularly for the organisations concern, because more often than not the legislation when it does see the light of day in Parliament is different in some respects, often very significant respects, from the details of the announcement initially made. So the Government delay in producing this Bill is a matter for concern, but it is, as I say, part of a general process of major difficulty which the Government seems to have in getting its act together in terms of the basics of management of government and of its affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> These delays cause great difficulties for business enterprises because they feel uncertain about their future. If one were one of the 1,200 employees of CSL and waited for 12 months between the time of an announcement that the organisation was to be converted into a company and the time of actually seeing the details of what was involved, one would know that that is not conducive to good morale, and not therefore conducive to effective personnel management or to the operation of the enterprise itself. As well, of course, those delays make it more difficult to meet some of the commercial activities which the organisation is supposed to be carrying out. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me crazy for an expert charged with running a commercial enterprise to have to fix up a strategic corporate plan, as was the case in this instance, and then to have to come to Canberra to seek approval from the Minister. If one is really serious about letting CSL go the way that the marketplace and other demands require, one cannot subject the development of strategic corporate plans to the dictates and whims of Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition amendment is designed to obviate these problems. It is designed to enable the organisation to immediately be floated or sold, whichever way would be dictated by commercial prudence and normal practices, to the public so that the people of Australia can become shareholders in this important organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister in summing up this debate will respond to my request for information and comment as to why the Government will not take the final step and let CSL enter the marketplace-let the shares that are being held by the Government be offered in part to staff, if they wish to take them up, which is an essential part of a privatisation exercise, and let the shares in what is demonstrably a successful and important government business enterprise go to the wider community. What are the reasons for the Government failing at this stage to take that important step, and why does the Government want to hold on to its ownership of CSL? I think that they are important questions and I hope that the Minister in responding to this debate will address them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not come anywhere near the goals of privatisation. The Government says that it wants to encourage value-added manufacturing within Australia without the requirement for underpinning by the Commonwealth, yet underpinning is precisely what will occur with this Bill. If the Government cannot make a decision about CSL-important though it is, it is one of the smaller government business enterprises-how will it ever be able to make a decision about the more vital areas that require privatisation among the realm of government business enterprises?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer, sadly, is that the Government will not be able to take those decisions. The Government has shown that in many respects it is the total captive of a very conservative movement in Australia in relation to the release from ownership by the public sector, namely, the trade union movement. That was the whole basis for the Government tearing itself to bits over the really minor matter, when it came to the question of privatisation and competition, of telecommunications. It could hardly get to first base in taking sensible, rational decisions there because the trade union movement and other vested interests within the Labor family prevented it from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we are saddled with a situation where in the case of telecommunications we now have no hope in the long foreseeable future of getting the competition, the increased efficiency and private sector involvement in telecommunications that are so essential. Regrettably, the same will be the case with most other government business enterprises. One can see it happening a mile off. That is regrettable because it means that this Government, because it is the captive of vested interests that are absolutely opposed to the private sector and to private enterprise for a whole host of ideological and other reasons, is therefore preventing Australia using its resources in the most efficient way possible. </PARA>
<PARA> We face a situation in Australia today where the economic problems confronting us are the most serious certainly since the end of the Second World War, and quite arguably the most serious since the great Depressions of the early 1930s and the 1890s. The fundamental difference though between the problems that confront us today and the problems that faced us on those two previous deep recession occasions was that previously the problems were imposed upon us by international collapse. Today the problems that we have in this nation are totally determined by the problems occasioned by the policies of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook says mockingly that there are no international determinations of our problems. That is very largely right, with the exception of parts of the rural sector in recent times. But those opposite have been in government during 7 1/2 years of unprecedented growth in world trade and the Western world economies and the developing world economies. The Government has not faced any problems imposed from outside in the whole period it has been in government. Despite that, it has managed this country into the greatest set of economic problems that we have had in at least half a century. That is a pretty difficult thing to do. This Government has done it very successfully, but the cost to the nation, the cost to future generations of Australians, is overwhelming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the Government that, unless it changes its whole approach to the operation of business undertakings now publicly owned, and unless it is prepared to let go the apron strings and allow those businesses to have private ownership, private capital involvement and the ability to tap the world market free of constraints of governments, then the problems that are presently compounding in this nation will get progressively worse. Of all the differences between the Government and the Opposition in terms of their approaches to the future of this nation, I can think of no starker contrast between the two major parties than in their approach to the question of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has a full-blooded and publicly announced program of privatisation. We have that because it is essential if we are to increase competition; it will lead to services for consumers which are cheaper, more efficient and provide a freedom of choice; and it is a program of management and use of resources in Australia which will lead to a dynamic, progressive, growing economy rather than the stultified economy that the public ownership of so many of our resources is at least in part contributing to. </PARA>
<PARA> Our privatisation program will increase efficiency and competition wherever possible, and that will be on most occasions. We will give employees the opportunity to buy shares on a preferential basis-something that is totally precluded in this Bill. It is not permitted because, of course, there is going to be no divestment of shares to other than government ownership. We believe that employee share ownership provides a common interest in an enterprise for employees and employers, and an incentive to improve productivity. I can only express again the concern of the Opposition at the inability of the Government-for whatever reason but it is essentially due to it being captive to vested interests-to see the need for a full privatisation program and to act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I return to my earlier comment that the Opposition does not oppose this Bill to establish the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories as a company. It is a worthwhile development. The point that we would make is that it is only a halfway house development and, whilst not opposing the Bill, we will be moving an amendment-as I have already intimated and as has been circulated in the chamber-to call on the Government fully and immediately to privatise CSL. </PARA>

Speaking as I am immediately after Senator Short, I cannot fail but remark on how incredibly blind members of the Opposition are when on the one hand they totally reject the evidence right before them and argue for privatisation, competition and efficiency and, on the other hand, argue that everything the Government owns is uncompetitive, is inefficient and does not produce those things which are in the best interests of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have before us an organisation which was started in 1916 and which has been in total government ownership for 74 years. It has served this country extremely well and, indeed, in 1988-89 it made a profit of $11.8m. It paid, as far as my estimates show, $6 2/3m to government by way of tax and a 40 per cent dividend, yet Senator Short says that that organisation is inefficient and needs to be privatised. The other week the Bond organisation lost $4,000m. That is a totally private organisation which is supremely efficient at one thing-at losing money which has been contributed by Australians, which adds very considerably to Australia's foreign debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for the example. Elders IXL has also lost thousands of millions of dollars. There is no necessary nexus whatsoever between whether an organisation is government or privately owned and between efficiency and serving the public interest. There are government-owned organisations, such as CSL, which have functioned very well for 74 years, have been efficient and have returned a profit, and there are, of course, government organisations that have not been efficient. But equally there have been private organisations which have been grossly inefficient and have certainly not served the best interests of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is nothing magical whatsoever about privatisation, and we would certainly express great fear that the Government has gone part of the way towards privatisation. My colleague Senator Spindler will be moving an amendment to this Bill which will seek to prevent that further stage of development from corporatisation to privatisation for precisely the reverse reasons which Senator Short elaborated on in his speech. We would strongly urge the Government to support the amendment which Senator Spindler will be moving, because Senator Short has put on notice the fact that, if the coalition should form the next government, one of the first things it will do, having got this far with the privatisation of CSL, is move to privatise CSL fully. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler's amendment, if put in place, will make it mandatory that that next step of selling shares to non-government people or organisations must come back into this Parliament and be made on a decision of the Parliament, not merely by the government of the day. Unless the Government has on a secret agenda the privatisation of CSL-and that may well be on its agenda- we would strongly urge it to support Senator Spindler's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me elaborate further on that point. Senator Short and many people in the coalition when speaking on the privatisation of other organisations have referred to the people of Australia owning the companies that are privatised. Surely the best way that every person in Australia can own an organisation, can own the operation of that organisation, and can have some say in the output-the sorts of products which are made and the sorts of end uses to which those products are put-is through government ownership. Then every Australian will have some share in the ownership of that property. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of fact that only 7 per cent to 10 per cent of Australians ever own shares; 90 per cent to 93 per cent of Australians never own a share during their lifetime. I guess it is a mark of the failure of this Government to increase equity in this country that it is now in a position of having to privatise those things which all Australians own-in other words, to sell them off to no more, and certainly in many cases considerably less, than 7 per cent to 10 per cent of the Australian public. In other words, from 7 per cent to 10 per cent of the Australian public evidently now have the wealth accumulated under this Labor Government to buy that which Australians as a whole can no longer afford to own. That process, quite clearly, would be exacerbated were we to have a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other two points I wish to make-I do not wish to speak at length on this Bill-is that health is one of those areas which does not fit well with privatisation, with competition and with being driven by the profit motive. CSL is an organisation par excellence which has developed unusual products, products which might only be used to treat a small number of patients but whose conditions if left untreated would prove fatal. For example, a small number of people in Australia are bitten and envenomed by various dangerous creatures in this country. Therefore, a small number of people benefit very considerably from the development of antivenenes by CSL. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of development which is not likely to be undertaken by a company which is profit driven. A company that is profit driven is far more interested in manufacturing a product used by a large number of people and by which it can maximise its profit. It is not particularly interested in manufacturing something which may well be lifesaving but will be used by only a small number of people and from which there is very little profit. CSL has been a world leader in developing some of those antivenenes. Being an Australian company, it has developed antivenenes against many of the spiders, snakes and other creatures which we have in this country. The development of those antivenenes is not something that is likely to be undertaken by companies overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I would like to make briefly is that it is vitally necessary that Australia maintain a considerable public interest in the pharmaceutical industry. If this organisation is to be privatised -clearly we have heard from the Opposition that that is its direction if it forms a government-the next step will be rationalisation of the industry and we will see certain products manufactured in Australia and others going off-shore and manufactured elsewhere. Before too long we could well find that the substantially foreign ownership of CSL would come to dominate even more the Australian pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and we would finish up with a very small indigenous pharmaceutical industry. We would not only lose those very important products to which I have already referred but we would also lose a handle on the cost structures which operate in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an industry where, with certain products, vast profits can be made. Just as the sale of the Commonwealth Oil Refinery (COR), for instance, by the Menzies Government in the 1950s denied successive Australian governments a handle on the cost structures in the oil industry and have left us now in a situation in which we are totally dependent upon whatever figures the industry wants to provide to government, the loss of a handle on the pharmaceutical industry through CSL would produce a similar condition in which we would be left entirely at the mercy of the very large multinational pharmaceutical companies which operate throughout the world and which could provide any figures they wanted on the cost of production, research and so on. We would have no indication whatsoever from our own operations under the control of our own government as to the exact costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply untrue, given the figures before us on the profitability of CSL, that CSL is not capable of providing the funds necessary for research and development. As I have already indicated, in 1988-89 CSL made a $11.5m profit-a 9 per cent profit on sales. That compares very well with most privately run companies in this country. A 9 per cent profit on sales is very good. CSL was able to pay a 40 per cent dividend after tax to the Government. The Government's revenue increased by $6.67m in one year as a consequence of CSL's operation. Given that we are talking about the health area, given that we are talking about an industry that should be run for the benefit of Australians and not just as a profit making venture, it would seem to me that within that scale of profit on its turnover, there is plenty of money for the research and development which CSL should be carrying out. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise: we are not opposing this Bill but we express grave concern that, as Senator Short has correctly identified, it moves part of the way towards privatisation. We are concerned that, given that and given the clear statement from the Opposition, should the Opposition form the next government, CSL will be privatised. The consequences of that we believe will be damaging to the health of Australia because those very small scale and unusual but sometimes lifesaving products will no longer be manufactured, as they will no longer be profitable, and because we will be likely to lose the control of a sufficient part of the pharmaceutical industry, with the result that we will not be able to understand the detailed financial operations of the industry and, therefore, keep some sort of necessary handle on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Control would also pass into the hands of a minority of Australians. We believe that also is not in the interests of Australians. We strongly urge the Government-we know the Opposition will not do this-to support the amendment which will be put by Senator Spindler. The amendment will require that, should privatisation be considered by the Government, that decision will necessarily come back before this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always with a sense of unreality that one follows the Australian Democrats in debates such as this. The objection to the Opposition's plans to privatise the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) is, in Senator Coulter's mind, based on the view that there is no such thing as a successful Australian public company. We did not hear either the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) or Senator Coulter mention one company that has any kind of successful record. The only examples of Australian corporate activity that the honourable senator could think of in this context were those of Mr Bond.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Mr Elliott. I am intrigued at the quality of intellectual activity that goes on in that corner when a debate on a serious matter such as this rests on such a fragile base. The reality is that the turnover of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories last year-I direct Senator Coulter's attention to this-was about $130m, of which 96 per cent was in commercial ventures and 4 per cent related to its, if you like, public sector responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We did not hear anything of that from Senator Coulter because that is an intrusive fact that does not fit in with his philosophical prejudices. The fact is that this is a commercial body; it behaves in a commercial way. The only effective constraint upon CSL acting even more commercially and more successfully is its involvement with the Government. Senator Coulter did not feel like reading the annual report or giving honourable senators the benefit of his knowledge and advice on it. The latest annual report-and this is a fairly late annual report; I will deal with that matter shortly-says this:</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the Government decision on the future of CSL was still awaited at year end . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the annual report for the year to June 1989. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The task of retaining experienced managers and recruiting new ones remains an acute problem under conditions of salary restraint and uncertainty over the future. Meanwhile, change in the industry continues apace. </PARA>
<PARA>The constraints imposed on this organisation by being a governmental one, subject to the constraints involved within the public sector, are such that they remain an acute problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has no solutions to these problems. He simply says that we cannot possibly privatise CSL because it will inevitably, invariably, and without exception, become a Bond-type failure. That sort of ludicrous remark really should be dismissed out of hand. The fact is that there are some clear benefits that will emerge from privatising this body. Unfortunately, the Government is going only part of the way by corporatising it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with a couple of matters of how unfortunate this half-way house approach really is. One of the major things the Bill does is to remove this body from the scrutiny that, frankly, all bodies should be subject to-the scrutiny of its shareholders. At the moment the shareholders of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories are the people of Australia through this Parliament. Honourable senators have the opportunity at Senate Estimates committee hearings to inquire of this organisation, through the people who run it, how it is accounting to us for its management. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of what will happen when this legislation is passed-we will be supporting it-is that by getting into this half-way house we will no longer have effective access to the management of this body, to ask it the sort of questions that any management deserves to be asked. There is not going to be an annual general meeting of this corporatised body, as there would if it were privatised, which the shareholders can attend. It is going to report to the Minister, but let us see how effectively this body has been reporting to the Minister so far. While I strongly commend the activities of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in its scientific area, I do not extend that to its speed in reporting to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, if CSL reported as late to the stock exchanges as it has to this Parliament, it would be de-listed. Maybe that is one good reason why we are not privatising it. But it ought to smarten itself up. I have here the Auditor's report in the latest annual report for the year ended 30 June 1989. The Auditor's report is dated 29 November 1989. The Chairman's report to the Minister is dated 1 December 1989-almost five months after the end of the financial year. It is not good enough. CSL will have to do better. Maybe in a more competitive environment it will be enthused to do better. If CSL was privatised, it would be forced to do better. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter worth mentioning in passing is that because Parliament did not sit for quite a while then, we did not get the report until well into the year. There is a touch of unreality trying to deal with an annual report from a body with a very substantial turnover-$130m-so late after the end of its financial year. When the Auditor-General dealt with the accounts, he disagreed to an extent with them on a question which I believe is worth raising in the Senate, and it is the question of whether accumulated sick leave is a right to employees. The Auditor-General clearly does not believe so and says on these accounts:</PARA>
<PARA>Provision for employees benefits: This provision includes an amount of $2.3m in respect of sick leave. The amount is reflected in the Balance Sheet partly as a current and partly as a non-current liability . . . As it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that a liability for sick leave actually existed as of 30 June 1989, the Australian National Audit Office considers that the amount should not be represented as a provision. Had the Commission shared this view, the operating profit before income tax would have been increased by $2.3m . . . Tax Benefits and Retained Profits Carried Forward are each overstated by an estimated $1.8m after tax. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that in passing because it strikes me as extraordinary that in some areas if people do not take sick leave because they were not sick, they still appear to be entitled to accumulated sick leave. I thought this was a safety net to protect people, not some sort of right to take away. The problem we face here is a very simple one in that the half-way house which removes this body from proper supervision is one that should and must be passed through as quickly as possible. The reason I stress this is that there has been some correspondence on this kind of issue. For example, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) wrote to one of the Senate Estimates committees to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate's former Deputy President and Chairman of Committees, Senator David Hamer, and the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, are both of the view that the Estimates Committees have before them only the estimates and unless there is an actual appropriation of moneys to such bodies in the estimates being considered, statutory bodies are not open to examination during these hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>The same applies, of course, to corporatised statutory bodies. To make certain that this situation exists, I notice that the Minister suggests that the community service functions of CSL-as I said, 4 per cent of its activities relate to community service-would be made more efficient and accountable by a formal contractual arrangement with the Commonwealth. The Opposition has no problems with that concept because if it were a privatised body, that would be the appropriate way to deal with its small proportion of activity that relates to the public sector. We believe all of these functions would work better under that system. But the Minister's plan is clearly to avoid direct government funding of the new CSL, so it is removed totally off budget. </PARA>
<PARA> We get no opportunity of pursuing matters on behalf of its shareholders, the Australian people, at Senate Estimates. I find that to be intolerable at a time when there is no other effective opportunity for the shareholders to ask tough questions. It is all very well to say that the Minister is maintaining control, and certainly he is. I must say that some of the aspects of the Minister's control seem to me to be quite curious, particularly when the Minister is going to retain the right to interfere strongly with the running of CSL while at the same time being on the other side of deals that CSL is supposed to make independently and on a commercial basis with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Minister will be on both sides of the deals that CSL is to make, or at least will have the capacity to be on both sides of the deals. It seems to me that we have a situation where there is to be less capacity for the shareholders, the people of Australia, to supervise how this body is going and to ask the appropriate questions than there is even now, and I am really concerned about this. However, it would be wrong of me to sit down without having said something very positive about CSL itself. Having criticised its late accounting and its obvious disagreement with the Auditor-General, I want to reinforce the views expressed here earlier about how it has behaved in an adventurous and progressive way in what is, and has been described as, an illustrious career. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL has been associated with a number of major advances in therapeutics. It developed a whole range of antisera and antivenenes against specific Australian pests, the most recent being the funnel-web spider antivenene of 1988. Having said that, there is no doubt that the lack of government capital, for example, has been some sort of a constraint on its activities to do more, although I ought to mention that at the moment it is expanding rapidly. I think there is $30m to be spent in the current estimates on construction of blood fractionising facilities. Even though this was delayed last year, the construction phase of the project is now under way. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that CSL's ability to develop new products has lagged, and one would hope that privatisation, which will take place under a coalition government, will give it greater opportunities in that area. It is only through product innovation, and in particular perhaps alliances with strong international companies in this area, that a good, strong future will be assured. I should mention, in passing, that CSL is virtually the only source in Australia of active ingredients for pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a body which has done remarkably well. It is a body with a very proud history. It is an organisation that will be able to do even better privatised once the shackles of governmental control and governmental constraint are removed from it. All I can say to the Australian Democrats is that if it is their intention, after we win the next election, to block legislation to privatise bodies like this, I suggest that they should on all occasions make that a very public statement and let the people of Australia know that, no matter what kind of mandate we get at the next election to correct the structural mess that this country is in as a result of this Government's policies, the Australian Democrats are going to ignore that mandate and block our legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is their intention, let them be honest enough to say so here and now, and I will look forward to the next contribution from the Australian Democrats to see whether they have the stomach for that kind of activity. In the meantime, I strongly support Senator Short's amendment, that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories should be fully privatised immediately and that there should be a full and complete divestment of all the Commonwealth interest and control in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories rather than the halfway measures proposed by this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill before the Senate, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1990, has been introduced as part of an alleged reform. I suggest that `reform' is indeed the wrong word. The words perhaps should be `reconstruction package for Commonwealth Serum Laboratories', announced in August 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961, to convert the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories into a public company called the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd. Whilst I welcome this move because it will remove a variety of statutory controls which have actually inhibited CSL's commercial operations my support is actually tempered by the failure of the Australian Labor Party Government to move to full privatisation of CSL, as suggested by my Liberal colleagues, led by Senator Short and Senator Michael Baume. </PARA>
<PARA> The privatisation formula for CSL, as per this Bill, is for CSL to be registered as a normal company with all of its shares, however, owned by the Commonwealth and the Minister having the power to give directions. I have a misgiving in relation to shares to be issued by a nominee of the Commonwealth because it is in this area that we have seen so much trouble in relation to some of the entrepreneurs, and I would have thought that that would have been unnecessary in the Commonwealth's case. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1989 the Government recognised that CSL ought to be far more commercial. CSL, with many other government business enterprises, was having difficulty in maintaining its market share. As with other government business enterprises, it was calling upon the Government for additional capital and it was felt, quite rightly, that those enterprises ought to be made far more commercial and there ought to be more line management capacity within those organisations. That is partly why this Bill has been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a matter of some regret that the Government has taken only half a step-that is, corporatisation-towards freeing up CSL so that it can vigorously, or more vigorously, pursue market opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, not just domestically but also internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Others have already made mention of the contribution CSL has made since it was established in 1916. I wish to draw to the attention of honourable senators some of the more recent achievements of CSL, as noted in its newsletter for August and September 1990. For example, CSL's diagnostic division has scored a major export coup in Japan with one of its key products. It has successfully negotiated a distribution agreement for foetal calf serum with the Japanese company, Toyobo. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan is one of the largest world markets for foetal calf serum, an essential growth factor used in cell culture. Sales from the initial three-year contract with the Japanese company will be worth significantly more than CSL's total Australian market for that particular serum. It took 18 months of hard work, including four visits to Japan, to secure this particular agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of this contract with Japan indicates the potential which exists for the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd in its corporatised form. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the August-September CSL newsletter to all senators. It contains an article entitled 'Building a Great CSL' which covers the corporate, divisional and research and development objectives of the soon to be corporatised CSL. In the words of CSL's Managing Director, Dr= Brian McNamee:</PARA>
<PARA>The package is designed to enable CSL to operate on a more commercial basis and to become competitive and profitable in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA>How much more commercial it could have been were it to be fully privatised really begs the question. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to achieve these commercial objectives, CSL is now adopting a new strategic direction based on three fundamental requirements: first, to significantly improve its operational performance; secondly, to develop improved biological products for human use; and, thirdly, to seek strategic alliance between partners as a means of gaining access to new products, technology and export markets. These requirements raise serious questions. Why were these not priorities beforehand? Why has it taken a notion of corporatisation to try to improve its operational performance in the past? This is surely a reflection on the management in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Within this context of change, the Government has specified three key objectives for CSL: first, to maintain an Australian manufacturing base for biological pharmaceutical products-a laudable objective; secondly, to preserve our current system for supplying critical blood products; and, thirdly, to operate without government subsidy. I ask the question: will there be further calls on the Commonwealth for funds? Investment of $30m is required, as was outlined by Senator Michael Baume. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporate strategy which has been developed by CSL is consistent with the Government's key objectives and recognises the need for profound change based on: first, reorienting CSL to its origins and core strengths as a human biological company; secondly, maintaining CSL's corporate independence while establishing strategic alliances-the Joint Committee on Public Accounts recommended that while there be at least a cent of Commonwealth moneys in these sorts of corporatised operations, the Commonwealth Auditor-General, the Australian National Audit Office, should be the final auditor for such a company; and, thirdly, investing in new manufacturing facilities and research and development to make its products more competitive on international markets. In Dr McNamee's words:</PARA>
<PARA>Our new strategic plan not only provides the best opportunity to create substantial value for our shareholder but also ensures CSL's long term viability as an internationally competitive Australian manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of the House wish it well. CSL has, as its motto or its catchcry, 'putting quality first'. I would not like to think that, in passing this Bill today, which goes only halfway towards full privatisation of CSL, we were jeopardising that motto. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate and those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on this most important Bill, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1990, which relates to converting the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) into a public company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, as honourable senators will know, was established in 1916 and has had-`a long and somewhat chequered history' would be too strong a phrase-times when it has performed extremely well. The initial impetus for its formation was to ensure that Australians could be self-sufficient in vaccines and various sera in times of war and crisis and then, of course, in times of peace. Certainly, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has tried to fulfil that initial impetus and charter over the succeeding decades and, indeed, generations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the modern trend is to secure the further development of CSL by putting it on a more commercial footing and by allowing it to be subjected to the usual planning and accountability mechanisms that one associates with corporations rather than with previous structures within government. I believe that, with the provision of a corporate plan and the formation of strategies to achieve the goals set in that corporate plan, we will see the benefits of this transformation. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Companies and Securities Commission, or, as it will now be, the Australian Securities Commission, will be the repository of the memorandum and articles of association of the CSL public company. Of course, the shareholder-in this case, the Commonwealth-will be in a position similar to that of other shareholders in any public company. That will enable the Minister responsible to exercise that sort of influence over the CSL which is desirable in such a key institution in the provision of various vaccines and other preparations so vital to the health and well-being of Australians. In so far as it has an export potential which is being realised, we are talking about not only a community service to Australians but also a capacity to benefit people who are overseas and who have a commercial arrangement with CSL in order to have the benefit of the scientific expertise and research and development of the various vaccines and other special preparations which are the specialty of CSL. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is rather complex in parts. This is because this transition will need to be effected in various stages to ensure that the CSL continues as a legal entity, and to enable it to have its taxation position and other matters properly adjusted and dealt with during the transition period. I believe that there is general support in the chamber for this package of legislation, except that the Opposition, of course, would wish the Commonwealth Government to go much further and bring about the immediate privatisation of CSL. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, quite properly, has indicated that it cannot support the privatisation of such a key institution, upon which the health and well-being of so many Australians is quite utterly dependent. I think that most Australians would wish to retain their status as shareholders effectively in this particular institution, mediated, of course, through the Government, which will have the rights of shareholders in relation to the operation of the company. I believe that that is something which most Australians would support. For that reason, the Government would not be willing to accept the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition. Therefore, I commend to the Senate the second reading as proposed by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that we are in an interim stage. We are still formulating the rules and procedures for dealing with Bills under this new committee procedure, so one cannot say that there is any established practice. However, it did seem that we were working towards a situation whereby, if a Bill was non-controversial to the extent that there were no amendments, or there were amendments on which there was agreement, it would not be referred to one of the standing committees. On the other hand, if there were amendments which were not acceptable to the other parties, then the Bills to which those amendments applied would be referred to one of the standing committees. For the reason of consistency, in this case we seek to adjourn the debate at this stage and refer the matter to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, as Senator Reid has indicated, we are all here. We could proceed with the Bill under the old system, or we could now go into the Committee of the Whole and debate the Australian Democrats' amendments. However, that would be inconsistent with the processes to which I believe we are moving. If we want to develop a consistent pattern for dealing with Bills, we should adopt the former pattern and refer this matter back to the Selection of Bills Committee and have the amendment dealt with in that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the key to Senator Coulter's submission to the chamber as to how best to deal with this matter is that we are seeking consistency in relation to the way this procedure may develop. If he were able to point to a practice that had built up over several weeks or months in relation to this matter and was seeking consistency, I could understand that, but we cannot set a goal or a model for the future and say that we have to be consistent now and then use today's decision to build into that model for the future. In fact, I do not believe that this chamber has ever thought that it was abdicating or displacing the opportunity to deal with such matters in the Committee of the Whole. I believe that if Senator Coulter, or whoever is moving the amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats, wishes to proceed over the next half hour or so, we can dispose of all the amendments and get the Bill through.</PARA></TALK.START>

In response to what Senator Powell has just said, it has never been our understanding on this side of the chamber that the new procedures would in any way negate the sort of debate that we have had in committee. I do not know what the status of the Selection of Bills Committee is, but if the Selection of Bills Committee took a decision on this matter at lunchtime today it seems fairly odd to me that four or five hours later we are talking about reversing that decision for no apparent reason. As we evolve our procedures in the Senate, and we are all feeling our way, I think we have to adopt a fairly flexible, pragmatic and sensible approach to things.</PARA></TALK.START>

As Senator Powell has pointed out, a document is circulating and it is unfortunate that some members of the Opposition have not read it. Evidently, Senator Watson is not aware of the fact that there seem to be some members of the Government, at least, who want to undermine the new system. While I accept what Senator Tate has said, I hope that what he is not attempting to do here is create a precedent whereby the new system will be circumvented. I agree with Senator Watson entirely that what we are proposing in this case may well mean a more circuitous way of dealing with an amendment. However, it is simply an attempt to get a process in place by which all Bills can be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everybody will know that, initially, the Selection of Bills Committee decided to send all Bills off. That was certainly not in the minds of any of the Australian Democrats at all.

<PARA>Clause 12, page 7 after proposed section 44b, insert the following section:</PARA>
<PARA>``Preservation of 100% of Commonwealth ownership</PARA>
<PARA> `44ba (1) CSL must not, after the issue of shares referred to in section 44b, issue shares to a person other than the Commonwealth or a nominee of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) The Commonwealth must not, without the approval of both Houses of the Parliament, dispose of any shares in, or any interest in shares in, CSL.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with a very successful public utility which has been largely involved in commercial activities, but which also has a significant community service obligation. We are faced with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill, which will turn this utility into a public company. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that it creates a more efficient body, there is no suggestion from the Australian Democrats that it should not be supported. We are in favour of increasing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public enterprises. We are on the record as doing that, and we will be pursuing that with public enterprises which provide an essential service to the community as well as dividends to taxpayers' revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> However, what we are faced with here today is privatisation by stealth. The Government might as well have accepted the amendment moved by Senator Short because, once we have a public company limited by shares, there is nothing to stop the Treasurer (Mr Keating) from ringing the directors representing the Government and saying, `Please sell those shares on the stock exchange tomorrow'-or half of them, or all of them. It will be a matter of a decision taken at the whim of the Treasurer. It will not be a matter that will be considered by the Senate or by the House of Representatives, which have the responsibility of looking after the public assets of the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that I am moving the amendment which says that shares may be issued only to the Commonwealth or a nominee of the Commonwealth and, further, that the Commonwealth must not, without the approval of both Houses of Parliament, dispose of any shares or any interest in shares in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The thrust of the amendment is quite clear: we want to make sure that if, at any stage, the decision should be taken to privatise all or some of this public asset, then it should be the decision of the Parliament-it should not be done by a bureaucrat and it should not be done by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this would be the responsible action to take, and I am rather disappointed in the Government for not accepting an amendment which, I believe, would do it credit. As I said, if the Government does not support our amendment-and I believe that is the case-it might as well go the whole hog and privatise the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that some intemperate language has been used by the Australian Democrats in moving this amendment. Certainly it is not the intention of the Government that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) be disposed of at the whim of the Treasurer-I think that was the terminology used-as though it could be put up in some sort of fire sale to get more money to help pay off the various debts that have accumulated over the years. That would not be the intention at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may well be-and I have no special inside knowledge of this whatsoever-that the CSL board itself, in looking at its situation, may consider that there is a need for it to have the assistance of a strategic partner in relation to a worldwide pharmaceutical industry. It may consider that the sale of a portion of its equity would enable it to have that injection of capital which would help it continue its research effort and its development of new projects, which are essential to the health and well-being not only of Australians-as I said during my second reading speech-but also of those who are dependent on this expertise overseas. Not only is it imperative to have an injection of capital to enable that to take place, but also it is imperative to take up a strategic partner who would enable access to be gained to markets in overseas countries. That, of course, is essential if CSL is not to be simply a small regional operation without access to the various markets which could be open to it if it had a satisfactory partner, who could purchase some of the equity. Those contractual alliances, those strategic joint ventures, and those sorts of international equity sharing arrangements- participation-are becoming much more common. That might be what attracts the board to the idea that it could do with an equity partner. I certainly reject any notion that this is simply a preparatory step-an early step-towards some whim of the Treasurer being announced by press release or in a Budget, a May economic statement or whatever, to raise a few dollars. That is certainly not the intention of the Government in resisting this amendment put forward by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell will have to make do with Big Brother on this occasion. It is a Big Brother amendment designed to give the government of the day more power over the disposal or the actions of an organisation that we are all about trying to make more efficient and productive. The amendment ties the hand of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) as well as that of the Commonwealth. I point out that the heading of the proposed new section to be inserted reads `Preservation of 100% of Commonwealth ownership'. I understand the Democrats' reason for this amendment. It does not under any circumstances want to have privatisation or private sector involvement now or at any time in the future in the ownership of CSL. Therefore I understand the amendment, but it is totally ideologically driven on that basis and is, of course, as I think the Democrats have intimated, the total antithesis of our approach to this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our complaint about the Bill is that it is a halfway house Bill. The Government should have taken the full step and privatised CSL as of now. This will operate in the opposite way. Not only that; I believe the legislation puts another spoke in the inhibition of the organisation to be productive and efficient. Senator Tate said that he does not want this to be seen as being a preparatory step towards any sell-off of CSL. We hope very much that it is. So for all those reasons, which are totally different from the Government's reasons, we join the Government in opposing the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Short has clearly delineated the difference between the Opposition's approach and the Government's approach. He has also clearly indicated to the Committee of the Whole, as it comes across to me at least, that the Government's response to Senator Spindler's motion is inadequate. This legislation is a government business enterprise (GBE) piece of legislation. It establishes a government business enterprise. As I saw it, it does not place in a statutory form a decision taken previously by the Government that ultimately Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) would be privatised. I did not see this legislation as a privatisation Bill. Maybe I am wrong and Senator Tate, who is at the table, can correct me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had a number of legislative packages come before us over some years which established government business enterprises. For example, the Telecom Australia legislation was just that. It established Telecom as a GBE. We all know that the Government has taken a decision in respect of Telecom and that decision will have to come before us in the form of a Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before us, as I understood it, was a GBE Bill-not a privatisation Bill. I would have thought that, if it was a privatisation Bill, it would have the potential to enable the board of CSL to dispose of shares to such an extent that the Commonwealth no longer had a majority shareholding, or indeed any shareholdings at all. In my view, we have been sold a pup. I would have thought that the Government would be honest about it and say that this is a privatisation Bill. I might be completely misunderstanding the situation, but I would be grateful to the Minister if he could point that out and tell me where I am wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -What I have tried to indicate is that in looking to the future capital needs and the need for strategic partners in the pharmaceutical industry in a world market-one hopes that Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) will be able, as it has already demonstrated to some extent in its export initiatives, to participate in that broad market-there may be good occasion and reason for the introduction into CSL of an equity partner. As I say, I certainly have no inside knowledge and I am not forecasting that; nor am I saying that this is a preliminary step to that which will be achieved in the near future. But that is a possibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the board would not be able to contemplate such sale of shares and introduction of such a partner without the concurrence of the Government, which seems to lie behind the honourable senator's suggestion that it could somehow do it in a way which was behind the back of the elected government because, in fact, the government would be holding 100 per cent of the shares and appointing the board. Although I have not seen the articles of association-I do not know whether they have been drafted-I am quite sure that it would be clear that the Government would retain a very firm hold over any such proposal that equity be disposed of. That seems to me to be quite appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not seem to me to be necessary that one has a vote not of the shareholders, which in this case would be the Government, but of two chambers of a parliament each of which could be controlled by different political majorities and come to some sort of impasse and frustration of an attempt by the shareholders-the 100 per cent shareholder being the elected Federal Government-to determine whether a new equity partner be brought in. It would seem to be incredible to want to transfer that particular responsibility and right from the shareholder to two chambers operating as we know they do in this Commonwealth Parliament.

<PARA> While I am on my feet and without wishing to delay the Committee, I cannot leave unanswered some of the things that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, has said. It was not my intention to invoke the Treasurer's name for any other purpose, except that I thought he would be the key person to deal with a financial matter of this type. I have clarified the intention of my question, which the Minister still has not answered, as to whether there is any protection at all in the Bill preventing the Minister in charge of CSL from disposing of or arranging to dispose of any of the shares in what is a public community asset. </PARA>

<PARA>I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the Government amendments to this Bill. Perhaps I should speak to those very briefly. The purpose of these amendments is to deal with a technical matter. Clause 14 deals with proposed section 56 and is intended to provide for exemption from taxes of certain matters relating to the conversion of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to a company. However, there is some ambiguity in paragraphs (f) and (g) of proposed section 56 as presently drafted which could be interpreted as giving CSL a wider taxation exemption than was intended. The proposed amendments remove any ambiguity by making it clear that the relevant paragraphs apply only to the operation of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Act 1990. </PARA>

It would have been desirable that we had the 1990 report before us before considering the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill today. My questions to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) are as follows: What, if any, link does the Government intend to have between the Senate and this new government business enterprise? Is it the intention of the Government that the Auditor-General, the Australian National Audit Office, will continue to be the auditor of this new corporation? Will the Government be putting in additional capital or loan funds into this new company? What funds have been withdrawn or provided to CSL to or from the Commonwealth in the last six months?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must thank Senator Watson for opening up this matter, because what I understand now to be the case should the Opposition privatise the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories-and the blood products division is not only not profitable because in Australia we do not buy blood, but is not profitable per se, because if we had to pay the real costs of blood fractionation we would not run that operation profitably at all-is that the non-profitable parts are likely to finish up in public ownership and the profitable parts, of course, will be hived off to private ownership. Despite what the Government has said on this so far, it is quite clear that that is the way the Opposition will go.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that is a fair characterisation. I certainly did put it in terms of profitable or unprofitable portions of CSL. I put it in terms of what I believe to be a very attractive aspect of the Australian community, namely, that it regards blood products as something which are beyond the normal marketplace trading, or commercial, sort of ethos that grips us in regard to everything else. In regard to blood products, the Australian community quite rightly regards those as being somewhat distinct, being vital, essential and crucial to the sustaining of human life. That principle encourages people to donate blood individually at Red Cross centres and underlies the decision which has been taken by the Government in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was expressing concern about a lack of reference in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill to providing a nexus between this Parliament and Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd (CSL). I was seeking several assurances from the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) as to whether the Auditor-General would continue to be the auditor of this new company and also as to capital funding and capital adequacy</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, as to the question of audit, no specific provision was included in the legislation concerning the Auditor-General. When the Bill was being drafted, the matter of whether all Commonwealth undertakings should be audited by the Auditor-General was under consideration as part of a review of the Australian National Audit Office. A decision concerning the appointment of the Auditor-General for CSL will need to have regard to any decision coming out of that review in respect of the audit of general business enterprises (GBEs) generally. In that regard, I am not able to offer Senator Watson a certain definite and affirmative answer until the Government announces its conclusions following the review being undertaken as to the role of the Auditor-General in relation to all GBEs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the transfer of capital funds to CSL, there has been no transfer of capital funds between 30 June 1990 and today. The capital funds outlined in the Federal Budget are for the construction of the new plasma products facility at Broadmeadows, which will remain Commonwealth owned once completed. CSL has an ongoing role as principal in the construction agreement and is expected to manage the facility once it is operational in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson then asked whether there would be any transfer of capital funds between now and the time of transfer. No transfer is expected. Senator Watson also asked how the extra capital requirements of CSL will be funded. It is thought that the following elements might assist. Firstly, through streamlining of activities-that is, the cessation of funding of some lines where technology has moved on and CSL does not enjoy competitive advantage; secondly, access to Loan Council funding in accordance with the normal practice; thirdly, joint venture arrangements and possibly, as I outlined in the second reading debate, at some future time some injection of equity by bringing in a partner. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson mentioned to the officers his concern over the assets register. CSL has for a number of years been required to detail its assets for taxation purposes. It has been a largely commercial operation for a considerable time and thus does not face the problems being experienced by other bodies now moving to commercial operation. Its assets are well defined between its own assets-purchased through the commercial return; the Commonwealth's-either purchased prior to 1961 or for a specific non-commercial purpose; and those funded under national interest allocations from the Federal Budget for collaborating and reference centres and particular research projects defined as being in the community interest</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Extradition Amendment Bill 1990 and the Opposition is generally supportive of this Bill. We have a couple of concerns which I will deal with, but we will support the legislation. Clearly, we support a modern extradition system for this country and recognise the fact that efforts in recent years have been made to negotiate new bilateral extradition treaties or extradition arrangements with a number of countries. I understand the Government is claiming that such arrangements have now been negotiated with 26 countries and another 14 are in various stages of negotiation. We are pleased with that because we are all aware of instances where inadequate extradition laws have not only been embarrassing to this country but have allowed criminals to escape justice, and that is destructive of our democratic system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Extradition Act which we passed through this place only two years ago, so I guess I have to say at the outset that we are somewhat disappointed that the Government has found it needs finetuning within such a short period of legislating the principal Act. It reminds me that on many occasions in recent times we have had to draw to the Government's attention deficiencies in its legislation. We call upon the Government to put in the effort that is necessary to produce quality drafting and quality legislation in order that such subsequent amendments are kept to a minimum. Nevertheless, we accept that technical finetuning, as has been described by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), is now required in this area, and this Bill provides such adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated that there were some areas in which we had concern. We dealt with them in the other place. In fact, in the other place we were planning several amendments until we received certain assurances from the Government. Our areas of concern principally relate to clause 4, concerning the application of the Act, and clauses 6 and 8, dealing with the presumption against bail. Clause 4 amends section 11 of the principal Act. It alters the regulation-making power under the Act to give effect to Australia's international obligations concerning extradition. Section 11 provides that regulations may be made to give effect to Australia's extradition relationships by applying the Act to `specified' extradition countries, so that Australia will then be able to extradite to those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's extradition obligations come from a number of sources, including bilateral and multilateral treaties and non-treaty based arrangements. It is often the case that our obligations will stem from a combination of these sources. But because of the way in which section 11 is presently drafted, the Act cannot apply to a country by more than one of these means-that is, only one of the sources can be recognised. Thus, if a recent multilateral treaty has an impact on Australia's obligations under an existing bilateral treaty, regulations under section 11 cannot identify, and give legal effect to, this latter source. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill is intended to remedy this defect, to ensure that the regulations made under section 11 accurately reflect Australia's extradition obligations as they may be altered from time to time. We have argued that this clause is poorly drafted and we called upon the Government to improve the drafting. We regret that the Government has not done so. We were of a mind to seek to assist the Government in that regard; however, there were a number of consequential amendments that would follow and it really seemed, therefore, somewhat inappropriate. Nevertheless, we draw this deficiency to the Government's attention, as is our responsibility, and we hope it works as the Government claims it will and it is not another short period time before we are back here with the Government producing more necessary finetuning amendments in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 6 and 8 of the Bill extend the presumption against bail in the principal Act to situations involving the review of extradition decisions. Under sections 15(6) and 32(3) of the Act, when a person is arrested, pending the decision of a magistrate to extradite, there is a presumption that the person will be remanded in custody. Bail will not be granted `unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand'-a phrase which is not defined in the legislation. This presumption, which, of course, reverses the usual situation which we find under State law where there is a presumption in favour of bail, is said to be necessary to address concerns on the part of some nations about Australia's ability to fulfil its extradition obligations. The suggested amendments propose the extension of this presumption to situations where extradition decisions are being reviewed or appealed. We note that the Government has not seen fit to offer any reasons for the extension of this presumption. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we are prepared to concede that it may be desirable that there be a presumption against bail in the context of an arrest or an appeal initiated by the person avoiding extradition. However, we would seriously question the desirability of such a presumption in the context of an appeal or review initiated by the country seeking extradition. After all, a court would have already made a decision at first instance that the person is not eligible for extradition or surrender. The courts, under the existing provisions of the Act, already have a discretion to grant bail or to remand in custody. That discretion is exercised after considering the seriousness of the alleged offence, the character and history of the person involved, and the strength of evidence against the person. The court can then refuse bail if the granting of bail would be an unacceptable risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is therefore of the view that the amendments proposed in clauses 6 and 8 are unnecessary. However, as I said earlier, we are not going to pursue amendments because of the assurances given by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in the other place that if a case for extradition has not been made out in the first instance, the Government is of the opinion that that would constitute special circumstances justifying a remand on bail during the appeal process. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in such circumstances, we have considered that our proposed amendments are unnecessary. We nevertheless trust that what the Government has put to us in fact is that which is appreciated by the court to justify special circumstances, and we will only find that out when this matter is put into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, although we have a couple of reservations, we are not proposing now to move amendments. As I said at the outset, overall we support a modern, capable extradition system for this country. We think it is part of the necessary international mechanisms that are now necessary to fight particularly organised crime, and we are therefore pleased to facilitate the early passage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments on the Extradition Amendment Bill will be brief. The Democrats support the legislation but we also have some concerns, which I will outline. The Bill seeks to make a number of changes to the provisions of the existing Act which, briefly, will allow regulations to be made to facilitate action under both bilateral and multilateral extradition treaties. In the normal course of events, extradition arises pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral treaty and under international law, no rights to extradition are recognised, apart from those rights specified in treaties or other similar international arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) indicates that the Government has formed a task force to negotiate modern bilateral extradition treaties or extradition arrangements, and this is pleasing because it is an effective crime control approach which is necessarily transnational in nature, and appropriate extradition arrangements are an essential part of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to some of the details of the Bill. The main provision of the Bill, clause 4, will amend section 11 of the principal Act, and its effect will be to ensure that regulations made under section 11 accurately reflect Australia's extradition obligations as they may be altered from time to time. A new section 33a will be inserted into part 3 of the principal Act by clause 7, and this provision will streamline the procedure governing situations where a person consents to be surrendered to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 6 and 8 deal with the presumption against bail. Under the Act, when a person is arrested pending the decision of a magistrate and relating to the extradition, there is a presumption that the person be remanded in custody and not be granted bail unless special circumstances are shown. Clauses 6 and 8 propose the extension of this presumption to situations where extradition decisions are being reviewed or appealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to clause 10 of the Bill and put on record some concerns the Australian Democrats have about it. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee raised this clause with the Minister, and I quote from the Chairman's letter about it:</PARA>
<PARA>As you will be aware, the clause proposes to insert into the Extradition Act 1988 a provision which would allow police officers, in certain circumstances, to arrest without warrant a person released on bail. </PARA>
<PARA> In normal circumstances, the Democrats would be extremely concerned about persisting with legislation, without seeking to amend it, which gives police the power to arrest a person without a warrant. However, we have taken note of the answer that has been provided by the Attorney-General, which states quite clearly the circumstances that have led to this particular clause and identified the difficulty which police officers would face in a situation where a person who breaks bail conditions must be presumed to be well on the way to extricate himself or herself from a situation which would mean certain extradition to a country which could deal with his or her criminal transgressions. </PARA>
<PARA> We accept that once a person has had a warrant issued against him or her the presumption must be that there is a reasonable cause why he or she should be extradited. While we continue to have concerns about this provision, we accept that in practical terms it is a provision which, for the time being and subject to future monitoring, will be supported. It is always difficult in these circumstances to weigh up the often conflicting principles of the protection of civil rights and the need to protect the community from crime and, while we are taking the position I have outlined, the Democrats will be monitoring this situation closely in the future to ensure that abuses of civil rights do not occur in the name of crime fighting. Apart from that concern, we are pleased to add our support to a further strengthening of the powers available to deal with criminal activity in the international arena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on the Extradition Amendment Bill. It so happens that at Question Time today I was able to indicate to the Senate that internationally Australia is held in very high regard as far as its extradition treaties are concerned and the general way in which it has undertaken very vigorously in the international community to enter into cooperative arrangements, to ensure that there is no safe haven for criminals moving from one jurisdiction to another in order to escape the claims of justice in regard to the criminal transgressions they may have been involved in, as Senator Spindler would put it. Of course, in relation to mutual assistance in criminal matters, we also have a series of treaties which again have been adopted by the United Nations conference in Cuba as models for the world community. In fact, both types of treaties have been forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly for its separate consideration because the conference in Cuba thought that it was so important that this be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, in relation to legislation underpinning such arrangements there can be occasions where matters domestically manifest themselves which require some clarification. I think basically that is what is being undertaken, certainly in regard to section 11 of the Act. At the moment, as has been remarked upon, it is not possible to list in regulations all countries to which Australia can extradite for crimes created pursuant to multilateral treaties, such as the hijacking convention and the convention for the protection of protected persons. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not want to give the impression that the regulations do not presently provide for giving effect to multilateral extradition treaties, but what the amendment does is permit the regulations, very clearly on their face, to reveal to the public exactly what offences render a person liable to extradition to which countries, and that is the key. We wanted the Act and the regulations to be as clear as possible. We think obviously it is in the interests of those who may find themselves caught up in this process, and their legal advisers, but there is also obviously a general public interest in these matters being as transparent as possible. The amendments to section 11 are, I think, uncontentious and I believe that that is why they have secured such ready support around the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> What has also been raised by senators as a matter of concern is those provisions which will give police power to arrest without warrant a person who is about to abscond, and that is what we are trying to tackle in relation to these matters outlined in clause 10 of the Bill. I believe that these are important provisions and I undertook to the Minister to indicate that it is true that Senator Cooney, on behalf of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, sent a letter to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>While it has not formally drawn the Senate's attention to the clause on this occasion, the Committee would be interested to receive your advice as to the rationale behind the provision. </PARA>
<PARA> That letter is dated 20 September 1980 and is signed by Barney Cooney as Chairman of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The Attorney-General has replied. It might be of use to those who are interested in these matters if I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the reply from the Attorney-General so that it is there as a supplement to the explanatory memorandum in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Cooney</PARA>
<PARA>EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 20 September 1990 concerning clause 10 of the Bill. Your Committee seeks the rationale for this provision which would allow police officers, in certain circumstances, to arrest without warrant a person released on bail under the Extradition Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is designed to minimize the chances a person released on bail under the Extradition Act has of escaping the jurisdiction of the court. Currently police officers have to obtain warrants where they suspect the person has or is about to contravene a bail condition. </PARA>
<PARA>For example, presently a police officer cannot arrest a person without warrant even if the person is about to board a plane at an airport and the police officer knows that the person was released on bail under the Extradition Act and that by boarding the plane (or even being at the airport) the person would be breaching a condition of his or her bail. Of course, by the time the officer could obtain the warrant the person would no doubt have left Australia. The proposed amendment will enable arrest to occur in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>You will, of course, be aware that the courts have held that State bail laws do not apply in extradition cases because the Commonwealth has evinced a legislative intention to cover this field. The proposed provision enacts a Commonwealth law which is consistent with State bail laws such as s.24 (1) Bail Act 1977 (Vic); s.50 (1) Bail Act 1978 (NSW); s.54 (2)(a) Bail Act 1982 (WA); s.18 (2) Bail Act 1985 (SA); s.35 (6) Justice Act 1959 (Tas); s.29 (1) Bail Act 1980-1982 (Qld); s.38 (1) Bail Act 1982 (NT) and ss.347, 358AI and 352 (2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) As amended in its application in the A.C.T by Laws of the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>MICHAEL DUFFY</PARA>
<PARA>As to Senator Hill's point about perhaps considering making different presumptions applicable, depending on whether it is the person who is sought or the extraditing country which is making an appeal, I am advised that this would be extremely difficult, given the possibility of conflicting presumptions where there is an appeal by the fugitive and a cross-appeal by the requesting country in cases where there are multiple offences. I am advised that this situation has occurred from time to time. So it would be extremely difficult to try to present the court with a decision to make on the basis of, as I say, what could be conflicting presumptions. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Senate for its obvious support for this improvement to the extradition legislation passed by this Parliament a couple of years ago. I understand the concern expressed by the Opposition and by Senator Spindler in that we must create a situation where in our zeal in fighting organised crime, particularly that which has an international dimension, we do not sacrifice the rights which are properly recognised as inhering in persons who are subject to police investigation and then prosecution in our court processes. We hope that we maintain that balance as well as possible, given the objective of ensuring that we have international arrangements in place which allow our cooperative effort with other jurisdictions to try to stem organised criminal activity spilling over the various borders, particularly when it has to do with drug trafficking, but not exclusively confined to that particularly heinous activity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 deals with a number of Bills within the Defence portfolio. It proposes to amend the legislation covered in it in the following ways. It amends the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act to remove restrictions on the Chief of the Defence Force's power to make single service command appointments. It removes some redundant positions dealing with seniority. It modifies provisions relating to enlistment of soldiers and sailors to enable the open-ended enlistment scheme to operate more effectively. It makes an amendment to the Defence Force Discipline Act to replace obsolete references to the offence of rape with references in the current Australian Capital Territory provisions that have replaced the former offence of rape. It amends the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No. 1) 1985 to remove an unnecessary provision relating to allotments. It seeks to amend the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to increase the orphans benefit. It also proposes to amend several Acts to replace references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation (JIO) with references to the Defence Intelligence Organisation. In other words, it amends the name of that organisation from JIO, as it is better known, to the Defence Intelligence Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is entirely in support of these amendments. I suppose of greatest interest is the proposed amendment to the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to increase the fixed component of the orphans benefit from $702 to $5,000. The Opposition has been calling for this amendment for some time. However, several other amendments are important. The Opposition would not want the entire consideration of this Bill to be devoted to the increase in the orphans benefit, although I want to say some more words about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The new command structure for the Defence Force-the role of the Chief of the Defence Force as the overall commander of that Force and direct command established between him and the land, maritime and air commanders-is an important new development. There were some statutory inhibitions to fully effecting that new structure in the Defence Act. I do not know why that was not dealt with earlier. It was discovered to be a problem because appointments still had to be made by the Chief of the Defence Force through the Chiefs of Staff. That is proposed to be changed. It is entirely appropriate that that be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the open-ended enlistment scheme, there seem to have been some strange delays in getting this legislation onto a proper footing. I do not know why that should be the case. The policy was decided upon several years ago. The first attempt to implement it was in 1987, I think. The full legislative provision for the scheme is now in place. Instead of enlisting for a fixed period, one can now enlist until retirement age; not for life, of course, but for the period of years that soldiers and sailors serve. It provides for that to be done with the ability to give appropriate notice, statutorily fixed at 12 months, although that can be varied in certain cases. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the purpose of this legislation is to provide that a soldier or sailor who has enlisted until retirement age does not have a right to claim a discharge during the first six years of service or, again, for such period as his relevant Chief of Staff determines. The legislation lays down some criteria which will govern the determination of the Chief of General Staff, which is only appropriate; namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the ability of the Army to carry out its current and possible future military operations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the size, and composition, of the Army; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the training of the Army. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously these are all considerations which are highly relevant to the question of whether there should be a commitment to serve for a period of six years or for a lesser period than six years. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will fully implement the open-ended enlistment scheme, or the legislation relating to it. As I said, I simply do not understand why it has been done in two bites. It seems extraordinary that there would have to be two attempts at statutory changes in order to implement a new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition is particularly pleased to find the increase in the orphan's benefit. However, that benefit has not been increased for 18 years. The reason why there is this striking difference, between $700 and $5,000, is that it has just never been indexed. The legislation, which increases it to $5,000, does not provide for any indexation. The explanation that the Government has given for the absence of indexation-although that was, in fact, recommended by the Cross committee on personnel wastage-was that it will fix it up when it brings in the legislation to give effect to the new Defence Force retirement benefits scheme, known as the military superannuation and benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The indexation of the $5,000 will be provided in that legislation. Why on earth it could not have been done in this legislation is beyond my understanding. We have already seen the messing around with the different statutory attempts to implement the open-ended enlistment scheme. I hope that Defence will be able to smarten up a bit and produce legislation as it intends it to be, instead of having these various bites at the cherry. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Newman, who has the principal responsibility for the Opposition in relation to this aspect of the legislation, has raised these matters with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, and has obtained that assurance from him. She was also rightly concerned about the position of the sailors who are serving and others who, no doubt, will be serving in the Gulf, and the present deployment there. She was particularly concerned about the position, if any of the sailors were killed, of their widows. Under the present Defence Force retirement benefits scheme, the widows are entitled to a pension, but under the new scheme, which is yet to be legislated for, they would be entitled to a lump sum. However, I am pleased to note that the Minister has written to my colleague Senator Newman. He has given an assurance, the terms of which I will read into the Hansard, because it is very important. Mr Bilney states:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me assure you, that it is my intention that in the event of the death of any ADF member serving in the Gulf, the equivalent to the lump sum option proposed for a spouse in the DFRDB Review would be applied by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's enthusiasm for this legislation is based, to some extent at least, on commitments which Senator Newman has obtained from the Minister in the course of correspondence since this legislation has been introduced. It is a less than satisfactory situation, but that is the way this Government goes about things and the way this legislation has been presented to us despite those reservations. As I said, the Opposition supports the measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the provisions of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill as far as they go. However, we feel that there is one other urgent amendment to the Defence Act which it would be timely to deal with now. I must apologise to the Senate for not having circulated this amendment earlier, but I will be moving it in the committee stage of the Bill. As the President said earlier today, I expect that we should actually be able to conclude consideration today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Democrats' amendment is to ensure that Australian troops cannot be sent overseas to fight or to act as peacekeepers without the agreement of both Houses of Federal Parliament. This provision is one which already applies in other countries and one which would in this country at least allow a full debate and a vote in both Houses of Parliament before our young men and women were sent to fight in a foreign country. Obviously, it is a timely one. </PARA>
<PARA> In the situation in which the world currently finds itself, we are constantly being told somewhere in the media, almost daily, that war in the Middle East is imminent. I profoundly hope that that is not the case. I believe that a peaceful solution is still possible through negotiation, and I am encouraged by the involvement of the United Nations (UN). I believe that stronger involvement by that body is desirable and probable. However, the possibility still exists that Australia will be drawn into a war in the Middle East against our wishes. In that case the Democrats believe that it is in the best interests of the Government, and especially of the people of Australia, that every one of their Federal elected representatives should be involved in the decision whether or not to send troops to such a war. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just describe the amendment briefly so that we can go through the committee stage a little more speedily. Basically, section 50c of the Defence Act 1903 requires Australian military forces to serve overseas. It contains no provisions at all limiting the right of our Prime Minister to send troops overseas at any time that he or she would wish. Our amendment would make it necessary to get the agreement of both Houses of Parliament before troops could be sent overseas to war or even as part of a peacekeeping force. This provision applies in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In Canada, the Governor-in-Council may deploy troops anywhere, at any time, subject to Parliament meeting within 10 days to approve that action being taken. In Germany, even a united Germany, there are still limitations. At the end of World War II the allies made constitutional provisions prohibiting German forces from participating in a war of aggression. Even a peacekeeping role is prohibited unless in response to an illegal attack on Germany itself. Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese have, until now, refused to participate in UN peacekeeping forces because of their Constitution. Of course, feeling in that country at the moment is running very high over the issue of sending troops to the Gulf in order to protect Japan against indirect aggression. There will be a debate and a vote in the Japanese Parliament on the issue very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment seeks to place the responsibility for a decision to send Australian troops abroad with this Federal Parliament, subject to exceptions covering the movements of personnel in the normal course of their activities and the need to take fast action in an emergency. Parliamentary approval for any emergency deployment of troops would need to be obtained within two days of the dispatch of those troops. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment also contains important exclusions. It excludes overseas service by members of the Defence Force pursuant to temporary attachment as part of an Australian diplomatic or consular mission; on an Australian vessel or aircraft not engaged in hostilities, or operations during which hostilities are likely to occur; for the purpose of education or training; or for purposes related to the procurement of equipment or stores. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is designed to reinforce the idea that the power delegated from the people of Australia is not given to one man or woman but to a group of men and women known as the Federal Parliament. It should be the decision of members of this Parliament, as the representatives of every Australian, whether or not to send any Australian troops overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious example of a disastrous decision to send Australian troops overseas is, of course, Vietnam. One of the most divisive issues in Australia's history, it involved some 50,000 service men and women, many of whom are still paying the price for that decision now, 20 years later. Nearly 500 of our troops were killed in that war and nearly 3,000 were injured. All this was as a consequence of a decision to involve Australia in a war with no proper consultation of the Parliament or the people. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years we were told that Australians fought in Vietnam in response to a plea for help from the Government of South Vietnam. That is rubbish, obviously. Australia was involved in that war because the United States did not want to be seen to be acting alone. That sort of shameful incident should never be allowed to happen again in this country. We believe that our proposed amendment would be the most effective way to achieve that aim. </PARA>

<PARA> The question raised by the Democrat senator is a very important fundamental one which, it is perfectly true, various governments around the world have chosen to deal with in various ways. Indeed, there is a long, complex and controversial history as to how this question has been dealt with in the United States of America, going back to the very establishment of the Constitution of that country. There is an even more interesting history as to how various congresses and presidents of the United States have dealt with this particular constitutional provision in the United States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Powell is indicating they have. I think this chamber has already debated the matter and, if my memory serves me correctly, I have been involved in that debate in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of whether our defence forces should be required to serve overseas has been traditionally determined, under our Constitution, by the Executive of government. Decisions of executives of governments have been made over the years in a cautious way, and there does not appear to have been a case of conflict between the Parliament and the Executive in relation to this question except, maybe, in relation to Vietnam. But I remind Senator Bourne that, in relation to Vietnam, the conflict emerged far down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> My very strong view is that the Parliament would have very strongly supported the decision to deploy Australian forces in that country, in the first place. The objections to it came much later. Nothing in this legislation would have affected that position, because there is no power of recall by Parliament in this amendment. I do not think it would have been of any benefit whatever to Senator Bourne or the Democrats in that case. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian members of the defence forces may also be required to serve overseas in many capacities. I notice that a clause in the Bill does not require the approval of Parliament in a number of limited situations, but those situations are particularly limited. There would be many occasions when Australian members of the forces may be deployed outside Australia in situations which are very far short of war. In particular, I refer to peacekeeping forces. </PARA>
<PARA> My guess is that with a renewed United Nations interest, and agreement within that body, Australia will be called upon more often in future than probably has been the case in the past to provide peacekeeping forces. There are many occasions when this could arise and when it would be quite surprising if Parliament had to approve of that deployment. The Opposition believes that, essentially, these decisions are ones to be made by the executive arm of government, and there is no demonstrated requirement for Parliament to assume this power to itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on what I understood to be the response of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) to the proposition that the amendment should be supported. I have to agree with him that it is a proposition that does deserve considerable and considered debate in this chamber, and indeed in both chambers of this Parliament, and I can see no impediment to such a debate here tonight. Even if there were, I think it is a particularly appropriate time, as Senator Bourne has said, for the matter to come before us again. I stress 'again'. It is a matter which has been raised in the past by the Australian Democrats. Indeed, if there were not time to consider it, we ought to be making time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern that we have is not a concern solely of the Australian Democrats in this chamber; it is a concern expressed to us in the community increasingly as days go by and the situation in the Middle East becomes more and more precarious. As we scan through the Australian Associated Press print-outs even tonight, following statements out of the United States about the inevitability of armed conflict escalating in the Middle East, it must be a matter of serious concern to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> What people are saying to me and to many of my colleagues is that they are concerned that, as with world wars I and II in which this country has been engaged in the past, in a sense we seem to be being conditioned to reach a point where we will be sending our armed forces into an engagement which is indeed a war; that we are now in a situation of the phoney war which will turn into the real war at any time. I hope that is not the case, as I am sure we all do, but there is concern in the community. Given that this is our policy and that we have attempted this before, people are responding positively, certainly to me and to my colleagues, when we say that we believe no such decision should be made unless the Parliament is involved in debating such a proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever there was a time that the Parliament should at least debate the proposition, this is certainly it. It is very disappointing that on neither the Government side nor the Opposition side does there seem to be a willingness to do that. We will not go away from here tonight and put this in the bottom drawer never to resurface. It will resurface as a Democrat initiative as long as we are in this Parliament. We as representatives of the community believe we do have a role if we are to send young Australians overseas with the great potential of losing their lives, particularly when there is time to consider such potential deployment and certainly when tonight there is time for us to consider the proposition that we might do that. We strongly commend the amendment to the Parliament and foreshadow that this will not be the last time we will bring this proposition before the chamber</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wholeheartedly endorse the amendment moved by Senator Bourne in the committee stage of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. I appreciate the sentiments behind it and the substance of the amendment. It is very important that on a crucial issue such as service of the Australian defence forces overseas, the Parliament be consulted. I know that this issue has come before the Parliament before. Of course, it is highly pertinent now with the hasty decision of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to send Australian troops to the Gulf region without consultation with Parliament, indeed without consultation with Caucus, and with very limited consultation with a carefully selected group of his own Ministers. It is deplorable when so much power is vested in one person. I have said repeatedly that it was a bad decision which should be reversed. The Prime Minister should have consulted more widely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may have happened in this situation that the consent of both chambers of the Parliament would have been given, but the point remains that Parliament was not consulted. The people of Australia felt that they had no decision-making input to this rash and hasty proclamation of the Prime Minister that ships would go to the Gulf in support of the American position. I think history may show it to have been a decidedly unwise decision. I believe it to be so now, whatever transpires in the next few months. I hope that it does not spark into a full-blown conflict in the Gulf region. The principle remains as strong; it is a consistent position that the Parliament of Australia should be consulted, that it should not be up to the executive members of the Parliament, and the Prime Minister himself, to decide under what circumstances Australian troops should be deployed to overseas engagements. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only a few months ago at the seventy-fifth anniversary, or commemoration-I think that is a better word-of the Gallipoli debacle that the Prime Minister said with tears in his eyes that never again would young Australians be serving in a foreign shore and never again would the situation develop where young Australians were sent off to be like lambs to the slaughter. Yet when it is convenient to him and his own political agenda to be seen to be supporting the Americans with such undue haste, he commits young Australians to a potential war zone much more dangerous than anything that was experienced with great pain by those forefathers of the Australian defence forces on the Gallipoli slaughter field. There is another potential slaughter field coming up. The principle is that the Parliament and the people of Australia should have some input into such an important decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it is very important that the Australian Democrats' amendment be supported. I am not surprised that the Government and the Opposition have said that they are not interested. They are not very interested in democracy. What they are more interested in doing is supporting the American line. They do so consistently. Our Prime Minister especially is extraordinary in his support of the American position on almost every issue and I do not think that the Opposition would be much different. It has not given us any indication that it would be very different in supporting the American position. It was an American position that was supported, not the United Nations position-which I would have endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal of support in the Australian community for the United Nations position but not for the militarisation that was engineered by the United States Government. It is that which most people are objecting to and it is that which could still explode literally into the most devastating circumstances known to humanity with chemical, biological and nuclear weapons all ready to go in the Gulf and our Prime Minister, on the whim of a phone call to President Bush, saying, 'Okay, let's go'. In fact, he committed five ships and the Navy had to tell him with some embarrassment that we did not have five ships to go. So keen was he to be supporting the American position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that this principle be enshrined in Australian legislation: that the Parliament of Australia be consulted, that the people's representatives in this place have a chance to put their views, that Australian troops are not deployed in any overseas engagements without the permission of the Parliament. The same situation could have arisen in the past few years on various other occasions when the former Minister for Defence was very keen to give the Australian defence forces some overseas practice with their new gadgetry that he so willingly acquired on their behalf. Mr Beazley had the troops ready to go to Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. Again, those matters should have come before the Parliament. A decision must be made with the consent of the elected representatives of the Australian people. This is the place where a decision should be made to deploy or not to deploy Australian forces overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> My position on this matter is well-known. I do not believe that the Australian forces have any business in being deployed overseas under any circumstances whatsoever. I would support what Senator Bourne said in her opening remarks: that negotiation and a mediated settlement is the way out of this dispute and the way out of all disputes. I wholeheartedly support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing like an omnibus Bill on which to make omnibus statements such as, `The people of Australia feel they have not been consulted on this matter'. I think it is pretty presumptuous of any individual member of parliament to presume to speak on behalf of 17 million Australians. Senator Vallentine, of course, never seems to find that any sort of a problem. The other breathtaking statement that Senator Vallentine just made, which caused people like Gandhi at the time enormous internal heartache, is that all disputes have to be resolved, or can be resolved, by negotiation. What a shame Senator Vallentine was not around to talk to Adolf Hitler!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regrettable as we might find it, human beings are frail creatures. It is greatly frustrating for all of us-not just for Senator Vallentine, because she does not have a monopoly on conscience or pacifism in this Parliament-that in a situation where we know we are intelligent animals, that we have fine minds, that we are capable of producing the music, literature and technology that we do, we cannot grasp the possibility of actually living in peace with each other without having to resort on occasions to stand up to bullies and thugs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some people in the world-and I will not prolong this point-who, unfortunately, rise to positions of great power and inflict great cruelty on their fellow human beings and to whom logic, reason, negotiation and diplomacy mean nothing whatever. Unfortunately, there has been a whole parcel of such individuals over the years, to the great misery of their fellow Africans, who have headed up African countries. I should not have to talk too much about places like Uganda. I would love to have seen Senator Vallentine negotiating with sweet reason with Idi Amin and to have seen how far she got on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> As regrettable as I find it, the omnibus statement just made by Senator Vallentine that all human problems and conflicts are always capable of resolution by diplomatic means, frankly, is nonsense. I regret to say that it is nonsense. I wish that we all lived in the ideal and perfect world where Senator Vallentine does where sweet reason prevails. Perhaps if that happened I would even be an Australian Democrat. I believe in the ideals of the Australian Democrats of saving the world. It has always been their campaign slogan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, there you go. I can remember one year Tandberg portraying the fundamental differences between the three major parties. I thought he did so in a very interesting way. He had the Liberal Party of Australia saying, `Save yourself'; the Australian Labor Party was saying, `Save Australia'; and the Democrats were saying, `Save the world'. I think there was a substantial element of truth attached to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But regrettable as we all find it, there are individuals and people in this world who do rise to positions of great power, who have the potential of inflicting great human misery on the people around them and who do not find it easy to be persuaded by logic, reason or negotiation.  Unfortunately at times we have to stand up to them. Regrettably, one of them currently is running the country of Iraq. There is not much that we can do about that with sweet reason either. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of this debate-and I will conclude on this point-many countries, including democracies such as our own, have had major debates on the role that executive government and parliament, by whatever name we call them, play in this fundamental question of how we deploy troops in times of emergency or war and, particularly, overseas service. As I know Australian Democrat senators are aware, for many years this has been the subject of major debate in my Party. There has been a long history of debate on this matter in my Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Executive governments are ultimately accountable to parliament, one way or the other, in a democracy such as our own. Particularly on substantial issues such as this, I have to say-and I think by inference the Australian Democrats probably agreed with the points that Senator Durack made-that I was one of those Australians whose birthday got thrown into the barrel. Fortunately, I was not one of the ones whose birthday got pulled out. I was living in north-west New South Wales at the time. I still recall my feelings then as a 20-year-old. I actually believed, along with most other Australians-and Senator Durack is quite correct-that the North Vietnamese would be shortly knocking at my front door if we did not go overseas to stop the communist menace. That was the prevailing feeling of the day. It is a long time ago and things have changed. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the wonderful thing about hindsight-one is always able to use hindsight with 20 : 20 vision. It is very convenient. But Senator Durack is quite correct, and I agree with him, that in the prevailing mood of the day it probably would well have been, in terms of the one example that has been given in this debate, the decision of the Australian Parliament then to send troops overseas to that conflict. The reason that I find that a relevant point to comment on is that I, as did Senator Durack, read the amendment and discovered in it, as he did, that there is no provision for recall. </PARA>

Without any disrespect to this chamber or this institution, I just tried to imagine, being the frail creatures we are, Australia's national security in some peril and fighting and directing the war in a forum such as this. We would be sending the troops and calling them back probably every second day. I simply point that out, as Senator Durack did, to highlight again the very substantive nature-and the Democrats have recognised it-of the question they have raised. It is not a matter to be tacked on to the end of an omnibus Bill such as this. It is a matter for far more substantive debate in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating an omnibus Bill, the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, which will amend or repeal a number of Acts falling within the Administrative Services portfolio. As the Bill relates to a diverse range of legislation within the portfolio, I will consider each amendment separately. The first amendment is to the Archives Act 1983. The Australian Archives is responsible for all records generated by the Commonwealth agency since Federation. Its purpose is to ensure consistent and accountable management of Commonwealth records in the interest of efficiency, effectiveness and equity. It makes available to members of the public information on the structure, location, functions and records of existing and previous Commonwealth government agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988-89 the Archives handled 17,230 public inquiries, an indication of the enormity of its task being 315,100 shelf metres of files at last count. In recent years the entire Department of Administrative Services has moved towards the introduction of user charging for services, either on a full cost recovery basis or at commercially competitive rates, where market rates are available. In 1988-89 the Archives raised a total of $139,000 in revenue compared with a total expenditure of $17,870,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this amendment, as I understand it, is to allow the Director-General of Archives to determine in writing charges for discretionary services provided to Commonwealth agencies. Previously any levy of charges by Archives for any of its services was to be prescribed by regulation in accordance with section 71 of the Archives Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment provides the Archives with flexibility to determine charges in accordance with market conditions, and is a means of putting the Archives on a business basis-a sense of direction which the Opposition supports-and a means of imposing economic disciplines on other government agencies. I think this is a move in the right direction, because it enables for the first time some sort of real cost to be put on the services provided by a government department. It makes those people who would normally think there was no cost to these things think twice before asking for frivolous information. </PARA>
<PARA> The only comment I would make is that I have some concern, although I agree with the sense of direction, about the whole business of trust accounts. One of the problems with trust accounts is that, curiously, statutory corporations are more accountable to the Parliament than are trust accounts. It is something I think this Parliament will have to address down the track. The Opposition will not oppose that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment is the repeal of the Naval Properties Act 1925. This legislation is now redundant as a result of the New South Wales Government in 1985 granting an easement in gross which protects the Commonwealth's maritime rights. It provides for ratifying agreements between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for the transfer of Cockatoo and Snapper islands from the New South Wales Government, and part of Goat Island from the Commonwealth. For that reason we will be supporting that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the repeal of the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act 1981. This Act, of course, is now redundant. It provided for a 20 per cent discount of Australian tenders to give preference to Australian producers. In 1989, it was announced that the scheme would be phased out and a non-discriminatory policy introduced. This Act has been overtaken by a series of purchasing reforms and new preference arrangements which have applied since 1 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930 and the Social Security Act 1947. The 1987-88 Budget announced the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Ltd. That company was sold on 1 July 1988. These Acts are amended to remove reference to the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services which, of course, is no longer a Commonwealth instrumentality. Therefore, that amendment will also be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to the Parliamentary Allowances Act, however, is something to which I wish to address myself. I foreshadow at this stage an amendment in the committee stage of the Bill. The Bill provides for continuing payment of additional allowances to office-holders other than Ministers from the date of dissolution of either House, or of the Parliament, until polling day where they are to be candidates for election. It has arisen, I understand, as a result of representations made several years ago from the Clerks of both Houses to the Minister seeking legislation to fix payment of additional salary for those office-holders who have parliamentary duties during the term of an election campaign. I stress that: during the term of an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The present system of ex gratia payments which had to be approved by the Minister for Finance was considered to be cumbersome from the point of view of estimates and vulnerable as a point of law. However, I point out that it appears it was not intended by the parliamentary officers that the allowance would be extended beyond those who received an ex gratia payment in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 March 1989, the President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, and the then Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mrs Child, wrote a letter to the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, in which they pointed out that the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 provided for the continuation of salary payments to members of both Houses from the date of dissolution of the House of Representatives, or both Houses, until polling day, where those members are candidates for election. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments to Ministers continued pursuant to the Ministers of State Act 1952. Section 6 of the Parliamentary Allowances Act makes special provision for the continuity of payments or allowances in respect of the officer of the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of Committees of the Senate, and the Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because there was no provision for allowances known as additional salary and expenses of office to be paid to other office-holders, the President and the Speaker recommended that legislation be changed to cover a certain group of people. Those people included, for instance, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Leader of the third party in the House of Representatives if there was one, the Leader of a recognised non-government party of at least five members not otherwise specified, and the Whips. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened with this particular amendment is that the Government has extended that recommendation from the President and the then Speaker to cover a whole range of people. I think it is worth while going through that list. Apart from those people to whom I have just referred, it also includes the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts; the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works; the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters; the Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority; the Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Community Affairs; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Infrastructure; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; and the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I just make the point that this is for the period from when an election has been called until polling day. This legislation wants to give the additional allowances for all these groups of people in that period of time. The list goes on as follows: the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs; the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts; the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training; the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration; the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology; the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communication and Infrastructure; the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure; and the chairman of a parliamentary committee not otherwise specified herein-just in case a few more are collected along the way. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government is serious about engaging in micro-economic reform, it has to start with itself and the principle of no work, no pay should apply. If the Government will not give a lead in these matters, what hope is there for the rest of Australia? The Government cannot ask people to tighten their belts while it continues to hand out largesse to its own parliamentarians at a time when there is no way in the world that those parliamentarians will be doing the work for which they are paid, unless-and I make this point-they think that at the time, because an election is on, there are some political Brownie points in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard arguments in the other place that a certain honourable member felt that during the election campaign he had to answer a few questions by telephone to staff engaged in Canberra about a report that came down in January. I ask: Is that justification for paying this vast range of people who in no way in the world will be involved in any of those committees during an election campaign?</PARA>
<PARA> The dollar amount involved is not big. My own back of the envelope calculation indicated that it was about $32,000. That may not seem much, but there is one hell of a principle involved. I think the question has to be asked: Do these people carry out those duties when there is an election on? I am pleased to see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, is on duty tonight, because with his background, he would know that more than anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Opposition in the committee stage of this Bill will move an amendment, the effect of which will be to cover those people who were not covered previously but who carry out their particular duties from the calling of an election until polling day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Parer for his remarks and for his support of all those sections bar the one about which he commented ultimately. I thank the Opposition for its support of those worthwhile, if minor, reforms. Obviously, as stated in the House of Representatives by Minister Beddall, the Government will not be accepting the amendment put forward by the Opposition. We can debate it mainly in the committee stage but, as the Senate would be aware, currently the Act provides that the only office holders who receive payment during the period in question are the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House and the Chairmen of both Houses. It is obvious from the amendment that it is considered by everybody that that list is not adequate and the Opposition has chosen to put a list that includes all the positions that relate to its own parliamentarians and the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is its entitlement. I do not raise that as a criticism. If the Opposition so chooses, it is entitled to raise that matter. But I think it is not an appropriate recognition of the continuing role of the people who hold other positions in the Parliament, particularly those people who chair committees. Poor old micro-economic reform is like liberty in the French revolution-all sorts of sins are committed in its name, and this is another. I regret to say that the Opposition has failed to put any particular argument why this amendment ought to be put. We can debate it further in the committee stage, but the Government will be opposing the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>As mentioned in the second reading debate, if the proposed Government amendments went through, a whole range of people would continue to obtain allowances from when an election was called until polling day. The effect of that would be that those people would continue to get those payments even though there is no way in the world they would be doing the work for which they were paid. This, in itself, is a reflection on the Government, which keeps talking about improving efficiency, improving productivity and saving taxpayers' money, while at the same time, when the Government gets an opportunity to keep handing out taxpayers' money to its own people, it cannot resist it. What a lead to give to the people of this country: tighten your belts; things are tough; the recession is on; we must do something about changing the attitudes of this country. Yet, when the opportunity comes, small though it may be, to give a lead-and a lead must come from the top-the Government suddenly comes out and hands out more money. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of my amendments is that they would limit those payments to those people who actually continue in their positions. Those people include the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the leader of a third party in the House of Representatives, the leader of a recognised non-Government party of at least five members not otherwise specified herein and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The list does not include the President of the Senate or the Speaker, the Chairman of Committees in the Senate or the Chairman of Committees in the House of Representatives. The reason for that is that those people are already covered under another piece of legislation-the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act. It is not that they are excluded; they are already included, so there was no necessity to include them in the schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, who is sitting at the table, how this Government can justify paying this money when everyone in this place and surely the rest of Australia knows that they are being paid for work that they will not be doing, unless, as I said in the second reading debate, they are doing that work because it suits their political purpose because there is an election on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I rise to say that the Australian Democrats support the Opposition's amendments to this legislation for the reason that Senator Parer has outlined. While we appreciate the spirit of the Government's amendment to ensure that office-holders continue to receive their remuneration during the time between the announcement of an election and when the election is held, we are concerned that the people should be performing the duty for which they are receiving the allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must confess to some slight embarrassment at having the carriage of this legislation for the Australian Democrats. However, perhaps I could declare a pecuniary interest and be excused for having this portfolio on this occasion; I could not persuade anyone else to come here and do it for me. It is a principle to which we should adhere. Although the sums of money, I understand, are not enormous, there is not any point in expending moneys where there is no justification for those moneys to be expended. There are a number of office-holders who, as Senator Parer has said, would not be carrying out their duties-committee chairs, whips, and so on-and for whom we believe the coverage provided by the Government's amendment, as in the Bill, is inappropriate. We therefore support the insertion of a schedule which outlines the party leaders and the deputy leaders-as noted by Senator Parer-as the only people who would receive the allowances, contrary to the Government's position where all office-holders would continue to receive the allowances, whether or not they did the job attached to that allowance. </PARA>

I think everybody in this chamber would appreciate-I have been waiting to hear it mentioned, and I have been surprised it has not been mentioned-that the most difficult time for any member of parliament to be asked to perform any activity outside his electorate is during election time. It is arduous for members from remote areas at any time to come to Canberra for committee meetings, and we put terrible demands upon them. But at election time, for a member in a marginal seat to be diverted in any way from the fundamental election campaign activity is a very high price to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appreciate that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats are expressing proper concern about the defence of taxpayers' money, and we all do that because we realise that in the decisions we make here to spend money, we are spending other people's money, and we ought therefore to be very concerned about the circumstances under which we do it. But there are two essential elements to the argument that have not been explored. I will not take the time to reiterate those that have been stated in other places and to which I referred in the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> First, in those matters that were referred to, for example, in the House of Representatives, the present Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) had been the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology during the course of the election, and he was able to recount those activities which he undertook; they were not as onerous as the activities which he would have undertaken at other times but they were being undertaken at the most difficult time. Honourable senators who have had such responsibilities have not appreciated calls being made upon their most valuable time, and there is no more difficult time in which to carry out those non-essential activities. The continuation of those activities, even at a lesser rate, is a function that ought not to be ignored. As campaign director for my Party in previous elections, I have been annoyed to find members not available to do the jobs that I thought were the most important because they were performing duties which they had been called upon to do by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we need to remember that the amount of payment that members receive is not a weekly amount. It is not the same as a fitter in the railway workshops who is paid a weekly amount. Members receive an annual allowance which takes into account the times when the committee is sitting, and the times when the committee is not sitting. If the committee does not have a current reference, payment is not stopped. If Parliament is not sitting, payment is not stopped to the whips. It is an annual amount to compensate them for the discharge of their obligations over a three-year cycle. If there was something which said that a member was paid weekly, then for a week when a member was not discharging the obligation, it may be possible to argue that the member ought not be paid for that week. Members of parliament do not get annual leave as such, but other people who are paid salary are not discharging their obligations when they go on annual leave, and we do not stop paying them because that is part of the assessed annual obligation of the worker to the employer. I believe it is an analogous situation. There is proper concern about taxpayers' money but it is misconceived in this instance. I urge both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to reconsider their position on the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question I asked the Minister on duty was this: What justification did the Government have to deviate, to the extent it did, from the request made to the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, in the letter from the President (Senator Sibraa) and the Speaker, Mrs Child, on 10 March 1989? I do not think he gave me an answer to that. The intention was to pick up those people-bear in mind they were not paid these amounts in the past-who, because of their positions, had to be granted act of grace payments by the Department of Finance. That was the origin of the change to the legislation, which is understandable. But then the list went from a handful to some 10 or 20 people. That is the problem we have. As I said earlier, it is the principle involved. We cannot expect a change of attitude, a change in work practices in Australia, if we are serious about micro-economic reform, but continue to use taxpayers' money at a time when, with one or two minor exceptions, one of the problems which has occurred in Australia over a number of years is that rules have been made for the exception rather than the total population.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to respond to the point raised by Senator Parer. I thought in a sense the broader description of the basis of the Government's decision did respond to his question, but let me be more specific. It is appropriate for the Speaker and the President when they become aware of an anomaly to draw it to the attention of the Government. But this does not limit the Government in its right to respond. If it perceives that in drawing to its attention an anomaly the Presiding Officers have caused the Government to become aware of other related anomalies, we ought not to be constrained in our resolution of the matter by the reasonable but less comprehensive initiative taken by the Presiding Officers. This is a circumstance in which the Government has seen, appropriately, that a very minor amendment and a matter that is not-Senator Parer properly acknowledged this-a depredation on the public purse of any significance but is simply a proper recognition that there is an annual determination made and that the intention of that annual determination is being distorted by the circumstances that take place during this period. That is the basis upon which the distinction has been made between the recommendation and the Government's decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government receives many recommendations from many places which initiate legislation, but the legislation does not always directly reflect, and in fact rarely directly reflects, those recommendations or initiatives, because others advise and governments decide. The Government has looked at the range of issues of concern and initiated legislation accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to make a few comments about our recent delegation to Moscow and Leningrad, from which I have just returned. The Soviet Women's Committee invited a cross-parliamentary group of women politicians from the Australian Federal Parliament to visit the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and I was one of the people fortunate enough to be able to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to pre-empt any official report that the delegation may give, but I want to make some comments in the nature of first impressions before those impressions get lost. They may not be for the benefit of everybody else, but I certainly would like to have the opportunity to make these comments now so as to remember in particular a number of things from the visit that I regard as particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I would like to thank the Soviet Women's Committee for its splendid hospitality, for its organisational skills, for providing interpreter services, for arranging our travel within the Soviet Union, for organising any number of meetings and for seeing to our accommodation-all of which was done with great ability and a minimum of disruption or trouble. I think the Soviet Women's Committee is one group that certainly gets done what it says it will do, and I want to offer my thanks to it. Also, I would like to thank our Australian Embassy staff in Moscow who, of course, provided assistance, briefing information and support to the delegation in its time in Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, I would like to thank those women who were interpreters for us-Elena, Galina, Vera and Tania in particular-and also those people who worked as guides for us. I said before I went that I thought we were very privileged to be going to the Soviet Union at this time. It is, I suppose, a great privilege to be there at such changing times. </PARA>
<PARA> From outside of the Soviet Union it looks very exciting. Certainly the movement to peace and the bringing down of that Wall that closed eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to the West is something that I think has pleased people all around the world, not only because the threat of war is receding-nuclear war, in particular-but also because that part of the world that was fairly much closed to the rest of us is now available and open. </PARA>
<PARA> Curiosity being what it is, many people wanted to go and have a look. But, more importantly, many people wanted to take the opportunity to make contact with people behind the Iron Curtain and in the Eastern bloc, particularly those who have friends, family and relatives in this country or in other countries in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to put on record in the Senate tonight some of my impressions. First of all, these are very exciting times for us. They certainly are changing times for people whom we met in the Soviet Union. They are also very frightening. The women told us again and again that they had a faint optimism and a great anxiety. I suppose that is a fair assessment or summary of what they said. </PARA>
<PARA> They are very pleased, of course, to acknowledge President Gorbachev's contribution to peace, but they appreciate, too, that the last five years have seen their standard of living worsen dramatically. So it is hard to know how, on balance, that works out for them. Many of the women would not want to blame Gorbachev, but they do not want to speak favourably of him. They also do not feel that it is likely that he will be overturned, but some of that, they would agree, may be in the nature of hopeful thinking, if not wishful thinking. There seemed to be little evidence of that while we were there, but I have to say that we did not peer into every corner. </PARA>
<PARA> These are challenging times, very exciting times and very concerning times. The standard of living, we were told, is much worse than five years ago. Another thing that struck me was the war-weariness of the Soviet Union. Certainly the recent Afghanistan venture is to the front of people's minds, but in Leningrad we were able to visit the monument to the siege of Leningrad, the stand of that city against the siege by the Germans for 900 days between 1941 and 1944 in the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of Leningrad was turned into rubble. It lost its water and power very early on during that siege. The population of over three million people in Leningrad at the start of the siege was reduced by 1.2 million. Those people died mainly in the first year of the siege from starvation and the effects of winter when they did not have any heating. Still, the people in Leningrad held out, and we know the course of that piece of history. </PARA>
<PARA> People are very uneasy about the prospects of more war. They are very weary and tired, and they are certainly very concerned about the potential for further loss of life. While the quality of life may be a cause of concern, they would rather have that than the prospect of death. We were told it is estimated that some 40 million Soviets have died or been killed since the Revolution. That is a fairly extravagant way to care for a population. </PARA>
<PARA> People welcome peace, but that peace is associated with the changes of perestroika and glasnost and the Soviet people told us that they are very concerned that things are no better-indeed, they would say worse. The old order has changed but the new one is not defined and not in place. Food shortages have not been as bad since 1947. The women who work all day-and something like 91 per cent of women in the Soviet Union are in the work place; 51 per cent of the work force is female-then have to stand for many hours in queues for what food is available. </PARA>
<PARA> Food and consumer goods are both in very short supply, and what is of concern at the moment is that the food shortages are now going to the very basic commodities such as bread, butter, eggs and potatoes. We were told that plenty of food had been produced this season but the problems were twofold. One was harvesting the crops and the second was transporting it, particularly to cities or population centres like Moscow and Leningrad. It certainly did not seem as though these problems were going to be solved in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> The shortages continue, people queue for long hours, they do not see any way that things are going to change, and they just know that they are getting very tired. I also think that we have to make sure that we do not place Australian values on life in the Soviet Union. We have to appreciate the differences. That means that we should not so much be critical as interested to be informed and be prepared to offer information rather than judgment or moral values. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited work places and found there that the workers were provided with such things as laundry facilities, a seamstress who would either mend or make clothes for a modest fee, a hairdresser, manicurist, sport and recreational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In one place there was an arrangement with a nearby swimming pool. Of course, child-care was provided either on site or nearby. Indeed, some of the workplace enterprises provided food for workers to buy, which sometimes reduced the time they had to queue. Those services are very unusual and not like what women in the Australian workplace would find, at least in the large part. The services may be there, but the buildings, the structures and the facilities are very tired and very out-of-date. Still, one acknowledges that considerable contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> We were also shocked at the salaries. But again, the salaries paid to people need to be qualified by the outlays. For example, a teacher would earn 110 roubles a month. We divide this by five to get a rough conversion into Australian dollars. We gasp when we see what it amounts to. However, for about one Australian cent people can ride the metro underground all day. Telephone calls cost about 2c. The cost structures need to be balanced against that income. In particular, we were advised-though I do not know that I can claim this to be the case in every situation-that the rental a person pays for living space is pegged at about a maximum of 10 per cent of income. These qualifications need to be added. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interpreters who travelled with us to Leningrad was interested when I asked her whether she wanted to move to Leningrad or work there. She said, `I cannot'. I asked her why and she said, `Because it is stamped in my passport'. She showed me her passport. It stated that she was entitled to five square metres of living space in Moscow. Her passport said that that was her entitlement. Five square metres is not a large space. That certainly pulled me up very short. Her husband has an entitlement and her family has a small entitlement for children. But the majority of families in Moscow would live in two rooms, apart from a bathroom and a kitchen. They do not live extravagantly in terms of housing space. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way she could move to Leningrad was if she found someone who wanted to do an equal exchange or if her husband's work took him to Leningrad, in which case her passport and accommodation would be changed. I believe that those restrictions on space are put there not so much to punish people or to set limits, but rather to keep people out of Moscow; to stop a massive migration into the large centres. I have not been able to authenticate that piece of information. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem that really shocked us was that very little safe or reliable contraception is available to women in the Soviet Union. We understand that about 5 per cent of Soviet women could have regular access to reliable contraception. We were also told that very many Soviet women could expect to have 10 to 12 abortions in their fertile lifetime. Of course, this is because abortion is the only contraception for them to fall back on. </PARA>
<PARA> After listing those impressions, we could be left with the idea that all in the Soviet Union is gloom and doom. I would certainly like to qualify that. The women of the Soviet Union showed energy, courage and warmth. Their hospitality is legendary. We certainly experienced that welcome and hospitality. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that struck me was the hunger of those Soviet women for the information we could provide. While we were there trying to find out what it was like for the Soviet women, asking them to tell us the facts and figures in their country, they were busy asking us what information we could bring. We had a splendid exchange of information. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very struck by this hunger for information. That was part of the welcome. The attitude was, `Do come. We are so pleased to get a source of new information; new ideas that might contribute to our thinking; new ways to look at the formulation of women's policy, for example'. They asked how we had done it in our country, who formulates the women's policy and what it covers. </PARA>
<PARA> They were particularly interested to ask us how we got elected. In their recent elections, the quota system for women was not in place. I never got the opportunity to ask, `Who took away the quota? Why was it judged that the quota should go?'. But the quota did go. So the number of women in the Soviet Parliament is very much less. Both men and women preferred not to vote for women candidates. The Soviet Women's Committee has some hard work ahead of it. It has to examine the reasons why, and particularly look at ways in which women can be more successful when campaigning in future elections. </PARA>
<PARA> They were very interested to know how we in Australia campaigned. Amongst other things, we told them that one puts out bits of paper with one's photograph, one's policies or one's Party's policies. They then said that there was a shortage of paper and also a terrible shortage of printing ink in the country. I suppose one thinks about fixing the supply of printing ink before one thinks about campaigning with bits of paper. The shortage of paper and printing ink is a chronic problem in terms of the production of printed information of all sorts, particularly books and publications which we in this country would regard as the norm. There is a considerable shortage of those. No-one sees a way to overcome that shortage, at least not in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA> The most abiding impression I have was the warmth and the generosity of that welcome and the enthusiasm, the desire, of those women to hear the information we could provide. It would be very sad if the channels of communication opening up from outside to within the Soviet Union were not to continue. I will certainly be looking at ways in which we can continue to stay in contact with those Soviet women and the many more that others of us from this Parliament have had the opportunity to meet, and no doubt other Australians who have been able to journey to the Soviet Union have been able to make friends and acquaintances there. I hope that it does not stop with one parliamentary visit. I think that our delegation, as a group, will want to say that in whatever report we produce. I reiterate: the response from those women was such that it would almost be unmanly behaviour not to provide some way of setting up mechanisms to continue to respond with that sort of information and with access to the goods and services that we in the West enjoy and take for granted. It is very important that we appreciate the benefits we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of my medical background and interest in health, I was very pleased to have the opportunity to visit a hospital in Leningrad. The best way to describe that is to say that I thought I was in a time warp and had gone back some 40 or 50 years from Australia in the 1990s. I know that some of the health and medical services provided in Russia are world class. Some of its research in health and medicine is world class. But the general provision of services to the broad population would certainly not be acceptable in this country. Again, I hope that there will be imminent changes in the delivery of health care, as there are now discussions about the change in the education system. </PARA>
<PARA> All those changes create not only pluses but also a dimension of anxiety. The parents would tell us that their children were asking questions. They are pleased that their children are asking questions, but the parents did not get the chance to ask questions. It is important that the parents also get some kind of education to assist them not only to answer their questions but also to know how to deal with just the right or the opportunity to ask questions-to doubt and to challenge things as well as get more information. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, it was a very rich and rewarding visit. I hope that Australian women and parliamentarians can continue that contact with the Soviet women so that the exchange that we enjoyed can continue and be fruitful for both sides of the Iron Curtain. </PARA>
