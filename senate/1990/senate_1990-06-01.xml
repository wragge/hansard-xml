<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> There is no need to remind honourable senators that since taking office the Hawke Government has embarked on an unprecedented program of reform and development in the aviation sector. Both the aviation industry and the community at large stand to benefit greatly from the changes involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions taken to date have been substantial and have been an integral part of the Government's agenda of micro-economic reform both in the private and public sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Faced with an industry hamstrung by 38 years of detailed economic regulation of interstate aviation, the Government's first reform priority was to put in place new arrangements designed to promote increased competition and pricing flexibility which would lead to greater economic efficiency in the industry and benefits to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the Government decided in October 1987 to give the required three years notice of termination of the two airlines agreement and move in 1990 to a deregulated domestic aviation system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before the Senate gives effect to this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill brings to an end the two airlines policy, and opens Australia's inter-state air services to free competition. </PARA>
<PARA> On enactment of the Bill, the following legislation will be repealed:</PARA>
<PARA> Airlines Agreement Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA> Airlines Equipment Act 1958</PARA>
<PARA> Independent Air Fares Committee Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, action has been taken to repeal Customs (prohibited imports) Regulation 4N, which currently controls the import of aircraft into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The net effect of these actions will be that the Commonwealth will withdraw from the detailed economic regulation of the domestic airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the current controls over the importation of aircraft will be removed. These controls have provided the threshold underpinning of the legislative and contractual arrangements which currently regulate the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the detailed determination of passenger capacity that may be provided by each trunk airline will cease. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the existing constraints on the entry of new domestic operators to trunk routes will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Independent Air Fares Committee will be abolished and the Commonwealth will withdraw from the determination of air fares. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, however, determined to ensure that Australia's high safety record is maintained. It will also continue to maintain the highest level of aviation security and ensure that the aviation system is similarly geared to national environmental priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government expects is a general improvement, over time, in the competitive environment with the airlines free to develop their own commercial initiatives which should flow through to the advantage of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits which can reasonably be expected to result from the increased opportunities for competition in a deregulated environment include:</PARA>
<PARA>greater incentives for existing and new participants to develop the industry in ways which are more efficient and responsive to consumer needs</PARA>
<PARA>a wider range of fares, in particular an increased availability of discount fares</PARA>
<PARA>growth, particularly in the price sensitive leisure market</PARA>
<PARA>a greater variety in the types, standards and frequency of services provided, and use of more appropriate aircraft on some routes</PARA>
<PARA> Following deregulation the domestic aviation market will be required to operate within the constraints of established competition policy controls applicable to industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Interstate air fares will be made subject to surveillance by the Prices Surveillance Authority. The discipline that competition will apply to the industry should ensure that the PSA's influence will, in practice, be limited to cases-likely to be isolated-involving abuse of market power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian aviation industry will also be fully exposed to the Trade Practices Act and its anti-competitive and consumer protection provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> A central issue concerning competition will be the ability of new entrants to gain access to appropriate terminal facilities at airports. A decision will be made within the next few days on the priorities to be assigned to individual operators for access to facilities located in Ansett and Australian Airlines existing terminals. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAC has acknowledged that it has a major role to facilitate operations by its customer airlines, existing or new. It welcomes additional business and will do its utmost to accommodate it in a responsible, commercial manner. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a need to ensure that adequate information is available in a deregulated environment. In order to encourage a more competitive environment Governments, airlines, tourism bodies and consumers will need timely and relevant information on the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and Communications is currently reviewing the information needs of a range of users in the deregulated environment to determine the most appropriate form, timing and distribution of information, along with appropriate cost recovery measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges that access to foreign capital could make an important contribution to the Government's aim to open up the industry to competition. From October 1990, foreign investment will be welcomed, subject to the normal Foreign Investment Review Board Guidelines, including investment by foreign carriers which do not operate to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The only exclusion in current policy is unlimited investment in domestic airlines by foreign international carriers operating services to Australia. In such cases, the investment limit is 15 per cent in any one domestic airline. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major challenge facing the Government was to replace the outdated administrative arrangements so that the aviation facilities and infrastructure essential for a deregulated environment would be provided efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government took the significant decision to reform these areas by separating them from the bureaucracy. This was achieved through the establishment of the Federal Airports Corporation, with responsibility for major airports, and the Civil Aviation Authority, responsible for safety standards and day-to-day regulatory control of air service operations. </PARA>
<PARA> These new organisations, free from the constraints of the Government's annual budget cycles, provide the basis for a more efficient delivery of facilities and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAC was created in January 1988. Its primary function is to plan, develop and operate Australia's major airports. This has meant that, for the first time, Australia's airports have been placed on a truly commercial footing, with proper emphasis on their operating and commercial performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Adequate forward planning of airport facilities has been conspicuously absent in the past, and accounts in large measure for the problems of congestion and overcrowding at some of our major airports. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere is this reflected more acutely than in the capacity constraints of Sydney's KSA airport. Previous Government's had put the question of a second Sydney airport in the ``too hard'' basket. However, this Government has met this critical issue head-on and has taken decisive action to resolve the Sydney airport issue and to position Sydney to meet aviation needs well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst micro-economic reforms in provision of airports and terminals have already achieved visible results, improvements in the provision of modern and efficient air traffic services are of equal importance. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, and in recognition of the need for effective safety regulation and enforcement in a deregulated environment, the Government established on 1 July 1988 the Civil Aviation Authority. The Authority is responsible for both safety standards setting as well as day-to-day regulatory control, and also has operational responsibility for the provision of aviation services to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was especially concerned when determining the functions of the CAA to ensure that the high levels of safety achieved to date were maintained and enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) is also maintaining its role to investigate and report on all aircraft accidents and incidents. In addition the Bureau prepares recommendations for increasing safety in aircraft operations and operates as an independent body responsible directly to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Through a co-operative effort the Government, the CAA, BASI and industry are committed to maintaining Australia's excellent safety record. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue that needed to be addressed by the Government was the implementation of measures to ensure the competitiveness of Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Following incorporation of the airline in 1988 the new processes, announced as part of the reform package for the Transport and Communications GBEs in May 1988, will ensure that the Board and management have greater responsibility for the performance of the airline and are more clearly accountable for results. </PARA>
<PARA> Day to day controls over the airline's operations have been removed, including the requirements for Ministerial approval of contracts and expenditures, terms and conditions of borrowing and leasing arrangements, investment of surplus funds and the establishment of subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms clearly placed the airline on a more commercial footing and will enable it to compete more effectively in a deregulated environment. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government recognises that Australia requires additional capital and is currently addressing a range of funding options which could meet the Airline's future capital needs without compromising public ownership and control. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of recent reports have identified areas of possible policy change including Qantas carrying domestic passengers, a single aviation market under CER, pricing of landing slots at KSA and major airports, and the level of foreign investment in domestic airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering options, however, it is important to emphasise that any change to one facet of policy could have effects on other elements of the industry-there are many linkages and significant implications for existing and prospective players in the domestic and international aviation spheres. The Government will need to examine carefully the potential gains and losses. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial implications of the proposed deregulation legislation for the Commonwealth are minimal. As mentioned above, the Independent Air Fares Committee (IAFC) will be abolished. In the 1988-89 financial year the IAFC incurred $611 369 in running costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority will have an increased oversight role within the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990, but the words spoken in this chamber and in the other place by our colleagues will long be forgotten while the impact of what has been decided this week lives on. I say that as a preface because this is not just another piece of legislation that we have to process. The Wool Tax Amendment Bills, in the strictest legal sense, will lift the present maximum tax levy on woolgrowers' returns from 10 per cent-in fact the actual payment by the woolgrowers was 8 per cent-to a maximum of 20 per cent. That is in essence what we are voting on in this chamber, but the ramifications of it are far more significant. In fact, Mitchell in the Australian this morning presents a very good summation of the whole situation. He has the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) standing beside an economist and the words are, `We've stuffed up everything else; let's stuff up the wool industry'. I hope that is not the case at the end of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those of us on the Opposition side, the decision we have before us is simple: either to accept the Government's offer of 20 per cent or to prevent its passage. For us the issue is not 25 per cent; it is not a debate about the floor price; it is not a question of the size or the merit of the stockpile. We have no amendment options. There can be no amendments. All we can hope to do if we reject the legislation here is to commit the industry to the status quo, a maximum of 10 per cent. That is not what they have asked for. For that reason we must accept what the Government has offered us and the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> For the same reason we cannot accept the Australian Democrats' amendment. In any event, I doubt that, given today's announcement of a drop in the floor price, woolgrowers would now want a tax of 25 per cent of their wool receipts. I think the events of the past few days have made this debate almost irrelevant. If we had any opportunity to argue for options to persuade the Government to follow another course, that opportunity is now past. The Federal Government has made its decision as to how it wants the wool industry to operate and we all-that is, woolgrowers, the industry and politicians-must live with it. I must state my pecuniary interests in the wool industry, as I run sheep myself for wool and for fat lambs. </PARA>
<PARA> I only hope, for everyone's sake, that the Government has this time got its formula right. In lowering the floor price, it may have set a dangerous precedent. How the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) sell this fall in the reserve to the wool markets of the world, particularly the wool cartels in Japan and Europe, will be critical to the future of the industry in Australia. It is very important that we all understand what it is we are debating here. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that woolgrowers realise our limitations in this legislation, and that others who in recent days appear to have become instant authorities on the industry also understand the very narrow meaning of this levy amendment. There is no doubting the wool industry has some very serious problems, and some very difficult decisions to make. The present dilemna epitomises very clearly the cyclical nature of agriculture and the wool industry. It is at times a cruel cycle, and for many in the wool industry things are not good and they are likely to get worse. How quickly times change. </PARA>
<PARA> We can all be wise after the event and say that we all knew prices had to come back. Never in the history of wool marketing in this country has a boom period lasted more than season and a half. We could all look now at the size of the national flock and talk wisely of overproduction. We could all argue now that demand will fall. The prices paid for sheep by some growers and new investors into the industry 18 months ago were foolhardy, as it turned out. People knew then that the price levels could not be sustained, irrespective of other economic, political or meteorological factors. What could not be predicted was, firstly, the international political scene-I refer particularly to China, Russia and the eastern European situation-and, secondly, our own economic management problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot isolate the problems in the wool industry and suggest that the position it is in is simply a result of its own efforts. Ahead of any other factor, the twin evils of the high interest rate regime that this Government has foisted on the Australian people and an inflated dollar value have had an enormous and, in fact, dominating influence. The full effect of these probably cannot reasonably be measured. </PARA>
<PARA> High interest rates affect the industry in a number of ways and at a number of levels. First, they impact on the liquidity position of the wool grower. Obviously, high interest rates affect a farmer who operates on an overdraft. But they also affect the farmer if he buys equipment on leases or hire purchase, or borrows against the expectation of a wool clip. They also affect the people who service one's farm. This is normal farm practice for many farmers and that is why sustained high interest, which everybody predicted would not and could not last, has forced growers into a financially impossible situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally irresponsible to dismiss the interest rate issue as a minor issue, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has done. It is argued that farmers benefited from high interest rates when wool prices were buoyant. They possibly did, but one good season does not wipe out a lifetime of debt. The fact is that high interest rates have been with us longer than high wool prices. </PARA>
<PARA> While there are many victims in this wool crisis, there is only one villain, and that is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. He, more than any other, has brought the wool industry to its knees. He has sought not to disagree with his Government's economic policies but rather to disagree with the industry. He has not apologised to growers for interest rates and dollar values that may well send them to the wall. Instead, he has blamed them for not making tough decisions and structuring their finances to cope. He has intervened in a market to induce a situation where the industry has been forced to accept a drop in the floor price. His remarks in recent weeks have been ill-timed and unwarranted. Growers will be a long time forgetting what the Minister has done to their industry simply, as it turns out, to accommodate his Government's economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has accused growers of being unrealistic for failing to accept his predictions for their industry. But can we blame the growers? Take the 1989 outlook paper of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, remembering that ABARE has played a big part in the setting of the floor price and levy. The opening lines in ABARE's 1989 outlook paper The Future for Wool, read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>While wool prices have receded from the record levels of last April, they are projected to remain relatively high into the 1990's. </PARA>
<PARA>That was only twelve months ago. So growers can be excused for making management decisions based on that fairly optimistic forecast. Growers can also be excused for not relying on ABARE's forecasts and advice this year. Given ABARE's track record, the industry is correct in its caution. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have had far more respect for the Minister had he kept out of the debate, waited until the end of the financial year and then undertaken negotiations with the industry. There is no disputing the fact that the market started to collapse and buyers started to withdraw as a result of the interventionist and disruptive comments of the Minister. I would frankly have had more respect for the Minister if, just once, he had acknowledged that his Government had got its arithmetic wrong-and did we not see that last night!-and that its economic policies were largely to blame for the wool industry's dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA> High interest rates have affected not only the growers but also the Australian Wool Corporation. The amount of wool that can be affordably stored is totally dependent on cost. At present interest levels it will cost $220 per year per bale alone to store wool, the bulk of which would go to interest costs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing inherently wrong in stockpiling wool. The mining industry does it frequently in slow market periods. The question comes back to one of cost effectiveness. The cost of storage must influence the decision. If current predictions about the stockpile prove correct, interest costs alone would amount to $720m a year on a stock of four million bales and over $1 billion a year on a stock of six million bales. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems for the industry-and I stress they are the industry's problems-to resolve are: first, the issue of too much wool in store; secondly, whether Australia is producing too much wool and what should be done about reducing production; thirdly, the question of an appropriate reserve price for it; and fourthly, how to promote sales for the middle range wools and increase demand for wool, which in recent years has declined. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first issue, the size of the stockpile, it is academic to argue how much wool would have remained unsold this season had the floor price been lower. Had the price been lower or had there not been instability in the market over the reserve price, who is to say how the present sales might have proceeded. Market instability, as I have said, can be directly traced to Mr Kerin and also to Mr Keating and comments from people such as Senator Button, who dived into the debate by claiming that woolgrowers had failed to think sufficiently internationally and sufficiently intelligently about their industry. Those sorts of remarks have not done the industry or its standing in international markets much good. </PARA>
<PARA> On the second issue of too much production, it must be remembered that even in the best of selling seasons Australia has never cleared five million bales of wool, which is our current production figure. We have always had a carryover. The reasons we have such a large carryover at present are threefold: too much middle range micron wool from too many sheep; too high a price; and too high an Australian dollar value. That is the crux of the matter for the industry. There are those in the industry who insist that Australia can never have too many sheep, that we are the only country that can increase production. I, nevertheless, believe that for a variety of reasons, especially related to the attraction of a relatively high reserve price and some good prices, people moved into sheep, generally from marginal wheat-sheep areas. They now ought to be persuaded to move back to grains. But that also poses a problem as the Americans are about to have the third biggest crop on record, and the biggest since 1982; in fact, wheat could drop $20 a tonne. Growers could move to cattle, but that would pose a problem too with the overproduction of cattle. So stability in the wool market has always been a necessity because the other commodities move up and down without the stability of wool in the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can reduce our sheep numbers and our wool production over the medium term, then we have a chance of restoring profitability to the market. I am sorry that the Government, so hell-bent on fiddling with the floor, fails to look at other options to reduce production. There has been little or nothing said about either a quota on production or a financial incentive to cull flocks. For example, if growers were paid $6 a head to cull aged ewes, and if we were to cull 10 million ewes this year, it would in effect mean 15 million fewer sheep next year. If we repeated that over a two-year period, our cumulative reduction would be close to 40 million sheep. The cost would be only $120m to the industry, but that would be cheaper than buying and storing wool from those sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> The other idea is a quota on production. I think it is the less attractive of the two options, but given that quotas have applied successfully in the grain and sugar industry, it ought to have been looked at. I am not saying that it should have been taken up, but I think it should have been looked at. Given the changes to and the potential collapse of the live sheep trade, it is evident that something must be done to provide a market or an incentive for people to cull their aged sheep. There must be an incentive to prevent them being kept for wool production. To date, nothing has been suggested for this end of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> I must make some remarks about the floor price, but I preface them by saying that there will be those who say it is the wrong decision, others who agree with it, and still others who do not know. The Opposition-the shadow Minister for Primary Industry in the other place, Bruce Lloyd; the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the other place, Tim Fischer; Dr Hewson; and everyone on this side-have said that the industry should decide on the floor. Even John Kerin said that in 1987. Again with the wisdom of hindsight, we can now suggest that the 870c floor was too high. Obviously a jump of 70 per cent over two seasons was too much. But the Corporation took the decision and growers and Government alike benefited from it. Little if any complaint was made at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether it is now correct 12 months later to decide that the price was too high and ought to be lowered is debatable. I have heard the arguments from every direction. I have reviewed the compilation of statistics provided by the Wool Council and on paper and in theory the best, or perhaps the least objectionable, option for the industry-and in light of the fact that other options are not being offered-the only chance to clear the debt was to take a 20 per cent levy with a 700c floor. That was the package that the Wool Council put to the Minister and, if we look at the facts and figures, it looks the most palatable. The industry, through the AWC and the Wool Council, must accept its share of the blame for giving the Government that option in the first place if it was so untenable to them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember the impact of the 870c floor, or indeed any floor we set in Australia, on the industry. While we held a high floor and refused to sell below it, we were allowing other countries who could produce wool cheaper to clear their stocks at prices higher than they might have received had we not had a floor in Australia. Despite the acceptance of the 700c floor, I understand sources in the industry suggest that if the market stabilises quickly the figure is likely to settle around about 800 cents a kilogram mark.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that not everyone will agree with the 700c/20 per cent levy option. I do not much like the idea myself. But we have to accept that, for whatever reason, the industry has an expensive storage problem on its hands. I am less concerned about the size of the stockpile than I am about the cost of it. As I have already said, had the Minister not panicked-and panic the market he did-and had interest rates been lower, I doubt we would have had the dilemma we have today. Mr Kerin said he directed the Board of the Australian Wool Corporation to cut the floor price to 700c, saying that this was the first time in the 20-year history of the reserve price scheme that the floor price had been lowered and indicating that it would not be lowered again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>My clear message to the market is that 700 cents is immutable. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The next time the floor price will be changed is upward. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly how it will have to be. Setting the floor well below the expected level at the moment, which I have just said is about 800c-means it will never have to be lowered again. That has to be made clear to people all around the world in the wool industry. If we muck around with the floor price again, ever, the scheme that has been held in such high regard by so many in the wool industry all around the world will be finished. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is no use talking in `whats' and `ifs'. Sadly, there will be many growers at the lower income end of the market who will be forced out. Across the entire wool industry there will be a slump because not only has their income been cut but so have their assets. The investment value of the stockpile is less; their land values will decline; there will be pressure on rural adjustment funds and there will need to be an increase in this year's level of funding of $36.9m. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Mr Kerin in a statement he is making in the other place this morning mentions the problems that he will have in that area. Mr Kerin also went on to say that he recognised that the cut in the floor price would create difficulties for wool producers, adding that the Government would be prepared to look at it. I think it is good that he is going to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth aspect-that of promotion-is a vital key to clearing the stockpile. Demand for wool has been declining for the past few years. Even Sir William Gunn is on record as suggesting that marketing holds the answers and wants more funds directed to the Interational Wool Secretariat. With wool's textile market share forecast to drop to 2.5 per cent over the next decade, better market strategies need to be considered, especially for middle range wools. A promotion as successful as the `cool wools' for superfine fleece would solve the industry's stockpile problems easily. Selling on terms might also be attractive to a cash-starved market and again this is another option that ought not to be discarded without discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that must be considered is that while essentially the debt is for wool growers, it is in Australia's best interests that the industry is not over- committed and unable to meet its own debts. Wool is a major export commodity; there is no argument about the important role it has played, and will continue to play, in the welfare of this nation. Often in this chamber I have said that we must all realise the debt we owe to the people of rural Australia who produce so much export income from which we obtain our standard of living. But it is for that reason that the industry cannot take decisions in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool-buying activities of the AWC are affecting the national savings, and long term they cannot be sustained or justified. When one considers the Corporation's worst case scenario of a $4 billion debt and a stockpile of six million bales, set against an industry that produces $6 billion worth of wool a year and purchases half of it itself, one starts to realise the appalling debt spiral that is potentially accumulating. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that high interest rates are a political and economic reality in Australia, at least in the short term, the wool industry, among others, has to learn to manage its operations within those constraints. The industry has to acknowledge that sheep numbers are up. Those in marginal wheat-sheep areas moved further into sheep when international wheat prices started to look shaky. Older sheep were kept when prices started to soar because it seemed the appropriate economic and management response to a rising market. With the changes and uncertainty in the live sheep trade there was not much other choice in any case, if one wanted to keep up profit margins. That cycle has now changed and it is now time to examine national flock numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps in the next little while, parti-cularly if we get a dry spring or a tough summer, and prices remain depressed, we may well face a voluntary slaughter levy to pay growers to dispose of their older sheep. From a welfare point of view, we cannot allow a situation to develop where farmers can no longer afford to feed their sheep. This is a particular risk in marginal sheep areas that produce the middle range wools. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the setting of a new floor and the passage of this levy Bill will bring some stability back into the market. But questions need to be answered. We still have four weeks of the selling season at the 870c a kilo floor. Does the industry stop sales, knowing that buyers are not likely to pay 870c when in three weeks time they can get it for 700c? What happens to those bales and what do growers do about their wool consignments between now and the new financial year? What will they do for a cash flow if the sales are suspended? What about the integrated industries which need a continuous flow of raw wool to keep their production lines operating? What happens to them if the sales are suspended? They have mills that have to be kept open if people are to keep their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, this legislation is not a vote on a floor price. It is a vote on a 20 per cent levy. The argument about whether it should be higher or lower was never one for those of us on the Opposition side to make. It was only a case of whether it was 20 per cent or 10 per cent. We were asked to give a firm signal to the industry. We were assured that by not disputing this legislation and assuring a quick passage, the market would be better for it. On reflection, the industry has been put through a fairly painful extraction process. I can only hope that the industry now gets back to the job of growing and selling Australia's finest product. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged by the manner in which Hugh Beggs accepted defeat the day before yesterday and his determination that the industry would `survive what it has been dealt. However, that by no means says that we condone the Government's action in respect of the wool industry. We abhor the mess that Labor's policies have meant for this industry and many others'. Mr Kerin will need to think very carefully next time he attempts to intervene in the market. He still maintains that he wants the industry to manage its own affairs. I hope that now he will leave it alone and let it do just that. I hope, too, that all growers in the future take more time to understand and observe what is happening in their industry. I do not believe that they have been well served by their leaders and they ought in the future to demand more information and expect greater accountability. I am looking forward to any legislation that will make the AWC more accountable at general meetings to the registered wool taxpayers. I also urge growers to remember their treatment at the hands of this Government. Their chance for revenge will come later. </PARA>
<PARA> The floor price has worked well for the industry and Australia and has given stability to a great exporting industry. As a very good friend of mine in the wool growing areas of the central west of New South Wales said yesterday, in the 47 years he has been growing wool, it is only in the last 19 years with the floor price that he has had any stability of income. He reflected that he had not made a great fortune during that time. That is what it is like on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the right of the Government to set a floor price. I conclude my remarks by quoting Mr Beggs, who said he accepted the legal basis of the decision and ruled out a legal challenge by the Corporation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to make sure there is no more speculation or division in the industry. Any further speculation can only be damaging. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not have to pretend that we like it, but we do have to buckle down and make it work, and make it work we will. </PARA>
<PARA>As a person who has dealt with droughts, flooding rains, hailstorms and all the things that go with being on the land, I can say that the people of rural Australia will buckle down and make it work. However, it would have been a lot better if it had not been inflicted with the economic policies of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government, which have just about driven the farming communities of Australia to the grave. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990 which are before the Senate today and to make my feelings clear about the decision that was made by the Government to raise the levy to 20 per cent, but to drop the floor price of wool to 700c, when the industry was actually calling for a 25 per cent levy and the retention of the 870c floor price. We have just heard Senator Brownhill, a woolgrower himself, speak on this legislation. My family has no involvement in the wool industry, but as a National Party senator for nine years I have consistently travelled around Queensland and I know the vital part that the wool industry has played in the export earnings of Australia over many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to honourable senators that I truly believe that this issue should have been a matter for the wool industry itself and should have been decided and worked out by that industry. It should not be decided by a group of economists sitting back here in Canberra with some flawed economic theories. Economists have a very good track record of getting it wrong, and in this case they have got it very wrong. Unfortunately the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and the Labor Government have followed their wrong advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has ridden on the sheep's back for years. The wool industry over time has provided so much of our export earnings. It is Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. Ninety-nine per cent of Australian wool is Australian owned and 97 per cent of wool is exported. Wool has always helped Australia to pay its way. Now I believe it should be the Government's turn to assist the industry with its problems. But has it? No! The Government may think it is helping the industry by its action of dropping the floor price, but I say to honourable senators that all it is doing is helping to destroy the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The marketing scheme has been great for the wool industry and for Australia. Our sometimes first and sometimes second largest export earner, the wool industry, has developed and made an enormous contribution to our export earnings. European and Japanese wool buying interests have disliked the success of our wool marketing scheme. They have not been able to manipulate the market and they have not benefited from the periodic collapse in price that was familiar prior to 1970 when the scheme was put in place. Now for 20 years the Australian wool industry has benefited from unprecedented price stability. But why, I ask honourable senators, does the industry find itself currently at loggerheads with the Government over the levy and the floor price? Unfortunately, the Government thinks that it has resolved it, but I do not agree. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason they have been at loggerheads is certainly not because wool has been surpassed as a fine material. Woolgrowers are not facing the situation where a synthetic fibre has been developed that can replicate the desirable and superior characteristics of wool, not at any price, let alone a comparable one. Confirmation of this is the fact that this season the latest available sales and export data for the eight months to 28 February 1990-honourable senators will notice the figures are not from the period when the Government suggested the wool price was going to come down-show that several traditional large and important wool buying countries with sophisticated and high technology processing industries have substantially increased their wool imports compared with the same period the previous year. West Germany increased its imports by 49 per cent; Italy by 9 per cent; the Netherlands by 377 per cent; the United Kingdom by 9 per cent and Taiwan by 19 per cent. But what has happened is that where countries have purchased significantly less wool, it has been agreed in most cases to be due to a shortage of foreign exchange currency, as in the Soviet Union, China and Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusions therefore must be that we are dealing with normal economic market forces of supply, demand and price. But nowhere have we seen the real truth stated as to why the Government is acting in this manner. I believe the real truth is that the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) borrowings are regarded by the Government as part of the Public Service borrowing requirements and that powerful elements of opinion in the Treasury and Department of Finance are arguing that these should be limited. Consequently, at a time when our foreign exchange situation is serious, the Government has undermined the AWC's authority and its marketing strategy. If the Government had speculated with the exchange rate in similar manner it would be accused of gross irresponsibility. We all know that the AWC's money and debt belongs to the grower, but this is somehow being ignored and I want to know why. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister today in the other place is bringing down a statement regarding the fact that the Government is going to guarantee the borrowings raised by the Australian Wool Corporation before 1 July 1992 and interest on those borrowings. The Government has agreed to provide the guarantee as one of several measures concerning the reserve price for wool. I believe that in this instance the Government is trying to appease the Wool Corporation and the growers. If we accept that we are dealing with a fairly normal situation of supply, demand and price, as I indicated earlier in my speech, it is therefore absolutely imperative that the reserve price should have been held at the level of 870c per kg and that the levy should have been raised to 25 per cent as the industry requested. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the lowering of the floor price is both unnecessary and catastrophic for the scheme, its future operations and the orderly marketing of the Australian wool clip. The decision to intervene in the wool industry's marketing system has slashed $600m of growers' money off the value of wool that they own in stocks, $10 billion off the value of wool growing capital invested by wool growers, and around $500m off the value of wool held in stock by international processes, and it has cost the Australian economy a projected $3 billion in export earnings over the next five years. Those to me seem very sad figures indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, Senator Boswell. They are very bad. Nowhere has it been demonstrated, as distinct from asserted, that were the offered price for Australian wool to be lowered, there would be any kind of direct and significant demand response. Further, and more importantly, it has not been shown that any such response would ensure that gross income to the industry would increase or even be maintained. The industry's recommendations should have been accepted and not the Government's, because it is the woolgrowers who have a cash investment of more than $2 billion of their own money in the Australian Wool Corporation stockpiles; the government has none. Therefore, the action that the Government has taken to depreciate arbitrarily the value of these stocks without the formal agreement of a majority of the growers is iniquitous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This interference could ruin the reserve price scheme and ravage future orderly wool marketing. Other consequences could be that textile buyers will turn away from wool to synthetics. It will cause massive long term damage to our trade figures leading to higher interest rates. It can lead to bankruptcies throughout Australia among woolgrowers and small businesses. I believe that many of the woolgrowers have been complaining about this decision that the Government has made, and ultimately it will lead to the loss, as I said before, of $2 billion in export earnings over five years. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the market support fund, which is solely funded by growers, was not designed to prop up prices but, rather, to ensure a stable and regulated market to protect all parties, in particular the users, by giving them the confidence to expand their use of Australian wool. The decision of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and the Government to reduce the floor price to 700c and raise the levy to 20 per cent will be disastrous to growers and users alike. We have to realise that the speculation about the floor price has done market damage that may not be recoverable. The slightest doubt and lack of resolution will only give the buyers encouragement to continue their resistance to the floor price. Does the Minister not realise that the wool buyers have not operated the auctions while the Government threatened to reduce the floor price to 700c? Sir Willian Gunn said: `If the price is reduced now it will destroy the wool industry's credibility. The reserve price scheme won't be worth the paper it is written on'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has been a very experienced man within the wool industry, and he must speak with a great deal of authority. It is up to the woolgrowers now to get out and sell their wool, whether by private enterprise or through their auctions. Whichever way they do it, they must try to get out so that at least they themselves will see that they are getting some income from outside, rather than just having their wool sold at the auction with the Corporation buying all the wool. Let me quote from an advertisement put out by the woolgrowers explaining their situation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Retaining the floor price makes sense because the wool price today is the same as it was three years ago. Price is not a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Our customers want a stable price more than a rock bottom price. The very people who buy our wool have pleaded with Australia not to drop the floor price as constant change in wool prices threatens their viability as well. They do not want a return to `the bad old days' of the 1960s either. </PARA>
<PARA>I heard of a country-I think it was Germany-which sent a message to say that because it had bought wool at 870c, if its competitors were going to be able to buy it at 700c that would put it at a disadvantage when it is selling. So we can look at it either way. I do not think it is a very good decision at all. The 870c floor price is in line with longer term trends. The Government's proposed 700c, in real terms, is close to the lowest ever price for wool. Wool is not a necessity and constitutes only 4 per cent of the textile market. If the Government makes the wrong decision, wool processors will be financially burnt and will turn to synthetics, rejecting Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA> In meetings held in New South Wales and Queensland over the last couple of weeks, there have been unanimous decisions by the woolgrowers themselves to keep the floor price at 870c and to raise the levy to 25 per cent. It is my opinion that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and the Government should have listened to the advice of the woolgrowers. After all, the levy asked for is to be paid by the wool growers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind honourable senators that the wool tax, which totally funds the stockpile and wool promotions, is paid by woolgrowers and not by the taxpayers. I ask the Senate: Why did the Government feel it necessary to take this matter out of the hands of the woolgrowers? Raw wool price has little effect on demand for wool. It had little effect in the late 1960s and the early 1970s before the reserve price scheme began-when prices fluctuated wildly. </PARA>
<PARA> The academic economists' approach to the current wool industry battle is badly flawed. When a conservative floor price was set five years ago, nobody claimed that they could see any significant difficulties. Now, suddenly, the Government economists are gifted with vision which enables them and the Minister, Mr Kerin, to see three, four and even five years ahead. To claim substance for such distant projection is clearly a nonsense. The wool industry comprises woolgrowers, brokers, buyers and our customers, the overseas woollen mills. Are the majority of these people irrational?</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a letter which I cut out of the Australian Financial Review, signed by four Board members who were selected for the position on the basis of their financial, marketing or commercial expertise. They are Mr David Jones, the Deputy Chairman and Managing Director of the Fletcher Jones group; the Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and former Chief Executive of H. J.

This action by the Government will certainly result in a loss of confidence in the wool industry if the Australian Wool Corporation is not careful. I believe these are people who are certainly interested in any actions which would lower the income of Australians, particularly the income and the future of woolgrowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the vast majority of people in each of these areas was begging the Government to leave the floor price as it was, and to raise the levy to 25 per cent, should the Government have ignored them because of flawed economic theory? How could the Government possibly be acting in the national interest if it ignored the rational commercial judgment of the whole industry?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to remind honourable senators of something which I find I have often expressed to this chamber-that is, that we should be ever vigilant that we do not allow ideology on economic issues and crass politics to misplace the needs of people. That is what is happening in many industries and it is being done at the expense of many important sections of our community. Today I believe it is happening in respect of the economic survival of Australia's wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a copy of an amendment to the Bill to be moved by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Senator Boswell), which will be circulated to honourable senators and which I will be supporting. I will not read it all because of its length. However, it condemns the Government for its arbitrary intervention in the mechanisms of establishing a floor price for the 1990-91 season. I think I should just say that as a direct result of this, the Government has undermined confidence in the existing floor price and forced the Australian Wool Corporation to increase substantially its purchases in the last series of sales; and it has ensured that the Corporation will have to increase further its purchases at the 870c floor price at sales up to the close of the 1989-90 season and on-sell to the trade at a lower floor price, resulting in a further cost to growers. This has resulted in the spontaneous downgrading of the Corporation's credit rating, thereby seriously further endangering the capacity of the Corporation to function on behalf of the Australian woolgrowers. Some further points are made in the amendment and I feel sure that Senator Boswell, when he speaks, will say something about them. I will be supporting the amendment which Senator Boswell will move on behalf of National Party senators. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has, with a click of his fingers, nationalised the wool industry.

More than that, it displays a total disregard for the role, the power and the independence of the Senate. That is a shameful attitude on the part of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More important still is what the Government has unilaterally decided for the future of the wool floor price. For the first time in the 20 year history of the floor price scheme, the floor price will be cut.

The wool floor price scheme is now in tatters. Its credibility, its integrity, is totally shot to pieces. </PARA>

The signal has now been sent out-where there is an oversupply problem in the wool market, the Australian floor price will be cut. This new Labor-imposed lower floor price can be cut again at any time the floor price scheme is down. To all intents and purposes, the floor price now is finished. The Government will rue this day. The Minister will go down in history as the man wholly and solely responsible for wrecking the greatest of all Australian rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone believes that the setting of this new lower floor price is the start and finish of the matter then they are mistaken. There is no doubt that the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) will have to tighten its belt and get on with the job of selling wool and I know that Hugh Begg will do that. It has no option. It has that responsibility. I wish it well in its endeavours. It has been dealt a low blow by the Minister who has effectively told the wool industry that he has no confidence at all in it. I have confidence in it and in the people who work for it and who are appointed to its boards. I have confidence in Hugh Begg, the Chairman of the AWC, and in Chip Sawers, the Chairman of the Wool Council of Australia. I also have confidence in the wool industry. The growers of this country are prepared to stand behind their industry. If everyone on every side of the national and international wool trade-the growers, the buyers, the textile manufacturers, the international wool secretariat and the wool exporters-are prepared to stand behind the industry, which they are, in support of continuing the 870 cents floor price, who is the Minister to say that they are wrong? Why are the closet bureaucrats economists right and those directly involved in all aspects of the trade wrong? This industry has been worth to the Australian economy $6 billion annually in exports. For the past 16 years the industry has been stable and reliable, providing jobs directly and indirectly for 650,000 Australians. Why has this Minister been totally determined for weeks now to force down the floor price, to wreck this great industry? There is something crook in paradise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Corporation and the Wool Council have presented to the Government a detailed case for the maintenance of the 870 cents floor price and for the increase in the wool tax levy from 10 per cent to a maximum of 25 per cent. These Bills are directly related to that proposal. The Government has said no to the 25 per cent levy and has instead determined that the levy should be set at 20 per cent, and the floor price cut to 700 cents. I say to the woolgrowers and the wool industry as a whole that it is a credit to the industry that it is prepared to accept an upper levy of 25 per cent to support the floor price. It is a credit that it is prepared at its own expense to make such a sacrifice in the interests of the industry and the country. It is a damnable shame, a total outrage, that others are not prepared to demonstrate equal faith. We are faced with an extraordinary situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The last three weeks have brought countless wool experts out of the closet. The Australian Bureau for Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has been very specific in its predictions. While it would be foolish to have no faith in the Government's economic advisers, I believe that the people who best understand the wool industry are the participants, the people at the actual coal face. The economists can play the game on paper but the real market is moving and changing, and it is now played in the board rooms and in factories all around the world. I said yesterday that the determination of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Government to unilaterally force down the floor price is economic treason. I stand 100 per cent behind that view. This Government, and this Minister, have depreciated the value of Australia's greatest single export commodity by a staggering 20 per cent. If that is not economic treason, I do not know what is. Would the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, cut the price of motor cars by 20 per cent when the demand went off? No way in the world. It is usually the other way around. The price goes up or taxpayers' funding increases to prop up the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool is Australia's greatest single industry. It supports itself and does not rely on taxpayers' subsidies. It has done more for the Australian economy and society than any other single industry. Wool is the only product in which Australia leads the world. It is Australia's biggest, and it is the world's best. Yet this Government has dumped it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the impact of the Government's action by forcing down the floor price. The Government has ensured an immediate loss of faith in the Wool Corporation's credit rating and a loss in export income to Australia of up to $3 billion over the next five years. There will also be a cut in the growers' incomes of up to $5 billion over the same period. There will be an immediate cut of $600m of growers' money off the value of the wool owned by them in the AWC; an immediate cut of $10 billion of the value of wool growing capital invested by growers; an immediate cut of $500m in the value of wool held and stocked by international processors; an immediate threat to the livelihoods of 650,000 Australians directly or indirectly dependent on the wool industry; an immediate and serious threat to the local economics of hundreds of rural communities which depend heavily on the wool industry for their very existence. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were not bad enough, the speculation directly caused by the public comments of Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that the floor price should come down has cost growers at least $300m at wool sales since Easter. Corporation intervention in those sales was forced up from the low 30 per cent level in March to a staggering 90 per cent this week. That has cost growers $300m. It is entirely the fault of the Australian Labor Party and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, can take some of the blame. He had his hand on the till when it happened. </PARA>
<PARA> It does end there. There are about 500,000 bales of wool that will go to auction between now and 30 June. Obviously, with the floor price for the 1991 season set now-known to be set at 700c-no international buyers are going to come near the place. The Corporation will have to buy all of that wool an offer at the current minimum floor price of 870c a kilo and then on-sell to the trade at the lower 700c floor price. That will mean another loss of around $100m. The figures go on and on. We are not talking of a few thousand dollars here and a few thousand dollars there, we are talking about billions of dollars. It is not the Government's money. It is all growers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the great tragedies. The growers are prepared to pay a higher wool levy than the Government will allow so as to ensure the integrity of the floor price. But no, the Government has got to shove its nose in and mess up the whole industry and socialise it. That is what this Government is about. It tells the industry, `No, you cannot increase the tax on yourself, even if you want to. Instead, we will intervene. We will wreck the floor price scheme for you for the first time in 20 years. We will depreciate the value of your product on world markets by 20 per cent and we will cost you hundreds of billions of dollars in lost income. So you should be grateful'. Senator Button said yesterday that the woolgrowers should be grateful. What a ridiculous statement. What an outrageous state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has totally rejected the wool industry's submission in support of the maintenance of the 870c floor price. For some reason the Government is absolutely determined to cut the floor price against all the best advice available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The Minister has been talking down the floor price for weeks. Now he has further devalued the close of season sales by actually setting the next season's floor price at the end of May instead of at the beginning of July. The Minister has single-handedly wiped off hundreds of millions of dollars from growers income and Australia's national economy. It is unbelievable and incredible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even the non-grower members of the AWC Board and Senator Bjelke-Petersen referred to those-men chosen specifically for their financial, marketing, and commercial expertise-are unanimous in their view that the floor price should be kept at 870c. They know what they are talking about. These people do not represent penny-ante companies. They are not fools. When it comes to product, price and marketing these people are highly successful in their own right. The managing director of Fletcher Jones and Staff Pty Ltd, one of Australia's biggest companies and one of the best suit manufacturers-I wear them all the time; the Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, Ernest Barr; the Chairman of Nestle's Australia Ltd, Tony Whatmore; and the Managing Director of an investment bank, Bob Douglass, are all prominent and respected business people who have put their name on the line for an 870c floor price. So why is this Government so determined to dump the industry, especially given that up to the Easter break in sales there was every sign of the market improving. </PARA>
<PARA> Countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Taiwan and West Germany were increasing their purchases. The amount of buying by the Corporation in the March quarter was down to between 20 and 30 per cent. The problems that existed in the market were not there because the floor price was too high. There is no evidence to support that at all. The problems predominantly existed because China, Russia and other Eastern bloc countries were having some types of exchange and reserve problems. For various reasons, Japan had cut its purchases by around 30 per cent compared to last season. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the President of the Wool Council of Australia, Chip Sawyer, who is now in Tokyo, the Japanese will need to buy wool within a week. They will probably have to buy it today or tomorrow. If they do not buy it today or tomorrow, the mills will close. The weavers will have to shut down. In other words, the Japanese are on the point of re-entering the market at 870 cents, and now such plans have been put in chaos. On top of these factors, as we know and as the industry accepts, we have seen a period of record production in Australia for the past three seasons-to 1,000 million kilos of wool. All these factors have combined to increase the difficulties for the industry, but they are not-I repeat, not-directly related in any way to the floor price and they were not foreseeable. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry believes that they are difficulties that can be overcome. Unfortunately, the Government does not share that view. It refuses to support the industry. The industry believes it can break into other markets and increase the overall demand for wool. This cannot happen overnight. No wool importer or spinning mill can flick a switch and take up the 2.5 million bales of wool that Australia has in stock. Factory production has to be planned; garments have to be designed; factory runs have to be programmed; and markets have to be fought for and won. It will require hard selling, promotion and research. That is the positive way: expand your market and hold your nerve. Anyone in the selling industry will tell us that. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has panicked. It has dropped the floor price, restricted the levy to 20 per cent, planning a fire sale for quick clearance not of the Government's stock but of the Australian growers' stock. The Government, aided and abetted by the media, which seems to be the fount of all knowledge on matters relating to wool, has unilaterally determined that the floor price is too high. I wish the media would take its responsibilities seriously and not accept the line handed out by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. Why do media representatives not stick their heads out the door and ask a few farmers about the situation? The International Wool Secretariat, which no doubt, according to the media and the Government, does not know what it is talking about, of the current floor price has said:</PARA>
<PARA>The current floor price in terms of major consuming countries is generally considered by the trade not to be a limiting factor in fibre choice. </PARA>
<PARA>The Secretariat further states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that a modest reduction in the floor price would increase the demand, and a major reduction is unacceptable. It would mean a significant and immediate devaluation of the raw wool stocks as well as the stock of wool along the textile pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA>The 870c floor price was set two years ago. It is interesting to note that in 1987 the Minister for Primary Industry gave the industry the right to determine the floor price. When the industry determined the floor at 870c for the 1988-89 season the Minister did not complain. Did he complain when the floor was reconfirmed at 870c for 1989-90? He said not a word. Now he says that economic circumstances have changed, the floor is too high and the industry is being irresponsible for wanting to maintain it. The truth is that in real terms Australian wool today is almost 40 per cent cheaper than it was two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> By undercutting the floor by 20 per cent the Government has effectively cut the real value of wool by 60 per cent compared to what it was two years ago. The international market has accepted the 870c floor. No-one has successfully proved that lowering the floor will result in substantially increased demand. No-one has substantially proved that the present level of the floor has caused a fall in demand. The Government has its priorities all wrong. It has listened to the advice of the economic bureaucrats rather than accepted the advice of the economic and commercial experts directly involved in the industry, both here and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now looking at a most extraordinary situation. The Government is going to bite the very hand that feeds it. Because of its shocking economic policies, the Government and Australia has come increasingly to depend on the foreign earnings of our great primary and resource industries, of which wool is an undeniable leader, to keep our economy afloat. Without commodities like wool this country would be totally broke. It is as simple as that. Yet the Government is now actively undermining the very viability of this great industry and is therefore further threatening the extremely fragile state of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> If nothing else, the decision of this Government will destroy for all time the credibility of the floor price scheme and will cause immediate and dramatic chaos in many areas of the wool industry chain. Forward orders will be cancelled or have to be discounted, meaning that weaving mills, manufacturers and exporters will have their stocks devalued. Now that the floor price has been lowered, up to 50 per cent of our top customers could go bankrupt. The level of discounting and cancellations will be devastating as everyone in the middle of the wool pipeline will want some type of compensation. The 2.5 million bales of wool held in stock by the AWC will now have to be discounted. International buyers will be tempted to stay away from the market every time stocks build up, knowing that at any time this Government could cave in and refuse to support the floor. The wool market will experience dramatic swings in price. It will be like playing Russian roulette-the type of selling and buying that is in nobody's interest. Factories, weavers and spinning mills will not know what the next shipment will cost or whether their competitors will hit the market at the right time and leave them disadvantaged. Already, the private treaty wool merchants are facing problems. About half the nation's woolgrowers are facing immediate cuts of up to 50 per cent in their incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the woolgrowers who have a stake in the industry, but the thousands of shearers who service it. Those are the people Government senators should be concerned about. No-one seems to give them a second thought in this Parliament. They have rightly shared in the prosperity of the industry, with better conditions and better awards. If graziers' incomes are cut, then this Government is not only putting the wool industry under pressure, but it is also placing under threat shearers' and truck drivers' hard-won conditions and awards and conditions. Entire local economies will be hit. Many rural towns are heavily dependent on the wool industry for their very existence. We are, simply and tragically, facing a grave situation here, which I am certain the Government has not fully appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> I began by saying that we had been placed in an extraordinary position of having to debate a piece of legislation that is central to the future of the wool floor price, which has now been determined by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It is an appalling situation. The Government is treating the Senate with total disregard. It should have brought on this set of Bills well before the determination of the wool floor price. It had plenty of time to do so. The Bills went through the House of Representatives two weeks ago. Why were these Bills not presented in the Senate earlier? The answer is that the Government does not care a jot for the wool industry, nor is it particularly keen on democratic and parliamentary processes. Weeks ago it determined that, come hell or high water, it would force down the floor price, and irrespective of the wishes of or submissions from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be to this Government's everlasting shame that it has not supported the wool industry. John Kerin will long be remembered as the Labor Minister who destroyed the credibility of the wool floor price scheme and who jeopardised the entire future of the wool industry, just as he did with the wheat industry. Beef producers should be quaking in fear to see what this Minister has in the pipeline to wreck their industry. They are next in line. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin, the Government, the bureaucrats and the academics should keep the score. They should let the wool industry and our other rural industries, the major money earners for Australia, play the game. They will regret this intervention until their dying day. I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the one that went into the House and was amended to become the one that is now before us. We are simply removing the House amendment. The Government supported the amendment that we are now overturning in the House. It supported it because it recognised that there is a discrepancy between the remuneration for a Whip in the Senate and the remuneration for a Whip in the House. It seemed to us entirely reasonable that the Whips in both the House and the Senate should be remunerated at the same rate. Whatever might be said in the House about the numbers of members to be managed by Whips could be countered by an argument in the Senate that, while the number of senators is fewer, nonetheless there are more frequent and longer sittings and, indeed, in a non-government majority chamber, a hung chamber, there is a more difficult job of greater complexity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seemed to us entirely appropriate to at least put the Whips on the same rate of remuneration. It also seemed to us-and I know this has attracted some comment-that the Whip in the Senate of a recognised non-government party of at least five members not otherwise specified ought to be remunerated at the rate that applied for such a classification in the House. Thus it was that we in the House amended this Bill in anticipation of such an amendment arising when the Bill came here. In order to speed its passage, anticipate the change, we made that amendment. What we now think is the appropriate course of action is to reinstate the original amounts but on some very clear understandings between the parties. The understandings would be that the anomaly is still recognised and that the principle of what we sought to achieve remains and needs to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The best way of achieving that is to refer this matter back to the Remuneration Tribunal because once we start altering some classifications in a multiclassification scale the obvious fact that arises is that the relationship of the altered classifications to other classifications has changed and that may, in itself, create some further anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless one makes a comprehensive analysis of the whole of the classifications and considers the interdependence and the relationship between them, the overall cause of justice might not be served. Justice would be done for Whips, but if we adjust upwards the remuneration for Whips we may throw out that of other classifications and justice may not be done for those classifications. On the basis, we believe that the whole of the classification table should be referred back to the Remuneration Tribunal and that we should ask the Remuneration Tribunal to review the whole of the table and reassess what the right relativities might be between all those classifications. </PARA>
<PARA> We should indicate to the Tribunal that when it has made that determination we would accept that determination, but that the date of operation for the newly determined classifications should be today's date, so that it would have the effect that it would have had for Whips had the amendment been made so that the wider cause of relativity justice is served as well. That may not have been the most elegant way of expressing what it is, but I have not had a long enough time to compose my thoughts in terms of elegance, but in terms of the principle I think it meets the point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that honourable senators have been able to understand what the amendment actually is in the circumstances. It appears on page 17 of the photocopy of the Renumeration and Allowances Bill that we have been working from since approximately 1 a.m. today. The effect of the amendment is that we go back to the original Bill, which was amended by hand at the last minute. It went through in that amended form in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has now conceded that that particular amendment which was made by the Government after, admittedly, some discussions took place between representatives of all parties has created anomalies. We readily agree with that because it was the Opposition that identified the sorts of anomalies that this created. The Opposition certainly agrees with the principle that Whips in the Senate should be on the same basis as Whips in the House of Representatives, but when it was attempted in this unsatisfactory way to put that principle into effect on the run and under pressure in the greatest haste possible as a result of the way the Government has gone about this matter, it resulted in one of the most glaring anomalies, namely that the Whip in the Senate of a recognised non-Government party would be getting the same remuneration as the leader in the Senate of one of those parties, namely the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if the Democrats had a leader in the Senate, assuming that the former leader had won a seat in the House of Representatives and had become the leader of the Democrats as such, she would have been getting $23,000 as against the Whip of that Party in the Senate getting $5,000. There is a special provision, however, for the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, and that is the same figure as the figure proposed for the Whip of that Party. So that in itself would have been a most glaring and obviously anomalous situation if it had gone on. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, I believe, other significant anomalies. Clearly it is not possible for us in this chamber, by any amount of negotiation, to overcome those sorts of anomalies. Indeed, it would be totally wrong in principle-as it was wrong in principle to tamper with these relativities-for us to compound that by going on and trying to fix up these monopolies in some sort of behind closed doors exercise such as that going on today and tonight and maybe tomorrow, and then coming up with still an unprincipled and unsatisfactory decision. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is, as the Government has proposed, in our view preferable in the circumstances-and I do not think there is anything to be greatly preferred about this whole exercise-to go back to square one and refer it to the Tribunal. That is what the Opposition's case is-that the Tribunal ought to be given the decision in these matters, that is, it should not be made by the Parliament. We should send it back to the Tribunal. We will all agree that one principle is one principle. What the Tribunal does is for it to decide, but we will agree on one view to put to the Tribunal in relation to this schedule of office holders of the Parliament-that the Whips should be getting the same in both chambers. Presumably that should apply to Deputy Whips, but that is also for the Tribunal to decide. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Tribunal decides on that, it will have to decide on relativities between whatever figures it decides on and the leaders and deputy leaders of parties and so on. For those reasons the Opposition will support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the amendment introduced by the Government. Senator Cook has outlined the exercise I think fairly clearly. The history of it, of course, is also reasonably well known. The proposition that I know the Government Whips and others have put to the Government over time I put to yesterday, and at a meeting between all parties early yesterday it was agreed that the exercise that had gone on for so long whereby the House of Representatives had had, in terms of the remuneration of the Whips, a significant increase over that of the Senate, was no longer acceptable. There was no basis in terms of any argument and, in fact, in every other area there was parity. The acceptance of that principle by both the Government and the Opposition should take at least one step out of this exercise. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, presumably drawing on his industrial relations background, at a meeting this morning came up with what I thought was an elegant compromise, and that is that the correct body to work out all of these relativities is the Remuneration Tribunal. It is what the Australian Democrats have been arguing all along, and certainly we were not able; despite the fact that we were the ones who were suffering as a result of this particular amendment, to argue against that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the Government and the Opposition have in this chamber today now expressed the view, which doubtless they will put to the Tribunal, that there should be relativity between the Senate and the House of the Representatives in terms of the Whips' remuneration, which is a step forward. We obviously would be arguing where we link in, and we would expect that on the basis of the work that is done in this place that would be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate, as everyone knows, there is not a majority of any Party. This requires the Whips of the Australian Democrats to consult on a regular basis, certainly in the morning and throughout the day, with the Government and Opposition Whips to make sure that the program can run. That is not simply a matter of convenience; it is a matter of necessity. The numbers dictate that that occurs. This is a totally different context from that of the House of Representatives. I am sure that the Government Whip in the chamber would love to have the luxury of being the Government Whip in the House of Representatives, who merely issues directions and has things happen rather than having to negotiate them. That is the reality of this chamber. It will be the reality throughout this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal puts down an annual report. Hence the Democrats' position in Parliament in terms of numbers needs to be recognised directly by the Remuneration Tribunal. At any stage where that disappears-it will not be in this or next Parliament-the annual report will reflect that. The annual report reflects, for example, a special allocation for the National Party. Presumably if the National Party merged with the Liberals that would have to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the Tribunal also reflects, as it were, the shifting compositions of the Parliament. I think that is how it should be. It is supposed to be a Tribunal with regard to productivity, workloads and the rest, which will obviously change when the numbers change. So this is a reasonable way out of the problem. I suppose we could press on with the exercise if we wished to do so, but I think that the Minister's suggested way out is the most principled method of dealing with it, and hence we support it. </PARA>

Very strong views have been expressed by the Opposition that the decisions of the Tribunal on wage rates and relativities should be determined by the independent tribunal which has been established to consider these questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was very interested this morning to hear a notice of motion put forward by Senator Vanstone that the wages and conditions outcomes should be based upon the individual needs of enterprises. That is our problem at present, is it not? We have this enterprise and somebody-the boss-reckons that the needs of this enterprise mean that we should ignore the decisions of the Tribunal. That is why we have this problem. To be consistent, the Opposition should listen to what people are saying in the other areas of wages outcomes for workers in general. Perhaps the outcomes that are proposed will have similarly disconcerting effects as they are having in regard to this enterprise. Ultimately it comes down to a question of whether certain decisions of the Tribunal meet criteria that are accepted, approved criteria of this institution. But I am concerned that quite regularly we seem to be in the situation we are in now. We will continue to be in that situation. Senator Sheil says that the first vote that he cast in this place was to knock off a Tribunal recommendation. I do not know that it will be his last vote, but it will probably be his second last. That is a period of 15 years. I guess that if any of us are around in 15 years time, we will still have the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I gave the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) an indication that I would be asking one or two questions and I would certainly like an answer to them. It seems to me that the Remuneration Tribunal must have considered over some considerable period and at some considerable expense the question of the remuneration of those covered by its determination. My question to the Minister is: What did it actually cost for the Tribunal to go through that process of consideration and come to a determination, which now has been totally rejected? I put it to the Minister that I would suspect that the difference between the costs of what the Government is now proposing and what the Tribunal proposed is probably exceeded by the cost of the Tribunal's work, which has now been totally rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question relates to the timing of this whole process. I noticed that the Remuneration Tribunal's report was sent to the Government on 23 May-roughly a week before we considered this Bill last night. The Government's Bill evidently was so quickly cobbled together that the pages of my copy at least still have the date and time on which they were printed. I notice that the last page came off the computer at 8.45 last night. The Bill was evidently then rushed through the House of Representatives and it turned up here at around about midnight. The question is: How long did the Remuneration Tribunal deliberate over this matter and, by comparison, how long did the Government take to cobble together the Bill that is before us now? I suspect that it was cobbled together in a matter of a couple of hours. By implication, it seems to me very likely that not nearly sufficient consideration has been given to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To the first question can I say: It is impossible to give a figure of the cost in money terms of the Remuneration Tribunal arriving at a conclusion, which was one element of a comprehensive submission that has featured in several submissions over several periods in the past. The question of whether there should be a permanent link between the salary of members of parliament and a benchmark, be it an index such as the cost of living index, the average weekly earnings index or the average award rates index, or a link between a public sector wage scale or salary scale which might be deemed appropriate is not a new issue. It has been canvassed several times and it has been before the Tribunal on many occasions. Its refinement of its consideration of that point would be spread over a series of years. To provide a costing would be like trying to unscramble an omelette. It would be very difficult to isolate it or, indeed, if in a discreet hearing or a discreet consideration of a broad submission one could in fact identify the cost of that element of deliberations. I cannot provide a costing, for those reasons, and I understand the political point that was made. That is the Australian Democrats' political point, it is not our political point. I think that Senator Coulter would understand, given the explanation I have made, that to try to provide a costing is indeed impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question that Senator Coulter raised was a question of how long we took. While the tones in which you raised that question were critical, I am not entirely sure whether Senator Coulter was not paying us a compliment that, indeed, we are very productive, and we are able to work reasonably quickly and produce legislation with the speed and alacrity that the constituents of this country would like to believe governments operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter asked how many hours it took, or how soon was the Bill ready. The sequence of events are on the public record. The Government made available to the Remuneration Tribunal its submission last week, as I recall Tuesday evening, and the Tribunal handed me a decision based on our submission and the other submissions that it had heard. I had a decision handed to me on Monday evening. That is indeed a very quick turnaround from the Tribunal. These questions have been before the Tribunal, a lot earlier than those occasions I have just now referred to, because the Tribunal made a determination before the election not to proceed further on the submissions that it then had about these issues. Had it proceeded before an election, it would have committed an incoming government, and it wanted to see the election out of the way so that a new government could express what views it might wish to express on the basis of the old submissions. The fast turnaround on this occasion has to be seen against the background of previous submissions that the Tribunal had and its familiarity and considerations with those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of Senator Coulter's question related to how quickly did the Government operate, and this may well be where the compliment is implied. We operated quickly because this session of parliament will draw to a conclusion today, I hope. If the Tribunal's decision were to be upheld or if the Tribunal's decision were to be disallowed it would be entirely appropriate for the Government to act quickly in order to provide an opportunity to take either one of those two courses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, do you know who that sounds like? When we were in Cuba, as members of the Australian Parliament, we travelled to and from the conference in buses. We found that some of the representatives of the Third World countries-where there are great problems-travelled in stretch limousines to the conferences and did not deign to get on the buses. When we asked them why they did that they said, `Spoils of office. We are not going to be here long enough, senator. We grab all we can while we are in office-the spoils of office'. The statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations was an appalling admission of the way he sees the situation while he is in government. I am not surprised. The only surprise I have is that he so openly admits what he just said. I then ask: Is it a fact that the Ministers' expenses of office have been included in their salaries? Is it a fact that members' and senators' expenses have not, but that the Ministers' expenses of office have been included in the salaries?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be drawn by the other comments. Let me just go to the question and answer that. The ministerial salary has been adjusted by taking the ministerial allowance, which constitutes the salary. The expense of office allowance, which is an expense allowance for Ministers and which has been taxed since our taxation amendment in, I think, 1985 and which therefore lost half its value, is taxed as ordinary remuneration.</PARA></TALK.START>

But the way in which we have made the adjustment is to combine the expense of office allowance and the ministerial allowance and apply the same increase in percentage terms to that figure, operating from the same date and phased in in the same manner as that applying to members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to combine both the salary and the taxed expense of office allowance was a decision made on the basis that there is really now no difference because, as all members of this Parliament know, in the use of electoral allowance, for example, one expends the electoral allowance and beyond the electoral allowance because that is required. In the case of Ministers, that same rule holds true. In fact, Ministers expend their expense of office allowance and more, as we all do in terms of our respective salaries. The reality is that it is just a salary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we believed it was proper and sensible to reflect that reality. The implication of that is that Ministers, as with other positions related to Ministers, such as the Leader of the Opposition and other leadership positions, have superannuation contributions based on the new rate. I am not sure what point Senator Walters wishes to draw attention to, but that in this sense means that there is a deferral of income-that part-but there is a reduced income at this stage while those contributions are being made. </PARA>

If my phrase was offensive to Senator Coulter, please consider that it was made in the face of a fairly base and crass allegation by Senator Walters. If I acted intemperately, I did. I could put it more elegantly, but the simple point is that when one is elected to government there are certain rights, privileges and responsibilities that are required. To complain from opposition about the exercise of those rights, responsibilities and privileges is an opposition complaint. The Opposition does not choose to be in opposition.

That is also not going to be included in salary for the same reason, I suggest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at what the Remuneration Tribunal said about salary entitlements, one wonders what this Government is on about. If one reads page 21 of the statement attached to the determination, one will see that at paragraph 86 the Tribunal reminded us that in 1987-88, as agreed at the 1987 conference, the Tribunal conducted a detailed examination and work assessment of the functions of members of parliament. So that was done in 1987-88. It went on to remind us that as a result of that work assessment, the Tribunal concluded that as at November 1988 the appropriate salary for members should be $67,000. I hope that those trade unionists in the Australian Labor Party take the time to read paragraph 86 which sets out what the work assessment was in November 1988. The Tribunal said that the appropriate salary should be $67,000 and that that salary should come in in three stages, but adjusted in accordance with the national wage decisions handed down by relevant authorities during the 1989 and 1990 years. No doubt it would be substantially in excess of $67,000. I do not know what the figure would be, but I presume it would be roughly $70,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, by way of this legislation, proposes to increase backbenchers' salaries by $3,300 from the period 1 January 1989, which is a rise of only 6 per cent over a period of 17 months. How on earth can back bench members of the Government accept that they are being fairly treated by their Government? In addition, back bench members are being deprived of superannuation entitlements under the provisions which Senator Walters and I referred to earlier, and are putting up with it. Is it any wonder that there was a complete revolt in Caucus? Of course, in the end, the Minister said, `If you revolt, you will get nothing'. So they caved in. I am sorry that they caved in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite apparent that the Minister has avoided Senator Lewis's question. I would like to give the Minister an opportunity to justify why members of parliament cannot include their electoral allowance in their taxable income for superannuation purposes while the Ministry and the officeholders of this Parliament can. That is an absolutely new principle that has been introduced into this Parliament. I am totally at a loss to understand the reasoning behind the Ministry availing themselves of this rise and not making it a universal practice across the Parliament. Perhaps the Minister in simple terms could explain to the Parliament why it has done this.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the Minister to reconsider his position, because it is a fundamental tenet of this Parliament that the Executive is responsible to the Parliament.

<PARA> If the Minister chooses not to do that, to treat the Parliament with contempt, then we on this side have to consider two options: either moving a censure motion against the Minister and the Executive for not following the charges of responsible government or amending the Bill so that fairness and justice prevails for the members of parliament. The Minister has three choices. Which does he want: A simple explanation of why he has behaved the way he has, which will solve the problem, a censure motion, or the Bill amended?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One point that I raised last night has not satisfactorily been dealt with either. I ask the Minister what was the purpose of transferring the operation of the Remuneration Tribunal away from the place where it logically belongs, the Department of Administrative Services, the Department that looks after the affairs of the members of parliament and others, and debasing it by sticking it in the Department of Industrial Relations at a time like this?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should first say that Senator Archer's reference to the Department of Administrative Services is in error. The actual department was the Special Minister of State's Department. It seemed appropriate to the Government that since matters of remuneration fall within the purview of the portfolio of Industrial Relations-that means that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which fixes wages and salaries for 90 per cent of the population, is within this portfolio-it would be appropriate not to treat remuneration for judges, for departmental secretaries and for members of parliament differently from that, lest the charge be made that there is special treatment for this category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was thought appropriate in those circumstances that the Department of Industrial Relations should be the administrative department. Having said that, I must also say, as I think is obvious to everyone, but which, given this discussion, needs to be clarified, that irrespective of what department it operates under, it is, of course, a statutorily independent body of government and it is not able to be directed by government. It makes its decisions based on the arguments and merits of the case that is presented to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unless anyone else has questions on the same area, I now ask questions on something else. Can the Minister for Industrial Relations tell me whether the employees in Ministers' offices now get performance pay, and whether a deal was done with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) which meant there could be large increases-indeed, up to 40 per cent and more to ministerial staff? Is that a fact?</PARA></TALK.START>

There are applications for it, I understand, and it is likely that this month or early next month the Commission may make a decision on whether performance pay should be awarded or not. If the Commission makes that decision, then how that is best reflected for other grades is a matter for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the decision the Government has made about ministerial and Opposition leadership staff is concerned, the Government has decided that that should be based on a merit review assessment, that people be placed in gradings based on merit up to a certain level and that the current remuneration that is paid to ministerial staff at the level where they do not receive overtime-that is, in consideration of the excessive hours of work that they are required to undertake-would be phased out and replaced by what the appropriate determination, assuming the Commission makes the decision to award performance pay, would be in that event. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a fact. The proposal is, as I have just tried to explain, that ministerial and Opposition leadership staff should go before the merit review panel and have their qualifications, experience, et cetera assessed by the merit review panel, and then they can be recommended for placement in a range that has a ceiling on it, I think at the level Senator Walters has just referred to. That way of doing things is typical of what is happening in the general work force in terms of award restructuring. The basis of award flexibility is that, where employees are multi-skilled or have undergone training for better qualification, that is a merit promotion path and a path along which they achieve better income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we have applied that yardstick, what applies to the general community, to ministerial staff and it therefore means that they have the opportunity of being assessed at that level. In terms of likelihood, I must say I think it is very unlikely that many of them would ever reach that level but it gives the Opposition and Ministers an opportunity to be more flexible in their choice of staff and look at specialist staff in specialist positions who might not otherwise be available to work for government because of the low remuneration that they would have got on a fixed scale had the old fixed scale remained. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I once again complete this answer by saying that that is the way in which award restructuring is being conducted in this country, a way which the Government has encouraged and the Industrial Relations Commission has supported. Increases can be obtained by training, by better qualification, by broadening of skills and by assessment on merit. </PARA>

Are the salaries of junior journalists attached to Ministers to rise from $55,000, which was the salary of parliamentarians, to $70,000 and some to $80,000?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The same principle I have just described for ministerial staff applies also to journalists employed by Opposition Leaders and Ministers. There is a higher ceiling for a media or a press officer who might be employed by the Prime Minister and a higher ceiling, but lower than the one applying to a media or a press officer of the Prime Minister, applying to a media officer who might be employed by, I think, the Deputy Prime Minister or the Treasurer and a lower ceiling for those employed by Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The objective of the ceilings is not to indicate what the income will be. It is to indicate that officers assessed by merit and qualification could be placed on a scale up to that level, which is not to say that they will be at that level.

<PARA> Furthermore, I am told by some of the Minister's senior colleagues that there is doubt now as to what Mr Crean's part in it was.

In view of the great public interest in this matter, the way it has been written up in the press, and the obligations the Minister bears to his colleagues in this Parliament, I think it is appropriate at this time that he tell the Senate just what the part of the ACTU has been in determining the salaries put to Parliament this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990, while they may be the last Bills that the Senate considers in this session, are probably amongst the most important. A number of speeches have already been made about these Bills in this place. I particularly refer to the speech by Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. It was a speech of passion and it outlined the enormity of what is happening in this legislation. But, more particularly, it outlined what has happened in recent weeks with regard to the wool industry in this country and the wool marketing system which was held in international high repute until now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Boswell's speech and the speeches by his National Party colleagues have been great speeches. They are important contributions to clarify what has happened. But Senator Boswell and his colleagues must realise that those speeches will be read in the context of the position which they have taken as members of the coalition. All that they have said about the scandalous approach of this Government, and the results of that scandalous approach in the demoralisation and destabilisation of Australia's greatest primary industry, is true, not just of the Government but of the Opposition. It is particularly scandalous that the coalition has buckled under to the very economic rationalist approach, which has motivated the Government's decision to press for and, finally, to act to lower the floor price for wool from 850c to 700c via its refusal to support the recommendations of the Australian Wool Council for a 25 per cent levy, which is what these tax Bills represent, and allow for a 25 per cent ceiling on a levy on wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA> By refusing that, and by bringing in legislation at 20 per cent several weeks ago, the Government signalled that it would have a lowering of the floor price. If the Australian Wool Corporation, the Wool Council of Australia and the responsible industry organisations and marketing organisations did not accommodate the Government it would, as it could under the Act, put forward, in the national interests, a reduction in that floor price. It was within the hands of the coalition to signal to the Government that that was unacceptable behaviour then, and not wait until it came into this chamber, after the fact, and to bemoan what has happened. If, like the Australian Democrats all those weeks ago, the Opposition had said no to Mr Kerin and had said that when the legislation got to the Senate where the coalition knew, because the Democrats had gone on record that we could refuse Mr Kerin's 20 per cent levy ceiling-we in this chamber could attach a request to these Bills that the House of Representatives reconsider and raise the levy ceiling to 25 per cent, as requested by the Council-if the coalition had accepted that responsibility on behalf of the industry, which the National Party members who spoke in this debate say they want to do, it could have been a completely different story and those speeches could have been made with full integrity. Instead the coalition made the decision to allow-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As evidence of the sort of activity that went on a few weeks ago I refer to a letter which was distributed to coalition members in order to assist them in writing to angry primary producers and woolgrowers, in particular, to explain the coalition's position. The letter, which is something which is often done in political parties to help with the flood of mail when one section of the community gets justifiably angry, implies that the Opposition had no alternative. One of the paragraphs says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The worst position for all sectors of the industry would be the possibility of the tax continuing at 10 per cent due to an impasse between the Senate and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The implication there is that we cannot act in the Senate because the Government might pull the legislation off. This is a common tactic in situations like this, particularly towards the end of session. Over this whole session we have been towards the end of the session-it having been only a four-week sitting in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The story that the House of Representatives was sitting for only a week was swallowed, or at the very least was perpetuated out in the community, particularly amongst the wool industry, by an Opposition which clearly knew better, as we all did, than that this Senate would sit for four weeks. It would do its work and, if it chose to review legislation and amend legislation, then the House of Representatives would come back as it regularly does. Since the transport office knew that it was coming back, I would have thought that the Opposition knew it was coming back. The Opposition hid behind the Government's program of the sittings of the Parliament and did not put forward a genuine argument except that it believes and supports, as we have seen in so much legislation, the thrust of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to make it clear at this point that the position of the Australian Democrats from the beginning on these Bills was, and still is, that the recommendation of the Wool Council of Australia for a 25 per cent maximum levy early in May, so that it could then make its decision with the Australian Wool Corporation about what the floor price would be, should have been supported and should have been put forward into this Parliament for legislation. If that had been done, then the speculation about the floor price would not have resulted in a withdrawal from the market of almost all buyers, that necessitating the Wool Corporation buying the vast bulk, in recent sales, of all that wool that has been on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, the Government made it clear that it challenged its own Wool Council and came forward with this particular legislation and, as I said, the Opposition acquiesced. </PARA>
<PARA> I now quote from the speech that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) made to the Wool Council conference in Roma on 23 May. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 I gave the power to set the floor price to the Australian Wool Corporation after consultation with the Australian Wool Council. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I made a mistake in believing the Corporation was strong enough to take purely commercial decisions about fundamental commercial issues, such as that level. I did not foresee the industry political pressure put on grower members of the board to push up the price. You will not doubt recall the NSW Farmers Association's demand for a 1,000c in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>He said further:</PARA>
<PARA> With the benefit of hindsight, we all made a mistake in not understanding that flexible exchange rates mean that it is impossible to stabilise the price of wool both in Australia and user currencies. (You may have noted some spectacular corporate and public sector crashes in recent times that have been related to change in the structure of our economy and overblown entrepreneurship.)</PARA>
<PARA>In that speech Mr Kerin expresses his lack of support for the Wool Council of Australia and the Corporation. The Wool Council was set up by legislation of this Parliament only three years ago and, as I have said, it made its proper recommendations to the Government. We established the Wool Council of Australia-an independent body-to act in the interests of that industry. It is a mixed body of grower representation and of outside representation being people with business and commercial expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this Government does not have confidence in its own established marketing system. We actually find a great deal of difficulty in seeing any consistency in the Government's approach to its own statutory bodies. As my colleague Senator Bell pointed out earlier this week, there is some conflict in a response given by Senator Collins to a question about the proposal of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to take certain actions within its own operation. Senator Collins, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if a statutory, independent national broadcaster is set up, it is expected that that broadcaster will operate with its own independent management which is responsible to its own board. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I would be very averse indeed to see any government of any political persuasion, as a matter of course, routinely interfering with decisions made by the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a case, I would have thought, for all of us . . . to wait until the Board determines, having considered what management wants to do and all the objections to it, what the programming decision will be. It is the Board's responsibility . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We find it quite strange that in that case the Government is prepared to stand by the independence of that statutory authority and yet in this case it is not prepared to stand behind this body, to accept its submissions and to provide it with the widest possible options-because that at the time was all it was. In fact, the Wool Council's submission to government-for which it was actually criticised by one of the speakers earlier in the debate-put a number of options, as quite appropriately it should have. It had not made its firm decision about the floor price. It was clear that there were options and everybody was still doing their calculations. To give it the widest possible options, it asked for a 25 per cent ceiling. This involves growers' money-as has already been pointed out-not taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not that the Council was prepared just to take a shoot from the hip approach. Some of its members are directors with relevant qualifications who were appointed on the basis on their ability to make rational commercial judgments, people whose names have already been mentioned in this debate: Mr David Jones, the Deputy Chairman of the Wool Council and Managing Director of the Fletcher Jones group, the Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and former Chief Executive of H. J. Heinz, Mr Ernest Barr, Nestles Australia Ltd Chairman Mr Tony Whatmore, and the Managing Director of investment bank Access International Pty Ltd Mr Bob Douglas. These people are conscious of their responsibility as members of the Wool Council who have been appointed for their marketing, financial and other special qualifications. Certainly in the case of Mr David Jones, as was evident in conversation with me earlier this week, he does not own a single sheep, although he uses a good deal of wool. They took considerable care to come to the best considered judgment they could. Very late in the piece, only early this week, they conveyed their final decision to the Minister as members making a commercial judgment. The Wool Council Board, in a letter to Mr Kerin said that its assessment was that it was very important to take a long term view and that the Government's expressed position-Mr Kerin's expressed position in Roma and in other places-was an incomplete interpretation of the past, present and future. It went on to point out that it is important in that exercise that the Wool Corporation, the responsible body, take on a long term stockholding role as one means of ensuring that past extravagances in the industry will not be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board's view is centred on the approach that there needs to be adopted a corporate and longer term view in developing policy strategies and plans for the Wool Corporation. It went on to expand its view that through the marketing system we have established in this country which, as I have already said, has a very positive international representation, our wool industry has been able to become part of the international fibre market and not just another rural commodity subject to wild swings of both supply and price. That is crucial to the long term future and to the ability of our industry to increase its share of the textile market. We have seen the downturns that have occurred as synthetics have become a much bigger part of the textile market internationally in recent decades. If the wool industry cannot, as the synthetic industry can on the world fibre scene, supply on demand-and people with business and commercial expertise point out that the just-in-time system which is now used widely in industry around the world means that supplies must be available with considerable speed as well as prices being reasonably well able to be anticipated-we must have a managed stockpile in this country. A letter from board members to Mr Kerin said:</PARA>
<PARA> In this way the Corporation can counteract the shorter wool pipelines of the customers which may well be the norm in the future because of the way business and industry operate, rather than simply a temporary phenomenon of the current record stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA>Those people did their figures and looked at what they thought was the realistic future. They pointed out that the stockpile would not be dramatically reduced very quickly but in their view many of the figures being bandied about were not accurate. On present indications, they said, the stockpile `would be well in excess of five million bales by the end of the 1981-82 season whatever the floor price'. They were writing to the Minister in an attempt to persuade him that the proposal of a 700c per kilogram floor price would not achieve a worthwhile result for either the industry or the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The members raised in their letter the question of external borrowings. We have been seeing as part of this debate considerable discussion about the fears of a deficit blowout as part of the motivation for a cut in the expectations of the wool levy and finally a cut in floor price. In an article in the Australian of 17 May Paul Downey said:</PARA>
<PARA> The fear among senior economic ministers was that the balance of payments deficit would blow out under the impact of a $2 billion fall in wool sales combined with a potential $4 billion debt incurred by the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>That view has been fairly clearly put forward and is evident in the Government's operation here. The Government made this decision because it wants a quick injection into the national coffers to pull back the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather staggering that it is one of our major national export industries that has to make this unfair contribution and to do so in the face of contrary recommendations by its own bodies-bodies set up by this Government to be responsible in the area. It has not been those high-flying entrepreneurs to whom Mr Kerin referred in the reference I made earlier who have had their external borrowings curtailed in recent years. It is the borrowings from overseas by private enterprise entrepreneurs, some of whom are in dire trouble, which have pushed up our current account deficit, our debt. They are now costing us almost $3 billion per year just in interest. The vast bulk of that is still coming out of the private sector. It is not those people who have been pulled up by this Government, but the woolgrowers of Australia on a short term proposition of a quick injection of funds. The Government wants those to come in at a lower price, using this as a brutal mechanism to restructure the industry. Fears have already been expressed about what might happen to other rural industries as a result of this crass way of doing things. When one has an industry which is prepared to restructure itself and to pay for that itself, there seems to be no justice and no rationality in the Government decision, certainly when one looks at the different way in which other statutory corporations have been treated by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is clearly not behind this industry corporation. Instability in price and supply in the future will be the result of what we have seen over recent weeks. I reiterate that if this debate had occurred in a different context, one which could have been set by the coalition, and earlier, the pressure would have been on the Government to listen more closely to the industry and to do what the industry was asking it to do. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the context in which the industry is being hit, this morning in the Age there are figures which demonstrate that farmers in Australia and New Zealand receive less than 10 per cent of their income in government aid, payments and support, compared to 75 per cent in Japan, 38 per cent in the European Community and 27 per cent in the United States. Those figures are demonstrated by an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report which has just been released. We all know that primary producers in this country do not operate on a level playing field. It is in this context that the Government is thumbing its nose at the responsible bodies of the wool industry in order to achieve a short term benefit for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry was prepared to levy itself and to build its own funds. It had top credit ratings available to it to undertake its own borrowings and it was totally prepared to take responsibility for itself. There has been Government interference in this exercise. I was fascinated to read an article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review by a former Leader of the National Party of Australia. The debate in this chamber today might have been very different if the former Leader were here instead of the present Leader of the National Party of Australia (Senator Boswell), who made such a magnificent if irrelevant speech in the light of his position in the coalition. Former Senator John Stone, in his column in the Australian Financial Review yesterday, pointed out that it is not really only woolgrowers' money that was prepared to be put into the 25 per cent levy. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the exclusion of the whole levy from taxable income now means that the Government's involvement in the process results in it . . . forgoing what would otherwise be a sizeable amount of revenue . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What a shame that that provision is a minor contribution to the 10 per cent of government type aid that our growers get compared to that received by primary producers elsewhere in the world. What about all the negative gearing that is available to all of those entrepreneurs who have put us in such a bad situation? I commend the cartoon in this morning's Australian to everyone as we debate this legislation. It shows a character who looks remarkably like the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) standing beside a farm fence with a gentleman carrying a bag marked `economist'. There are five sheep grazing in a rather lush paddock. The economist says to the gentleman who looks like Mr Hawke, `We've stuffed up everything else, let's stuff up the wool industry'. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the leader of the Government in the Senate. Are the Minister and the Government concerned about latest official statistics revealing a 12,000 increase in May in the number of Australians on unemployment benefit to almost 406,000 after four years of trending downwards? As the Government has continually pointed to lower unemployment rates as a mark of its alleged successful management of the Australian economy, what measure of success does the Government intend to use now that its disastrous policy of relying mainly on high interest rates has meant that, as the Australian Financial Review says today, the dole queue is longer than it was a year ago as business has stopped hiring. Will that measure of success be recorded bankruptcies, rising inflation, record foreign debt, record balance of payment deficit, falling investment in new plant and equipment, shattered consumer confidence or growing dole queues?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume is endeavouring to supplement Senator Puplick's question and destroy the essential purpose of it. If Senator Puplick looks at the Budget projections last year-I cannot recall them exactly-he will see that in respect of the employment situation it was anticipated in the Budget projections last year that as a result of the current economic environment there would be some marginal increase in unemployment. That is what the figures which the honourable senator points to represent. The Government anticipated that. Of course, we are concerned about it, but not surprised by it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as the other part of the question is concerned, which I might say larded up the essential point, I only point to the national accounts figures published the day before yesterday and, I think, a general recognition that the Government strategy is on track. If those national accounts figures had shown a different picture two days ago, the honourable senator would have asked whether we are in a recession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Administrative Services. My question is prompted by a newspaper report concerning the owner of a Gold Coast chocolate company who is stated to have indicated that he will defy a Commonwealth Government directive telling him not to use the Commonwealth coat of arms on his chocolates. Is there anything to prohibit the Commonwealth coat of arms being used for commercial purposes? If not, will the Government give consideration to the matter of prohibition of use so that our coat of arms does not fall into disrepute?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1729" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of background, I am informed that the Commonwealth coat of arms was granted to the Commonwealth Government by a royal warrant in 1912 and is used to signify Commonwealth Government authority and property. In response to the specific part of Senator Colston's question, there are currently no statutory sanctions in place to protect the arms. It has been preferred essentially to rely on community regard for respectful and dignified use of all national symbols. However, occasions do arise where private organisations use the arms without authorisation. When these instances are brought to the attention of the Government the organisations are formally approached, advised of the protocol surrounding the arms, and advised that their use is not in accordance with established practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This was in fact the procedure which was followed with Mr Garry Green, the owner of a Gold Coast chocolate company, to whom Senator Colston refers. On 10 April he was advised by my Department not to use the coat of arms on his products as it was not in accordance with the established practice. I gather from press reports I have seen that he intends to continue using it despite this advice.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, a few weeks ago I asked the Awards and National Symbols Branch of my Department, the group which is responsible for monitoring the use of the Commonwealth coat of arms, to consider legislative provisions to protect the coat of arms against inappropriate use. I expect its advice on options available to government by the end of June and will take action thereafter.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I draw his attention to the fact that in the first three months of this year Australia's foreign debt grew at the rate of $100m per working day, the great bulk of which was due to the need to finance Australia's continuing record balance of payments deficit. As servicing this record net debt of $123.6 billion now costs more than $1 billion per month and in view of the clear failure of the Government's policies to halt the continuing rapid rise in Australia's foreign debt, does the Government have any new proposals to correct the crisis situation its failed policies have produced?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, of course, is concerned at the level of foreign debt. The contributors to foreign debt include State governments, which owe approximately 15 per cent of that foreign debt, and that is an issue which I assume will be an agenda item at the forthcoming Premiers Conference; and statutory authorities, which owe 25 per cent of the foreign debt, and which I also assume will be a matter for discussion at the forthcoming Premiers Conference. The Commonwealth Government is now a net foreign currency creditor, making a negative 3 per cent contribution to that debt. In the Commonwealth situation, where we have enjoyed record surpluses in the last two years, the Commonwealth has, I think, played its part in dealing with the foreign debt issue. I can add nothing at this time to the references I have already made to the forthcoming Premiers Conference, but I will seek further details from the Treasurer in terms of any steps which might be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his comments about new measures to be taken in his buck passing exercise against the State governments and statutory authorities. I ask him once again: What policies does he have to halt the continuing rapid rise in Australia's foreign debt where in fact the bulk of that debt lies, which is in the requirement to finance our continuing record balance of payments deficit which is officially expected by this Government to bring continuing rises in our foreign debt at a time when overseas interest rates are rising? If the Minister does have a view on what this increased servicing cost is going to be, what policies does the Government have to bring this situation to a much more satisfactory conclusion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been through this issue on a number of occasions in discussing the composition of the current account deficit. The Government's strategy is designed to increase export capacity, to increase the level of exports and, by lowering demand, to reduce the level of imports. That is the only way the current account deficit problem can be handled. That, of course, will take time, but that is the Government's strategy. If one looks at the national accounts figures published earlier in the week one will realise that that strategy is working, albeit slowly, in terms of the contribution of net exports in those figures. I can add nothing to that at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support to accidents and incidents overseas later in 1988 and early in 1989 involving the new Boeing 737-400 series aircraft and reported subsequent restrictions placed on engine thrust levels by civil aviation authorities. Are any Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) jet engine operating restrictions in force in Australia for the Boeing 737-400 aircraft operated by one of Australia's domestic airlines? Has any decision been made by Australian authorities to require the provision of smoke hoods in aircraft to protect those on board from toxic fumes in the event of fire?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1730" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know of Senator Maguire's continuing interest in these issues. He has asked a whole series of questions relating to the safety and integrity of Australian aircraft over a number of years. The answer is somewhat technical so I will ask honourable senators to bear with me. I have been provided with the following information: Boeing 737-400 aircraft are fitted with CFM 56-3C engines, which are similar to the engines fitted to the B737-300 aircraft but which are capable of producing higher thrust. Engine fan blade failures have occurred on a number of Boeing 737-400 aircraft, including the British Midland Airlines aircraft involved in an accident at Kegworth on 8 January 1989 which killed 47 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Technical analysis and testing since that accident have shown that fan blade failures occur due to vibration associated with the use of higher thrust levels than used on similar engines fitted to the Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The United States of America's Federal Aviation Administration has placed limitations on the use of the CFM 56 engines fitted to Boeing 737-400 aircraft which limits the thrust to be used in order to prevent occurrences of the vibration mode associated with the fan blade failures.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire will be pleased to know that the FAA limitations have been incorporated in the flight manual authorised by Australia's Civil Aviation Authority for use by Australian operators of Boeing 737-400 aircraft. Since introduction of the limitations referred to, there have been no occurrences world-wide of fan blade cracking or failures due to this cause. The effect of the thrust limitation is to reduce the payload of the aircraft on limited runways. This situation rarely occurs in Australia and the economic impact of these restrictions is therefore minimal. The reliability of all engines within the limitations now imposed meets all safety criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Australian requirements for the provision of smoke hoods in aircraft to protect passengers from toxic fumes in the event of fire, I am advised by the CAA that the background to this matter relates to an aborted take-off of a Boeing 737 on 22 August 1985 at Manchester Airport after the disintegration of rotating engine components, which is an experience I hope that none of us will ever have. Although the aircraft was brought safely to a stop, the resulting fire prevented the evacuation of passengers from the aircraft and 54 people did not survive.</PARA>
<PARA> A recommendation of the accident investigation report was that the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority should urgently give consideration to the formulation of a requirement for the provision of smoke hoods and masks to afford passengers an effective level of protection during fires which produce a toxic environment within the aircraft cabin. The United Kingdom Authority accepted this recommendation and gave urgent consideration to the formulation of requirements for the design and provision of smoke hoods to passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1987, in the light of major collaborative research carried out by the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and France, a decision was made by these countries in unison that a mandatory requirement for the carriage of smoke hoods could not be justified at that time. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom has continued with the completion of its specifications for a smoke hood, defining both the equipment performance and installation requirements. But, to date, no smoke hood has been shown to meet these standards.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the accident investigation report recommended that the proposed requirement for cabin crew smoke hood protection be extended to include training for crew, donning and use during aircraft emergency evacuations associated with a fire, and smoke threat during the evacuation. The Civil Aviation Authority has monitored developments in this area, along with other leading aviation regulatory authorities. On 20 December 1989, the Australian Civil Aviation Authority amended requirements for protective breathing equipment for flight crew members and required that on and after 1 January 1991 a pressurised aircraft engaged in passenger transport services must be equipped with protective breathing equipment units for use by the cabin attendants.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In general terms, telephone interception in Australia is regulated by a law of this Parliament, which requires that for an interception to be lawfully undertaken it must be done in accordance with a warrant obtained from a Federal Court judge. That is the only circumstance in which a law enforcement agency in Australia can undertake lawful interception of a telephone call. I seek Senator Bell's concurrence in providing him with a more detailed answer in relation to the claim he is making that Telecom has been intercepting telephone calls to check on the injury status of those who are seeking workers compensation. I think that was the general question. Under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act-this is only a very general statement; I am not talking about the particular instance that Senator Bell raised-telephone interception can be undertaken only to further investigate crime, not in order to see whether a civil claim, for example, is justified. That is a broad answer to the question. I will certainly seek further more detailed information to the first part of Senator Bell's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of the question, the particular type of activity to which he refers I believe is undertaken by Telecom in order to judge the quantum of telephone call time. For example, when a person complains that he has received a bill which is inordinately large in comparison with what he believes to have been the use of the telephone, a device can be attached to the telephone exchange somewhere, I guess, which enables Telecom to check on the duration of calls. It has nothing to do with the actual substance of the messages passing over the telephone line. I believe that a tracing machine of some description can be used in relation to claims of harassment, obscene calls or calls in which subscribers are threatened. I will seek further advice in relation to both parts of Senator Bell's question and provide him with an answer as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the Australian Government's attitude to the terrorist operation mounted against Israel yesterday?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that 16 Palestinian guerillas, in two speedboats, equipped with rockets, machine guns and anti-aircraft missiles, raided the Israeli coast yesterday. A Libyan ship is reported to have assisted in the attack. Fortunately, the attack was a complete failure, with four of the guerillas being killed and the remaining 12 being captured by Israeli security forces. No Israelis were killed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government condemns this act of terrorism. It is a further blow to the peace efforts and clearly will harden Israeli attitudes. I understand that the member of the PLO executive committee, Abu Abbas, who is also the head of the Palestinian Liberation Front (PLF) has claimed responsibility for the operation. Abu Abbas is reported to have been responsible for the attack on the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985. The PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, has said that the PLO itself was not involved in the raid but his denial will scarcely be credible if he does not actually firmly dissociate the PLO mainstream from the group responsible for the operation.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the United States acknowledges that yesterday's attack was an act of terrorism and that Abu Abbas's PLF is part of the PLO. In consequence, the United States is examining its attitude towards its dialogue with the PLO which started after the PLO's chairman, Yasser Arafat, renounced terrorism, recognised Israel and accepted the United Nations Security Council's resolution No. 242 at Geneva in December of 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government reviewed its position on the PLO after Mr Arafat's Geneva statement. One of the main consequences was that the Palestine Information Office in Canberra was allowed to change its name to the PLO Office. In subsequent correspondence on this point with a PLO representative in Canberra, Mr Kazak, in February 1989, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has welcomed the positive development of the PLO's approach to the peace process as expressed by Mr Arafat in Geneva and trusts that its commitments are pervasive and permanent. You will appreciate that any retreat from commitments in the future will necessarily result in a further review of the Australian Government's position. Our willingness to make the kind of gesture embodied in our acceptance of the renaming of our office is very much contingent on both the letter and the spirit of these commitments continuing to be observed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already referred to the national accounts figures looked at over the last two quarters which show a net contribution to gross domestic product from exports and declining imports. Those figures are consistent with Government strategy and, indeed, the outcomes are consistent with government strategy. In the latter portion of the last calendar year the Government was asked a number of questions in the Senate about these issues and even the Budget projections. In answer to those questions the Government indicated that it thought that, for example, this situation would arise as a result of tight monetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I very much regret that consumer confidence, if it is correct, is the level which Senator Crichton-Browne points to in his question-that is, to use the words in his question, `not a beautiful number'. Nonetheless, the figures published on Tuesday show that the economy is still growing in excess of one per cent. I forget the other part of the honourable senator's question. I think it related to improving export performance and so on. Well, that is happening, unfortunately, at a slower rate than we would hope.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figures published last week indicated that, as a result of investment in calendar years 1988 and 1989, the productive capacity of the Australian economy had increased by 10 per cent. Those were the figures which, in a sense, comment on the results of the investment boom-if I can call it that-in those two years. It was anticipated that investment would fall off in this part of this year. That is happening. I think it is significant to look at where it is happening. The investment fall is not as high in manufacturing. I think the predictions about investment in manufacturing are actually quite reasonable. It is not a source of great comfort but, I think, if we look at the differential impacts of changed investment patterns on industries, we see that the mining sector is considerably down, but the manufacturing investment intentions remain reasonably strong. I said the other day that the investment picture is patchy. I do not retreat from that. I think that is a pattern which was anticipated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier in this Question Time, I was asked a question about the increase in unemployment in the month of May. I do not regard it as strictly relevant to Senator Crichton-Browne's question, but it has just been drawn to my attention that the Budget Papers anticipated an unemployment rate of 6.25 per cent at the end of the current financial year. This is up slightly from some monthly figures. This financial year, for example, the 6.5 per cent is down from the actual figure achieved in 1988-90 of 6.6 per cent. That is not a great variation. These figures were all before honourable senators in the Budget context, including predictions about investment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should make it clear to Senator Jones that the control of pollution from ships, especially oil spills, is in the hands of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, and not Mrs Kelly. Of course, when beaches are damaged-as they certainly were in this case-and quite a number of penguins are killed because of the oil spill, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories must maintain an interest. Certainly the damage has occurred and there has been, I think, the death of 75 penguins, as I read a couple of days ago. A number of ships have been identified as the possible source of the pollution. Officials of the Department of Transport and Communications have been to those ships and have taken some samples of their oil. Those officials are comparing it with the substances they have found on the beaches to see whether we can positively identify that ship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even if there is a positive identification, there remain some difficulties in terms of attempting to do something about it. The nationality of the ship and whether or not that ship's flag state is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships is going to be a problem. Of course, we must also establish whether or not the spill took place in waters of Australian jurisdiction. Any foreign vessel that is caught discharging in territorial waters can face a penalty of up to $250,000 for the owner or $50,000 for the master.</PARA>
<PARA> Oil spills are dealt with now under a plan called the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil. The Commonwealth-State administrative arrangements provide that the primary responsibility for cleaning up beaches and foreshores rests with the relevant State government authority, usually a port authority. The Commonwealth Government will continue to work with the States to see whether we can prevent these oil spills. The Department of Transport and Communications will pursue this matter with vigour.</PARA>

Given that one of the central recommendations of the Garnaut report-that Australia phase out tariff protection by the end of the decade-was received by the Government with much acclaim, will the Minister explain, firstly, the concerns of Dr Blewett, as expressed in the Sydney Morning Herald today, that Australia should hold onto its tariffs and bargaining chips; and, secondly, whether the expression of dissent on tariff reduction by members of the Government, including Dr Blewett, is a sign that the Hawke Government is not capable of making the tough decisions and is tending away from deregulation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson can draw all sorts of extraordinary implications from Dr Blewett's comments if he likes, but they are extraordinary implications which he has sought to draw. Let us get the facts correct. The Garnaut report was commissioned by the Government. The Government has to respond formally to the Garnaut report and will be doing that in time. The issue of the reduction of tariff protection to zero by the year 2000, which I might say is Dr Garnaut's view, argued with some cogency, is never a view which has emanated from the Opposition or anybody else in terms of discussing the levels of tariff protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has had a steady commitment over its life to reduce tariff protection. I think the figure is something in the order of a 37 per cent reduction in tariff protection across the board by 1992 which, when put together with the Whitlam tariff reduction of 25 per cent in 1974, is a reduction of something in the order of the mid-sixties. I cannot do that sum on the last day of the sitting of the Senate; I cannot add those two figures together. It is something in the order of the mid-sixties. That is the only reduction in barrier protection which has taken place in the last 15 years. Nothing at all happened when the coalition was in government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is yet to determine future levels of tariff protection. The regime in respect of tariff protection until 1992 has been announced. The Government has yet to determine future levels of tariff protection post-1992. Whatever they are, they will be down. Industry knows this; the motor vehicle industry knows this, and so on. In respect of Dr Blewett's comment that the Government should hold on to the tariff levels as bargaining chips in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round, with respect to my colleague, that is always a view which has emanated from trade Ministers involved in multilateral trade negotiations. When Doug Anthony was around he used to talk about holding on to bargaining chips in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round. The only thing that I can say happened with certainty is that nothing happened in terms of tariff reductions in the whole period of his life as a trade Minister. I do not know whether we ever cashed any chips in at all. Certainly Australia did not make much progress on tariffs in those years.</PARA>
<PARA> It may be that a reduction in tariffs, irrespective of bargaining chips and the GATT round, might be a useful end in itself in respect of the Australian economy, irrespective of any bargaining which might take place in GATT. That is a view which I basically subscribe to, but I do not necessarily agree with any formula about this. I think that there should be a pragmatic approach to it, which the Government has followed and I believe will continue to follow in the next few years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of these further concerns that have been raised, principally in the Sydney area adjacent to the airport. These concerns show a continuing lack of understanding of how the EIS process operates. I confirm that Thiess has won a $5.4m contract on a competitive tender for taxiway pavements at KSA. For the sake of completeness, I mention that it has also been contracted to undertake pavement work at the domestic terminal at a value of $11m, and I am pleased to say that it is going to extend the apron at the international terminal at a value of $6m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thiess has been contracted by Kinhills to provide it, as the EIS consultants, with technical advice on the construction methods that could be used to build the third runway at Sydney Airport. I expect to hear a lot more about these continuing concerns prior to 31 July when the EIS draft is released. They show a substantial, fundamental lack of understanding about the EIS process. Kinhills is required to prepare a technically excellent document covering the fundamental question of building a third runway at Sydney Airport. Therefore, it has to draw, necessarily, on the widest possible advice and expertise to put that report together.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason that Kinhills has contracted Thiess to provide it with technical advice on constructing the third runway at Sydney Airport is that Thiess built the second runway-that is, the existing runway-at Sydney Airport. As a result, it would have more than an outside chance of knowing just a little about the technical problems of building runways at Sydney Airport. Frankly, I would have been amazed had Kinhills gone to anyone else for advice on constructing a runway at Sydney Airport other than this well-established Australian firm that has such an excellent record of construction. I am very familiar with a number of things that this company has built. I point out that Thiess is not the only contractor being used by the Federal Airports Corporation for works at Mascot. A number of other major construction companies have won competitive contracts for works at the airport.</PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that the Government can guarantee the integrity of the EIS process. As I said in response to similar concerns raised during a previous Question Time, it is a very open process. The draft will be available on 31 July. The Government has made available the sum of $100,000 to interest groups to provide for technical examination of that draft when it comes out. A three-month period of examination will be provided in which the draft EIS and the processes behind its being put together will no doubt be put through the wringer. It is a rigorous process. The legislation provides for that, and the EIS will stand or fall on its own merits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article by Graeme O'Neill, who, I might say, is one of the most thoughtful commentators on science and technology matters and the relationships between science and technology and industry, has drawn attention to this report. If I might just refer briefly to some of the conclusions of the report, they are simply these: Australia has enormous natural comparative advantages because of an abundance and diversity of raw materials; we have a good research base in raw material applications; and that that has not been transferred into industrial development for a variety of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report which Senator Crowley and the article referred to was commissioned by my Department and now that it is published it will be disseminated by the Department as widely as possible. It recommends that the Government should seek to focus attention in these areas: advanced ceramics; new polymers; biomaterials, and so on, rather than spread resources too thinly in research efforts. For example, generic technologies in new materials are the subject of the grants for the industrial research and development scheme, a designated area of that scheme. To try to assist diffusion of information about the competitive advantages which we might have in this area, a directory has been produced by the Department, Opportunities in Advanced Materials, which describes them and the associated processes in which Australia is believed to have advantages.</PARA>
<PARA> Advanced materials is also one of the four target areas in the key technology element of the metal based engineering program. The Australian Industry and Technology Council, which consists of myself and Ministers from the various States, has agreed to encourage the growth of advanced materials activities through the development of material application, testing and design centres and to encourage the establishment of advanced material user groups, company based demonstration programs and investment promotion.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of those areas which are trying to bridge the link between the raw materials and the research capacity in relation to those raw materials and business, the Department will be conducting a series of seminars following on the publication of the report to which Senator Crowley referred.</PARA>

For example, it is within my knowledge that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in the area of composite fibres is doing some important research work which is sponsored, and indeed paid for to a significant degree, by international aircraft manufacturing companies. So the quality of the research is recognised. It is making those domestic linkages which are important, and there will be every initiative to encourage an appreciation of the strengths by the sort of seminar approach which I have referred to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge Senator McKiernan's long interest in the field of industrial relations and, in particular, occupational health and safety for the Australian work force. One of the problems faced by researchers in the field of occupational health and safety is the paucity of information on the extent of industrial accidents in Australia. In recent times statistics on employment injuries and industrial accidents have been collected by each State branch of the Australian Bureau of Statistics with the exception of the State of Victoria. However, the collection of the information differs from State to State, with no national integrated standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This difference in standards primarily reflects the differing State legislation on industrial accidents. Nevertheless aggregation of State information, with the exception of Victoria, clearly shows that industrial accidents, along with personal and family trauma, have a profound effect on industrial activity. In 1986-87, the latest year that a comparison can be made between industrial accidents and industrial disputes, the five-State figure shows that industrial accidents caused 9.1 million working days lost compared with 757,100 working days lost from industrial disputes, a ratio of 12:1 in favour of accidents as opposed to disputes. That is an extremely significant level. It is extremely significant, too, in that most public debate is about disputes. There is very little public debate or examination about the cause of accidents and how to remove those causes from our community.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken a number of programs to highlight the effects of industrial accidents in the workplace and to introduce safety standards in industry. Under the prices and incomes accord between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government, besides the restraint on wage increases that the agreement has delivered, there exists a comprehensive package for growth in the social wage which includes taxation reform, spending on health and social security, training, and occupational health and safety. The Occupational Health and Safety Commission, WorkSafe Australia, is the Government's vehicle to reduce the incidence and severity of occupational injury and disease and provide healthy, safe and productive working environments. WorkSafe's strategies centre on six priority areas: occupational back pain, noise-induced hearing loss, management of chemicals used at work, occupational skin disorders, occupational cancer and mechanical equipment injury.</PARA>
<PARA> WorkSafe is also directing its attentions to those anomalies in State statistical collections on employment injuries. WorkSafe has developed a national standards action plan in consultation with the States and expects that a nationally integrated set of statistical information on occupational accidents will be published next year for the 1989-90 financial year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware of the exact number of days that had been sat by Mr Cahill, the Chief Magistrate acting as coroner in this inquiry. But I acknowledge that the inquiry is taking much longer than was originally considered probable. Nevertheless, I cannot see any way, and I do not take Senator Reid to be suggesting, that the inquest can be brought to a halt at this stage of the inquiries. Indeed, as I understand it, even Mr Hatton, who has called for a royal commission into some matters that have been touched upon by the inquest, has agreed to provide what information and materials he can to the coroner. So no doubt he considers that this phase, the last phase, of the coroner's inquest, dealing as it will with the Seville matters, is an important and necessary part of the process to allow Mr Cahill to come to the conclusions he needs to as to the manner and cause of Colin Winchester's death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator will also be aware that only yesterday Mr John Winneke QC was appointed as senior counsel assisting the coroner to replace Mr John Dee. He will be sworn in today as a judge of the Country Court in Victoria. I believe that the coroner will count himself extremely fortunate to have Mr Winneke as counsel assisting, a very senior and very experienced counsel in these matters. I believe that no significant disruption will occur as a result of the changeover from Mr Dee to Mr Winneke. I believe that the coroner will be greatly assisted by the expertise that Mr Winneke will be able to bring to the latter part of the coronial inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, as I have indicated many times to this chamber and was indicated by the then Acting Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in a letter to the Hon. Nick Greiner, the matter of any further inquiry will need to await the conclusions of the coroner, but we remain open to following up any leads or any information that is required to be followed up in an appropriate manner when that time is reached.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only a week or so ago Greenpeace representatives called on me and indicated their concern about that, whilst tuna catches had increased greatly as a result of driftnet fishing, which was introduced in the late 1950, this was quite often at the cost of many dolphins being killed in the process. Honourable senators will be aware that circular purse seine nets, some up to three-quarters of a mile long, are in some waters set around entire herds of dolphins, then drawn closed at the bottom. Both dolphin and tuna are trapped and the air breathing dolphins suffocate and drown as they become entangled or are crushed as the catch is dumped on deck.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given this situation, I have decided to invite members of a working party to establish a voluntary, industry-based code of conduct on tuna labelling. The objective is to establish a system of dolphin-safe labelling so that importers and Australian canners who sell tuna caught by methods other than driftnetting can identify their product to consumers. The working party will allow the commercial initiatives of the H. J. Heinz Company Australia Ltd, which already markets dolphin-safe canned tuna, to be built upon. It will seek ways to tap into international verification systems by gathering intelligence from the United States and other sources on the practices adopted by the fishing fleets of various supplier nations.</PARA>
<PARA> The working party will also examine the use of Australia's Trade Practices Act or other legislation to enforce the proposed code of conduct which, for example, provides for injunctions that may be obtained to restrain deceptive advertising. Even prosecutions with heavy penalties of up to $100,000 can be launched to ensure that no deception of consumers takes place. I have invited Greenpeace Australia, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, the Food and Beverage Importers Association, H. J. Heinz Company Australia Ltd, Port Lincoln Tuna Processors Pty Ltd and the Tuna Boat Owners Association of Australia, together with various government agencies, to join the working party. I do not believe in centralised over-regulation in relation to consumer matters but I do believe that by unleashing consumer power in this area we can ensure that tuna fishing is conducted in a way which does not lead to the needless slaughter of dolphins.</PARA>

In any event, as the Treasurer indicated on 24 April, it has been open to motor vehicle dealers to make provision for the additional liability pending passage of the legislation. The Commissioner of Taxation advised then that the Australian Taxation Office does not penalise sales tax payers who make provision for or remit additional sales tax in anticipation of legislation giving effect to an announcement by the Government being passed by the Parliament. The prohibition on the collection of additional amounts of sales tax is a safeguarding measure to be applied in cases where sales tax has been collected under false pretences.</PARA></TALK.START>

Neither is it true that the CAAIP report was substantially re-written by the Office of Multi-Cultural Affairs.</PARA>

The attached paper instead provides some general comments on some of the major issues involved, and some more specific comments on financial aspects of the immigration program. Unquote.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Department does not have any special immigration programs to recruit doctors from overseas. Some doctors come to Australia under family and concessional migration categories. Others may be sponsored by hospitals under standard immigration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Hospitals may sponsor doctors for permanent entry under the Employer Nomination Scheme if they have not been able to find a suitable person within Australia. The scheme requires an employer to show (through advertising for example) that they have not been able to fill a vacant position from within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The nominee must also be under 55 years of age and have qualifications allowing immediate registration for practice in Australia. The employer must have a satisfactory record of training Australian residents and the position must be paid in accordance with Australian wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> Similar provisions exist to sponsor doctors for temporary residence.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of any ruling by the Department which excludes specialist staff needed by country hospitals. If hospitals can show that suitably qualified people are not available to do the work, they may recruit specialists from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> Before the Department can approve doctors for entry, State Departments of Health must advise the Department whether the doctors' qualifications are acceptable for practice in Australia. State Departments of Health and the Department of Employment, Education and Training also need to advise the Department on labour market issues.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is aware of shortages of doctors in certain specialist areas. But it is also aware that there is an oversupply of doctors in some metropolitan areas in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Shortages of doctors in country areas are occurring because doctors are generally unwilling to live there. I do not think that immigration is a long term solution to this problem. The Department cannot bind a migrant to one particular place after they have arrived in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Departments of Employment, Education and Training and Community Services and Health are currently looking at ways to make the labour market more flexible. They are also looking at ways of bringing migrant doctors already in Australia into the system and persuading them to practice in the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time today Senator Bell asked me a question concerning allegations that Telecom Australia had been asking some of its employees to intercept telephone conversations for the purposes of discrediting workers' compensation claims by its employees. At the time I promised a more detailed answer, which I am now able to provide. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of the allegations referred to by Senator Bell but they would cause me concern if they were true.</PARA>
<PARA> The interception of telephones is completely regulated in Australia by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The Act makes it unlawful for any person to intercept telephone calls without the knowledge of the person making the communication except where it is done by an officer of Telecom in the execution of his or her duties in certain specified circumstances, or under a warrant issued under the Act. Such a warrant may only be issued on an application by specified law enforcement agencies such as the AFP, NCA and the NSW and Victorian Police Forces for the purposes of the investigation of specified offences. Class 2 offences include serious fraud but only where the offence is punishable by at least 7 years imprisonment. A warrant is not available for the purposes of pursuing or defending civil actions or claims.</PARA>
<PARA> ``C-CAS'', I have been advised, stands for ``call charge analysis system'' and involves the installing by Telecom of special equipment to record particulars of the use of a telephone service. These particulars include the volume of calls, the day, date and duration of calls, the numbers called, and registrations for local, STD and IDD calls. The equipment is used to check the accuracy of equipment which records information for the purposes of billing or to check usage in the event of a billing dispute with a customer, where an abnormally large bill is registered on a particular service or in the investigation by Telecom of possible offences against Part VIIb of the Crimes Act 1914. These include the making of offensive, menacing or harassing calls. The equipment does not record the content of conversations.</PARA>
<PARA> Technically, the use of this equipment by a Telecom employee may amount to an interception under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. Even so, it would not constitute an offence under the Act if it were done in the course of the employee's duties in connection with the operation of the telecommunications system or in order to identify or trace a person committing an offence under the Crimes Act of the nature just described.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also mention that unauthorised use of such information derived from it by a member of staff of Telecom could involve the commission of an offence.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The minutes of the meeting of the NH&amp;RC working party on acupuncture referring to registration state that, while the members supported the principle of registration, the conclusions of its earlier published report should remain unchanged. This conclusion was:</PARA>
<PARA>``That the context of non-medical courses is highly variable indicating a lack of agreement amongst acupuncture organisations as to the nature of the practice and standards of education required.

<PARA> The report of the working party states the concerns about safety of acupuncture practice and training, particularly in areas which relate to safety of practice ie. anatomy, microbiology and diagnosis.</PARA>
<PARA> The report's view on the role of medical acupuncturists is related to safety. Regardless of the duration and nature of acupuncture training, the use of acupuncture by a medical practitioner is predicated by prior training in medicine and subject to the accountability of registered medical practice.</PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 to provide a Commonwealth Government guarantees on all borrowings raised by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) before 1 July 1992 and interest on those borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agreed to provide the guarantee as one of several measures concerning the reserve price scheme for wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's guarantee provides a firm backing to the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) and reduces the risk of the financial sector reneging on loan agreements with the AWC. It will also assist the AWC to obtain access to credit on more favourable terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, Senators will be aware that yesterday the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy directed the AWC that the minimum market indicator reserve price for that year will be set at no more than 700 cents per kilogram clean. </PARA>
<PARA> The direction which the Minister issued is unprecedented. The guarantee of borrowings is similarly unprecedented. These two initiatives are intimately linked and it is therefore appropriate if I address the general circumstances prevailing in the wool industry in this second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision was not taken lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> It was taken after an exhaustive process of consultation with members of the Board of the AWC, with industry and with those involved in the processing and export of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is in a very serious situation. Demand has been very depressed over the past year and production has reached record levels. Prices have progressively moved down to the floor. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporation purchases have been very high during the year and stocks have now reached record levels. The chilling fact is that forecasts made by the professional staff of the AWC point to a further massive build up in stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has been closely watching the increase in AWC stocks since last year. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because of the risks of altering market behaviour the Minister made no public comment on this issue until just recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of commercial hazard the Minister has been meeting with both the Chairman of the AWC and the leaders of the wool industry behind closed doors since late last year. In those meetings he emphasised his concerns about the prevailing market situation and the likely impact of this on the Corporation's activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators will be aware that late last year it was suggested that the Corporation would need an increase in the wool tax to a maximum rate of 15 per cent. More recently, it was obvious that 15 per cent would not be sufficient to fund the borrowing activities necessary to support a stock pile of unprecedented dimensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Automatically providing an increase in the tax rate to 25 per cent caused the Government considerable concern. Our concerns existed for a number of reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> We were unconvinced that by tackling supply alone that the industry would effectively manage the outlook into 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> We were concerned that the international demand for wool would worsen in the 1991 year. </PARA>
<PARA> We are apprehensive that this would result in additional borrowings by the Corporation and a level of stocks which could not be meaningfully managed in just a few short years. </PARA>
<PARA> We were dismayed at the prospect of a Corporation with potential liquidity problems being required, in the not too distant future, to act drastically to clear an overhang of stocks; and</PARA>
<PARA> We were concerned that growers were not fully informed about the risks associated with any of the options facing them. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 May, the Minister met with representatives from the AWC and the Wool Council of Australia (WCA). The Minister advised them of the Government's concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister next met with the AWC Board on 18 May. The purpose of the meeting was to hear presentations from the members of the Board and the Corporation's professional staff on their commercial, economic and market assessments. </PARA>
<PARA> His main concern was that all measures should be considered. That is, the reserve price, the wool tax, borrowing requirements and appropriate marketing strategies. The Minister required a complete package which would protect the future viability of the industry, and the long term interests of growers. </PARA>
<PARA> At Roma, the Minister conveyed a similar message to that which he had put to the Corporation earlier; namely to carefully and scrupulously examine the AWC's preferred option (which was a 25 per cent tax, a $4 billion borrowing limit and a floor of 870 cents per kilo), and compare the risks of this with a different set of measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could not accept the AWC's preferred option because the risks to the industry and the Government appeared to be too great. </PARA>
<PARA> The risk goes beyond allowing the industry to bankrupt itself. In bankrupting itself, it breaks the backbone of Australia's farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA> With an 870 cents floor. AWC figures pointed to stocks of four to five million bales in a year's time. Two years out, the prospect was a full season's wool in stock. If demand fell further, say by five per cent, which is not unlikely given the situation in China, the USSR and Eastern Europe, the figures showed stocks at levels which would overhang the market into the late 1990's. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of holding such stocks are enormous. Present stockholding costs are considered to be around $220 per bale per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of this is taken in interest charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest costs alone would amount to $720 million per year on a stockpile of four million bales. </PARA>
<PARA> If demand collapsed, then a stockpile of 6 million bales would be a real possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not a wool mountain, that is a wool mountain range. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest costs of a stock pile of 6 million bales would be close to $1 billion per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, these figures give us all cold comfort. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures demonstrate that the returns to growers from holding massive stocks diminish at an extraordinary rate. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures demonstrate that commercial returns to growers are not maximised with stocks at those levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Given a 870 cent floor and given stocks of such dimensions the Corporation suggested that an upper borrowing limit of $4 billion would be required. </PARA>
<PARA> This would occur even with a 25 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Such borrowings by a statutory authority would set a new precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> They would act to increase pressure on domestic capital markets, increase our foreign debt and would result in interest rates remaining higher for a longer period of time than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators will know that AWC's borrowings are currently approved at an upper limit of $2.5 billion. Given this limit, then it would be likely that the tax rate would rise beyond 25 percent. </PARA>
<PARA> If demand collapsed, then a tax rate of around 40 per cent would be a real possibility. The financial consequences for growers, the social costs to growers would be disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> It was apparent after Roma that the AWC's and the industry's rock solid preference was for the 870c floor. This position was reached despite the presentations of AWC professionals. The Minister, therefore, arranged to meet with the AWC and the Wool Council on 25 May to discuss again a viable package of measures which would not jeopardise the industry's viability. </PARA>
<PARA> At this meeting the AWC put forward a new proposal based on a series of marketing initiatives. They considered that borrowings could be contained under the $2.5 billion, but a 25 per cent wool tax would be required over an extended period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister asked for this proposal to be thoroughly evaluated by his officials and the expert and professional staff of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also gave notice to the Corporation that he was considering issuing a Direction regarding the floor price. However, he made it clear that he wanted to see the evaluations of the AWC's proposal before taking a final decision. He advised the Corporation that he would be discussing the matter with Cabinet before any action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government welcomed the effort put into the AWC's proposal, it was clear to him that it did not overcome the high risk of the 870 cents floor and 25 per cent tax option. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal was based on sustained increases in trade clearances of wool at unprecedented levels. These exceeded the levels achieved between 1984-85 and 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> Simply, it meant a larger increase in clearances in the next six years than had occurred over the 40 years before 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I seek leave to table a graph which illustrates this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The House should note that the projections illustrated here are according to the AWC option which assumes increased demand resulting from promotional activities. Trade clearances are defined as total sales through the auction system. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this was a period of extremely rapid growth in demand, highlighted by the strong presence of China in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> A marketing initiative does not, however, equate to firm orders. We could not afford to wait another year to see what prospects there were for increased sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's main difficulty with the proposal was that it did not get to the heart of the industry's present problems. </PARA>
<PARA> This simply relates to the basic economic forces of demand and supply. A price has been set at a level which has discouraged the consumption of wool in the face of competition with more price competitive substitute fibres. This has been particularly exacerbated by the foreign exchange problems of China and the USSR, two of our most important customers. </PARA>
<PARA> On the supply side, the price has encouraged an extraordinary increase in production. This increase has been boosted by an unusual run of good seasons. Shorn wool production has been at record levels in the past two years and these are likely to be exceeded again this year. The prospects of another record next year also looks strong. At the current price levels, growers will simply not cut back wool production. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics now tells us that we have five million more sheep than we previously thought. Our supply calculations have therefore been underestimated by five million sheep and the wool from five million sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry, in general, accepts the 870c/kg floor was set at too ambitious a level. The increase in the floor since 1986-87 has been a massive 71 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the floor had been set at a level consistent with the long term trend in wool prices then there would be no issue before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> However, had the floor been maintained at 870c per kg, speculation about a reduction would not have diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> Not this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Not next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Such speculation would have increased if the market deteriorated further. Under these circumstances, there is no logic in arguing that a correcting adjustment should not be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister emphasised to the industry that an adjustment had to be made this year. At this time next year, with vastly expended stocks, the types of options available to us today would simply not be available. </PARA>
<PARA> Growers would have needed to pay whatever tax was necessary to meet the stockholding costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively the AWC would have had to go further into debt. </PARA>
<PARA> We would have been gambling with high risk stakes, namely the viability of one of our most important industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern relates to the Reserve Price Scheme itself. In recent years, the minimum reserve price changed from a means of managing large unexpected downturns in prices to a price support mechanism. This development guarantees that the correct price signals are not transmitted to producers. </PARA>
<PARA> It also undercuts everything that the farm sector and the Government has been saying internationally on trade and agricultural reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have concerns that the proposal for the AWC to hold a substantial level of stocks, as part of their marketing strategy, departs from the original intent of the Scheme. The new proposal has connotations of an acquisition policy. A policy, I would add, rejected by the industry in the 1970's. </PARA>
<PARA> Such major changes away from the original policy or legislative intent must be subject to open review and debate before being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Government rejects any reliance on high tax rates for an extended period. With constrained AWC borrowing, growers could have faced the prospects of between 30 to 40 per cent of their wool receipts being taxed over a three to five year period. </PARA>
<PARA> It was often suggested to the Minister that this would discourage production and help bring the supply side under control. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is senseless to not give a market signal to growers on price, but only give them one on the tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unacceptable, in our view, for Government to use taxing powers to force thousands of growers from the industry. When propositions such as this are raised I sometimes wonder whether it has been forgotten that Australia is a market economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, for the reasons I have given, it was necessary for the Minister to issue the direction to the Australian Wool Corporation to set and publish next season's reserve price at no more than 700 cents per kilogram clean. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that at this level the competitiveness of wool will be restored and stocks, borrowings and the wool tax rate will be able to be brought down to manageable levels more quickly than under the present floor price. The risks of the financial collapse of the AWC or the industry are substantially lower. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the decision will restore the reserve price to its original purpose as a floor: to underwrite the market in order to protect growers against large sudden falls in wool prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In taking the decision to lower the floor, the Government will not contemplate, under any circumstances, further downward movement from this level. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of 700 cents as a floor is immutable. The wool trade can now act with confidence that the price will not be reduced further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given tangible expression in offering to guarantee all borrowings of the Australian Wool Corporation for the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the Government has decided that a review of pricing policy in the wool industry should be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic aim of such a review would be to analyse changes which have taken place since the current arrangements were introduced in 1974 and to recommend measures to make the arrangements more effective. The Minister will be announcing details of the review at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make this perfectly clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to the 700c per kg floor is rock solid. </PARA>
<PARA> Any recommendations will not be allowed to induce another dizzy round of speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of critical importance now is for the AWC and the industry leaders to manage the future, for the sake of the future and for the long term benefit of growers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister acted with the greatest reluctance. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government, with the Corporation and with the Wool Council, intends to see the long term future of growers, and the wool industry secured.</PARA>
<PARA> Wool is of key importance to our rural economy and nationally. </PARA>
<PARA> It contributes approximately 25 per cent of the value of agricultural production. Prior to the recent contraction in demand it was our major export commodity contributing about $6 billion to our export income in 1988-89. This year its contribution is expected to be around $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In facing up to the difficulties that lie ahead of the wool industry, the Government recognises the critical role of wool promotion. The Government accepts its responsibility to assist the Corporation in its promotion and marketing efforts, particularly the new initiatives which have been proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, to boost the AWC's promotion funds, we will extend the Government's contribution to $75 million over three years from 1991-92. This will continue from the Government's current commitment of $25 million per annum which expires at the end of 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The combination of a high wool tax and a cut in the minimum reserve price will reduce the gross proceeds to growers from wool in the coming season. Some small specialists who have few or no production alternatives will be hit hard.</PARA>
<PARA> However, growers' income need to be considered in the context of what has happened over the past ten years or so. And not just with the high incomes of the previous boom firmly in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> With a 700c per kg floor and a 20 per cent tax the average cash surplus earnt by wool growers in 1990-91 will still be above that earnt in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, on average, it is projected to be as high as $15,000 above the cash surplus earnt by growers in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> I would remind members that most wool farms only receive about 50 per cent of their incomes from wool-the balance is derived from activities like beef for which the present market is strong. </PARA>
<PARA> In making his decision to reduce the floor the Minister had to weigh up all the risks facing the industry and the short and long term costs and benefits. Had the Minister agreed to the 870c per kg-25 per cent proposal, then it is likely that this would have resulted in losses, over the longer term, of some $11,000 for every wool producing farm in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, by 1993-94 the share of the Corporation's debt attributable to each wool producing farm, as a result of the Corporation supporting an 870c per kg floor price, would be around $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Should the market worsen, and senators can assess the risks associated with the trade into Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union themselves, then the prospects for growers under an 870c per kg floor would be very bleak indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> And that is why, Mr President, the Government flatly and categorically rejects the concept of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> At this moment, it is not possible to obtain a firm idea of the number of growers who might be affected by the lower floor and higher tax. I recognise however, that significant pressure may be placed on some individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Government is prepared to review the supply of funds under the Rural Adjustment Scheme, including possible carry-on assistance and structural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the intent of the Wool Marketing Act is that the Minister should only use the power the Parliament has given him to direct the Corporation in exceptional circumstances. In legal terms this means that ordinarily the functions and powers of the AWC are to be exercised without Ministerial intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity here of reinforcing that intent. It was necessary for the Minister to intervene, in this case, because of exceptional circumstances, to ensure the future viability of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government hopes the need for such action will not arise again. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the seven years he has been responsible, the Minister's main goal has been to get the wool industry and, indeed other rural industries, to take responsibility for decision-making processes and to move these away from Government. His record on reforming statutory marketing arrangements since 1983 speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the current events, we do not intend to back-track on what has been achieved in providing autonomy to the statutory marketing authorities, including the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in the past few weeks the wool industry and its leaders, the Board of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Government have been through an extraordinarily difficult period. The decisions that have now been taken have not been easy for any of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that the Board of the Australian Wool Corporation will be able to bring its best commercial expertise to the marketing of the massive stockpile of wool Australia has now. </PARA>
<PARA> Our first priority must be to send messages to our international markets that Australia is committed to the future of its wool industry and will stand firmly behind it. As part of this process, the Minister proposes to attend the 59th International Wool Conference of the International Wool Textile Organisation at Cavtat-Dubrovnik next week to convey this message to the world's processors of wool</PARA>
<PARA> He intends to convey this message, in the clearest possible terms, to the processors and manufacturers in Europe. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill which has just been presented to the Senate and is now being debated cognately with the wool tax Bills is a piece of legislation that has been forced on us for consideration now by the Government's manner of dealing with this delicate and sensitive matter of the wool debate over the last couple of weeks. It is typical of so many pieces of this Government's legislation, as I said last night in the debate with regard to the wool tax Bill, and it is a pity that the Parliament is being forced to deal with this matter with undue haste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Wool Marketing Amendment Bill is certainly a very late acknowledgment by the Government of the need to take corrective measures quickly and promptly to cover the ineptitude of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in dealing with this matter administratively over the last couple of weeks. The Bill is necessary because it establishes a guarantee that is important for the wool industry with regard to loans. In that respect, the Bill will be accepted by the coalition as something that is necessary; but it is about the circumstances and the processes that we must register our extreme annoyance and protest. The debate that is continuing today with regard to this whole package of legislation acknowledges the very fragile situation at the moment with regard to the wood industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the opportunity to have a cursory glance at the second reading speech of Minister Kerin with regard to this legislation. A lot of the phrases that the Minister has used highlight the compounding problems that he has brought on the industry in the last couple of weeks. Obviously, the Government has finally been forced into making some very deliberate decisions to support the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister refers in his second reading speech to the very necessary matters of the rural adjustment that is most important to the industry and the need for further marketing promotion. The fact that the Government has had to acknowledge that it will extend the grants that will be available in this promotional area just highlights the compounding marketing problems. There has been a very dramatic fall in the income of woolgrowers. That has been compounded by the disastrous public intervention that has affected the wool sales. The fact that the Government refused to accept many of the views that were put forward by the industry is a matter that has, very properly, concerned many honourable senators who have already spoken or are yet to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation that has now been put with the wool tax Bills-the Wool Marketing Amendment Bill-reflects the double standards of the Government in trying to deal its way out of a difficult problem that it created. It falls to me to indicate that, as this legislation is essential to restore confidence in the market following the Government's unprecedented intervention in the industry, the coalition will support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, by Senator Boswell. I apologise to Senator Boswell, not necessarily to the Opposition. We do so having in mind the things that I have already said about the position of, in particular, the National Party members of this chamber, although they may not be the only ones who have some problems with this legislation and with the actions of the Government and, subsequently, the coalition and then this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment which has been moved sets out all of the concerns of those of us who do not agree with the decisions that have been made by the Government and supported by the coalition in Opposition. Therefore, we support it. We do point out that this runs counter to the actual position of the National Party members in the coalition. I refer to the comment by Senator Brownhill that he does not condone the Government's action; but, of course, he will do so later when amendments of our own are moved in the committee stage, amendments which will be moved in spite of the fact that events have somewhat overtaken the situation, but which will be moved based on the principle that this Parliament should listen to the statutory bodies established by this Parliament and should support them in a way that the Government has not done in the case of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> While it may seem that a 25 per cent ceiling on the levy is unnecessary now, we do not know what events will occur in the future any more than the wool industry knew what was going to happen a year ago at Tiananmen Square or knew that the Soviet Union would not pay its bills and remain in the market or, indeed, that the Berlin Wall would come down and the entire economies of eastern Europe would be in turmoil at this point. While Senator Brownhill and others might not condone the Government's actions, it appears that they will in fact vote for them. Senator Brownhill said he hoped that the Minister, now that he has had his way with the wool industry, will leave it to the industry to make its own decisions. That could very well be a vain hope. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen here is massive interference and the initial part of that interference was at entirely the wrong stage of the operation. If the Minister had kept his own counsel, if he had listened to the advice of the Wool Council of Australia and proposed legislation according to that advice and then acted as he had the right to do under the principal Act if he really believed it was in the interests of the nation to act, we might well be in a different situation. I do not think that we can have any genuine optimism that the Minister will leave it to this industry to make its own decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I just point, finally, to something which I have not heard in this debate at all-not just today, but in the massive debate in the media in recent weeks. When the prices were up 40 per cent two years ago, we did not have the restoration of income equalisation deposits. I urged the Minister to restore equalisation deposits to primary producers while the wool price was at its peak. The Government did not do that and it should have. A lot of money has already gone into government coffers through that lack of action from the wool industry. What is happening now is even more grossly unfair in light of that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Hawke Labor Government warrants the strongest condemnation for the nature and the extent of its intervention in Australia's wool industry. Indeed, it stands condemned out of the mouth of one of its own, because in the words of the former Minister for Science, Barry Jones, MP:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Australian Wool Corporation can on a financial transaction basis be equated with larger Australian private corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate in this regard for the Australian Wool Corporation to be hampered in its ability to operate commercially. It cannot be expected to seek frequently ministerial or government approval for corporate financial decisions. It is also fundamentally wrong for major decisions on the finances and market operations of the Australian Wool Corporation, such as decisions on the minimum reserve price, to be taken in a political environment. If the Australian Wool Corporation is to act as an autonomous commercial body, it must have its financial arrangements established, as far as possible, on a commercial basis like any other business organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>A further quote from Barry Jones:</PARA>
<PARA>At present the Minister for Primary Industry determines the market indicator floor price each year for the reserve price scheme. This is inconsistent with the Government's objectives of maximum commercial flexibility and autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have from the mouth of one of Labor's former Ministers a condmnation of the Government's current approach to this industry. Furthermore, three years ago the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) himself also told us that these matters were the industry's own responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also stands condemned for its cavalier attitude to the developing problems in the wool industry. I remind the Senate that as long ago as last August I drew to the attention of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) through a question, the massive increase in purchases by the Australian Wool Corporation in terms of the proportion of wool offered at auction which it was purchasing in June, July and August of last year, compared with the average for 1988-89. There had been a massive increase in the percentage of the clip that was being purchased by the Wool Corporation during those three months, compared with the financial year average. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister made light of that issue at the time. He expressed confidence that in a few months the wool market would again become a sellers market. He therefore gave the industry a false of security and that, in turn, has had the effect of delaying corrective action, until now we find that the industry is in a crisis situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I reminded the Minister of this a couple of weeks ago with another question. Again, he treated the issue with levity. He said he was no Robinson Crusoe in terms of his misjudgment of the situation and blamed the experts for not giving him the right advice earlier. I gave him that advice last August and he chose to ignore it, to the detriment of this Government's decision-making and, sadly, to the detriment of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We now find the Government is intervening; but it had a responsibility to be better informed about the state of the wool market and the state of the industry and the likely future directions of the industry as long ago as last August, or at least following my prescient warning at that time to make itself better informed. Sadly, as I say, it failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent weeks the issue of the situation of the wool industry has been very much on the agenda and, through the raising of the issue by the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation, it has been very much under consideration. Both of those bodies have strongly asserted their right to manage their own affairs and to negotiate where necessary with this Government. The coalition parties-the Liberal and National parties-have supported that view. We have supported that view notwithstanding our decision to accept the Bills that we are debating today-the Wool Tax Amendment Bills and the Wool Marketing Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We have repeatedly argued that these decisions regarding an appropriate level for the wool tax and the floor price should be left to the industry. I am therefore very disappointed by the unwarranted attack on the Liberal and National parties in a statement yesterday by Mr Don Pfitzner, the President of the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia, which said he was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . extremely critical of the federal coalition parties for their lack of support for Australian farmers in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pfitzner went on:</PARA>
<PARA>A substantial number of coalition members of parliament are elected from the rural electorates and they failed in their obligation to speak out and represent their electors in this debate, a point which would not be lost on rural communities in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>As one of those who seek faithfully to represent rural South Australians in this place, as a part owner of a wool producing property and as a current President of a United Farmers and Stockowners branch, I totally reject Mr Pfitzner's criticisms, not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my coalition colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the coalition has repeatedly and strongly supported the right of the wool industry to manage its own affairs. However, in giving responsible consideration to the legislation before us it must be remembered that accepting a wool tax of 20 per cent rather than 25 per cent, which the sections of the industry sought, will not detract from the purchasing power of the Australian Wool Corporation. The present circumstances are adding some $200m a month to Australia's current account deficit. The wool industry therefore is in a state of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite my own regard and preference for wool as an apparel fibre, wool is not irreplaceable. The world's textiles, clothing and fashion industries are fickle and could be tempted to rely increasingly and perhaps irreversibly on synthetic fibres if wool is not reasonably price competitive. This country produces about 70 per cent of the world's textile wool and over the past two years there has been a dramatic drop in demand for it. We export about 96 per cent of our entire wool clip and the current stockpile purchased by the Australian Wool Corporation is worth about $2.9 billion. This is equal to about 15 per cent of the current account deficit or approximately two months' current account deficit. The wool industry is worth around $4 billion a year and wool is probably our most significant net export. It is of further significance for its research and development potential. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this situation and the criticism of the President of the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia, Mr Pfitzner, it should be understood that the coalition has no part in the price setting mechanism. That is undertaken by the Wool Council, the Wool Corporation and the Government and no-one else. The industry has therefore not provided the Opposition with much information, and when that information has been forthcoming it has sometimes changed. As an example, after its last executive meeting the Wool Council confirmed that a 15 per cent wool tax was adequate to meet the Australian Wool Corporation's financing requirements to maintain the floor price of 870c per kilo clean. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures which were provided for the coalition by the Corporation were unconvincing in many respects and raised many questions. These included whether the corporation would survive at 870c if there was to be a stockpile of five billion bales in 1995, and what borrowing arrangements were in place for a debt of $4 billion and above. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, clear to those who look rationally at this issue that the setting of the reserve price two years ago at 870c was a mistake. That has even been acknowledged by a no more knowledgeable person with regard to the wool industry than my colleague from South Australia the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), a former Chairman of the Wool Council of Australia. That reserve price represented a near doubling of the reserve price in two years. The basic premise behind the establishment of the reserve price was broken in those sharp rises and woolgrowers, including members of my own family, have sadly paid the penalty and will continue to do so for some time</PARA>
<PARA> A number of factors have led the coalition to accept this legislation, which raises the wool tax from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The first of those is that there appears to be little difference in the additional interest that will be required to finance the floor price between a 20 and a 25 per cent tax when one relates that interest to the total borrowings of the Corporation in any year. For 1990 the maximum added interest the Corporation would need to provide would be about $40m to $50m at the 20 per cent rate. If that tax were at the rate of 25 per cent, that $50m would be paid by the growers either in additional borrowings by those growers or in interest forgone. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, should the 25 per cent tax which sections of the industry sought have been sought by the coalition amending this legislation in this place with the support of the Democrats there was a real possibility of entering the forthcoming wool purchasing season with a 10 per cent maximum tax, because it is quite likely the Government would not have accepted that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Face up to political reality, Senator Powell. The Government, quite likely, would not have accepted that amendment and would have let the legislation lapse; the present legislation providing for a 10 per cent tax would have remained in place, and it would have been untenable for the industry to have faced the forthcoming wool selling season in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Australian Wool Corporation's stockpile is currently some 2.5 million bales. This is expected to double to around five million bales in about 12 months' time. It costs about $220 per annum to store a bale of wool. This constitutes about $180 in interest and about $40 in storage. So, for every one million bales, we will be paying out around $170m to $190m in interest. This amount represents either the interest which one pays to an outsider or, if that money comes from the tax, interest forgone by woolgrowers. The present stockpile is already costing the Corporation $1.27m a day in interest repayments, lost earnings, storage and handling charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the value of a bale of wool dissipates totally inside four years at these interest rates. If the current rate of interest were a mere 9 per cent instead of 18 per cent, 10 per cent instead of 20 per cent, or even 8 per cent instead of 16 per cent, the borrowing requirement would stay the same but the interest to be paid would be reduced significantly. This is another area in which the Government stands condemned for its high interest rate policy and the impact that that has in a detrimental way on the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent difficulties with the industry have prompted Hugh Beggs, the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, to maintain that the Corporation will continue to stockpile for another 12 months. Its stockpile is currently about 2.5 million bales, and this further stockpiling will swell to over five million bales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation bought nearly 75 per cent of the 148,000 bales recently offered at sale. At last week's Adelaide sales the Wool Corporation purchased more than 87 per cent of the 21,885 bales on offer on the first day. It will be a tragedy if this country manages to stockpile over five million bales of premium grade wool, but it is quite within the realms of reason. As a result of that, in five years' time we may have between four million and six million bales still stockpiled. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be remembered that in the history of the woolgrowing industry in this country, going right back to the nineteenth century, extremely high prices have never been reflected for more than 1 3/4 seasons. That is a point that really needs reinforcing. Very high prices for wool always last for a only a relatively short period. The situation in which we have had relatively high prices for three seasons is a most unusual circumstance. In the 40 or so years between 1945 and 1986, the wool price fluctuated fairly wildly between about 40c per kilogram in 1945 to a high of some 400c per kilogram in 1986. The prices that have been achieved over the last two to three years and that have been reflected in the reserve price are significantly above that long term trend. </PARA>
<PARA> Originally the floor price was established for predictability, stability and the evening up of the price mechanism, which, it was then hoped, would advantage buyers and therefore give stability to the industry, and that benefit to buyers would then flow on to growers-something of a bad times insurance policy. It was not established to derive more income for growers, nor to compensate growers for their costs. It certainly was not put there as an incentive to produce more wool. The 870c per kilo price emerged from six years of rises in the floor price-an increase of some 50 per cent on the 1982-83 figures. Those who set this floor price ignored the ratio of the price of wool to the price of alternative products-in particular, synthetics-which blew out from three to one to in excess of eight to one. </PARA>
<PARA> Factors that are relevant to the current surplus are, firstly, that the industry never sells an entire season's wool crop in one year. Secondly, there has been a significant movement from the production of wheat to the production of wool in those areas in which it is possible to make that substitution because of unsatisfactory wheat prices over a number of years. Thirdly, there has been a continuation of excellent wool producing seasons, especially in New South Wales. Fourthly, there have been doubts about the return of China, Russian and eastern Europe to the wool market. Fifthly, there has been a considerable expansion in flock sizes as a result largely of the high floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government's intervention in this industry is unacceptable to the coalition, a realistic view, as I said earlier, is that 870c per kilo is too high as a floor price. It may be said that that is a judgment made in hindsight and that those who decided on the floor price at the time it was instituted should, therefore, not be overly condemned. But we really have to make decisions based on the present situation, and that situation is that we are losing our market share. Of course, we have only about 4 per cent of the world's fibre market. We are subsidising overseas growers. Despite producing only about one-third of the total wool, we are the ones responsible for providing that subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> We are buying back half of our wool through the Wool Corporation. We are borrowing extraordinary amounts. The $1.8 billion which had been saved by the Wool Corporation in earlier years has gone and we have now borrowed more than an additional $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has used its powers under the legislation to intervene in setting the floor price and reduced it to 700c per kilogram, as well as limiting the wool tax to 20 per cent. Undoubtedly, this will hurt some wool growers, at least in the short term. But the most important thing now is to get on with the job of marketing more wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Wool Secretariat has developed proposals for expanding wool promotion to contribute to reducing the anticipated stockpile over the next five years. These proposals involve increased activity in western Europe, the United States and Asia-Japan, Korea and Taiwan in particular. The major proposed priority is to expand promotion of Woolmark products to the potentially higher volume middle market. This involves increased promotion of such end uses as men's and women's knitwear, men's trousers and women's skirts and trousers in the major markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation is also looking into ways to more aggressively market Australian wool. Such strategies need to go well beyond our present disposal strategies and efforts to develop new markets through joint projects in Italy, China and other countries with the International Wool Secretariat. There is also a desperate need to devote more resources to technology, to broaden the potential uses of wool and the way in which wool may be treated to make it suitable for a broader range of users. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in which the wool industry is now left following the reduced floor price announced by the Minister is that the price competitiveness of wool should be recovered more quickly, improving demand, starting in 1990-91. A peak external debt of $2.1 billion should occur in 1991-92 and drop to zero by 1994-95. Shorn wool production should decline sharply in 1991-92. Peak stocks of just over 4.4 million bales in 1991-92 should decline to two million bales in 1994-95, thus allowing higher prices and with it higher producer incomes in subsequent years as a trade-off for the sharply declining wool grower incomes which will obviously occur in the early 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Offset against these comparative benefits of a drop in the floor price there are, of course, detrimental factors which must be considered. If the drop in the floor price results in reduced confidence in the floor price scheme in the long term, that would be of great concern. That will have to be monitored carefully. There may also be short term financial problems for some wool customers through devaluation of their stock. There will be, of course, losses to the market support fund through a writing down of the value of stock. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this Government's intervention, it is therefore even more incumbent on the Government to minimise the impact of this potential downside for woolgrowers. This can be done only by a significant change in economic policy and management to create a better economic environment within which export industries, particularly the wool industry, can operate. Labor's policies of high interest rates and high inflation, which have appreciated our exchange rate, have been the most significant reason why Australia's major industry, the wool industry, has had difficulty in competing against the textile fibre industries in other countries, where interest rates and inflation are much lower. How can any exporter compete with countries which have interest rates and inflation at less than half of those which we have to live under this Hawke Labor Government in Australia? Instead of relying on failed policies, the Government should get on with the job of restructuring the labour market, freeing up the labour market, establish an enterprise based union structure, clean up the waterfront, inject some competition into coastal shipping and obtain substantial improvements in road and rail transport as well as getting rid of tariff protection, the costs of which are borne by exporters in general and, more particularly, by rural producers. Let us have no more of Senator Button dragging the chain as far as tariff reductions are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We did have a promise from the Government that it would get stuck into these areas when it deregulated the domestic wheat market and we are still waiting for those deregulatory decisions to be implemented. This Government simply drags the chain and stays out on one long smoko when it comes to dealing with its own mates in the union movement who benefit from these closed shops and uncompetitive situations. In direct contrast to this, of course, the coalition has adopted firm policies in these areas and accorded them the highest priority. Of course, we will not have the opportunity to implement those for some three years. Action is required far more urgently than that. So it is incumbent on this Government to initiate that action. But, as we have seen and as I have just remarked, the past record of the Government in this area really indicates that it lacks the willpower to implement these much needed reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I urge the Government to get on with the business of implementing those reforms so that the wool industry can salvage its situation from the present crisis and go forward with confidence in the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, this is a very sad day for us, for it is a day on which we have to recognise that our most famous industry, and our greatest export earner, the wool industry, is in serious difficulties through the gross mishandling of its affairs by the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of this Corporation still do not seem to recognise their extraordinary incompetence, which bodes ill for the future because our wool will need very sensible handling over the next few years if we are to restore its credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of the wool crisis is that it has gripped perhaps the one industry where Australia can justifiably claim to be the world leader. Australian merinos produce some of the best and lowest-cost wool available. Backed with the highly successful Woolmark campaigns, the industry has met competition from synthetic fibres and continued to contribute heavily to the export effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I saw a statement from the Chairman of the Wool Corporation referring to the Corporation's advice being over-ridden by, as he expressed it, `a bunch of bureaucrats and purist economists with little or no commercial or marketing experience'. One could wish that the Wool Corporation had a little elementary economic knowledge, particularly in areas such as the law of supply and demand, the probability of substitution if prices of a commodity become excessive, and the importance of not distorting market signals. I am afraid the Wool Corporation will be abject failures in all of these. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to me to have been more nonsense talked in this whole debate in the wool community than I have heard in modern times. Let us establish a few important parameters. The first is that the wool industry is not homogeneous. The superfine wool producers, who produce about 5 per cent of the clip, have been selling their wool well above the floor price. At the other end of the spectrum, the carpet wool growers, using mainly New Zealand sheep, have been operating profitably at about half the floor price. They do not get the floor price because they sell to the local carpet manufacturers. If they attempted to get the floor price, defying the law of supply and demand, the carpet manufacturers would merely shift to New Zealand wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The behaviour of the Wool Corporation, however, is likely to push them out of the industry. Although they are profitable at present, if the levy is pushed up to 20 per cent as proposed in these Wool Tax Amendment Bills, or 25 per cent, as wanted by the Wool Corporation, many of them would go out of business because they would cease to be profitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest problem area, of course, is in strong wool-22 microns and upwards. There can be no doubt that the price we are asking for this wool is more than the market is prepared to pay. Although we are substantial suppliers of wool-70 per cent of the world's textile wool-we do not have a monopoly. Our competitors-the South Africans, the New Zealanders and the Argentineans-are laughing all the way to the bank while this nonsense goes on from the Australian Wool Corporation. All the remarks from the Australian Wool Corporation echo similar remarks made during similar failed attempts to manipulate commodity markets by cartels-the coffee market, the tin market, the cocoa market; you name them. They have tried and they have always failed. </PARA>
<PARA> The only body able to operate in the way the Australian Wool Corporation wants to operate is in the diamond market, because there it is very easy to control supply and to store the commodity. With wool, it is not easy to control supply in the short term. Worse still, the Wool Corporation is sending all the wrong signals to the growers of wool which we cannot sell at the price we are asking. The message is: `Produce more wool and we will buy it from you at an excellent price'. The result, inevitably, has been a sharp rise in sheep numbers. We tamper with the market mechanism at our peril. Eastern Europe seems to be waking up to this; it is about time the Wool Corporation did. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, Madam Acting Deputy President, let us look at the levy. This is based on the gross income of wool growers. It was set at 8 per cent, which I think was a justifiable figure. Of course, the levy was used for wool promotion and eliminating potholes at wool sales-that is, attempts by cliques of buyers to manipulate the price, or the temporary absence of buyers. If it was not needed it was returned to the growers. What it was never intended to do, and what it never could do, was to hold the wool price above what the market would bear. What happened was that there was a sudden rise between 1986-87, 1988-89, when wool prices went up by about 70 per cent. For comparison, the rise over the previous of 10 years had been 39 per cent. Over 10 years it has been 39 per cent; it then went up by 70 per cent in two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, this brings up another argument about the floor price-that it achieves a stability in wool price which is important both to growers and to customers. In fact, it does no such thing. It maintains a minimum price but it does nothing-it can and should do nothing-about maximum price. The sudden rise in the price of wool as in 1987-88 are very disturbing for wool users, and push them towards the use of alternatives such as cotton and synthetics. From being between two and three times more expensive than cotton and synthetics, wool suddenly shot up to five times as expensive. This drives users out of wool, and once driven out they do not soon return. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble was that when the price went up by 70 per cent, the floor price went up too, despite the fact that the sudden spurt of demand was not, and could not be expected to be, sustained. Worse still, the Wool Corporation does not seem to understand that overseas buyers do not think in Australian dollars. They think either in their own currency or in United States dollars. The rise in the Australian dollar against the US dollar and most other currencies effectively caused the floor price to rise still further while demand was falling. I think the Wool Corporation should do some Year 11 economics. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not going to be easy to get out of this Wool Corporation induced mess. Cartels are always dangerous things for an economy and an incompetent cartel is even worse. I personally would like to see the levy left at 8 per cent. This seems to me to be plenty for the proper functions of the Wool Corporation. Nevertheless, it has got this enormous stockpile which will take considerable time to clear, and it is worth remembering that because of interest and storage charges the net value of stored wool falls by about 25 per cent a year. In other words, its value disappears after four years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got to sacrifice ourselves, our national economy and, regrettably, penalise the woolgrowers in order to get out of this Wool Corporation created mess. For that reason I am prepared to support the 20 per cent levy on the wool clip, though this will do serious damage to the carpet wool growers. I will also support the increase in the Wool Corporation's borrowing limits. However, I wish the Wool Corporation would stop this bombastic nonsense which is irresistibly reminiscent of Alan Bond, Christopher Skase, Laurie Connell and all the others-`Just let's borrow a few more billion dollars, and all will be well'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation has managed to get the Australian wool industry-a vital industry in Australia's economy-into a horrible mess. I hope all of its members will have the decency to resign and be replaced by more competent people. In the meantime, though, we must do all we can to sort out the mess. Our woolgrowers are highly efficient. Our primary producers are probably, per capita, the most productive in the world. They deserve better management and leadership than has been provided by the Australian Wool Corporation. By the way, Madam Acting Deputy President, I am a superfine woolgrower. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume that when the first caveman skinned his first woolly to get himself a cloak, wool marketing became a contentious problem. It has gone from then to now and it is still contentious. I have turned my mind to it recently, and I presume one could agree with every word that Senator Hamer just said. However, nobody can be an expert on wool marketing; not the bloated plutocrat, the bleary bureaucrat, or the wool marketing corporation. I think we have to have more trust in the people that are dealing with wool all the time than we would in people who are instant experts from other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I want to make now is that nobody can be an expert on wool marketing, but many people have had a lot of experience with wool. It is simply because, as Senator Hamer said, there are many different sorts of wool, and there are many differing demands for those different sorts of wool. Those demands are made at different times, and they are made in different parts of the world. We have fluctuating markets that are exposed to the unpredictability of events, such as China withdrawing from the market, Russia holding up its payments, and the events in eastern Europe. Wool is affected by the outbreak of wars, and by changes in fashion such as the advent of the miniskirt. We have all that on top of floods, drought, fire, plague, pestilence and disease. What the wool marketeers are trying to do is balance a set of multifaceted variables that are interacting in an indeterminate fashion. It is almost an impossible feat. </PARA>
<PARA> Not the least variable in the equation are the actions of a hostile government, such as this one. The wool industry itself is well organised to insure itself against the multifarious problems that beset it, but it cannot protect itself from the depradations of a voracious government. This Government is feeding on inflation and high fuel and other taxes, and is causing high costs, not only with its persistent discordant accords but also with its withering policy of high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, it is the Government that is in financial trouble, not so much the wool industry. Certainly the wool industry was not in as much trouble as it is now until the Government began the actions that it has been taking over the last few months. It is the Government that is in debt and running monthly losses of up to $2 billion at times. It is the Government that is casting about for more money by increasing taxes, such as the tax on luxury cars that it passed a week or so ago. Now it wants a fire sale of our wool stocks-stocks which are collateral for borrowings--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ4">Senator SHEIL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not inevitably become the Government's. It is the Government's duty to help the wool industry because it is one of our great exporters. The stocks are as good as gold in the bank. I think those stocks negate any argument that they are adding to our overseas debt. They are a valuable asset held against borrowings. Now the Government wants to devalue that asset. Anyone can sell anything if they reduce the price of it. The cost is to be borne by our wool producers. Why would a wool buyer want to buy wool when we have a government that is threatening the price of that wool? We can understand why wool sales stopped completely once the Government started threatening the floor price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, is nothing more than an ingratiating socialist. He has placed his coils into and around the wool industry. Now he has slimed it up all over and he is about to swallow it. The market for wool fluctuates. We have had much higher stocks than this in the past and on all but one occasion the industry has pulled itself through successfully. It would have been able to do that again now. </PARA>
<PARA> At the industry meeting in Roma recently over 1,000 people met from all over Australia and they expressed their confidence in the Australian Wool Corporation and its ability to handle the problem in the machinery available to deal with its present trading. The industry wanted a floor price of 870c a kilo and a self-imposed levy of 25c to fund the industry's marketing program, but the Government refused to let the industry have its head and is now going to curb the industry's ability to borrow. What the Government is doing now is devaluing the stockpile of wool. It is going to drive buyers away until the argument is settled, it is going to break some woolgrowers, and it is going to drive others out of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> By law, the floor price of wool cannot be altered until 1 July. Prior to Mr Kerin and Mr Keating threatening to lower the floor price, wool sales were proceeding well. The Wool Corporation was only buying about 30 per cent of a hugely expanded production; that is, 70 per cent of that same hugely expanded production was being sold. But the Government's threat to devalue wool immediately stopped the sales. The Government's threat to devalue wool is about as irresponsible as a threat to devalue our money would be. Now the wool producers of the world have almost used up their stocks, the pipeline is almost empty, but nobody will buy wool while a drop in price is threatened. Devaluing Australia's wool stocks and flooding the world markets will destabilise other producing countries and other wool processors. Why the Government is at war with the wool industry, which has always been one of our top two export earners, I have no idea. </PARA>
<PARA> I was on the speakers list when we started debating these five wool tax Bills, and since then another Bill has been brought in so we are now having a cognate debate involving a fifth wool marketing Bill. The last Bill is merely a sweetener that the Government has added to inveigle the Wool Corporation into accepting its terms and conditions. The Government is now promising to back the borrowings of the Wool Corporation in order to buy the stocks that the Government has created. I cannot see why the Government cannot support the wool producers as I do. I support the amendment proposed by Senator Boswell. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990, which relate directly to an industry approved tax administered by the industry's own appointed and independent body, the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). The self-imposed levy is designed to meet research and promotion costs necessary to sustain this vital and No. 1 export product of Australia. Further, a proportion of the levy, albeit an ever-increasing proportion, is to finance the floor price scheme effectively introduced in 1971. The Bill specifically relates to increasing the levy from one based on 10 per cent of wool sold to 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As all honourable senators would be aware, it is not just confined to that. This debate scans far wider. In fact, it goes to the heart of the wool industry and the orderly marketing system of Australian wool. To that end, I would like to signal in this early part of my speech that I support the amendment before us, proposed by the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate, Senator Boswell. That amendment reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) condemns the Government for its arbitrary intervention in the mechanisms of establishing a floor price for the 1990-91 season,</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) failing to stand behind Australia's greatest rural industry, the wool industry, and support the industry's recommendations for a continuation of the 870c wool floor price for the 1990-91 selling season, together with a 25 per cent grower levy. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the amendment itself takes in a great deal more than that, but that is the thrust of it. Now the setting of the levy has been directly linked in the debate to the ability to maintain the floor price as voted on by Australian woolgrowers in Roma last Wednesday, 23 May. No-one has ever believed that the 20 per cent levy has been capable of maintaining the 870c floor price, because on any analysis, be it the Wool Corporation's own analysis or figures from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), a levy of greater than 20 per cent or borrowings in excess of $2.5 billion is necessary to maintain what was the old floor price at 870c. So to be advised by the Government, especially the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), that we should be so blinkered as to restrict this debate to merely the discussion on the levy and the levy alone and not draw in the floor price is a deception. You can run but you cannot hide. This Bill does fundamentally discuss the orderly marketing of Australian wool and, indeed, the integrity of the floor price system. </PARA>
<PARA> The floor price system is now vulnerable to collapse and regardless of the Minister's second reading assurances that the new floor price of 700c is to be set and supported, I do not believe the Minister has any idea, now that he has dropped the floor price, how he will be able to hold off the world market push. Now traders are very likely to believe that the AWC cannot accumulate stocks great enough to sustain the floor price before the Minister once again enters and forces the price down. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Minister has again indulged in the practice of legislation by blackmail. To be advised by the Minister that our judgment should be swayed by the threat that he would throw the industry into turmoil if the Senate were to amend this Bill is, of course, his usual style of brinkmanship politics-the finger on the button approach. It is obvious to me, as it was to Senator Powell and many on the National Party bench here, that the ramifications of that pressing the button tactic were always too great for the Government. If we were to go back to the 10 per cent levy, we would not be able to maintain any sort of floor price at all. The Corporation's A1 credit rating would be downgraded, growers' returns would be devastated and the economy ripped apart. I remind the Senate that this type of blackmail is usual from the Minister because we saw it also in the wheat debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth, then, reflecting upon the predicament the industry is in that has allowed the Minister to make such a threat. The current state of the wool industry does represent a national crisis and nobody should believe that the wool crisis is just restricted to the wool industry or the growers. It really does affect every single Australian. The current decision to reduce the floor price in the wool industry will affect every single Australian, city and country. So it was always necessary to be very careful, to make the correct economic and commercial decisions. That has not been done. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate a graph from Acil Australia Pty Ltd's commissioned report for the Australian Council of Wool Exporters which best outlines the current position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The graph shows that after reaching a peak of 125c per kilogram in April 1988, wool prices fell to 870c per kilogram in 1989. I am sure everyone is aware of that fact. This, of course, triggered the Wool Corporation's entry into the market to buy and store a percentage of bales on sale simply to maintain the 870c floor price. In the first five months of the 1989-90 season the dollar value of wool exports declined approximately 42 per cent, in nominal terms, over the corresponding period in the previous year, and, over the full year, the value of exports is forecast to fall to approximately $3.8 billion, which is over one third down on the 1988-89 level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decline in Australian wool purchases came due to the factors which I shall set out. From these factors, we are best able to judge the future demand of the industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I highlight one set of figures. China in 1986-87 bought 106 KGTs, in 1987-88 97 KGTs, and in 1988-89 63 KGTs. One can see from those figures the decline in its purchases. In the seven months to January, the figure was a stunning 10 KGTs. But the average for the 1980s has been 65 KGTs. While some have argued that the lifting of the reserve price from its 1986-87 level of 508c to its 1988-89 level of 870c, which was a 71 per cent rise, was the primary cause for the current difficulties, that is a judgment with the virtue of hindsight. It should be remembered that the 1987 870c KGTs floor price was 300c below the peak price and was at its greatest distance from the market than any other previous time when the floor price was set. In this sense it was a conservative rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will be addressing the question of demand later. However, I make some early points in relation to the figures that I have just tabled. If those major markets were merely to return to their averages in the 1980s, we would find demand rise considerably. I would suggest that it would rise above what is now termed the old floor price of 870c. The figures show that the demand fell 7 per cent between 1987-88 and 1988-89. But the worst effect upon the purchase of Australian wool in the 1990s has resulted from the actions of the Australian Government. Thanks to the Government, what was once a manage-able problem is now a national crisis. Mr Kerin's speculation on the floor price and interference in the market has just about dried up all interest in Australian wool sales for this season. Due to that uncertainty, the first sales after the Easter break 1990 forced the Wool Corporation to purchase 73 per cent of sales in Sydney and 63 per cent in Melbourne. Since that action it has had to purchase another 78 per cent. In Adelaide last week it purchased 90 per cent. </PARA>

Now that the floor price has been reduced to 700c, the Australian Wool Corporation is forced to buy all the remaining season's sales at the old floor price of 870c and to re-sell it at 700c after 30 June. What sort of responsible Minister-one in his right mind-or Government, would be willing to speculate on a market, before the end of the season, when there are more than one million bales to sell?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate, who has just entered the chamber, appears to be trying to interject. He comes from Tasmania, a fine wool growing State, and we have not heard a peep out of him. I do not think that Senator Tate understands the market. His Government is responsible for the devastation of the woolgrowers in his State and he has not budged an inch. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, who sits next to Senator Tate, is a worse offender than Mr Kerin-if that is possible! Senator Cook weeks ago announced in this chamber that it was the Government's intention to reduce the floor price. That created speculation in the market and the world buyers had a field day. They just pulled the plug on Australian wool. They translated a problem into a crisis. There can be no doubt that Mr Kerin's tactics have been ordered by the Department of the Treasury. I do not think anyone is in any doubt on that. It was done simply for the short-term current account gains over the long-term stability of the wool industry. That is what has been sacrificed for some cheap beautiful figures in the coming months. So often, the wool industry has bailed out the Government. How often has it bailed out this Government? Its worth has been invaluable to this Government, particularly in 1986-87. It has consistently been our top exporter. In the 1988-89 season alone, it produced $6 billion of export income. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to analyse the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics paper on which the Government has based all its fineries. The current situation can be best judged thus. To support the reserve price scheme the Australian Wool Corporation stocks have grown from 188,000 bales at June 1988 to 2.2 million bales at the end of February 1990. They are forecast to reach 2.75 million bales at 30 June 1990. I dare say that that is now a conservative estimate. If we work on those figures, all things being constant, on the basis of a 20 per cent levy and a floor price of 870c, which our amendment supports, it was estimated that the stockpile would grow to a peak in 1992-93 of 6 million bales and borrowings to $4 billion. They are the Wool Corporation's figures. I do not underestimate that that is a very large stockpile but it pales into insignificance when one thinks of the stockpile that we held after the Second World War, some 11 million bales. However, that is the business equation and that is based on all things being constant. The first rule that one learns in business is that all things are not constant. Senator Panizza has just entered the chamber. There is no man closer to business in this chamber than Senator Panizza. He comes straight from the land. </PARA>

We are playing a game of high poker and I have absolutely no doubt that everyone's nerves are on edge over this matter. It is a national crisis. I wish some more people would recognise that that was so. It does not just affect country people; it affects everyone. It must be remembered that those in the industry are in the best position to read the market forces. It is also a fallacy to believe that the Australian Wool Corporation is only represented by the woolgrowers in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As others have announced in this chamber, I note that there is a letter signed by four members selected for the position on the basis of their financial marketing or commercial expertise. They include the Deputy Chairman and Managing Director of Fletcher Jones and Staff Pty Ltd, Mr David Jones; the Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and former chief executive of H. J. Heinz Australia, Ernst Barr; the Chairman of Nestles Australia Ltd, Mr Tony Whatmore; and the Managing Director of investment banker Axhurst International Pty Ltd, Rob Douglass. It is not just woolgrowers on the Corporation making this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Has it not always been the purpose of this legislation to allow the wool industry's self-determination? Both sides of the chamber have recognised this; that is, until now. The Treasury lost its nerve and, through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), has sought to dismantle the orderly marketing system in Australia. Even with all of those pressures on it-the Government pressures, the glare of the media, the bulk of the economists' reports-the wool industry has judged, and stuck to its judgment, that the floor price should hold at 870c and has requested a 25 per cent levy on growers' sales to support the floor price. No-one should think that it has backed down. </PARA>
<PARA> In its press release yesterday, it made it quite clear that it is disgusted by the Government's move. The second paragraph of the press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems ridiculous that this Board has been overridden by a Minister who has been advised of likely outcomes and risks by a bunch of bureaucrats and purist economists with little or no commercial or marketing expertise or training. </PARA>
<PARA>They are very strong words from the Australian Wool Corporation. So the Government should not think that it has dragged the support of the Corporation on this matter because it has not. The Government has not dragged my support nor the support of several members of the National Party. Yet we have had to endure a deadlock position and, at best, we can say that the Government has unlocked that position, of course to the detriment of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the argument is predominantly on the demand side. The advice given to the Government came from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics paper, dated May 1990, based on the latest available production and demand estimates for the current season and a set of assumptions-shaky assumptions at any time. However, that is something that economists like to delve into-just as they like to delve into the Australian dollar, future interest rates and discount rates. It is a very detailed paper. Actually, in part it is quite persuasive. But is that not the way of all economists? Who could hold an unflinching confidence in ABARE's predictions when we only have to go and look at its record in the wool industry alone, in the past three years. Let us look at its predictions of the stockpiles. In December 1986, ABARE forecast a stockpile as at 30 June 1987 of one million bales. In fact, the stockpile was 381,520. In December 1987, ABARE forecast a stockpile as at 30 June 1988 of 290,000 bales. In fact, the stockpile was 9,203 bales. In December 1988, ABARE forecast a stockpile as at 30 June 1989 of 4,000 bales. In fact, the stockpile was 199,278 bales. For three years in a row ABARE was wrong on stockpiles. We could have given it one out of three but it was three out of three defeated-counted out. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard ABARE's model scenarios. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to ABARE the benefits from a lower floor price arise from a combination of an increase in the quantity of wool demanded and reduced supply. The Government's judgment has been solely placed upon the ABARE paper. However, all the fancy charts and scenarios must always be tempered with the marketplace. The knowledge of that marketplace best comes from the Australian Wool Corporation and its woolgrowers, but above all, from the International Wool Secretariat which is the world body on the matter. I do not think we can get a more credible body than the International Wool Secretariat, which does not take in only the Australian section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cornerstone of the argument to drop the floor price is dependent upon one assumption and one assumption alone; that is that demand will increase as the price goes down. The demand will follow the price down. However, the commercial reality is that the fall off in demand for wool, in this case, was never solely dependent upon the price. Firstly, to back that statement up, the Government has affected the demand for wool over the past months by its own speculation on the floor price change resulting in buyers speculating upon the future level of wool. Secondly, it is estimated that our major buyers-China, Japan, and Russia-are set to return to the market, as their stock has run down with no more than a few months supply. While it is conceded that the price of wool did reach dizzy heights, no-one has argued that China's and Russia's exit from the market was due to price. It is acknowledged that their exit was more to do with their own economic and political systems being in turmoil in the past 12 months. It should be noted that the 870c is a far lower price for these countries on their return than the 1,000c they faced when they left the market. Because Chinese processing of wool for export is itself a source of much foreign exchange, the prospects appear good for the fine wool manufacturing sector. I must concede that, given the economic and political changes currently occurring in the Soviet Union, export to this country still remains uncertain over the short term. Recent problems in obtaining payment for wool from the Soviet buyers, and the call for concessional credit arrangements by the Soviet Union, do add weight to that risk. However, at this stage, even ABARE agrees that demand in the future will moderately increase. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are positive changes in other markets. The Soviet Union's uncertainty can be balanced by purchases from Italy, France, Germany, Korea, and Taiwan which are over a third of this country's purchasers. To that end, as I am running out of time, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the figures that back up the assertion that Italy's and Germany's current purchases show a marked increase from past purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Example Italy. </PARA>
<PARA> 1988/89 purchases were 80 kgt. Seven months to January 1990 49kgts. </PARA>
<PARA> This represents 58% of the previous year's purchases with still 50% of the year to finalise . . . had the market not been destabilized. </PARA>
<PARA>Example Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> 1988/89 purchases 47kgt. Seven months to January 1990 35kgt. Purchases from Germany on these figures look set to surpass record exports to the country of 49kgt in 1986/87 . . . had the market not been destabilized. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) that that graph comes straight out of the ABARE paper. The graph shows that at the peak production in Japan buyers were willing to pay peak prices in Australia. Who could forget the record price paid by the Japanese for a bale of wool in Tasmania during the 1988-89 season-a record purchase for $3,000 per kilogram, or $500,000 for the bale. It was an impressive figure, however you look at it. Price was no object in those days. The 1989 slump in production in Japan, as the graph shows, saw a preference for the mills to run down their large stocks. As the graph shows, production is increasing in 1990 and the years ahead will induce the Japanese buyers back to the Australian market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, it has been suggested that Japan has the greatest capacity, at peak pricing of wool, to switch into alternative fibres such as polyester and cotton-relating to Senator Walsh's Cassandra comment on that very point. On analysis, it shows that the ratio of wool prices to prices of competing fibres is between 2:1 and 3:1 as being the norm. That is likely to prevent a switch en masse to alternative fibres. To that end, I wish to incorporate in Hansard a graph showing the ratio of wool prices to prices of competing fibres, again from the ABARE paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The graph read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>[GRAPH NOT INCLUDED ON DATABASE, SEE HARD COPY PAGE 1766]</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The graph shows that the ratio peaked at 5 : 1 in 1988 and is how falling to 3 : 1 in the 1990-91 season. At 870c per kilo of wool, the ratio reverts back to 3 : 1-the norm. Further, it needs to be taken into account that the prices of synthetics have been increasing recently, principally due to the constraints of the Japanese supplies. These price rises are expected to continue over the next two to three years. That should favour an increase in demand for wool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nobody should underestimate the desire of the Japanese and other buyers to dismantle Australia's successful wool marketing system. With low stocks, the time seems very opportune. They have not been able to manipulate the market and they have not benefited from the periodic collapses in price that were so familiar prior to the 1970s, when the scheme was put into place. The dropping of the floor price has definitely signalled to the world markets our inability to hold stocks at a certain level before cracking. The Government now runs the Australian wool industry. Now that the floor price has dropped to 700c per kilo, this will give considerable encouragement to buyers to believe that they will be able to ride that floor price down lower by simply withholding purchases some six months out from the next date of the setting of the floor price. Effectively, we have dismantled the Australian orderly marketing system to the eternal benefit of world manipulators. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a good product in the world market. If we are unable to fend off the large buyers such as the Japanese and the Europeans and stop them from exploiting our premier export, we may as well hand over the country to them. Not only has the industry faced the dollar value write-down of its stock to the tune of billions of dollars, it will also now suffer massive losses in asset values at the farm gate. I can see that time is against me. To that end I seek your indulgence, Mr Acting Deputy President, as this is my last speech in this House, to incorporate in Hansard the rest of my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>If we are unable to fend off the Japanese and other buyers from exploiting our premier export then they may as well move in and run the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, not only has the industry faced a dollar value write-down of its stockpile to a tune of billions of dollars but the industry will now suffer massive losses in asset values at the farm gate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to a letter to the editor of the Australian which produces reliable calculations regarding this matter. The letter, from Doug Anthony, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>When the Wool Commission was first proposed in the 1960s it faced strong opposition from international wool buyers. In the first year of the Wool Commission's operation, it was challenged by foreign buying interests. The funds then made available to support the reserve price were soon exhausted and more funds were needed. </PARA>
<PARA> It became a major issue for the then government (the McMahon/Anthony government). The issue was hotly debated and nearly split the Coalition government. Fortunately, Prime Minister McMahon and Treasurer Sneddon reluctantly agreed to provide an additional $50 million and from that day on the corporation has been able to hold the line on the reserve price. </PARA>
<PARA>I am convinced that now world creditors have seen that our premier export product is losing its value and is subject to wild price fluctuations, a loss of confidence will not only occur in the wool industry, but flow on to other export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This will further downgrade our nation's credit rating. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to turn to the supply side of the argument. Taking the wild assumption used by economists that ``all things being constant''-though on the land that is never the case-the ABARE paper forecasts for 1990-91 season that the number of shorn sheep will increase by 2 million to 215 million. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply argued that this number is an oversupply of wool on the market that is contributing to a downward pressure on prices. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on closer analysis this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly: the 2 million increase is a small number of the total. It represents only a 1% increase in production in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In world terms the ABARE March quarterly statistics report that the 1988-89 season saw a 3% increase. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90 production stabilised and for the 1990-91 world production is predicted to remain much the same at 1.9 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence world production has plateaued. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated after the 1990-91 season in Australia, domestic production will plateau and decline. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABARE March quarterly reports that demand for Australian wool in 1989-90 fell 27% while production rose 13%. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990/91 year it is estimated that demand will increase 27% and supply only 1%. </PARA>
<PARA> That means the Australian supply of wool has already started to adjust to the market. As the 1% increase shows. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be added in practical terms Australia only has so many paddocks and so much feed. </PARA>
<PARA> Further to this, due to the uncertainty that has now engulfed the market, those fringe growers that entered to capture the record prices and could not work to the floor of 870, would have to move out of wool production. </PARA>
<PARA> While this number is difficult to quantify it still remains an effect on supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Government's decision will devastate all wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is believed by the abare economists that an increase in the levy to 25% is not as an effective market signal to reduce supply. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote ` . . . growers can reasonably be expected to interpret an increase in the tax without any adjustment to the floor as an indication that the present situation is only short term in nature.'</PARA>
<PARA> I strongly disagree with this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a strong market signal to take a quarter of a grower's income. </PARA>
<PARA> It also misses a fundamental point in the raising of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Like any tax the levy will act as a disincentive to production: that is the natural law of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover the levy is not part of the revolving fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The revolving fund is the levy paid by growers which is returned in subsequent years, according to the Australian Wool Council's determination of the market and demands upon the fund for future financing plans. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the year 1988/89 $166 million was returned to growers. This was an exceptional amount being two years worth of contributions 1981/82, 1982/3. </PARA>
<PARA> On any calculation the increased levy of 25% would not be revolved under ten years, nor with interest payments. </PARA>
<PARA> A guide on this would be that after the 1974/75 wool crisis funds were withheld until 1981/82, some eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note in 1975 when the Whitlam Cabinet recommended a lowering of the floor price, the decision was overturned in Caucus on May 28th 1975. An article in the Australian at that time reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party Caucus yesterday overturned the Cabinet decision on wool and restored the floor price to 250c a kg in a 52-29 vote. </PARA>
<PARA> The result was a decisive triumph for the party and the back bench over Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> An estimated crowd of more than 300 wool-growing and farming interests waited outside Parliament House during the Caucus meeting and were first told of the likely reversal by the Federal Country Party leader, Mr Anthony. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wran, anticipating the arguments of those ministers who would follow him, put up a powerful case to maintain the 250c floor price. His amendment was seconded by another NSW backbencher, Mr J. Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA> But this time he's in Cabinet himself, part of the club, and has treasury leaning on him, and he has wilted. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the question of the revolving fund: It is not, however, subject to interest accumulation for the growers and is eroded by inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> So even if a payment was to come about after 10 years, the money would be worthless. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be dead money spent on servicing the AWC's accumulated debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely this is the most powerful signal to growers regarding production. </PARA>
<PARA> ABARE has underestimated the strength the levy plays in affecting the supply side of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The growers have clearly indicated that they are willing to accept a 25 per cent levy for the next 5 years to maintain the 870 floor price over the next 5 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The floor price at 870 is subject to devaluation by way of the Australian dollar falling and high inflation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in real terms, the price will decline, but in a far more managed and less sudden and damaging way than has been effected by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> To that end, I support the amendment brought forward by Senator Boswell to amend the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis, it should be the Australian Wool Growers and their representative determining their future on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the amendment I recognise that I am crossing the floor in disagreement with my coalition partners. </PARA>
<PARA> More particularly, I cannot support the Government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> My support is with the Wool Growers of Australia and their express desire to maintain the orderly marketing system for wool, and more particularly to maintain the existing floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from 2 parts of an article from the Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA> In another last-ditch bid to convince Mr Kerin that the corporation's position was soundly based, a number of its non-grower board members sent him a letter yesterday stressing their conviction that the floor price should be held. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter was signed by the four board members selected for the position on the basis of their financial, marketing or commercial expertise-the deputy chairman and managing director of the Fletcher Jones group, Mr David Jones, the chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and former chief executive of H.J. Heinz Australia, Mr Ernest Barr, Nestles chairman Mr Tony Whatmore, and the managing director of investment banker Axhurst International Pty Ltd, Mr Rob Douglass. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Wool Council of Australia president, Mr Chip Sawers, that Japanese buyers were ready to return to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> In a statement from Tokyo, Mr Sawers said Japan would need to buy wool within a week to avoid mill shutdowns. </PARA>
<PARA> Its raw wool stocks were down to 10,000 bales. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The processing pipeline is empty and speculation over the floor price is causing a crisis for the wool industry,'' Mr Sawer said:</PARA>
<PARA> Finally I quote from a letter from a man with 14 years experience as an economist with the IAC, the latter part at a fairly senior level. Referring to Mr Kerin, this man wrote</PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere has he mentioned the nominal write-down of production assets and, thus, of funds employed, arising from a lower floor price (at 700c this would amount to at least $8.5 billion assuming average sheep area values fall from about $150 to $100). I wonder about the reaction from the banks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators well know, time is very limited. For that reason I will have to make my speech a very short one. The legislation before us today is to implement the Government's decision to override the wool industry's decision on the wool levy. The industry had made a decision that it was prepared to increase the levy woolgrowers were paying from a maximum of 10 per cent to a maximum of 25 per cent, and that, because of this increase, the floor price would be maintained at $8.70 per kilo clean wool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For nearly 20 years the wool industry has efficiently run the levy and floor price to the benefit of Australia. Australian wool exports have rescued the Australian economy on many occasions. While the Opposition agrees with the Government that raising the levy to 25 per cent is a bit steep and, indeed, that 20 per cent is more applicable, the interference by the Government to lower the floor price to $7 per kilo clean at the same time as raising the levy will send many smaller growers to the wall. As a fine-wool grower, I realise only too well the problems of those in the industry growing stronger wool. But with likely changes in fashion, when next year or perhaps the year after the stronger wools could be in demand, with bulky knits, et cetera, the situation could reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst part of the whole shoddy deal is the way the Government has prolonged the debate. It has ruined the last few months of wool sales. The Australian Wool Corporation has been forced to buy all the wool. But up until the sales, up until this debate and the Government's intervention, it had been selling 70 per cent of the wool. The Minister has acted in an unbelievably irresponsible fashion and has damaged the industry. Confidence in the price of Australian wool has suffered a severe blow. </PARA>
<PARA> In just one swipe the Government has ruined the reputation of the Corporation, which was built up over nearly 20 years. That reputation gave stability to the wool industry. International buyers knew that they could place forward orders around the floor price and could be assured that the stability of that floor price would mean that the value of the wool bought would either be maintained or increased, but certainly not devalued. Countries such as Korea are now telexing their agents and saying that they will not honour the purchases they recently made at the $8.70 floor price. They tell their agents not to send the consignment. Their loss is too great. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis in the wool industry is complex. The various inputs are far from just economic ones, as some would have us believe. For instance, one example is Australia's climate. We know how fickle that can be. Presently, parts of Queensland and New South Wales are saturated following some of the worst floods on record, while parts of Victoria, South Australia, and my State in particular, Tasmania, are in the throes of a deep drought. Our hydro dams are holding about 23 per cent of their full capacity. In our State we are currently contemplating electricity rationing. </PARA>
<PARA> If in the next two seasons Australia were unfortunate enough to be caught in the throes of a severe drought nationwide, we would be hunting for wool to meet the world demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again, the industry has tried to point out to the Government that its economic bureaucrats are no answer to the industry's expertise and experience. But, as usual, the Government knows best. As a result, the Corporation's stock has fallen in value by 20 per cent. Countries already holding our wool have also lost 20 per cent of the value of their wool. Some countries such as Korea and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are reneging on their payments. As Mr Hugh Beggs, the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I shall not endeavour to explain the Minister's rationale, that is his job, but I will say that the Board of the Corporation does take and always has taken very seriously its charter under the Wool Marketing Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The major parts of this are twofold:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to increase the commercial returns to the Australian woolgrower; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the performance of its function and the exercise of its powers do not conflict with major Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I refuse to accept that in the Corporation's submission either of these factors was neglected. The result is that of the Minister's judgment overriding that of the AWC . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On his own head be it. I am fully aware of the disappointment and concerns of the industries but, as Mr Beggs and many other officers of the industry have said, we do not have to like the Government's decision. We believe it is wrong; we believe the Government will be proved wrong. But we have to get behind the industry now, to set about pulling the industry together again, assuring our international markets that there will be no further reduction in the floor price. It is imperative that the debate stop now and Australians speak with one voice, both the industry and the Government. With all the credibility that our history can muster, there will be no further lowering of the floor price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills. I wish to make a few short comments as to what I believe the wool industry needs. What the wool industry needs, above all, is certainty as it seeks to plan its future. For this reason the Senate cannot responsibly take action that would result in this legislation failing or being delayed. The message that woolgrowers in Western Australia have given to coalition senators is that they do not want this to happen, with further uncertainty wreaking havoc with sales. They have had enough. The simple rules of the game are such that only the Government can amend a taxation Bill, and any effective blocking of these Bills by the Senate could mean that for the 1990-91 year the maximum rate of levy would be stuck at 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the 1987 wool industry legislation aimed to establish the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) on the level of a major private corporation, with determinations as to levy and floor price left to the AWC and the Wool Council of Australia as representatives of the growers, it is unfortunate that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has now acted to override the industry on both counts. I have never felt it right, as a senator for Western Australia, to state what the right floor price for wool should be. It should be a decision of the industry made in the fullest knowledge of market conditions in both the short and long terms. Whatever the merits of a floor price of 700c, we have a situation where the asset value of wool stocks is severely diminished, along with the credit rating of the AWC. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only state that in Western Australia, while many growers have strongly supported the argument that a lowering of the 870c floor price will not succeed in selling more wool, others-including many members of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association-consider that a lower floor price best reflects market realities. We must remember that we are dealing with an efficient industry which ultimately has to survive in the real world of international competitiveness and domestic input costs. It is an industry that has levied itself $190m annually for research and promotion. At the end of the day it is the growers who pay the bills. It is very sad that there has been so much publicity about problems in the industry and that any action has been delayed for so long in seeking to arrive at a possible solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor should we lose sight of the fact that the efficiency of the industry has meant a yield of 4.61 kilograms per sheep in 1988-89, from 166 million sheep, compared with a yield of 3.54 kilograms per head in 1945-46, when sheep numbers were 89 million. Production levels of 1,000 million kilograms are thus three times the level of the postwar period, when a stockpile of 3.8 million bales was the equivalent of 10 million bales today. While dispersal of that earlier stockpile took four years to clear, real prices were two to three times their current level. It is also a fact that the wool industry has shown itself capable of responding well to market signals. Thus, the 1970-72 slump in wool prices saw sheep numbers fall from 172 million in 1970-71 to 134 million two years later. We are not therefore dealing with an industry or with producers who are afraid of the ultimate dis- cipline of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that a fresh scenario has, in effect, been forced upon the wool industry, it is to be hoped that the industry will be left to implement its own solutions without any further pressure from the Minister. The position of any major export industry depends far more upon the macro-economic climate that a government creates than upon individual decisions of Ministers in a regulatory capacity. The Minister who really deserves to be in the hot seat for this debate, therefore, is not the Minister for Primary Industries, but the Treasurer (Mr Keating). We are back to the inescapable truth that it has been the policy of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government to use high interest rates as a tool of economic management. This of course has added to the cost structure of Australian farms, along with other business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest concerns held by the industry, and by both sides of Parliament, is the size of the wool stockpile. I would emphasise, therefore, that the annual $220 storage costs per bale amount to a breakdown of $40 for actual storage, and $180 in interest costs-so great as to write off the value of the wool in a few years. I remind the Senate that these costs are courtesy of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also an inevitable consequence of the Treasurer's policy that his high interest rates create a situation where the Australian dollar is over-valued to the detriment of the people who keep Australia going-the exporters. Let us not forget what a fine industry the wool industry has been in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> If the 870c floor price was considered a barrier to selling wool, then how much greater a barrier has been the over-valued dollar, courtesy of the Treasurer. Thanks to the economic management practised by this Hawke Labor Government, Australia in the 12 months to April had accumulated a current account deficit of $21.3 billion, 5.8 per cent of the national output. Our gross foreign debt stands at $148 billion. It is with this kind of background that the Treasurer is pressuring the Minister for Primary Industries to compel the wool industry to reach short term solutions that will sell more wool more quickly. While we would all agree that wool must find its markets overseas, for the health of the industry and Australian exports in the long term it is essential that solutions are geared to the viability of the wool industry rather than improved short term figures. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting this legislation, the coalition does not endorse the economic management of this Labor Government that is a major cause of the difficulties of the wool industry. Long term, difficulties will be best tackled with a backdrop of responsible economic management and the maximum freedom for wool producers to decide their own destiny. Australia needs a viable, strong wool industry for our own national good. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be speaking in support of the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990, and I shall be supporting my colleagues on this side of the chamber in this package of Bills. I believe that these Bills are the best that can be done at present for the wool industry. I am not happy about the Bills; I have some reservations. That is the reason why I wish to speak for three or four minutes this afternoon. I do not want to go through the history of the wool industry or the state of the marketing arrangements at present. However, I refer anyone who is interested to Senator Panizza's excellent speech yesterday when he covered this topic in a most encyclopaedic manner. I felt it was the best speech that Senator Panizza has ever made in this chamber-which is what one would expect of someone whose lifetime had been involved professionally in growing wool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to put on public record some matters that concern me. First, I believe that it is not the purpose of governments to set prices anywhere, least of all for commodities. Certainly it should not be for governments to support practices which distort the market signals. The principal reason that we are in the present mess with wool that we cannot sell is that the usual market signals have been blurred and suppressed by the marketing system that was in place. That has done the industry a very great disservice. At the end of the day a person is selling anything he has to meet the market. If people will not buy at one's price, one is left with the goods. It does not matter what one is selling, it is the market that dictates the price. There might be many complexities, but that basic fundamental cannot be evaded. One cannot embark on running cartels, which is what the Australian Wool Corporation has tried to do. It has tried to set up a cartel. There are two failings with that, quite apart from the fact that, historically, in the commercial world cartels do not survive. Firstly, one does not have a monopoly on the material, as other countries produce wool; and, secondly, there are alternative products, alternative man-made fibres, which can be used for the same or equivalent end results. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also disturbed by some of the misconceptions that have been promulgated in the public debate. One of those is that if there is any downward change to the price, the market for wool would collapse. That is a very dishonest argument. Anyone who buys commodities-it does not matter whether it is copper, cocoa or wool-knows that the price fluctuates. People who are buying the product are professionals. They are in there to make a profit. They make a bigger profit when the commodity is at a low price. Their professional skills and experience should guarantee them a profit when the price of the commodity goes up. Anyone buying commodities expects the market to go up and down. Obviously, it is desirable for those on both sides of the equation that those swings are not too wide, but sometimes they are uncontrollable. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest concern I have about the public debate on the wool industry is the argument that is run, very dishonestly, that somehow or other that this is a private deal between woolgrowers, and that the Government has no part in the argument and should not be involved. That is the reason that I am on my feet this afternoon-because the Government is very much involved. The Australian Wool Corporation can only raise levies as a consequence of the legislation that this Parliament passes empowering it to do so. I have a marked aversion to passing legislation which raises taxation in any form. I can see the justification when the national interest is involved, and services to the nation are provided as a consequence of those taxation moneys raised. That is why we have personal income tax, sales tax and the other revenue gathering functions. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Parliament has done here, and what we are being asked to do today, is pass legislation which allows one private group legally to tax another private group. While that legislation exists-and that is why we are debating this matter this afternoon-the Government has a very real place in the debate. I reject entirely the argument that the Government should not be involved in this wool debate. I wish it was not. If I had my way it would be right out of it. If the woolgrowers wish to form a private cooperative and set up their own marketing agreement, that is fine, but only if that has been set up can they make the claim that it is their money. </PARA>
<PARA> The national interest is very much involved. We now have a great problem with our balance of payments. This Government has mishandled the economy to such an extent that we are spending roughly a billion dollars more per month than we earn. Wool is one of our great export earners. The organisation that has been handling wool sales internationally has not done so as effectively and as efficiently as it should. As a consequence, one of our great export income producing industries is not working as efficiently as it should. The national interest demands that the Government has a view in this circumstance to improve it for the benefit of all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point regarding the national interest that is important is the fact that, as a consequence of this legislation and the levy raised-the 10 per cent which is now to be 20 per cent-there is a direct reduction in the taxation base from which the Treasury runs the country. It is not the growers' money exclusively that is being taken by the wool levy. It is a reduction of 20 per cent from every woolgrower's income which the Treasurer simply cannot tax, so taxation rates have to be raised to compensate for it across the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The national interest is also involved because the Commonwealth will be the guarantor of the loan moneys raised by the Wool Corporation, to the tune of about $2.5 billion. If for any reason those borrowings cannot be liquidated by the wool industry, the taxpayers of Australia will have to pay that debt. It is a very big debt. I hope it will not happen. If things are managed properly it will not happen. Nevertheless, legally that liability still exists. So on every count the Government does have a real interest in the wool industry at present. I reject utterly as being misleading and dishonest the argument that it is the private concern of the woolgrowers, and theirs alone. The nation is very much involved. </PARA>
<PARA> As I made clear earlier in my speech, I wish we were not involved. If I had my way I would not be involved at all in any price support or marketing schemes. Least of all would I have ever supported legislation such as we have before us or its predecessors. But the fact of life is that this system is in place, we have a crisis in the industry and we have to do the best we can for the wool industry. While I have reservations, as I have made clear during the last seven or eight minutes, about the direction we are taking here, I believe that in the circumstances at present it is in the best interests of the industry and the nation that this legislation be supported. </PARA>

Some people have suggested that it is unusual for an urban resident to speak on legislation dealing with a major rural industry of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza's party had 23 years to introduce it but it never did. It took a Labor government actually to introduce it. I remember the debates at the time that the floor price scheme was being established. The discussions were about putting a base in the market. In the early 1970s the average price for wool was about 27c a pound or 70c a kilo-an unbelievably low price. People at that stage were predicting the end of the Australian wool industry as we had known it over its previous 100 years. There was the biggest recession, the biggest downturn, in the history of the industry. Out of that grew the establishment of the floor price scheme, the reserve price scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The idea of the reserve scheme brought in by the Whitlam Government was to put a base so that one could not take prices into or below the basement. It was there to stop actions which occurred in the early 1970s. The accusations that were made that were reasonably valid were that there were cartel operations going on amongst overseas wool buyers that were unnecessarily depressing the price of wool, irrespective of the demand for apparel fibre in the world. So the floor price was established to put a base or a bottom in the market. We understood that because the world's wool industry was based in Australia-we dominated 80 per cent of the market-we would have an influence with that reserve price or floor price scheme. But none of us at the time that it was introduced by the Whitlam Government ever believed that the floor price would develop into a high ceiling price scheme for the wool industry. The reason the industry is in its present mess is that unfortunately the leadership of the industry tried to turn a floor price scheme into a high ceiling price; that is, instead of having a guaranteed price at the bottom through which prices could not fall, they put a high ceiling at the top through which prices could not fall. I think that the reason we have the problem is that the industry tried to affect a fundamental position of supply and demand and was caught out. It is a very painful price for it to pay to learn that lesson, but it is going to have to learn it. Unfortunately, many woolgrowers will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that the price of 870c was 30 per cent above the long term trend for wool prices in the world. Any attempt anywhere in the marketplace to establish a price 30 per cent above a longterm trend is obviously fraught with danger, no matter whether it is wool, wheat, oil, or any other raw material. When it is done, there ends up being a number of effects. First, the people who benefit from it are not necessarily the people we are trying to protect. This is what has happened particularly in the last 12 months in the wool industry in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The first people who got the benefit from this excessively high reserve price were overseas wool producers. Why? Because they could sell their wool a few cents below 870c and sell their wool--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will respond to Senator Boswell's remarks that they could undercut it at any price. Overseas wool producers cannot undercut it at any price because their producers are less efficient than our producers and if we drop the price down to 600c they cannot produce the wool at a profit. We can, because we are more efficient at wool production than any other country in the world. If the price was dropped to 600c, we would remove from the marketplace internationally a number of producers who are our competitors. I would have thought that in the national self-interest and in the interests of the wool industry that would not have been a bad idea. The first thing we did by having the price too high was give an absolutely free kick to international wool producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was pointed out to me a couple of days ago that in the mid-1980s the Americans, through their subsidised grain prices, established a subsidised price for their wheat that was far too high. What happened? The Australian Wheat Board moved in and undersold the Americans by a few dollars per bushel and got a lot of extra markets and an increased price because we were able to sell below the American price. That was in the mid-1980s. It benefited our producers because the Americans tried to rig the wheat price too high. Unfortunately our wool industry did not learn from the experience of the American wheat producers in the mid-1980s. So the first people who benefited from this were the overseas wool producers. By raising the price too high, normal supply and demand starts operating. Other producers of alternative apparel fibre can come into the market and undercut us. </PARA>
<PARA> Who else are we supporting? We are supporting cotton producers around the world by removing wool from that part of the market by making the price too high. Above all else, we are supporting the natural enemy of the wool industry over 30 or 40 years, the synthetic producers. They are able to move in, undercut our markets and start selling. Therefore we are losing market share. The woolindustry is taking what could be termed a suicidal position by making the price too high. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group of people who in the short term may appear to benefit are, of course, within Australia inefficient woolgrowers. We have encouraged people to shift agricultural production out of other areas, whether grains or beef, into wool, because the prices are so good. That is a natural function of supply and demand. People can say that if they are guaranteed a price of 870c and their cost of production is pretty good, they can make a killing from wool production. So we are distorting the market by encouraging people to move away from other industries that were not as profitable because they were not being subsidised by such a high price. </PARA>
<PARA> Who suffered from this decision that the price of wool would be 870c a kilogram? First, the efficient woolgrowers of Australia, those who had made a number of decisions to produce the wool that could sell irrespective of the price of 870c-those who produced the superfine wool and carpet wool-suffered. They can apparently sell their wool, but they are now being asked to pay a 20 per cent levy to subsidise those who cannot sell their wool. Obviously those efficient producers are saying, `Why should we pay the piper for those inefficient producers?' It is going to make the industry overall more inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The final group of people who have suffered are the good old Australian taxpayers. Recently I asked a question in the Senate which showed that with a 20 per cent levy, Australian taxpayers will forgo revenue of over $200m-lost revenue because the levy is tax deductable. With a 25 per cent levy, which is what the woolgrowers want, revenue forgone would be something like $270m. That is revenue forgone. That is a cost to all Australian taxpayers. That cannot be ignored by the industry. The industry has no right to say, `Leave the reserve price to us; it has nothing to do with the Government.' It is to do with the Government because the taxpayers are being affected. Members opposite should not use the argument--</PARA>

Therefore, I think it is more than legitimate that the Australian Government through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has the right to start saying, `These are the decisions that you are going to have to take.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thing I want to conclude on is the question of the economic changes going on in Australia. The coalition has argued and put forward cases for the need for micro-economic reform in many areas. I do not disagree with a number of areas it has identified where there has to be substantial change to the way industries are run. But the Opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot stand up and say: `Let's clean up the wharves. Let's clean up road transport, shipping, civil aviation and so on, and get rid of the inefficiencies, the hidden subsidies, tariffs and so on', and then expect when the wool industry gets in a bit of trouble, to come to the Australian taxpayers to bail it out through revenue forgone and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the economy we are going to have to have in this country in the future, people will have to be responsible and take it on the chin when they make a bad economic decision. The Australian Wool Corporation made a bad decision in setting the reserve price at 870c a kilogram and it is going to have to take it on the chin, unfortunately for its growers, but that is a fact. It cannot then ask us to have micro-economic reform and changes when other groups in the community take it on the chin and expect to escape its own responsibility, as unfortunate and as difficult as that is. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in the future the wool industry, through the Wool Corporation, will understand from this debate that the fundamental economic lesson is that it cannot jack up the price beyond a sustainable level on the basis that it can lead its own growers into some economic nirvana because it can control the price. This whole episode in the wool industry over the last 12 months proved that even if we have 80 per cent of the world's wool producers, we cannot jack up the price and get away with it. It is going to have an economic cost not only to the wool producers but also to the Australian economy. I believe Mr Kerin has been correct in his actions over the past few weeks. I believe the Government is correct in bringing forward this legislation and not accepting the recommendations of the Wool Corporation. I believe, above all else, that the Government's biting the bullet two days ago and telling the Wool Corporation that the price had to be reduced to 700c was the correct decision and is in the long term interests of all woolgrowers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to thank honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1990. We are facing the question of the very viability of one of Australia's major industries. Indeed, of course, the consequences throughout the economy, particularly through the loss of export income, are such that they merit the very full debate and very well considered interventions that have been made by honourable senators during the course of the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 20 per cent maximum tax rate that has been recommended in this Bill is only part of a package which the Government sees as necessary to help ensure the long term viability of the industry and, as a consequence, the Australian economy. One is talking about a number of variables, obviously, including pricing policy, and borrowings, marketing and promotion strategies. All these matters come into the full package, though at this stage this chamber only has the question of the wool tax maximum rate before it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite proper that honourable senators have addressed other matters, particularly the question of the floor price scheme. I think that basically Senator MacGibbon said what in large measure I would like to say-that really the market has determined the situation that we have reached today. There is a big difference having a floor price scheme, which acts as an income support scheme, as opposed to providing, if it can be achieved, that minimum stability which is required in the industry. But it certainly cannot be achieved if there are inexorable movements of the market, which have occurred over the last several years. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the loss to growers that was mentioned, for example, by Senator Boswell in his very well considered interventions on their behalf, essentially must be sheeted home to the market, which has made its determination about the price it is prepared to pay in relation to this major export commodity. To continue to stand against that trend is to court disaster for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> After the most exhaustive discussions between, in principle, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), the industry and other sources of advice, the Government certainly believes that the package which Mr Kerin favours, and which has been adopted by the Government, is the only sensible course which this Parliament could give its adherence to. I believe that to do anything less would be to abrogate the responsibilities of government and of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again Senator MacGibbon and I find ourselves in agreement-which is rare enough-in our belief that, the Parliament having decided on this structure, responsibilities have to be sheeted home to the Parliament and the executive Minister in terms of the Act which has governed this industry for many years. The Government believes that any abrogation of the course upon which we find ourselves embarking would lead to consequences which would be more difficult and cause greater pain and greater hardship out in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA>That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment to each Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>Page 1, clause 3, leave out `20', insert `25'. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment amounts to removing the figure of 20 per cent and inserting the figure of 25 per cent in each of the Bills. I move this amendment on the basis I referred to in my speech during the second reading debate-that, had this been the form of legislation originally and had the Opposition as a whole, the coalition, publicly supported this legislation in this form originally, we might not see the disaster, that has been predicted by many Opposition speakers, which the whole process, including the lowering of the floor price, will bring to the Australian wool industry or the short term attitude towards the impact on the Australian economy that we are seeing by virtue of the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand that the pre-emptive moves of the Minister could be seen to make this appear unnecessary. However, it is only a ceiling. We believe that the Australian Wool Corporation should be given that ceiling within which to make its decisions and that it should be the decision-maker, not the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the National Party has sympathy with the amendment, we really cannot support it. The effect of the amendment would be to lift the levy from 20 per cent to 25 per cent to sustain a floor price of 700c. I have spoken with the industry and it does not see this as a viable proposition. If we could have amended the Bill from 20 per cent to 25 per cent and then amended the Bill further to include an 870c floor price we would have supported this amendment. We tried to do that. We spoke to the clerks and found that what we were trying to achieve was impossible under the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that we would be written off by the rural industry as not being realistic if we went out there and told the constituency that we were supporting a 25 per cent levy to sustain a 700c floor price. It is not required by the industry. It is not wanted by the industry. I do not think it is economically viable to go down this track. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that the Australian Democrats are trying to support the wool industry but I would suggest that if they really want to support the industry they should change their policy on live sheep exports and a few things like that. If they were to change their policy on live sheep exports and a move a little way on those sorts of things they would really be helping the industry. We understand that they are trying to show solidarity with the industry but I do not believe that they are doing it in a practical way. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(3.15)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept the amendment moved by Senator Powell largely for the reasons put so ably by Senator Boswell, whose real commitment to the wool industry no-one in this chamber doubts. But I feel that the Australian Democrats, with all due respect at this late hour of the session-and I do not want to prolong it-are posturing in this regard. The 25 per cent tax is a maximum. They cannot really believe that a tax rate would be imposed on woolgrowers by the industry up to that rate because, as Senator Boswell said, it is not required where one has a 700c per kilogram floor price. They just do not go together. The 20 per cent tax rate goes well as a maximum with the 700c per kilo floor price, but the up to 25 per cent certainly does not. It was always linked to the maintenance of the floor price at 870c per kilo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So this is some posturing on behalf of the Democrats and cannot be accepted by the Government. They cannot believe that the industry and the woolgrowers on a 700c per kilo floor price could sustain a 25 per cent tax. That would be utterly disastrous for many hundreds or perhaps thousands more woolgrowers than would be the case if this Bill were passed in the form proposed by the Government-allowing the imposition of a 20 per cent wool tax. So the Government rejects the amendment moved by the Democrats and thanks the coalition for its support for this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not oppose the Remuneration and Allowances (Amendment) Bill, but we propose to move an amendment to be added to the second reading. It proposes to add to the end of the motion the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>But the Senate is of the opinion that the Government's handling of this Bill and related legislation displays extraordinary ministerial and administrative incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA>The situation has been revealed by the second reading speech we have just heard from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). It details, in fact, a number of deficiencies in the Bill. Let me say at the outset that this Bill has not arisen because of any amendments made in the Senate to the Bill earlier today. The deficiencies in this Bill were in the Bill when it was introduced into the House of Representatives yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Those deficiencies are of a very considerable order because if the Bill had proceeded there would have been a repeal of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 which we passed in this place only last week, I think it was-a Bill which the Government itself brought in and trumpeted as a vitally necessary piece of legislation to preserve a whole lot of parliamentary entitlements which have been put in doubt by the High Court. There is hardly a matter which would have been more to the forefront of the Government's mind, its advisers' minds, and even perhaps the drafters' minds, than the controversy that had gone on over the parliamentary entitlements legislation, resulting in the disgraceful history of that matter for which the Government is directly responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The end result of that sorry, sordid episode in the history of this Parliament and of Australian government is that this Government was forced the other day to bring in the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill to preserve the entitlements which had been rendered in doubt by the High Court of Australia decision in relation to the Government's nefarious activities in respect of postage allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill that the Government has brought in on this occasion to tinker again with a decision of the Remuneration Tribunal virtually repeals the Parliamentary Entitlements Bill. The most glaring and obvious weakness in that legislation is being rectified by this Bill before us now. We could not have a more clear example of ministerial and administrative incompetence than the fact that the legislation the Government brought in to change yet again a determination of the Tribunal has created this awful mess. </PARA>
<PARA> One or two other matters are, perhaps, important to the people concerned. The Bill seeks to change the salary of all those people who are covered in schedule 2-that is, the secretaries to departments and holders of public offices. Everybody agrees that the secretaries to departments require an increase in salary. But at the same time as the Government tinkered around with the increase in the salary of secretaries to departments, it forgot to provide the rates and conditions of payment of travelling allowances for holders of offices specified in the legislation. The Bill now covers ordinary travelling allowances which were omitted when when the Government mucked around with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> New arrangements were made this morning as a result of an amendment to the Bill. Part of the new deal was to send back to the Tribunal the whole question of relativities between the holders of parliamentary offices. The Tribunal, which has competence in this area, hopefully will be allowed finally to resolve this question of relativities. But the Government found that in fact the Bill had taken away the right and power of the Tribunal to deal with matters of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sorry tale that we now have unfolded. Of course, it has not been very clearly presented to the Senate this evening by the Minister for Industrial Relations. And we can understand why. The Government wants to cover up this complete ministerial and administrative incompetence. Fortunately, through his or her alertness, somebody in the Administration-perhaps the only person who has shown any competence-discovered this problem in time for it to be fixed up before we all left Canberra this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason for this piece of legislation. As I said, the Opposition will certainly support it. However, I will move an amendment to register our absolute and complete disgust at the way this Government has behaved from whoa to go in relation to this question. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government's handling of this Bill and related legislation displays extraordinary ministerial and administrative incompetence''. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. </PARA>

I refer to restrictions being placed on the delivery in Britain of mail originating in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mail which was sent by an Australian to a former Australian resident residing in England is being deliberately withheld from the person to whom it is addressed because a Moslem postal agent at that woman's local postal agency, which is located at Wych Hill in Woking, Surrey, does not approve of a married woman receiving mail from a man in Australia who is apparently not her husband. Appeals by this woman to the postal agent's supervisor have also proven fruitless as this person is also a Moslem who supports the agent's action. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is an entirely unsatisfactory situation. Therefore, by way of this adjournment speech, I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to use whatever influence he possesses with the United Kingdom Government to ensure delivery of this mail and to ensure that there is no repetition of this situation at this agency or any other agency or post office in the United Kingdom. Will he also ask the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to investigate whether a similar situation has arisen in Australia and, if so, ensure that it is not allowed to arise in the future. </PARA>

<PARA>Profile</PARA>
<PARA>Bert Cooper, AO</PARA>
<PARA>BERT (Officially Albert Thomas) COOPER is shortly to retire as Principal Parliamentary Attendant, a position he's held since April 1981. He's known to countless inhabitants of and visitors to both the Old and the New Parliament Houses because he joined the Parliament in November 1950. Bert Cooper has earned much praise and friendship from the seven Prime Ministers and seven Clerks of the Senate to whom he's been responsible over the past forty years. He's been invited to significant ceremonies such as the Party in the Senate Gardens which welcomed Prince Charles and Lady Diana, and the laying of the foundation stone for the New Parliament House. And now, on Australia Day 1990, he's been honoured with Membership of the Order of Australia for what his hometown paper, The Queanbeyan Age, called ``outstanding public service''. Nick Greiner sent a telegram. Bert Cooper was born on 26 March 1925 at Merricumbene on the Duaua River. When he was seven the family moved to Moruya, where he went to school until the age of 14. Then Bert moved around a bit. He earned one pound a week plus keep on a dairy farm called ``Mayfield'' in the Moruya area. Next, he was chosen to work in a Civic Construction Corps gang of eighteen, and used pick-and-shovel to build first the Nowra aerodrome; then the Currarong road to the bombing target on what is now called Point Perpendicular; and then an airstrip at Jervis Bay. At the end of the war Bert left the CCC and went beekeeping, an interesting but fruitful change of lifestyle as he met his future wife, in 1945, when transferring beehives to Dalgety on the Snowy River. But it was to be a five year courtship as June McPhie's father insisted that she could not marry until she was 21. So Bert continued to work on the farm and then, in 1949, moved to Queanbeyan. He worked first at the Government Sawmill at Kingston and later in the hardware section at J B Young's at Civic. Finally, on 14 October 1950, June and Bert wed at Queanbeyan. </PARA>
<PARA>They honeymooned in Melbourne (the furthest south Bert's ever been and he's only been north as far as Newcastle!). Then it was back to the house in Queanbeyan they've lived in ever since. </PARA>
<PARA>Bert and June have three children and eleven grandchildren, all currently living in Queanbeyan. June has worked in the Post Office at Queanbeyan for many years. Her helpfulness earned her the Rotary courtesy award in 1987. Prior to his retirement, Bert Cooper has been less visible than normal because he was assisting in a major furniture stocktake in the Hume, Queanbeyan and Kingston warehouses, and with the barcoding of all items of furniture in the New Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA>Eventually there will be a full computer compendium of all furniture and its location. He is now back to reap the farewells from his many friends and acquaintances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 May 1990 (Hansard, pages 296 to 299), Senator Brownhill asked Senator McMullan, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. ``. . . I suggest that the Australian Taxation Office should give sympathetic hearing to those affected by the disaster who pay provisional tax . . . It would be much appreciated by small businesses and others in the community if they could be given a chance to adjust their provisional tax payments.''</PARA>
<PARA> 2. ``. . . Another point with regard to the Tax Act . . . relates to new fencing and the fact that it is deductible only at a depreciable rate. If it is a flood damaged fence I believe there should be total deductibility in the year of expenditure because people have to rebuild their fences in order to ensure their stock remains in the right place.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Answer No. 1</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that the application for variation of provisional tax is normally required to be lodged before the due date for payment specified in the assessment or in the instalment notice. However, the Commissioner has power to extend the time for lodgment of the application and the Taxation Office will give sympathetic consideration to such requests by victims of the floods.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the taxpayer has paid the provisional tax, and the variation reduces the amount of provisional tax, the Commissioner can credit any overpaid amount in payment of income tax payable, or refund the provisional tax overpaid.</PARA>
<PARA> Answer No. 2</PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the taxation deductions available for new fencing depends on whether the damage caused by flood requires only the mending of sections of the fencing, or a replacement of the whole fencing.</PARA>
<PARA> Where a primary producer restores an existing fence to good condition by repairing, including replacing, a damaged section, the expenditure is fully deductible in the year the expenditure is made.</PARA>
<PARA> If the damage to the fencing is so extensive that it needs to be replaced in its entirety, the general rule is that expenditure incurred in erecting the new fence is subject to depreciation over its effective life, rather than to immediate deduction in full.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, if the old fence had not been fully depreciated for tax purposes, the excess of the then depreciated (ie written down) value over the consideration received (which in this case would include any amount receivable under an insurance policy) is fully deductible.</PARA>
<PARA> The exception to the general rule preventing immediate deduction in full is when the fencing was erected to combat or prevent land degradation. Primary producers can claim an outright deduction for the cost of erecting fences which are primarily or principally used for the purpose of excluding livestock or vermin from areas affected by land degradation to prevent or limit the extent of land degradation in the areas.</PARA>
