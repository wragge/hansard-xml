<TITLE>Middle East: Australian Military Personnel</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The hasty deployment of Australian military personnel to the Middle-East at the request of the President of the United States has involved Australia in an undeclared war with potentially disastrous consequences for Australia and the people of the Middle-East.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will:</PARA>
<PARA> Immediately withdraw all Australian military personnel from the Middle East and pursue a foreign policy designed to secure justice and human rights for all of the people of the Middle-East.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<TITLE>Telecommunications: Future Charges</TITLE>
<PARA> To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The petition of the undersigned shows that there is widespread community concern over the introduction of competition into Australia's telecommunications industry, and that ordinary consumers may be faced with higher prices and reduced services as a result. In particular, we are concerned about the impact on the affordability of telephone services for low income earners and rural consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>The petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should introduce legislation to:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) protect ordinary consumers from increasing prices and decreasing service and to ensure that the telephone remains an affordable utility</PARA>
<PARA>(b) clearly define community service obligations of all telecommunications providers</PARA>
<PARA>(c) ensure that, regardless of the structural arrangements, a strong and viable government telecommunications carrier is maintained and continues to provide a universal, affordable service to all Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>Middle East</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA> Their Opposition to the despatch of three Australian warships to the Middle East, which is part of an unnecessary militarisation of the region, and which contributed to the likelihood of all-out war. The increasing military buildup in the Middle East does not contribute to a resolution of the conflict. The conflict can only be resolved by regionally based diplomatic means. Whilst we unambiguously oppose the acquisition of territory by force and Iraq's military takeover of Kuwait, we note that current actions against Iraq have not been applied in similar circumstances, such as the annexation of East Timor by Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian warships in the Middle East be withdrawn immediately.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned concerned citizens, wish to bring to your notice our dissatisfaction with the present legislation pertaining to the Family Law Act. Whilst the Act, as it stands might make divorce easier, child custody has become another ``possession'', along with property settlement on the matrimonial background.</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act concerns all citizens, and society as a whole has a responsibility to ensure that children caught between this conflict are not socially deprived of equal access to both parents wherever possible, a human right necessary for normal childhood development.</PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that the Family Law Act as it stands, frustrates and antagonises many people into violence. Research suggests that as high as one quarter of all murder victims in Australia are killed by a family member. This fact alone is a telling sign of the inadequacies of the present enactment. Further to this, it is all too easy for one partner to make allegations that a child of the marriage has been sexually abused by the estranged partner. American studies have shown that a high percentage of these alleged abuses do not occur.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we request that representations be made on our behalf to bring to the notice of the legislature our dissatisfaction of the Family Law legislation and further request urgent action be taken to address a totally unacceptable situation.</PARA>

<PARA>We the undersigned, citizens of Australia, wish to state how appalled we are to read an article that Australia may be supporting China's ruthless population control programme. We object to taxpayers monies being used either directly or indirectly by any government agency including the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (A.I.D.A.B.) to support the $A4,000,000.00 purchase of 200 portable ultrasound machines from a Sydney firm.</PARA>
<PARA>China's Policy on birth Control has been promulgated since 1982, with calls for all women of childbearing age with one child to have intra-uterine devices inserted. All couples with two (2) children are to be sterilised and all women pregnant with over-quota children, to be aborted.</PARA>
<PARA>Women who refuse abortions are fired from their jobs, fined or physically coerced. Australia recently held a visit to China and we were represented by popular former Prime Minister Mr. Gough Whitlam and Dr. Bob Brown, the celebrated Tasmanian green M.P., which illustrates how quickly we forget even official Government stances and policy on massacres, (Tianamen Square).

<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Evans,</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing on behalf of many people who are concerned about ``THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD.''</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that the children of the world should be protected against child abuse, but I feel that the articles in this convention could be misleading. Particularly articles 2, 6, 13, 14, 15 24 &amp;28.</PARA>
<PARA>This convention is greatly reducing the rights as a parent, and I am deeply concerned that the children of the future will not be properly disciplined, as morals and standards will not be passed down to them.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not as yet a parent, but had intended to be so in the near future. When I heard of these new laws being put through parliament, it has made me become doubtful whether or not it would be worth bringing a child into this world, if I cannot direct the child the way which I think this child should go.</PARA>
<PARA>Attached is a petition of people who are against the wording of this convention, and I ask, could you please present these before parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Could you please reply once this letter has been presented in Parliament. With all respect to you, it will not be acceptable to say that Australians will not be affected greatly, as these articles stated will be law. Thank you for your attention in this matter.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This determination was made by the Privacy Commissioner under procedures in the Privacy Act to grant exemptions from operation of the Act. The Committee has received representations that its principles were breached by defects in the conduct of statutory procedures preceding the making of the determination. These defects included alleged denial of natural justice and the right to be heard and invalid changes to the statutory requirements. The representations also argued that the determination itself was uncertain in its effects of operation, granted wide and unreviewable discretions and was more suitable for enactment by Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is usual at the end of each sitting for the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to speak briefly on the operations of the Committee and to incorporate in Hansard a statement relating to these operations. During these sittings the Committee scrutinised 881 disallowable instruments of delegated legislation under its principles to ensure that such instruments comply with parliamentary propriety and personal liberties. This is the largest number of instruments ever examined by the Committee during a sitting. Of these, the Committee detected what appeared to be defects in some 171 instruments-almost 20 per cent of the total. The Committee wrote to Ministers and other makers of delegated legislation expressing its concerns at these defects. In 38 cases the law maker agreed to amend the parent Act or the instrument to meet these concerns. In other cases, the Minister or others undertook to provide or improve explanatory statements, provide numbering and citation, or take administrative action. In the remainder of cases the Minister provided advice which satisfied the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is grateful for the high level of cooperation that it received from Ministers. The Committee has noted some areas of continuing concern involving aspects of delegated legislation. These are set out in the accompanying statement. The Committee is grateful to colleagues in the Senate for their continuing support of the parliamentary ideals expressed in the Committee's non-partisan technical legislative scrutiny. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a brief summary of the concerns of the Committee and a statement on the work of the Committee during the sittings.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The summary read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>DETERMINATION OF APPLICATION NO. 2 MADE UNDER SECTION 72 OF THE PRIVACY ACT 1988</PARA>
<PARA>This Determination was made under provisions which enable the Privacy Commissioner to grant waivers from compliance with the Privacy Act following an application, publication of the application, and other procedures involving public consultation. The Determination exempts the Director of Public Prosecutions from provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The present instrument was tabled in the Senate on 26 November 1990, apparently in lieu of an earlier tabling of a generally similar instrument on 15 November 1990. The textual differences in the two copies appear to be intended to place the technical drafting validity of the instrument beyond doubt. However, it is not this aspect about which the Committee is principally concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has received representations about the Determination from three organizations, including the Australian Privacy Foundation and the Communications Law Centre. These two organizations are listed as making submissions to the Privacy Commissioner during the processes leading to the making of the Determination and appear to have taken part in hearings on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>The basis of these representations is that the Determination breached the principles of the Committee in a number of ways. Some of these are not directly concerned with matters normally raised by the committee. Nevertheless, because of the importance of their subject matter, the Committee has decided to write to the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA>One suggestion is that the Determination was not validly made because the required hearings were fundamentally flawed in that natural justice and the right to be heard was denied to organizations representing state and federal government employees. The required advertisement by the Commissioner which publicised the application for relevant exemption from the Act by the DPP mentioned only that the proposed exemption was for the DPP to disclose certain information to professional disciplinary bodies and the Victorian Mental Health Review Board. During the resulting hearing the commissioner widened both the scope of the inquiry and the scope of the Determination beyond that set out in the advertisement, to include the Commonwealth Public Service Commission and the State and Territory employer organizations as bodies to which the DPP may disclose information.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, it was suggested that the Determination may trespass upon personal liberties because it allegedly does not indicate clearly how widely the DPP could or would disseminate the information and does not list the bodies to which the information can be disseminated. The submissions also argued that discretions given to the DPP were so wide as to require review of their merits. It was also argued that the Determination expanded powers granted under the Act, and that such expansion should be effected by amendment of the parent Act.</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES STATEMENT OF WORK OF COMMITTEE DURING BUDGET SITTINGS 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The operations of the Committee over these sittings have been characterised by the high volume of delegated legislation which has come before it for scrutiny. Delegated legislation authorised by Acts of Parliament was made by Ministers administering every Department of State, by the larger statutory authorities, by the High Court, the Federal Court, the Family Court and by other tribunals. Almost all of the more important programs of the Government rely on delegated legislation to provide finer details and technical requirements, particularly where frequent changes to these are necessary. Delegated legislation often provides for changes in the level of taxes, levies, fees and charges. Some delegated legislation made by the executive incorporates other material, which in a number of cases is thousands of pages long.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a duty on the Parliament to ensure that this material, which is no less Commonwealth law than Acts of the Parliament itself, complies with the high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties upon which the Parliament properly insists for Acts. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee acts on behalf of Parliament to scrutinise all delegated legislation in close detail. The Committee draws to the attention of the Senate cases where there are significant defects in an instrument, often placing a protective notice of disallowance in order to preserve its option to recommend this final sanction. However, it is only in rare cases that this is necessary. Ministers and officials normally agree to amend the offending instrument to meet the concerns of the Committee. In other cases Ministers agree to amend the parent Act, take administrative action or advise the Committee on special circumstances relating to the instrument.</PARA>
<PARA>During these sittings Ministers have agreed to amend no fewer than 38 instruments to meet the concerns of the Committee. This does not include undertakings to provide or improve Explanatory Statements, provide numbering and citation or take administrative action. Many of these undertakings have been to amend an instrument in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a high level of cooperation from Ministers, and represents a commitment by them to the parliamentary ideals of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>The following table sets out the broad categories of instruments which have come before the Committee during the four months of the present sittings. The categories are necessarily broad. This is because there are more than 100 different series of delegated legislation, the great majority of which have a poor standard of numbering and citation. Even these broad categories do not indicate the extent of the reliance by the executive on delegated legislation. For example, the Statutory Rules series alone, most of which are regulations, are made under parent Acts administered through all Departments of State. The Territory ordinances cover all external territories. Both the Education and training and the Community services and health instruments include more than a dozen different series of delegated legislation made under a number of parent Acts.</PARA>
<PARA>The 881 instruments scrutinised by the Committee this sittings is the largest number of instruments ever scrutinised in a sittings.</PARA>

<PARA>881</PARA>
<PARA>Every instrument of disallowable delegated legislation is scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, which may conveniently be called its terms of reference. These principles are now included in the Standing Orders. The Committee discusses each instrument which appears to be defective and writes to the Minister or other law-maker for advice about the apparent breach of its principles.</PARA>
<PARA>During these sittings the Committee detected prima facie defects in 171 out of the 881 instruments which it scrutinised. These defects are set out below under each of the four principles of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Is the delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA>This principle of the Committee is not interpreted narrowly to include mere technical legal validity. Rather it is interpreted widely to include all aspects of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA>Naturally the Committee does scrutinise instruments for technical validity. During these sittings the Committee questioned instruments which purported to provide directly for the same matters dealt with a month earlier by a determination of a specialist tribunal. Other instruments purported to allocate identical sums of money for similar projects in a series of determinations without attempting to revoke, replace or remake the earlier instruments in the series.</PARA>
<PARA>In another case affecting validity a supposed revocation was ineffective as the instrument did not include any words of revocation. In another the stated purpose of the instrument was not effected due to the omission of appropriate words. Several instruments referred to Schedules which were not provided. In one case Schedule headings were transposed. On two occasions two separate instruments were given the same number in the series. In one case two separate and important provisions were given the same number. In two cases statutory authorities were referred to by incorrect titles. Finally, four fresh instruments were made which were evidently intended to replace four earlier ones. Some three weeks later two more instruments were made which purported to revoke two of the earlier instruments from that later date.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of instruments were felt by the Committee to breach parliamentary propriety even though validity was not in question. Some instruments had no system of numbering or citation, without which delegated legislation may be imprecise and confusing. Others either had no Explanatory Statement or explanatory material of poor quality. Several Explanatory Statements cited Acts incorrectly. One Explanatory Statement advised that the purpose of the instrument was to allocate a sum of money among several institutions. However, the sums actually allocated by the instrument did not add up to that sum. Parts of some instruments were so poorly reproduced that they could not be read. Others appeared to omit words and phrases.</PARA>
<PARA>Some instruments provided for further instruments which appeared to be legislative in nature, but which were not subject to tabling and possible disallowance in Parliament. One provision referred to the ``published policy of the Department'', with no provision for tabling or disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA>On several occasions the Committee queried the technical drafting of instruments. One single provision used four cumulative negatives. Another used archaic language such as ``Deck Boy''. A similar instrument referred separately to a ``kitchenman'' and a ``kitchenmaid'', although both of these categories have the same grades and salaries.</PARA>
<PARA>Many principal instruments of delegated legislation have been amended often, with large numbers of additional provisions inserted. Some of the more important of these principal instruments were amended by renumbering all provisions. This was done without any charts or tables comparing old provisions with new. In these cases the Committee believes that a reprint of the principal legislation should be produced at once. Without such reprints the legislation is extremely complicated. In several cases the renumbered provisions were themselves subsequently amended with no reprint produced at all.</PARA>
<PARA>It is common for delegated legislation to incorporate other material. This is generally valid only insofar as the incorporated material, apart from acts and regulations, is in existence and is not amended. However, in some cases it appeared that makers of delegated legislation were unaware of this requirement. In one case an instrument expressly incorporated future material.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) Does the delegated legislation trespass unduly upon personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee closely scrutinies delegated legislation for possible breaches of personal liberties.</PARA>
<PARA>Strict liability offences are accepted by the Committee only in unusual circumstances. The Committee generally regards it as inappropriate for the executive to create offences where no intention to commit a crime is required. In one case during this sittings strict liability was provided for all of the officers of an organisation if the organisation itself breached a provision. The instrument which created this offence was not accompanied by an Explanatory Statement to explain the necessity for such a provision.</PARA>
<PARA>Another provision reversed the usual onus of proof in criminal cases, so that a person was presumed guilty unless that person could prove themselves innocent. Again the Committee insists on a full explanation before it will accept such an offence. Similarly, the Committee believes that there should be clear protection against persons being required to incriminate themselves. In one case, the person in charge of an establishment could refuse to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination. However, if that person waived this right then the right was waived for all persons present on the premises, who were then required to answer questions even if the replies incriminated them. In another case, it was an offence to refuse to answer a question without reasonable excuse. It was unclear whether self-incrimination was a reasonable excuse.</PARA>
<PARA>In a related type of case, public officials could demand personal information from any person at all. The Committee obtained an undertaking that such information could only be required from a narrow class for the purposes of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>In another offence provision, the owner of a motor vehicle was deemed guilty of certain offences even if the vehicle had been stolen or taken illegally at the time the offences were committed. At the other end of the scale, the Committee questioned mandatory provisions which did not include any sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee examined a number of provisions which empowered officials to enter private premises. In such cases the Committee believes that warrants to enter, search and seize should be issued only by a judge or magistrate, should be in a mandatory form subject to tabling and disallowance in Parliament, and should be limited as to the hours, dates and places of entry. The Committee questioned one provision where it was unclear whether these safeguards existed. In another case a warrant was in a discretionary rather than a mandatory form.</PARA>
<PARA>The officials who actually execute a search warrant should be required to produce a photographic identity card on demand, or else leave the premises if requested. This safeguard was not provided in several instruments. Under one instrument photographic identity cards did not have to be produced in an emergency, although written identification did.</PARA>
<PARA>One instrument provided that a public official could remove persons from an area if they had contravened the regulations. The Committee pointed out that whether a person had contravened offence provisions was a matter for a properly constituted court, not for the opinion of an official.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not only offence provisions which may breach personal liberties. The Committee is vigilant to ensure that all procedures in delegated legislation are fair and equitable. One instrument provided that certain property dealt with by a statutory authority became the property of its new owner free of any charges and encumbrances. The Committee sought assurances that holders of a mortgage or charge over this property would not thereby lose their rights.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee questioned what appeared to be harsh provisions in an area with important financial and livelihood implications. In one of these there was a time limit for the provision of information. Failure to meet the time limit would have severely adverse financial consequences, yet there was no discretion (subject to external merits review) to extend the limit. In another there was only a restricted right to apply for an extension of time. One provision queried by the Committee purported to operate notwithstanding certain other provisions. This procedure appeared to avoid a number of important safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA>In a related series of instruments some individuals were required to make an important decision within eight days while others were given thirty days to make the same decision.</PARA>
<PARA>A considerable proportion of delegated legislation imposes or changes the level of taxes, levies, fees and charges. The Committee always requires that the Explanatory Statement advise of the basis for the imposition or the change. This is often to effect a policy of cost recovery, or to reflect changes in the CPI. In any event, it should be notified.</PARA>
<PARA>Duties and rights imposed by delegated legislation should be clear and unambiguous. In one instrument there was no indication of who was to exercise a number of discretions. In another, obligations were ``subject to the conditions which the Department from time to time notifies.'' Other provisions were questioned by the Committee because they were vague, uncertain and subjective. Some rights were expressed to be subject to the ``national interest.'' Others were required to be ``consistent with the interests of Australia.''</PARA>
<PARA>(c) Does the delegated legislation unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal?</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee examines all discretions which may affect individuals to ensure that external review of the merits of a decision is provided in appropriate cases. In the reporting period the Committee inquired about discretions granted to Ministers, to the Registrar of a Court, to secretaries of departments and to statutory officers. In many cases the power to exercise these discretions could be delegated to others. The Committee believes that the case for independent review is stronger where there is a wide power of delegation. Where delegation is to any person at all the case is overwhelming. In any event, the Committee also examines delegations to ensure that they are restricted to the narrowest possible class.</PARA>
<PARA>In one case, an instrument provided that only a restricted class of public officials could be authorised for certain purposes. However, the power to appoint individuals within this class could be delegated to any person at all.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee examines the type of discretion to decide which review rights may be suitable. Some discretions are to exempt individuals completely from the operation of a scheme. Wide discretions like this should usually be subject to AAT review. Other discretions may have a commercial value or affect a person's livelihood. Here external review will also usually be essential. Other discretions may have a financial value. It is common for delegated legislation to provide that an official may refund fees already paid, or waive or remit in whole or part fees which are payable. Here also the case for external review is strong.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that discretions should not be open ended but rather limited and guided by objective criteria. In the absence of any criteria at all, or where criteria are subjective, vague or wide, then external review should be provided. In some instances an instrument may set out criteria but then provide that an official may make a decision regardless of the criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>Review rights should not only exist, but also be notified to the person affected by the adverse exercise of a discretion. The Committee believes that where such a decision is made, there should be an express requirement that any review rights be advised in writing at the same time as advice of the decision itself. If there are no review rights this should also be advised to the person affected. At present, many instruments of delegated legislation are unclear as to whether review is provided for discretions. This is particularly so in the large number of instruments which amend principal instruments. Such principal legislation, or the parent Act, may provide review rights. In such cases the Explanatory Statement, or Notes in the body of the instrument should indicate whether review exists for individual discretions. If review is not provided this also should be clearly advised in the Explanatory Statement. The Committee has scrutinised instruments which refer to reviewable decisions without any indication as to the decisions subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA>Some instruments provide for decisions to be reviewed by special bodies established for the purposes of the parent Act or delegated legislation made under it. The Committee generally prefers that decisions be reviewed by the AAT, which places itself in the position of the original decision maker and which may substitute its decision for the original decision. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, which established the AAT, provides many safeguards for the appeals process. The Committee accepts specialist internal review procedures in place of the AAT only if they are genuinely independent of the original decision makers and of the executive generally, and include similar safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA>(d) Does the delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA>The Sex Discrimination (Operation of Legislation) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No.244, prolonged for a further 12 months Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation which would otherwise be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The total period of such exemptions is now seven years. The Committee has indicated that any further exemptions should be by Act rather than regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>During this sittings the Committee made a submission to the Administrative Review Council's major project on Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies. The ARC, the peak Commonwealth advisory body on administrative law, had expressly invited the Committee to make such a submission. The submission covered most areas of current concern to legislative scrutiny committees. In particular, it emphasised that the drafting and presentation of delegated legislation, including access by the public, should not be less than that of Acts of Parliament. To this end the present proliferation of types of instruments of executive law-making should be subsumed within a single delegated legislation series, preferably the Statutory Rules series, professionally drafted and made by the Governor-General, subject to the highest levels of safeguards expressed in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903.</PARA>
<PARA>The submission emphasised that consolidated reprints of delegated legislation should be available at least with the same frequency as those of Acts. The Committee also considered that automatic repeal provisions under which existing delegated legislation is repealed after a fixed number of years might be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>There might be merit in a single series of delegated legislation being presented and amended by the loose-leaf method which is, in effect, an instant consolidation. Agencies could also be required to produce convenient ADP access to a definitive consolidation each time the principal instrument is amended.</PARA>
<PARA>During the sittings the Committee initiated a project on quasi-legislation, which is one of the most important issues facing legislative scrutiny committees. Delegates to the Third Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation, held in Westminster in November last year, including the Australian delegation, expressed concern at the increase in quasi-legislation. Quasi-legislation is difficult to define. At the conference Professor Gabriele Ganz said that quasi-legislation is not a term of art. It may include circulars and press releases or even oral directives from Ministers or others in the executive. Often it will include matter which is administrative in nature as well as legislative. However, any material which determines a general rule of conduct or declares a power, right or duty applying to broad classes, as opposed to applying the law in individual cases, is legislative. Insofar as this material is made by the executive, it is the duty of Parliament to supervise and control such legislation. I hope that the work of the Committee will advance this process. During these sittings Senator Bishop, the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, tabled on behalf of the Committee on 20 September 1990 the manuals used by officials in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to administer the Migration Act and Regulations. Senator Bishop pointed out that the 195 manuals were 3,300 pages long and cost 400 dollars. This is the type of quasi-legislation which the Committee will scrutinise.</PARA>
<PARA>In the initial stages of the project the Committee is examining the lists of procedural manuals produced by agencies under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The Committee will examine all manuals from selected Departments or statutory authorities for legislative implications, particularly for control by Parliament and other safeguards. It will also examine all manuals relating to selected topics from across the range of Departments or agencies, with the same object.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has continued its practice of hearings with public officials to explain aspects of delegated legislation which it has raised. In a previous report Honourable Senators will recall that the Committee asked officials from two different Departments to brief the Committee on delays in implementing undertakings given to it to amend legislation to meet its concerns, and on delays in replying to correspondence. During this sittings, at the invitation of the Committee, a Minister nominated senior officials from the Department to attend the Committee to discuss progress on aspects of changes to delegated legislation and parent Acts. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for this cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA>On 29 November 1990 date I tabled the Eighty-seventh Report of the Committee, called ``Subdelegation of Powers''. This Report is a survey of the law and practice in this area, written by Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, the Legal Adviser of the Committee. Subdelegation of legislative or administrative powers is an important area of concern to the Committee. Many instruments of delegated legislation provide, for example, that the Minister may exempt classes of persons or individuals from paying fees or charges. Often this power may be delegated, sometimes to any person at all. The Committee insists that such delegation be restricted to appropriate levels of persons. Similarly, other subdelegations are, in some cases, to approve the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars of Commonwealth money. Here again, the Committee scrutinised carefully all aspects of such delegations.</PARA>
<PARA>One area of concern to the Committee is the existence of significant instruments, clearly legislative in character, which are subject neither to tabling nor disallowance. It is, of course, only by chance that the Committee becomes aware of these instruments. Since the establishment of our sister legislative scrutiny committee, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, such instruments are picked up in the Bills stage. However, there are some legislative instruments for which provision was made before that Committee was established, which lack any parliamentary safeguards. Senator Kay Patterson drew the attention of the Committee to one such instrument, which appeared to contain defects which in a disallowable instrument would lead to a protective notice of motion of disallowance pending a reply from the Minister. The Committee scrutinised the instrument and wrote to the Minister, asking if the parent Act could be amended to provide for full parliamentary supervision. The Committee also asked if the present instrument could be amended.</PARA>
<PARA>The work of the Committee now includes scrutiny of instruments of a type possibly not seen before in Commonwealth delegated legislation. The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1989, among other things amended two parent Acts to provide for the making of six new types of delegated legislation. This delegated legislation cannot be disallowed outright by either House of the Parliament. However, the Act provides for either House to approve amendments of the legislation, with the legislation only coming into effect if such amendments are approved by the other House. The Committee scrutinised a number of these types of instrument, and wrote to the Minister where it detected possible deficiencies. As usual, the Minister replied with a prompt and helpful explanation, including an undertaking to amend an instrument to meet the concerns of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee acknowledges the high level of commitment to its principles shown by Ministers. Recently the Committee advised a Minister that certain review provisions were a credit to the portfolio legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not usual for the Committee to mention individual Ministers in these reports. However, there were two instances of major reforms by Ministers which the Committee felt should be drawn to the attention of the Senate. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator the Hon Bob Collins, a former Chairman of the Committee, has advised that the numerous and bulky Civil Aviation Orders will progressively be included in the Statutory Rules series. This series is better drafted and presented than the rest of the more than 100 other series of delegated legislation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon John Kerin MP and the Minister for Resources, the Hon Alan Griffiths MP, have made instruments in which each amendment is part of a complete reprint. This provides the best possible access to delegated legislation by the Parliament and by those members of the public whom it affects.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has been greatly assisted in its work by its Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan of the Faculty of Law at the Australian National University. Douglas Whalan comments on every disallowable instrument of delegated legislation, attends Committee meetings when required, writes special reports and generally provides high level legal support.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the good cooperation that the Committee receives from Ministers, the Committee sometimes receives letters drafted by officials who appear to lack a complete commitment to improve the quality of delegated legislation so that it meets the high standards of the Committee. For the information of Honourable Senators one such letter is included below.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee thanks the Senate for continuing the strong support which the Committee has always received during its 58 years of existence.</PARA>

<PARA>Standing Committee on</PARA>
<PARA> Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter dated 24 August 1990 seeking advice as to a possible duplication of time and resources involved in the processing of Statutory Rules 1990 Nos. 147 and 148 and Statutory Rules 1990 Nos. 217, 218, 220, 221, 222 and 223. I share your Committee's concern that the process of subsidiary law-making should be streamlined as much as possible to avoid unnecessary delay and duplication of scarce resources. I am advised the Legal Services Branch of the Australian Customs Service (ACS), which processes the documentation for regulations presented under my name to the Federal Executive Council, also makes every endeavour to assist in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>As an explanation to what might appear in the instant case to constitute a breach of the above, I make the following general observations, followed by specific comments on the Statutory Rules your Committee has highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA>Regulations are drafted by the Attorney-General's Department upon formal instruction by the Legal Services Branch of the ACS, which processes instructions on behalf of the relevant policy area of the ACS or, in some cases, another Minister or Department. The time taken to draft the amendments varies according to the complexity of the request and the drafting priorities of the Attorney-General's Department. In addition, the urgency of each regulation varies as does the draftsperson in the Attorney-General's Department. When the first draft is complete the ACS ensures it is suitable in terms of the policy which it intends to achieve. If the draft is unsuitable then some liaising must occur between the ACS and the Attorney-General's Department to finalise the draft amendment. It is only when the draft is finalised that prints of the amendment can be submitted to the Federal Executive Council. These prints have to be accompanied by the various Executive Council Documents which are prepared by the Legal Services Branch of the ACS.</PARA>
<PARA>If a number of amendments need to be made to any of the regulations which I administer and those amendments are to be made under the same enabling provision, then appropriate instructions are sent to the Attorney-General's Department, either at first instance or when the various draft Regulations are scrutinised, for the consolidation of the proposed amendments under a single Executive Council Minute. Where, however, instructions have to be sent separately because the need for amendment arises at different times, oftentimes to attempt to consolidate these amendments at a later stage creates a substantial amount of duplication of time and resources, especially for the Attorney-General's Department. Different draftspersons are frequently involved in processing the various instructions, some of which might have a particular urgency. To consolidate in such circumstances may result in the delay of proposed regulations which would otherwise be ready to proceed to the Federal Executive Council.</PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the present request, the following observations on each of the abovementioned Statutory Rules are relevant:</PARA>
<PARA>SR 147 and SR 148 of 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The request initiating SR 148 was received in the Legal Services Branch on 16 February 1990, and the request initiating SR 147 was received over 2 months later on 27 April 1990. This resulted in drafts being prepared and finalised over a month apart. SR 147 was a matter of urgency (it prescribed new Warehouse Licence fees for 19901991) and so its preparation had priority over SR 148. In addition, the urgency prevented any attempt to consolidate at a later stage because of the delay that this may have caused to SR 147. The result was that they were both ready to proceed to the same Executive Council Meeting (18 June 1990).</PARA>
<PARA>SR 217, SR 220 and SR 222 of 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The request initiating SR 222 of 1990 was received in the Legal Services Branch on 31 October 1989. This amendment did consolidate a number of amendments to the Customs Regulations. This consolidation created some delay and the proposed regulation was not ready to be presented to the Executive Council until 26 June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>It may have been possible to process SR 217 and SR 220 of 1990 together, as instructions were received only a fortnight apart. Both amendments, however, had corresponding amendments to the Excise Regulations (SR 218 of 1990 and SR 221 of 1990 respectively). The normal ACS practice in such situations is to process these ``twin'' amendments together to enable the amendments to be drafted and cleared at the same time. There is minimal delay in these cases because the reasons for amendment and the amendments themselves are similar, if not identical, for both the Customs Regulations and the Excise Regulations. This means that drafting instructions to the AttorneyGeneral's Department can be consolidated, liaising need only occur with one draftsperson as the one draftsperson is responsible for both amendments, and the amendments can be cleared as one.</PARA>
<PARA>SR 218, SR 221 and SR 223 of 1990</PARA>
<PARA>As outlined above, SR 218 and SR 221 of 1990 were processed with their corresponding Customs Regulations amendments. SR 223 amended several Excise Regulations. The requests for amendment were received by the Legal Services Branch at dates ranging from 31 August 1989 to 20 March 1990 and this led to its presentation to the Executive Council to be delayed until 21 June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to reassure the Committee that, wherever practical, amendments to delegated legislation made under the same enabling provision will be consolidated to ensure there is no duplication of time and resources. If, however, such a consolidation would in fact duplicate such resources, or if it would be more efficient to process corresponding amendments made under different enabling provisions together, for the reasons noted above, then such consolidations will not be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust the above is of assistance to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

During these sittings the Committee has continued its task of improving Commonwealth delegated legislation and associated procedures through its non-partisan technical scrutiny. For example, at our last meeting of the year, which took place this morning, the Committee received advice from a Minister on aspects raised by the Committee concerning the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of States grants moneys. At the suggestion of the Committee, the Minister had obtained advice from the Australian National Audit Office and the Auditor-General's Department as to whether departmental procedures for the payment of money were appropriate. The advice was that, although the procedures were legally valid, it would be much more appropriate and clearly desirable to adopt the procedures suggested by the Committee. This is the kind of valuable work that the Committee does.</PARA></TALK.START>

I find that totally unacceptable. I ask why the Government has not brought this matter on before. We have had a program down to the line hour by hour and now a matter of very great importance is being brought on at the last minute. I find it appalling.

That is my advice. All honourable senators would be aware that it is not a matter that I initiated, nor was I briefed that it was in any way controversial. In the brief opportunity I have had to check on the matter, I am told that the motion simply relates to being able to deal with some Bills later tonight than we otherwise might have been able to do. If that is not the case I will inform the Senate as soon as it comes to my attention, but that is my understanding.

Perhaps it would be possible to take off one of today's Bills or put today's program back and bring the therapeutic goods legislation on today. That might be a better way of dealing with the matter.

It was discussed at the time we went through the program and itemised the four notices of motion in Senator Robert Ray's name that appear on the program. So it did get a mention. There was no debate generated about it, but it certainly was mentioned that it would be brought on tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mention has been made of a conspiracy. The Bills we have before us today-Government Business orders of the day Nos 1 to 11-were itemised in the guillotine motion on Thursday of last week. On Thursday of last week nobody on the Government side thought that there would be a funeral tomorrow in which any member of the Senate might have to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are seeking to do tonight, by the motion to suspend standing order 64, is to give us the option that we have had all this week, and indeed that we have used all this week, to finish off the Bills for an hour or so. Very rarely have we gone beyond 11.30 at night. That is all we were seeking to do by suspending standing order 64. We had a problem with that on Thursday of last week, I think, when Senator Harradine drew attention to the usage of standing order 64.

<PARA> That-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the instrument dated 5 November 1990 revoking the previous Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions,</PARA>
<PARA> made under section 29 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, approved by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 6 November 1990, and laid before the Senate on 7 November 1990, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision to disallow any delegated legislation is not one to be taken lightly. In this instance the Opposition finds itself with no choice but to proceed with a disallowance motion first put before the Senate on 26 November. The role the Government and the Department of Veterans' Affairs have played in forcing this disallowance motion is quite shameful. </PARA>
<PARA> The second edition of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions, commonly referred to as GARP 2, assesses veterans on both their medical impairment and their lifestyle impairment in order to determine the rate of war disability pension they should be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> In measuring lifestyle impairment, a lifestyle report is used. It is widely agreed that this report is overly long, repetitious, intrusive and complex. Veterans' organisations have campaigned long and hard for the removal of this report. In tabling GARP 3 the Government has recognised the unsatisfactory nature of the lifestyle report and has, in fact, removed it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the changes have gone much further than this with the complete removal of the individual consideration of lifestyle effects. In GARP 3 an imputation system is being adopted whereby a medical impairment rating, with an inconsequential lifestyle loading, is the sole basis upon which determination of disability pension rate is made. As a result of removing individual consideration of lifestyle impairment, there is no recognition of the fact that the same medical impairment may have quite different lifestyle consequences for individual veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consequence of the changes introduced in GARP 3 would be that the only avenue of appeal against a particular assessment would be to challenge the medical impairment rating. In the past, nearly all successful appeals have been based on a challenge to the lifestyle rating assigned to a veteran. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it would appear that GARP 3 is not consistent with the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The removal of the lifestyle rating component from the overall assessment of degree of incapacity appears to be contrary to the concept of incapacity in the Act and could well be challenged in the courts. Subsection 5(9) of the Act and, indeed, the definition of incapacity contained in the glossary of GARP 3, indicates that in assessing incapacity it is not just the medical impairment, but the sum of the effects of the disease or injury on the veteran, including lifestyle, that is to be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, at the front of GARP 3, under the heading `Principles of Treatment', incapacity is defined solely in terms of medical impairment. It is stated that a lifestyle loading is added to the medical impairment rating in order to reflect the effect of an impairment on a person's capacity to function in society and enjoy life. The problem with this is that no matter what the medical impairment rating is, the same lifestyle loading is added. Anyone can see that the lifestyle loading is, therefore, irrelevant. No account is taken of the real effects of impairment on lifestyle. Essentially, the medical impairment alone would determine the rate at which a disability pension is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will argue in its defence that the Returned Services League (RSL) and other ex-service organisations have long sought the abolition of the lifestyle report, and that in tabling GARP 3 it is recognising such demands. This argument, however, fails to address the full extent of the changes made. That the Government has removed the lifestyle report is not a point of contention. Indeed, the Opposition has welcomed the removal of the lifestyle report. The point of contention is that no satisfactory arrangements have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> There seem to be a number of other options available; for instance, a shorter and simpler form. The Department's own determining officers have already indicated that sufficient information on lifestyle could be gained if the number of questions were reduced by 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Another possibility is that the veteran's doctor could provide both lifestyle and medical impairment assessments. This already occurs for those veterans who are assessed for an extreme disablement adjustment (EDA). Under GARP 3, a shortened version of the lifestyle report, completed by the consulting doctor, would be used in assessing EDA pensions. Alternatively, GARP 3 could possibly be acceptable if there were to be an additional provision which would entitle a veteran to have evidence taken into account where it was clear that there was an extreme lifestyle impairment. </PARA>
<PARA> In signalling its intention to disallow GARP 3 nearly a month ago, the Opposition was giving the Government as much time as possible to consult further with ex-service organisations in order to reach agreement on a more satisfactory arrangement which could be put in place. We in the Opposition find that it is extremely disappointing that there is still no agreement after this time between the Government and the ex-service community. The Opposition is forced to pursue this motion of disallowance due only to the Government's intransigence on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Department of Veterans' Affairs proposed that GARP 3 be allowed but with a monitoring committee established to evaluate its operation and report back within 12 months. The Opposition could see some virtue in this proposal but the offer was so strongly rejected by the Returned Services League, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and the Regular and Defence Force Welfare Association that such an arrangement was felt to be totally unsatisfactory by those organisations. They had two reasons for that: firstly, the inequitable provisions in GARP 3 would be allowed to take effect for a period of at least a year; and, secondly, at the end of 12 months the Government would still not be compelled to take any action at all on GARP 3. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that soon after the Department's proposal was rejected, it was decided to abandon serious efforts to provide a compromise agreement. In a briefing note, which was forwarded to me by the Department subsequent to the rejection of the monitoring committee proposal, it was stated that if disallowance were to occur it would have to inform veterans that GARP 2, and thus the lifestyle report, would be reactivated. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it was asserted that, `All the odium will attach to the Opposition and the RSL'. This briefing note was prepared for the Australian Democrats by the Government. The Australian Democrats, I am glad to say, were not seduced by these blandishments and will be supporting today's motion. Without even waiting for the Senate to consider this disallowance motion, it seems that the Department has already sent a letter to current applicants for a war disability pension carrying a message to that effect. The letter completely fails to outline the valid concerns of ex-service organisations with regard to the removal of individual consideration of lifestyle effects in GARP 3, changes which will result in 23 per cent of applicants being worse off than would have been the case under GARP 2. </PARA>
<PARA> In distributing such a letter, the Department is resorting to shameless and quite unnecessary abuse of its role, which ought to be to keep its clients fairly and accurately informed on issues of relevance to them. If the lifestyle report is reinstated as a result of this disallowance motion, then it is the Government and not the Opposition which must be taken to task for allowing this situation to occur. The Opposition will not allow veterans to be deceived and misled by the Government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I again repeat that the Government has given the Opposition no choice but to press for a disallowance of GARP 3. Ex-service organisations have indicated clearly that GARP 3, for the reasons I have outlined, is quite unsatisfactory. They are prepared to suffer under GARP 2 for a little longer in order that a satisfactory alternative can be found. If the Government cares about compensating those who fought for our country, then it must recognise that GARP 3 is seriously flawed and cannot be allowed to come into operation. It is up to the Government in consultation with the ex-service community to sit down and determine as quickly as possible an acceptable alternative to GARP 2 and the lifestyle report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disgraceful that the Government has been so determined to have its own way in this matter that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Humphreys, is prepared to have his Department conduct a scare campaign to vilify the veterans' organisations and the Opposition-a campaign which will frighten elderly veterans. Unlike the Government, the Opposition does not have a hidden agenda. We are determined to fight for the best interests of the veterans and thus must take the action that we take today. The veterans' interests must come before administrative convenience or cost cutting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support this disallowance motion. Senator Newman has very adequately traversed the ground which justifies the disallowance. I think honourable senators are aware of the fact that the veterans' community in this country is very suspicious of what is happening to its entitlements and that has created a very negative climate. That negative psyche and climate places specific focus on this instrument, GARP 2 and the proposed GARP 3.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am grateful for the briefing notes that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has given to me on this issue over the last two weeks. They are comprehensive. I am not going to canvass all the points raised in them. I would simply like to cite the fact that the dissatisfaction has a very long history. Veterans in this country have resented the lifestyle questionnaire from the beginning. It is something on which they find it very difficult to compromise. It is an area of deep resentment and conjecture and the simple realities are that the processes of consultation between veterans' organisations, the Commission and the Department have not adequately resolved the odium and problems surrounding this instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> Veterans' disability is assessed in two ways. On the one hand, there is a medical judgment about where they are at in medical terms, and then there is the second dimension to the judgment and that is how they live their lives-in other words, their lifestyle. These two are merged together and it is the second aspect which is seen as being particularly unacceptable by veterans. On the one hand, they have gone before a medical assessment process which arrives at some assessment of disability; on the other hand, they are asked questions about how they live: do they garden, do they shop, do they drive cars, do they carry shopping bags? Frankly, they find it very difficult to bring the two together. </PARA>
<PARA> Veterans cite the fact that this intrusive questioning about how one lives one's life in terms of determining whether one is entitled to a benefit has been an extraordinary dimension of the process. This deep dissatisfaction expresses itself in their attitude towards the instruments that have been devised over a period of time. Naturally, the veterans' organisations have carried the flag and they have been doing that for a long time. The processes of consultation seem to be coming along, but they have been frustrated very much in the last week or so by what Senator Newman cites as being a very unfortunate letter which emanated from the Commission and which has muddied the water yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that the question has to be resolved as quickly as possible. The solution does not lie in the regulations in their present form. We believe that we need to disallow in order to allow a more constructive and positive resumption of the processes of consultation. That belief is based on a clear perception of the fact that the resentment within the veterans community is so profound. In the briefing note that was given to me-I am grateful for it-by the Department, the first point made is that veterans detest the lifestyle report and have protested vigorously about it. That is a strong acknowledgment of what is out there. </PARA>
<PARA> The second briefing point, and I do not have time to go into the details, was that the Returned Services League and other ex-service organisations have repeatedly called for the abolition of the lifestyle report and not for its modification. That is a statement of the entrenched position on the part of veterans' peak organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The third heading in the briefing note says that the Repatriation Commission was initially opposed to the abolition of the lifestyle report. In other words, it took the opposite position. That is the entrenched problem which exists. It is the feeling of the Democrats, in support of the Opposition and specifically Senator Newman's motion, that what is presently proposed is still unacceptable. It needs more deliberation; it needs a spirit of cooperation which is not there now but which needs to be achieved as quickly as possible. Not only is there resentment but there is also confusion among veterans. They happen to be a group of people who, because of their circumstances and ages, are confused by complex things. As was mentioned in debate the other day, a person who is very expert in these matters says that Australian legislation affecting veterans is among the most complex in the world. That all gives rise to an attitude of suspicion in the veterans' community. When that attitude is reinforced by intrusive questionnaires about how one leads one's life in an attempt to determine or influence outcomes of entitlement, we are dealing with a vexed situation indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats think it is appropriate to disallow at the moment, hopefully to achieve a period of intensive and more constructive consultation in order to arrive at something which is not only satisfactory to veterans but which also fulfils the acknowledged administrative needs of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with a motion to disallow the third edition of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions (GARP), the main feature of which is the abolition of the lifestyle report. Senator Newman has indicated that the move is at the request of the Returned Services League (RSL). I understand that the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council has supported that move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The guide was introduced with the enactment of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in May 1986, the purpose of the document being to introduce equity and consistency into the assessment of veterans' disability pensions which was not present under the repealed Repatriation Act. The adverse effect of war-caused disablement on veterans' lifestyle is a component taken into account in assessing rates of pension under the guide. The lifestyle report is a questionnaire used to gather information about lifestyle effects for the purposes of pension assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the RSL wanted to do away with the lifestyle report used to arrive at pension assessments. For some time the veteran community and the Opposition have berated the Repatriation Commission and the Government for using such a long, complex and intrusive form. The Commission was initially opposed to the abolition of the report and it was only after persistent pressure from the ex-service community and after being convinced that a fair system could be devised that it agreed to abolish the questionnaire. </PARA>
<PARA> In June this year the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) announced this decision to spontaneous applause from his RSL audience and, I understand, praise from the Opposition, including Senator Newman. This was the major change in the new guide. The report was done away with and replaced with a method which imputed a lifestyle rating to veterans seeking an increase in pension without any intrusion into their private lives and without any fuss. The system takes into account lifestyle effects as a result of medical impairment from war-caused disabilities. An automatically allocated lifestyle loading is added to the impairment level in order to assess the pension rate. The level of the loading increases as the level of impairment increases. Furthermore, the new process would have resulted in a greater number of veterans receiving an acceptable rate of pension in the first instance without having to go through lengthy and worrying appeal processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, it seems, the RSL is saying there was not adequate consultation and that what it really wanted was to replace the questionnaire nobody wanted with another questionnaire. The Senate might like to know that this would be the third attempt at such a questionnaire. The last attempt was the result of considerable effort by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, involving the RSL, other veterans' organisations and a professor from Griffith University who is an expert in form design. It worked well at getting the answers but everybody hated it. The RSL now wants to try again. Meanwhile, by disallowing the new guide, the RSL and the Opposition will once again try veterans' patience by imposing the present questionnaire on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The third edition of the guide we are discussing today stems from a review of the previous guide, which was carried out on the recommendations of the Veterans' Entitlements Act monitoring committee. It is not something which has been arrived at in a hurry. There has been consultation with the ex-service community in designing this third edition. Consul- tation began in 1989 when 20 ex-service organisations were invited to make written submissions. Nine organisations, including the RSL, responded and their comments were taken into account. The Services member of the Repatriation Commission attended a number of ex-service organisations meetings and conferences where he canvassed problems arising from the lifestyle report and reactions to the possible abolition of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the review team had designed a proposed set of changes, including the abolition of the report, the RSL and other major ex-service organisations were provided with copies of the team's recommendations for comment. On 5 July this year the National Secretary of the RSL was given a briefing about the decision on the new method of imputing lifestyle in the assessment of pension. The President and the Secretary of the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council were given a briefing by the leader of the team. A group of senior RSL Veterans' Review Board advocates was also briefed. The last meeting gave rise to a letter from the National Secretary of the RSL, which read in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Although I was not present when you attended our meeting last Friday which reviewed the Report on GARP II, I understand that your comments made the meeting all the more successful with a greater understanding resulting for all present. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the veteran community had a more than adequate opportunity to make its views known. In any case, of the hundreds of official and personal representations to the Minister and to the Repatriation Commission received before and after the abolition of the report was announced, there were no more than a handful which argued for its retention or for anything other than abolition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern raised is that many veterans would be disadvantaged by the report. Let me give the Senate the facts. Firstly, the new process would remove any intrusion into personal privacy. Secondly, it is estimated that by using the new system the great majority of veterans would automatically receive at least the same rate of pension as they would by using the present scheme. Statistical analysis of pension assessments by the Department of Veterans' Affairs indicates that 77 per cent would receive a higher or the same level of pension under the revised guide as they received by the completion of a lifestyle report under the present scheme. Those veterans who would receive a marginally lower pension would, in the main, be at the lower end of the impairment rating scale. There was no Government directive to cut costs or lessen compensation to veterans by introduction of the revised scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, removal of the report would enable the Department to process applications for increase more quickly. The only exception to the arrangements concerns the very small number of applications for the extreme disablement adjustment allowance, which is currently about 350 per year. The law requires an assessment of lifestyle before the allowance can be granted. Applicants will continue to be individually assessed by medical staff and reports on lifestyle submitted to determining officers. Savings provisions would protect those who currently have a higher pension rate than assessed under the new edition of the guide, unless their condition has improved significantly or the assessment was based on false or misleading information. This means that no veteran could have his or her existing pension reduced by application of the revised guide. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise again that abolishing the lifestyle report is in response to the veteran community's demand for years that this be done. The Government has received hundreds of representations asking for its removal and much praise for finally removing it. The media, the Opposition in this House and in the House of Representatives and the ex-service organisations have consistently argued that the lifestyle report is an invasion of privacy, a cumbersome imposition on ageing veterans and even a trick to reduce pensions. This is not true, yet the Government believed it should react positively to this process. That is why the report is being removed. It will be replaced with a more efficient system which is fair and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatives were considered by the Repatriation Commission, including the possibility of making the report entirely optional. It did not take long to reject this option because it discriminates in favour of the better educated and the more articulate against the less educated and more reticent, of whom there are many in the veteran community. Simplifying the questionnaire was tried with the present form but has obviously failed to satisfy veterans. Designing a new form which would be short enough to please the veteran community would produce a document which has no place in a fair system for determining veterans' disability pensions. The only other option would be to have those same questions asked at an interview. This would obviously require an increase in public servants employed to process claims and therefore increase costs. More importantly, it would still be seen as an invasion of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other point I must make: the Repatriation Commission, in the spirit of compromise, offered to set up a monitoring committee for the guide. The committee would have comprised the Services member of the Commission, a departmental representative and two nominees of the ex-service community. The committee would have monitored the implementation of the revised guide for the first 12 months. The Commission undertook to correct any demonstrable anomalies or faults in the new guide. The proposal was totally rejected on the day it was made by the RSL and the Veterans and Defence Services Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Veterans who have claims currently before the Department will now have to be issued with lifestyle reports to complete. Lifestyle reports were not issued in recent months in anticipation of the third edition of the guide becoming effective. These veterans are now being advised by letter of the uncertainty of the third edition becoming effective and, as a consequence, are being advised to complete lifestyle reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The RSL and the Opposition have issued media releases attempting to distance themselves from the results of their action by complaining that the Repatriation Commission is biased and is not giving veterans the full story in these letters to them. But the letters are intended to do nothing more than explain why veterans will have to complete lifestyle reports. This they do adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I can only repeat that the purpose in abolishing the lifestyle report was to provide veterans with a fair and equitable compensation system without the need for intrusion into their personal lives. This represents a compassionate approach, responsive to the wishes of the veteran community, rather than any attempt to disadvantage them. For these reasons, the late objections to the revised guide appear misguided and out of touch with the wider veteran community. I ask senators to reject the motion of disallowance, as this would lead to a return to the questionnaire which veterans find so objectionable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -in reply-The Government says that there has been more than adequate opportunity for the veterans to make their views known about the second Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions (GARP 2). There certainly was but the problem was that the veterans did not know what the Government was proposing to put in its place, and that is where adequate consultation did not take place. Obviously the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) was reading a brief and did not understand that. It is also clear, from the Parliamentary Secretary's response and from the briefings we have had, that efficiency has been the paramount consideration in this issue. The Government has not been concerned so much with justice. In fact, the information from the Department of Veterans' Affairs shows that 23 per cent of veterans will be losers under the new proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government seems to be saying to us, `If you don't have my solution, well then you can't have any solution', although the Government and everybody else have recognised that the previous solution was unsatisfactory. The Parliamentary Secretary said that this is the third attempt. Does that mean that it is the last attempt or is he not willing to try any harder for our veterans? We think he should try again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Secretary also says that it is the Returned Services League and the Opposition-he is repeating the furphy that has been put out to the veterans-that are forcing a lifestyle report back on veterans. In fact, it is the Government that is doing so by its intransigence. He also mentioned the fact that the lifestyle reports have not been used in the last few months. I ask how the Parliamentary Secretary can get by without the lifestyle reports in the last few months, yet he is not prepared to get by without them in the next few months while further negotiations take place. Quite clearly in the interests of justice and if he really cared about the veterans he would operate on that basis. If the Government insists on the lifestyle report, it is on the Government's head. I thank the Australian Democrats for their support because they obviously are more in touch with the problems being faced by the veterans than the Government is. </PARA>
<PARA> I support exactly what Senator McLean said, that is, that this is an issue which must be resolved as quickly as possible; that there must be constructive consultation; that this disallowance motion is simply designed to allow that to happen; and that the resentment in the veterans' community is profound. Senator McLean is absolutely accurate on those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Summing up and putting it in a nutshell, these regulations would give no recognition to the differences of lifestyle impairment between a clerk who loses his thumb and a pianist who loses his thumb. Blind Freddy and surely any senator with any compassion or understanding and certainly with any intelligence would recognise that there is a good deal of difference in lifestyle impairment when a clerk loses a thumb and when a pianist loses a thumb. </PARA>
<PARA> I am astonished that the Government has refused to acknowledge that basic fact and also that the Government is having to be forced into reconsidering this whole matter. We are not taking this action lightly. We believe it is a serious matter when the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) have so little concern for the veterans' community that efficiency in administration has taken precedence over justice and compassion for our veterans' community. Therefore, we are forced by the Government to take this action to require proper, meaningful consultation and to find a proper solution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A debate on the northern prawn fisheries voluntary adjustment scheme may not attract a lot of Australians to turn on their television or radio to listen, but it is important to the people who are involved in it. Australia is only small in the fishing business by world standards but, to the people who are involved, and in the areas in which it is involved, it is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this particular case the Opposition supports the legislation and the revised amendment to the northern prawn fishery management plan. Before I get under way I pay tribute to all sections of the industry for the constructive way that they approached the problems evident in the original plan and also thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) for his flexible attitude to the amendments and to the revised management plan. There were days and days and hours and hours of discussions, visits and calls to try to improve the original proposal that was put forward. This whole exercise demonstrates what can be achieved with a little bit of goodwill and a lot of commonsense. I am most grateful to the people who were involved in the way that the matter was discussed. I am not saying that everybody is satisfied because, of course, in a deal of this magnitude they cannot be. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been involved with the fishing industry ever since I came into the Senate 15 years ago. I am well aware of the problems and the difficulties. I also understand only too well the difficulties associated with fishery management, particularly in the overexploited areas. In the northern prawn fishery there is the classic situation of excess capacity with the resulting danger of overexploitation and economic ruin. The industry has had this problem for a number of years, and this is the first time that there is some real hope that the problem can be remedied. </PARA>
<PARA> All concerned-the Government, the Opposition and all sections of the industry-agree that there is a need for industry restructuring and also that, although there may be some reservations, the optimum size of the industry is somewhere near this 50,000 A-class units, based almost wholly on the economic evidence. The main argument, it seems, is how we are going to reduce the current fishing effort of 96,170 units to 50,000 or, to all intents and purposes, how we will half the present effort. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the enhanced buy-back scheme did not achieve the results that the industry had hoped for. A more drastic plan was needed to be worked up; hence the proposal tabled in this place on 9 November. It would have been an impossibility to devise a management plan to please everybody. When we take out half of the fleet, we must hurt somebody. Therefore, it is quite remarkable that a compromise solution was arrived at in a relatively short time to appease most of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The amended plan overcomes to a considerable extent the main industry concerns, if not the individual concerns, which we cannot really expect ever to do. We are all concerned with the profitability of this most important fishery and the Opposition would want to see a healthy, profitable industry remaining. The best advice available to me indicates that the profitability in the fishery has declined to a very great extent. The prices for both banana and tiger prawns on overseas markets fell by about 40 per cent in 1989, and the low prices have extended well into 1990. This decline in price was a direct result of competition from other places and particularly from the farm-grown prawns. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read an article recently in a journal called INFOFISH International of May 1990 which makes reference to some of these things. We have only to look at the size of the industry to understand the concerns. Australia's industry amounts to an average of approximately 10,000 tonnes catch per year; whereas the world catch is 2.7 million tonnes. So what Australia does really does not make much difference, but what happens in the rest of the world makes a lot of difference to Australia's share of the market in other places. This journal goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> For example, in Taiwan alone, there are now about 2,000 shrimp hatcheries and 40 feed mill plants . . . Thailand with about 50,000 ha of shrimp farms now has 15 feed manufacturing plants and more than 1,500 family-owned and operated hatcheries . . . two of the largest hatcheries in Thailand have a combined monthly output of over 40 million postlarvae . . . In Thailand alone, more than 10,000 ha of new ponds were constructed in the last few years . . . Indonesia and the Philippines likewise added another 4,000 ha and 8,000 ha of new ponds respectively . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The real pressure on the world market for Australian prawns is going to come from the Eastern countries. For instance, in China in 1988 the output reached nearly 200,000 tonnes, and China is ranked as the top producer with more than 22 per cent of the world output. These are the sorts of figures that we need to take into account when we bear in mind that Australia produces 10,000 tonnes a year. Prices are coming down on an international basis and the costs are still going up, particularly for the wild prawns and the fuel costs that go with it. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics considers that prawn prices will continue to fall. It also considers that in the long run the optimal fleet size will be about 100 boats, about 80 of which could be less than 370 units. In the absence of better advice to the contrary and with the concurrence of every industry group, the Opposition is accepting this target as being where we have to head. </PARA>
<PARA> We also realise that, should this target not be achieved by 1 April 1993, a compulsory proportionate reduction must take effect. We all hope that the target can be reached without compulsion. Nobody on this side of the chamber wants to see compulsory acquisitions and compulsory wind-downs, but it happens with grocery stores, with dairy farms and all over the place. The economic circumstances are changing from day to day. </PARA>
<PARA> We just hope that the fishermen will be able to see that, although fishing may have been their way of life, circumstances may now well have passed them by and they may have to readjust, as it is euphemistically called. We know that we cannot satisfy everybody and that this is going create problems with the sale of large numbers of well-equipped boats in good condition. But we have to accept the position and the fishermen have to accept it also. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme that we are now proposing must be made to work. In the past 10 years we have had many plans that have not produced the results that we hoped for. This is not the end of the industry. I hope that it is the beginning of a new, modernised, improved and more profitable industry. We just hope that everybody will be able to settle in and that the industry will be stronger and better than ever. We do not want to see it go to the compulsory closure and acquisition stage. We support the proposition before us because we believe that it is the best alternative for us at this stage. </PARA>

However, I would just like to make a few comments about the management plan, together with its amendments, which is what this loan guarantee is all about. This debate finally comes down not so much to a debate about fishing but more to a debate about bureaucracy and the administration of the downsizing of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has already been said that, in any rearrangement of any industry where something is wound down, somebody has to lose. I do not accept that. I think it is possible for the losses to be shared equitably amongst those who are presently participating in the industry. That is what the bureaucratic side is about: there is the capacity to ensure that any losses that occur are shared fairly and equitably across the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It may also be said-and it has been said in another place already-that consultation has taken place. Superficially that is true. There has been a great amount of information-gathering taking place. There has been a great amount of representation to those who are formulating the management plan, but I suggest that what we see before us in the management plan and its amendments so far is evidence that the Government and those who have been negotiating have been incapable of synthesising into one concise plan the information that has been presented to bring about a resolution which is fair and equitable for all concerned. The ramifications of the implementation of the present management plan are that some will lose more and some will lose less. Those who will lose more are those that I am concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I detail my concerns, I would like to place it on record that we are in complete agreement with the sorts of things that were said in the other place in the passage of this loan guarantee amendment in November. For example, I will quote statements made by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who said:</PARA>
<PARA>The policy statement-</PARA>
<PARA>which was originally issued by Minister Kerin-</PARA>
<PARA>placed particular emphasis on the need to ensure that fisheries resources are not over exploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not take any issue whatsoever with that statement, and it gains the Democrats' complete support. Another statement which was made, which I was very pleased to see, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>These objectives are entirely consistent with the Government's policy of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA>That phrase is becoming much more common in claims that are made by the Government. Another thing which the honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned in his speech on this matter was that the community return legislation which would be subsequent to this was designed to return to the community some sort of recompense for the fact that its resource was being used. Further on there was this suggestion:</PARA>
<PARA>An industry-government committee has been established to ensure a continuing high degree of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>These are fine sounding words, but I suggest that the trawlers who are involved in this industry are typically independent individuals and perhaps not easy to unite in support of what they see as outside interference in their industry. That has been the difficulty for the Government in formulating the management plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received about 200 letters on this matter. Although I am pleased to say that the latest proposal actually meets most of the concerns, as far as I can tell there are still some unresolved matters. In respect of the resolution of some of the concerns of those involved in the industry, I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said in a speech in the lower House that the coalition parties are still considering the fairness of the plan. I am aware that Senator Boswell is also of the view that the problems that some people in the industry foresaw should be taken into account. The Democrats share those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very glad that Senator Macdonald is in the chamber at the moment. The Democrats are often accused of agreeing with the Government without giving consideration to legislation. For some reason the honourable senator fails to recognise the importance of the negotiation process which can take place and the occasions on which the coalition and the Democrats agree to carefully examine legislation. That negotiation will continue while ever we agree that there is a problem with legislation. Negotiation did continue in this case. The Democrats took seriously the threat of the disallowance of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed to say that I do not believe all of the problems have been resolved. I am disappointed that an agreement was reached at such an early stage. As far as I can see, there is a problem with clause 3, which sets out the general outline. Under that amendment, the units which would be taken into account for cancellation will now become active class A units instead of all being class A units. I think the effect of that simple change may have been unforeseen by those who proposed it. The effect is that 19 out of 58 trawlers will be seen to be doing very well out of this rearrangement and 39 others will be seen to be doing not as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me be explicit. Operators who at the time of implementation had some suspense units-for example, 100 suspense units-which were originally intended to provide for the upgrading of trawlers and who had not used those suspense units over the six years to upgrade their trawlers, will now be in a very advantageous position compared with those operators who have efficient trawlers and who had taken advantage of their suspense units to upgrade. Most of the operators in the latter category have no debt. But they will have to go into debt in order to continue in the industry. I believe that that is inequitable. This inequity can be resolved by not implementing the amendment to apply active class A units. I hope that the Government will see that this would be a sensible course of action. I hope that this matter can be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> We do not have the capacity in this legislation to change this arrangement because agreement has already been reached. In the reduction to 20,000 units, smaller boats will get 890 units and the remaining 70 boats will get only 300-odd. As far as I can see, the only other possible solution-and this has been raised in negotiations-would be the overall implementation of quotas. That is not really a satisfactory way of resolving this matter. The imposition of quotas has been raised and dismissed as a way of getting over this problem. This would not be the best way of proceeding. I do not think we should support quotas. However, the imposition of quotas would be fairer to those who have to carry the burden of this cost than what is proposed now. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the passage of the loan guarantee legislation. However, I do not think that the management plan, which is consequential upon the legislation, is as fair as it might be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about that. The Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Amendment Bill 1990 is very complex legislation and is very difficult to understand. The honourable senator made some points which I would like to explore. Although the legislation is complex, after listening to the honourable senator it sounds much more complex. I wonder whether some of the comments that the honourable senator made are accurate or are relevant to the plan and the Bill which is before us. If the honourable senator wanted to be taken seriously, he probably would not have supported the Government's guillotine motion. This would have allowed us to discuss the Bill fully and properly. People do not take the Democrats seriously because they side with the lot on the other side of the chamber whenever serious matters come up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I continually like to remind my southern colleagues-and I stress `southern' colleagues-that northern Australia, with around 5.6 per cent of the population, produces almost half of this country's export income. One industry which illustrates the export ethos of northern Australia best is the northern prawn fishery, which covers an area extending from the tip of Cape York across to Broome in Western Australia. Over 90 per cent of the annual catch is exported, almost exclusively to Japan. Between the present 215 boats which comprise the fishery, total production for 1990-91 is estimated at being worth about $170m. The industry is particularly important to north Queensland, which I principally represent in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> About 85 boats which are licensed to work in the northern prawn fishery are based in Cairns and Innisfail, on the east coast of far-north Queensland. In addition, a number of other boats are located at Karumba, in the north Queensland Gulf country. Behind sugar, fishing is the biggest primary producer in the Cairns region, earning around $200m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 10 years there have been a number of developments which have put the future of the fishing industry in jeopardy. The main problem has been the size of the fleet, which has resulted in overfishing. There is evidence that the resource itself is being depleted. Every resource industry, such as the northern prawn fishery, has a finite capacity for exploitation. There are only a limited number of prawns which can be caught in each season. Eventually a point is reached where more fishermen does not mean a larger catch but instead means a slimmer profit margin for the operators. </PARA>
<PARA> All parties seem to agree that the present size of the fishery needs to be reduced from the present 215 boats or 96,000 units. As Senator Archer mentioned, perhaps the greatest competition has come from the aquaculture industry. This threat to the industry is set to increase. I am told that grown or farmed prawns have a noticeable difference in taste compared with the trawled product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably right. Having lived in the north and experienced, as Senator Boswell has, this fresh product straight off the trawlers, I can certainly vouch for its quality. I am impressed that the free range producers-as one might call them-are looking towards marketing the fresh product as `wild seafresh prawns' as opposed to the farmed product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before us provides for an increase to the limit of commercial borrowings to fund the adjustment scheme for which the Commonwealth will provide with a government guarantee. The existing Act provides a government guarantee for loans of up to $5m. This amendment Bill will increase the limit to $40.9m. While it is not actually a part of this Bill, the Government has also approved a government grant of $5m over the next three years from the national fisheries adjustment program to help fund the adjustment scheme by providing an initial pool for payment of principal and interest on the borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Archer has mentioned, we support the Bill itself. We did have a number of grave concerns about the Government's amendment to the plan-which of course is not a part of this Bill but which was gazetted at the same time. As Senator Bell has acknowledged and as Senator Archer has mentioned, it is indeed pleasant that all parties were able to get together to look through the plan and, through very wide consultation with the industry, come up with a set of regulations which generally suit everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I should make reference to Senator Archer and his office. They did an enormous amount of work in liaising with the industry and the Government and pointed out some rather glaring errors in the plan as it was proposed originally. Through this wide consultation process a plan has now been developed which has fairly widespread and general support. </PARA>
<PARA> I did intend to go through the provisions of the Bill at some length but, as our time has been restricted-a fact which has been made very clear in the case of a number of pieces of legislation-I will not be able to give the individual clauses and the details of the plan the attention that I would have liked to give them. But I can say that whilst we in the Liberal and National parties support the Bill and the northern prawn fishery plan in its amended form, I am concerned at the prospect of a resource rent tax being imposed on operators in the northern prawn fishery. It is implicit in the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that, whilst there are no provisions in this Bill for a resource rent tax, it is in fact the Government's intention to bring in such a tax at some time in the future. The Minister mentioned in his speech that he was thinking about effecting this resource rent tax, possibly as soon as autumn 1991. In the closing lines of his second reading speech Mr Kerin said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has made no secret of the fact that it expects industry to share some of the new profits which result from this restructuring with the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's view is that where genuine new profits are made arising from the exploitation of a community resource for private gain, the industry will share a portion of those profits with the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA>I was not aware that prawn fishermen were any different from other people who are trying to eke out a living during these difficult times. Prawn fishermen pay their income tax, capital gains tax, provisional tax, fuel tax-and what a lot of that they pay-and so on. Why should they have to pay another tax which is custom-made for them? Anyone can see that if they make some more money out of the industry-and I hope that will happen as a result of the restructuring-they will pay more income tax on that money. Why another tax should be foisted upon these people who are trying to make a living is beyond me and I condemn the Government for even thinking of it. On the one hand, the Government is trying to do something for the industry and the people who are working in it by making it more profitable through a voluntary buyback scheme and, on the other hand, it is going to take back any profits that might be made by way of a resource rent tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell is right. There is a bait there and regrettably it is leading to this resource rent tax. No doubt the Democrats will join us in opposing that when the time comes because it seems to me to be quite ridiculous. This is a renewable resource. The life of a prawn is about 18 months and the resource will renew itself if it is not overfished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My restricted time is almost up, but I again ask Minister Kerin to look very seriously at this matter before he implements any resource tax. In fact, he told the industry some time ago that he did not think he would live long enough to see the day that the northern prawn fishery would be profitable enough to afford a resource rent tax. Not long after he had said that, he turned around and flagged that that tax will be coming. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the measures that this legislation will implement. I think the fisheries plan, owing to the good work that has been done by all parties, is as close as we will get to the right thing. We believe it is going in the right direction and we certainly support it. But I hope that the good work that has been done by this legislation and the plan is not spoiled when next autumn the Government's attention is again drawn to the northern prawn fishery when it is looking at implementing this resource rent tax. I urge support for this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Amendment Bill 1990. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a government grant of $5m for a loan guarantee for commercial borrowings up to $40.9m over a number of years in an effort to reduce the number of units in what is generally accepted to be an overfished area. At the moment there are 96,000 units and there has been an agreement to bring that number down to 50,000. Some people say that 50,000 is too low and that 70,000 units would be a more realistic approach. Nevertheless, under the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Committee resolution 23 there was an agreement to reduce the number of units to 50,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that time the Government brought in a plan that was going to be fair to some and unfair to many. The smaller one-and two-boat owners in particular-were going to be almost driven out of the fishery because of the Government's plan. I must pay tribute to Senator Archer today because he has borne the brunt of the difficulty in bringing all of the parties together to come up with a conclusion that is accepted by most of the industry. As a matter of fact, I have before me a number of telexes sent from all sections of the industry asking me to support the conclusion that Senator Archer has reached with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 the Government approached us with a similar buyback scheme which was unfair and which would have resulted in a number of people losing their livelihoods. We rejected that scheme in the Senate when we moved to oppose the regulation. As a result of that the fishermen decided that they would bring in their own voluntary adjustment scheme. They reduced the unit capacity from 133,274 to 96,400 and reduced the number of boats from 302 to 217. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been problems with that voluntary adjustment scheme. The scheme ran out of money when it needed it most-at the beginning of this year when the prawn catch was down. A number of boats would have been on sale. Unfortunately, at that time the voluntary adjustment scheme lacked money and therefore could not take the effort out when it was most needed. There are now 217 boats in the fishery. </PARA>
<PARA> Originally, everyone agreed with the proposal now before the Senate. After some investigation some came up with problems that would affect them. I say to those people: the Senate-I include the Australian Democrats, the Government and this side-has done its level best to accommodate all sections of the industry. I have had representations from the smaller fishermen, who told me that they would go bankrupt if we were to accept the Government's original plan, and from the very big fleet holders, who said that they would be in trouble if we were not to accept the Government's plan. My advice to them was, `There is not one section of the industry or the Parliament that doesn't agree that the effort has to be reduced in the fishery. Can't you go out there, talk to each other and come up with something that will be acceptable to the whole industry?'. That is exactly what happened. They went out and talked amongst themselves. After two or three days we received a proposal that had been put together by Senator Archer. It had the general acceptance of the industry. I think that about 17 or 18 boats are unhappy. I say to them: I am sorry that we cannot accommodate you but we have done our best to look after all sections of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the new scheme there will be a buy-back price of $950 per unit up until April 1993. That should remove a great number of people from the industry. Fishermen will be able to sell their units for $500 for an A-class unit, and a further $450 as compensation to get that effort out of the fishery by April 1993. If, after the beginning of the season in April 1993, the effort has not been reduced to 50,000 units, all boat owners left in the fishery will have to surrender a proportion of their units so as to allow the fishery to come down to 50,000 units. The industry has two years to adjust. Hopefully, with this $950 incentive that applies before April 1991, a lot of effort will be removed from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now refer to the rent resource tax. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) he states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to ensure that fisheries resources are not over exploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He said that, to maximise economic efficiencies in the exploitation of resources, the Government would collect an appropriate charge from the individual fishermen exploiting the community resource for private gain. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week-or it may have been this week-we received a discussion paper on resource rent in fisheries. That discussion paper stated that it had been written for fishermen. But if fishermen cannot understand it they should not think that they are mentally retarded. Everyone down here is finding it very difficult to understand this Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics discussion paper on resource rent fisheries. I have given it to some of the best researchers in the Parliament and they are having difficulty. When people write such papers they should write them so that 99 per cent of the population can understand them. I make that plea on behalf of the normal people out there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the case, it has certainly achieved a 100 per cent result. Today we examined the Budget Papers and found that last year there were 288,000 fishing licences. It is estimated that the amount will increase to 733,000 in the coming year. That is a huge jump of 154 per cent in an item that usually goes up only marginally. Yet time and time again Mr Kerin has told us that in his lifetime-Senator Macdonald referred to this-there will not be a rent resource tax. There was then a recommendation in the Budget for a rent resource tax. I approached the Government and it denied that there would be a rent resource tax for two years. Yet here we find that there is an estimated increase of 733,000 in the coming year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A rent resource tax seems to be socialism in its worst form. Fishermen pay their taxes and their sales taxes. They make tremendous inputs just so they can get out and fish. They will now be partners with the Government, which will take what it calls super profits. I do not know too many fishermen who have made super profits. In the last couple of years they have been battling just to hold on. </PARA>
<PARA> I am being told to finish my speech and I do so by asking this: where does a rent resource tax stop? Do we put it on beekeepers? Do we put it on kangaroo shooters? Where does it end? I should not have mentioned those as I have probably encouraged the Government to do some sums and place this charge on the other industries which are not paying it at the moment. My time is up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Development Association (IDA), as the soft loan window of the World Bank, is one of the main contributors to development in the poorest developing countries. Between 1990 and 1993, the IDA plans to lend $9.3 billion in soft loans for its core poverty program. These loans are interest free, repayable over 35 to 40 years and have grace periods of 10 years. They are, therefore, practically no different from grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without the contribution of the IDA, the problems of poverty in the poorer developing countries would be much worse than they are now. Though in many cases, particularly in subSaharan Africa, it is clear that the impact of the IDA and other international or bilateral aid agencies on the massive problems of poverty and population growth have often been disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic stagnation, rapid population growth and the vicious cycle of poverty in the world's poorest countries are problems of concern to all Australians. Starvation and the threat of starvation faced by poor people in the least developed countries are the most obvious manifestations of the problems facing these countries. I am sure of strong support through all sections of the Australian community for humanitarian assistance to those countries to provide food and shelter to people stricken by drought and other man-made or natural disasters, and facing starvation. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance to develop the economies of the poorer countries in the longer term is urgently needed in order to prevent poverty and to obviate the need to rely on charity from wealthier countries. This will take time but action is urgently needed to prevent a looming disaster which also poses serious environmental dangers that should not be ignored. Alleviation of poverty and improvement of health and education services are essential prerequisites for the slowing of population increases which, if not slowed, would threaten the environment not only of the poor countries but of the whole world. Desertification and the loss of tropical rainforests are global problems that call for global solutions. The slash and burn agriculture and traditional livestock practices of the burgeoning poor are destroying forests at a faster rate than production for timber.</PARA>
<PARA> We should also not forget an economic motive. Economic growth in the poorer countries can fuel world trade and provide benefits to the donor countries as well as to the recipients. Until recently, when the combined effect of a slowdown in world trade and the rate of liberalisation of their economies slowed their growth, India and China were starting to have such an effect on world trade. Australia would also be a beneficiary to such growth in world trade, although we would be less likely to benefit if we failed to become more internationally competitive in a wide range of industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The IDA provides funds for much needed infrastructure in health, education and other essential services, without which the poorer developing countries would have little hope of ever escaping from the grip of poverty. The funds provided by IDA are seldom sufficient to meet the needs of these countries, for investment, domestic savings and investment are also critical, as is private overseas investment. Without funds from IDA the needs for investment in essential public infrastructure simply could not be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The case for assistance to the IDA by Australia is therefore clear. Like the World Bank in general, the IDA contributes more to development than funds at concessional rates. Its role in policy dialogue to ensure that economic policies are in place to maximise the benefits of IDA is just as important. The desperate need of the poorest countries for funds unfortunately does not mean that these funds cannot be wasted. Quite the contrary; it is often the case that the countries with people most in need of assistance have governments that are willing to waste scarce resources on military spending or other luxuries that they cannot afford or allow funds to be siphoned off into offshore bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not an argument for not giving assistance to these countries. Rather it suggests that funds must only be given if strict conditions are attached together with the provision of a capacity to monitor performance in relation to those conditions. The World Bank does not always manage to enforce its conditions but it does manage to have successes in the longer term, which could not be achieved as easily through other channels. For example, bilateral aid is not usually on a scale sufficient to have the impact on government priorities that the large international banks can have. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian assistance to the IDA, as a proportion of the total aid budget, has risen steadily over recent years from 9.1 per cent in 1986-87 to 14.1 per cent in 1990-91. As the real level of the total aid budget has been whittled down, the decision to maintain contributions to the international development banks has meant that the proportion going to them has increased significantly. The effect of this has been to eat into the proportion of the budget available for the bilateral aid programs to the point where we spend almost as much on the banks as we do on the bilateral programs in South East Asia. This is something that the Opposition believes is undesirable as bilateral programs are able to give rise to benefits which are more tangible for the Australian community, being located in countries with which we have a wide range of ties.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the Government's allocation of the highest priority to maintaining its level of support to the development banks has been made at the same time that it has failed to set a multi-year commitment to the bilateral program in Indonesia, one of our closest neighbours with whom we have ties of political, defence and economic significance. Indonesia has an outstanding record in poverty reduction, but it still has many people living in poverty particularly in the eastern region closest to Australia. It is in the interests of both Indonesia and Australia that this poverty is eradicated. Similarly, priority has been given to the maintenance of support for the banks at a time when a commitment just entered into with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Government had to be abrogated. Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) could explain why this absolute priority was given to the international banks. </PARA>
<PARA> When this question was asked in the other place, the answer, which came interestingly from Mr Langmore, explained the level specified in the Bill as `the contribution we are asked to make in roughly proportional terms with previous contributions, less a little'. This simply begs the question of the level of priority. Apart from the cost in terms of squeezing the bilateral program, the apparent readiness of Australia to answer the call by the international development banks for further funds does nothing to increase Australia's voice in these institutions. One might ask whether Australia has a voice in them at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Annual Report entitled Australia and the World Bank was presented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and not by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who has responsibility for the aid program. Exercising his responsibility as Australia's Governor on the World Bank, the Treasurer has presented a report setting out what the bank has done over the last financial year and providing assessments of the efficiency and effectiveness of its various arms. It includes some comment on the attempts that Australia has made to influence the World Bank in relation to allocation of IDA funds and a range of other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that Australia argued for greater allocation to Asia where there has generally been a better record in the efficient utilisation of funds and where the allocation per head has been lower than in other regions. There has been no indication that this pressure has been successful. Failure to achieve influence for Australian positions in relation to bank management issues are recorded in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the document there seems to be little indication of the exercise of Australian influence in relation to issues of specifically Australian interest. Perhaps the only exception to this is in relation to bank activities in the South Pacific. The bank seems to have reversed its previous unwillingness to modify its organisation or procedures to suit the unique requirements of the small Pacific states. There is nothing, however, to show that bank activities are related to other Australian development assistance or wider foreign policy objectives in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian funding of the World Bank in general, including the IDA, has the appearance of a blank cheque issued without any particular regard for Australian objectives in donating such large sums. It is reminiscent of aid to Papua New Guinea, with the exception that in the case of the World Bank there is no indication that the amount will gradually decrease. It is as if there has been some assessment that the funds given to the international development banks are the best used of all the elements of the aid budget and should, therefore, be maintained at all costs. The Treasurer's report, however, contains no argument in support of such a conclusion. Not surprisingly, given that the document has originated from the Treasurer rather than from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), it contains very little on the rest of the aid program or wider foreign policy. The fact is that the international development banks or, more precisely, Australian representation at their headquarters in Washington and Manila, are treasury fiefdoms and are therefore protected from budget costs regardless of whether they are able to demonstrate any tangible benefits to Australian objectives in international development. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion in relation to the IDA, the case for Australian assistance is clear. For humanitarian, economic and environmental reasons it is important that Australia supports the activities of the IDA to provide assistance to poorer developing countries. The level of assistance that Australia should give is, however, a separate issue. The level as a proportion of the total Australian aid budget, as I said, has risen significantly, skewing priorities in such a way that bilateral aid options have been held back. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition therefore supports this Bill, which is based on a pledge already given, but records its concern that the effect of the present pledge is to continue support at levels which the Government has never properly justified and which, if projected into the future, would lock a future government into an aid budget which did not reflect its priorities. This Opposition would not permit itself to be so locked in in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now make a few comments on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill 1990. The Opposition supports this Bill for Australian participation in the new bank which is being established to help fund the reconstruction of the economies of the former Eastern bloc countries as they undergo the transition from centrally planned economies to free market economies. The successful transition from totalitarian political systems to stable, liberal, democratic orders will depend in no small part on the ability of the economies to respond to the challenges they will face in the competitive world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> This will not be an easy process. The difference between a free market economy and a centrally planned economy is not simply one of emphasis. The transition will require nothing short of a revolution in institutions and the way of life. After many years of repression, expectations are bound to be high and the development of stability will require both the realistic political management of those expectations and the economic progress needed to provide improvements in living standards. The new development bank, as a region-wide institution, will play a crucial role in this process, engaging in policy dialogue and helping to shape and support workable economic policies that might not always be popular. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed Australian role in the bank is modest, reflecting the limited role that Australia is likely to play in the reconstruction of eastern Europe. The sum of ECU30m has been provided, to be paid in annual instalments of approximately A$9m over five years. It is appropriate that we should support an institution which will play such an important role in the reconstruction of Europe, but it is also appropriate that our role should be relatively small. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the benefits for eastern Europe, Australian membership of the bank will provide some benefits to Australia. It will allow Australia a voice-perhaps a better voice than we get on the IDA-and it will allow us to provide some input to the economic reform process in eastern Europe. This will have some commercial and economic advantage for Australia. It will allow the Australian Government to formulate trade development strategies in response to the opening up of opportunities in eastern Europe. In conclusion on this particular Bill, we also offer our support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will also be supporting the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill 1990 and the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill 1990, although I will be moving a second reading amendment at the end of my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats support the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill because it offers Australia the chance to be part of the restructuring process now taking place in eastern and central Europe. The functions of the bank as set out in article 2 of the schedule are commendable because they encompass a strong emphasis on assisting recipient countries to become fully integrated into the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the biggest problems facing eastern and central Europe, however, is the environmental one. For years now these countries have claimed that they have had no environmental problems to deal with. We now know that the ecological destruction in these places is massive and quite possibly in many areas beyond restoration. I was pleased to read that the functions of the European Bank, as set out in article 2 of the Bill, include the following:</PARA>
<PARA>to promote in the full range of its activities environmentally sound and sustainable development;</PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate that we congratulate those involved in setting up the bank for their prudence in including a statement concerning environmental considerations within the bank's functions. We trust that this will promote environmentally sound and sustainable development in the bank's activities and that it will also provide a lead to other international financial agencies to place an equally high priority on protecting the world environment. It is certainly a step forward when such considerations are adopted within the functions of newly set up financial development agencies such as this European Bank. We are pleased that Australia is involved in this enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to make a few brief comments in relation to the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill, which also has the support of the Democrats. The one area of major concern in development is the reduction in the overseas aid budget. Australia has pledged $382.5m, or 1.99 per cent of our total Budget, for funding of development projects under this three-year round of the International Development Association. It is obvious that there has been a clear reduction in the volume of funds being provided for official development aid, and we agree with Senator Hill's comments on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this Bill we are especially pleased that women will finally be recognised in the design of development projects funded by the International Development Association. It is a long overdue reform, and we commend the officials involved for ensuring that this recognition was finally given by taking into account the importance of women as decision-makers and work force participants in all societies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats would also like to place on record our support for the adoption of environmental considerations in all aspects of the International Development Association's future activities. This too represents quite a forward step in overseas aid development projects, and illustrates the point that the Democrats and non-government aid agencies have been making for some time-that there is a strong association between environmental destruction and Third World poverty in many developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite these reforms-and they certainly are of a positive nature-the Democrats would like to see the Australian Government use this opportunity to take a number of other steps in its power and make further reforms along this path. As Senator Hill has been telling us, Australia at the moment is represented on the Board of Governors of the World Bank by the Federal Treasurer, and Australia belongs to a group of countries which elect the Executive Director to the Board. Australia currently holds the position of Alternate Executive Director. I will be moving an amendment to the second reading of this Bill requesting that the Government take action to assist the World Bank's policy process by broadening the selection process for Australia's position on the World Bank so as to make it as wide as is practicable, given the Public Service requirements of such positions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, Australia's Executive Director has been chosen from Treasury. I believe that the Government has decided that in the future, when the position of Executive Director becomes vacant, Treasury will call for applications from three government agencies: the Treasury itself, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. While this is an improvement, we believe that it does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have proposed an amendment with the knowledge that in a recent parliamentary report the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended precisely this idea of broadening the selection process. Headed by former Queensland senator John Black, this Committee reported on Australia's overseas aid programs and, among other things, assessed the adequacy and effectiveness of this country's participation in the decision-making processes of the international development agencies to which Australia contributes, such as the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also received evidence from numerous organisations in the aid field which pointed to environmentally damaging activities resulting from insensitive and badly managed aid projects financed by multilateral development banks such as the World Bank. In submissions and evidence to the Joint Parliamentary Committee, the World Bank's performance in terms of environmental considerations also received some criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 74 of the report, the Committee expressed the need for the bank to become more sensitive in the strategies which it adopts and pointed out that there is a greater need for the executive to broaden its understanding of what is required in developing countries. According to evidence presented during the Committee's hearings, the World Bank often funds poorly thought out development projects which subsequently cause massive dislocations of indigenous people with the benefits of projects going, in many cases, only to the privileged classes. </PARA>
<PARA> The poor in these developing countries are not involved in the design or implementation of development projects and the Committee discovered that the lending policies of the World Bank often lead to massive indebtedness on the part of the developing country. One way in which the Committee suggested that these problems could be overcome was for some appointees to the World Bank executive to have a greater awareness of development issues. This could happen by broadening the selection process for Australia's appointment to the executive so that a greater range of people in the community and from the aid agencies have the opportunity to serve in that sort of capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the chapter in which it dealt with the international financial and development agencies, the Committee made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's executive director and alternate director positions should be filled on the basis of expertise in development and development finance issues. Therefore they should be openly advertised inside and outside the Public Service, and filled on merit. The Committee regards continued membership of the World Bank as an essential aspect of the aid program. However effective membership requires greater participation and awareness of development issues in policy formulation.</PARA>
<PARA>In responding to these recommendations, the Government accepted the general thrust of them and committed itself to advertising the position widely in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We too believe that this sort of reform is essential if the bank is to continue its new found balanced approach to the challenges of development and see it as more than just an accounting transaction. Essentially, this reform recognises that the World Bank is a development agency and that the person who fills Australia's position of executive director should at least have some experience in the fields of development and development finance. It is to Australia's shame, of course, that we remain the only country that does not require its bank executive director to have that development experience. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) condemns the Government for its failure to implement its own response to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report of December 1989, in relation to filling of Australian positions at the multi-lateral development banks; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) calls on the Government and in particular the Treasurer, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to ensure that in future:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) such positions are openly advertised both inside and outside the public service</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) candidates are selected on the basis of merit and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) selection criteria shall include the desirability of demonstrating an experience in development and development finance issues''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise to follow, from the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill, and to support some of the comments he made in respect of Australia's foreign aid commitments. I am concerned that this country is giving as much money as it is in foreign aid when, as Senator Hill said, in many cases it could be seen as a blank cheque. Whilst I support the general principle behind the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill 1990, I have some concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is important for us to assist those countries that have been recently freed from the shackles of communism. It is important for us to help them rebuild their shattered economies, but it is also important that the aid that we supply overseas is properly directed and is not abused. I seek leave to table a deed of a grant of land for a cattle property called Kulai outside of Goondiwindi in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The deed of grant of land shows that the cattle property Kulai was purchased late last year by the China National Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation, Shenyang branch. This organisation is an arm of the Chinese Government. It has purchased this cattle property which, I understand, has an area of 2,137 hectares just outside of the Queensland town, Goondiwindi. It has attached to it a feedlot licence for 16,400 head of cattle. I ask: how can the Chinese Government afford to pay over $1.2m to purchase this cattle property at a time when Queensland farmers are finding it difficult enough to hold on to their own farms?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also of concern to me is that it appears from the title deed that the Chinese Government was able to buy this cattle property; but not at the exorbitant interest rates that Australian farmers have to pay-16, 17, 18 or 20 per cent overdraft rates. No, the Chinese Government was able to purchase this cattle property for cash. The deed of grant of land shows that there is no encumbrance over the land. It walked in with its cheque book and it signed away. It purchased a cattle property in Queensland at a time when, according to Australia's overseas aid program pamphlet circulated by authority of Senator Evans this year, the total Australian aid flow to China in the financial year 1989-90 was $42.7m. Is it not a bit absurd that we should be providing $42.7m in aid to the People's Republic of China and yet it should be able to come here and buy a Queensland cattle property for over $1.2m in cash?</PARA>
<PARA> I am not foolish enough to suggest that there might not be a legitimate reason why the Chinese Government should have purchased this cattle property. It may have purchased the cattle property for the purpose of increasing the trade to China in Australian beef. But I hasten to add that at the time the Chinese Government purchased this cattle property there was already approval for a feedlot licence. Nothing has been done about that feedlot licence in the last 12 months. In fact, the Chinese Government had been so tardy in taking up the opportunity to install the feedlot that it has had to apply for an extension of the period of time in which to complete the feedlot. I am told that extension of time has now been given to the Chinese Government and it has until 9 November 1991 to comply with the terms of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> If this feedlot is so important to the Chinese Government, if it needs it so much for trade between Australia and China, why has it not done anything about it? Why does it have to apply for a 12-month extension in which to do the work? These are the questions which need to be answered. These are some of the problems with Australia's foreign aid budget at the moment. It seems that we are giving money to governments and yet those same governments are purchasing property and commercial investments in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be some contradiction. I am also not foolish enough to suggest that $42.7m in aid to China was all cash because, of course, it was not. Some of the aid was important because it assisted Australian companies in getting a foot in the door in China. But, on the face of it, we have to ask whether this purchase of a cattle property in Queensland can be justified when we are giving so much money to China. Maybe we should put it the other way around. Can we justify giving $42.7m to a repressive communist government whose human rights record is well known and has been repeatedly criticised by Amnesty International? Can we afford to give this much money to the Chinese Government at a time when it can afford to come here and buy farms that Australian farmers cannot afford to own themselves?</PARA>
<PARA> This highlights the quandary in the policy decisions behind Australia's foreign aid budget. I believe it highlights some of the potential traps into which we could fall if we are not very careful about the manner in which we allocate overseas assistance. I hope there is some very good explanation for what has happened in Goondiwindi. I hope that we will look closely at the sort of foreign aid we give in future and that we take the time to check our priorities and ask whether we should give money to governments that seem to be able to fend quite well for themselves, thank you very much. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that charity starts at home. At a time when our rural sector is in a dreadful recession and Australian farmers in their thousands are being forced off the land-pushed off the land-because of a combination of factors, including this Government's failed economic policies, I do not believe it is appropriate for us to write a blank cheque to every government that holds out its hand for a grant. These problems are of great concern to me and, I believe, to many Australians and we must turn our attention to these problems in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that the guillotine is operating because it would be important at some stage to have a rather lengthy debate on the operations of the World Bank. I feel that is long overdue in this Parliament. It is very heartening to see that more members of this chamber are becoming interested in the operations of international financial institutions. That was not always so 10 or 15 years ago, but over the past five, six or seven years more honourable senators have expressed interest in what is happening in these international institutions and the focus of their policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of that has been the result of the interests of environmental groups and their concern-indeed the concern of quite a number of people-about the policy of the World Bank to come to arrangements with the elite in various countries and engage in quite suspect, in many cases, development projects. This is not to say that the operations of the World Bank are not beneficial in many circumstances. Quite clearly they are, but there are areas to which attention needs to be paid. These areas should have the microscope put on them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of those areas has been subjected to public debate and pressure. At last the World Bank has responded to this public pressure and debate. I refer to environmental concerns which have arisen. However, we have to take a lesson from that. Year after year the World Bank said it was doing the right thing and was taking these things into consideration. In 1987, after years of denial, World Bank President Barber Conable delivered a speech in Washington in which he publicly acknowledged that, as far as environmental destruction was concerned, the bank:</PARA>
<PARA>had been ``part of the problem in the past,'' and announced that the Bank would mend its ways by greatly increasing its environmental staff and by increasing lending for environmentally beneficial projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Later it was proved that this speech contained a degree of rhetoric. According to a number of people in the environmental movement, there is still a long way to go in this respect. The spring issue of World Policy Journal contained an article written by the director of the United States Environmental Defense Fund's international program, which referred to congressional hearings held in October 1989-2 1/2 years after Conable had committed the bank to sweeping environmental reforms-and which slammed the bank for the continuing and systematic violation of its own environmental and social policies. The hearing had before it information that the bank was continuing to finance a dam project in northern central India, despite the fact that, among other things, no resettlement plan had been formulated for the 90,000 rural poor that the dam's 120-mile reservoir would displace. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the comment made in the World Policy Journal, but two points need to be made. It has taken many years for the bank to admit its failings in respect of the environment and it admitted to them only after substantial intense pressure from environmental and community groups. Once it had admitted its failures, it is alleged that it continued to hide behind rhetoric. Measures have been taken by the World Bank-I know that-in respect of the environmental issue now, but we have to learn a lesson from that: despite the rhetoric some problems may still occur. Indeed I was disappointed to hear someone say in debate that the poor were doing damage to the environment. Again I quote from that article in the World Policy Journal:</PARA>
<PARA>Third World NGOs were particularly outraged because the plan seemed to blame the poor for the destruction of tropical forests while promoting investments to open up large areas of pristine forest for exploitation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators realise, I have expressed concern in this chamber in the past about another aspect of the World Bank's focus, and that is population control. It is very important that we do not allow the World Bank to make assumptions which are not well founded. Its assumption that the fertility of poor women in poor countries is to blame for a range of problems-from environmental damage to war-is plainly ludicrous. I do not intend to make a speech today about that, but I would quote from a document authored by someone who would not share many of my views. The article, which was written by one Betsy Hartmann, appears in the journal Progressive of 18 September 1990. It is headed `Bankers, Babies and Bangladesh'. It deals with the World Bank involvement in Bangladesh. It must be remembered that Australia is also involved in this area. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . at the 1988 annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Bank President Barber Conable pledged that his institution is ``dedicated to attacking poverty and beating it back.'' A vital part of his battle plan is ``curbing excessive population growth.''</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>``The societies in which population is growing very fast must accept that many-perhaps most-of these new lives will be miserable, malnourished, and brief,'' he said. There was no mention of the misery that population control has brought to poor people like Osman Ali. </PARA>
<PARA>Osman Ali is a Bangladeshi typical of the people whose human rights have been violated. The story of Osman Ali began this article. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Conable's pronouncement was nothing new. For more than 20 years, the World Bank has played a strategic role in pressuring Third World governments to implement population-control programs. It can do this by virtue of its leverage over other forms of development aid. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> By procreating too often, the logic goes, the poor help to create and perpetuate their own poverty. Their numbers spread scarce agricultural and environmental resources too thin, keep wages low and cost governments too much money in social services. Forcing down birth rates through population-control programs will thus help the poor help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two main problems with this analysis. First, it obscures the real cause of poverty in the Third World: the unequal distribution of resources and power within individual countries and between the developed and underdeveloped worlds. The Bank has always turned a blind eye to inequality; moreover, it actively allies itself with the same Third World elites who monopolize resources within their countries and thus prevent real development. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to cover a number of other situations. The point that is being made, of course, is that the real cause of poverty is not the fertility of poor women in poor countries, but is made up of a number of other factors, which are addressed by a number of people in the World Bank. But so far as the bank's population control measures are concerned, what is happening is quite a disgrace. Turning to Bangladesh, this article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In financial terms alone, population control now absorbs a full third of the government's health budget. Mother and Child Health, supposedly a cornerstone of Bangladesh's population policy, has consistently taken a back seat to sterilization, with tragic consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> According to World Bank figures, only 2 per cent of children in Bangladesh had been immunized by 1987 against the common infectious diseases. Almost half of infant deaths and one-third of childhood deaths are caused by illnesses which could be prevented or readily cured. </PARA>
<PARA>The articles goes on further but time is running away under the guillotine and I do not intend to continue. I just raise these issues because regard must be had to them by the international institutions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole range of information now as to what is the bottom line of such population control measures. The bottom line is a violation of human rights. I would like to see the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have, somewhere within their charter, a principle to ensure that those measures adopted coincide with and respect the culture of the developing countries and the individual human rights of the people in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the India project of the World Bank, about which I asked questions in the Estimates committee hearings, will be found to be wanting. I would like to know why the United States of America opposed the project which I referred to in the Estimates committee, because that has not yet come out and I have not yet received an answer as to the full issue of the India matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that the decision-making process has to be taken from the bureaucrats and put back into the hands of the couples-and that is not being done because, for example, the Billings method is being ignored, even though the Indian Council of Medical Research has done a study on that method and found it to be most effective. That method puts the power back into the hands of the people, away from the bureaucrats. This is one of the reasons why some of the international bureaucrats do not want it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill and the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill, I particularly want to concentrate on the first Bill. In doing so, I want to contrast what Australia is doing with what has occurred in eastern Europe in recent times, and consider our trading role with those countries in recent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I would like to acknowledge the fact that in eastern Europe we are seeing the whole structure change into market orientated economies. This was the fundamental reason for the establishment of the European Bank. I want to contrast Australia's input into this with our trading situation. It is worth noting that in recent years we have had an export trade worth something like $1.5 billion per annum with eastern Europe. In return, our contribution to this particular bank is going to be $9m per year. I believe it essential that this bank be established, but I am concerned, in terms of the value of the trade that we extract out of those countries, that our contribution will be seen as very miserly. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that as a result of the list of shareholders-the United States has 100,000 shares, Japan 85,000, France 85,000, Germany 85,000, Italy 85,000 and the United Kingdom 85,000-Australia has the potential to lose a significant amount of our trading clout in terms of the redevelopment of eastern Europe and its movement towards a market oriented economy. </PARA>
<PARA> While I certainly support our involvement in the redevelopment of eastern Europe, I think that our contribution should and could have been significantly greater and much more positive. It is going to be very important in the next year or two, in terms of the situation in eastern Europe, that we work very hard to maintain our market share of exports into those countries, because there is no doubt that those countries that I have mentioned, and others that are making a significantly greater share in terms of the European Bank, will use that as a lever to try to extract more trade from those countries at the expense of Australia. This is particularly important at the present time with the breakdown of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and what is occurring there. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this situation has the potential, because of our small contribution, to put Australia at a trading disadvantage. I want to contrast this, in the few minutes that I have, with some expenditure that is here. I think that Senator O'Chee raised a very valid point in terms of where Australia places finance and how we handle ourselves. Let me give the Senate one internal example. Let me compare this $45m over the five years-approximately $9m per annum-with the $69m spent last year in the advertising and promotion budget of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In the previous year the amount spent was $54m, so we were able to find an additional $15m to go into that particular activity, which, I believe one can argue very strongly, will have a minimal impact in many areas in terms of improving our position. Yet we can see here the magnitude of our contribution in an area which is absolutely crucial in terms of our current account and in getting on top of our debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I summarise by saying that it is absolutely crucial, now that this bank has been structured, that Australia maximise its promotion overseas in order to maintain our market share in these countries which have become very important to Australia. Otherwise, I believe, the countries that I have mentioned-Europe, America and Japan-will walk all over the top of us. </PARA>

<PARA> In July and August of this year, I spent some four weeks in Europe looking at the European single market in 1992, the developments in eastern Europe and the implications that they have for Australia and Australian trade. These four weeks followed on a meeting with Carla Hills in Washington just prior to the G7 summit in Houston and after delivering two papers on trade in Canada. The four weeks in Europe were broken up between two weeks in the United Kingdom as a guest of the British Government, a week in each of Brussels and West Germany and a week in Czechoslovakia. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in those periods of investigation that I gained an insight into the enormous problems that are facing eastern Europe and, therefore, the rest of the world in coming to terms with providing free economies. Fairly recently as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I had the opportunity of meeting with Mr Gerasimov, a spokesman for the Soviet foreign ministry. In that discussion he illustrated three points which I think are quite significant in the mistakes that the Gorbachev administration had already made. </PARA>
<PARA> The first mistake was the attempt to implement a prohibition on alcohol, which simply resulted in enormous forgone revenues from the production of alcohol, together with an increased demand for sugar because, quite simply, people were making alcohol at home. Secondly, too many roubles were printed. Thirdly, the Gorbachev administration made a mistake in not producing consumer goods but in attempting to pick winners and produce manufacturers who were tool makers. Quite frankly, to bring about an equilibrium between demand and supply in the Soviets would require price rises of over 50 per cent. One sees enormous distortions in the Soviet economy with massive subsidies being paid still for food and shelter, and also this enormous demand question. A rapid rise in the monetary supply has fuelled inflation with wages rising something like 1.4 times faster than productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA> In one of the papers that I gave in Canada, I dealt with questions dealing with recent developments in eastern Europe for specific trade and investment and the implications for Australia in particular. Some of the issues that I raised in that paper are relevant to look at today. I looked at the impediments to trade and investment in eastern Europe. The first is the conflict of objectives. When western companies are looking to establish joint ventures, they are looking at doing so with an aim to looking for markets in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, when we look at the aims of the Eastern bloc countries, they are looking to increase their exports. This thus means that joint ventures will have to be self-supportive in currency terms. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. A major problem, of course, is that of the willingness and commitment to establish the concept and reality of private property. This is still a debate going on in Soviet Russia; this is a debate which, in countries such as Czechoslovakia, has been placed up to and decided upon, and they indeed will create private property and allow markets to work. In East Germany the 8,000 enterprises which the West German Government identified are proceeding to move into private hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there will be enormous problems in negotiating with lethargic bureaucracies which remain. One of the fundamental problems is that those people who presently control property and enterprises are the very people who are ideologically opposed to them being privatised. So there are long term problems to be negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA> To look at the bank itself: the bank will take over some of the World Bank's responsibilities for eastern Europe, even though the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will continue programs of structural adjustment lending. It will have an initial capitalisation of $US13 billion. The European Community's 12-member states and its institutions will hold a 51 per cent share; the United States, 10 per cent; Japan, 8 per cent; and the Soviet Union, 6 per cent. Australia's contribution is $45m over the next five years and is, indeed, to be part of the underwriting of the activities of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the bank represents a compromise between the United States and Great Britain on the one hand and the French on the other. This compromise means that 60 per cent of the bank's activities are to be directed to the private sector and to assist with the privatisation of state owned enterprises, while up to 40 per cent will be allocated to the state sector in each country assisted. That which is allocated to the state sector is intended to assist industries deemed to be moving towards denationalisation and demonopolisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is interesting to compare the degree of national private investment which is going on in Europe now. Of all the private investment going into Poland, 60 per cent is German; into Russia, 50 per cent is German; and into East Germany, 97 per cent is German. After that comes the United States, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, with Japan just moving. Much of that investment is also being done through German subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed privatisation role of the bank to be established is, in fact, to have little precedent but I think it is important that we do not see a repetition of the errors that were made with regard to World Bank allocation of funds, particularly in the Latin American markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hungarian economist James Kornoi says that there needs to be developed a new middle class in eastern Europe, composed of industrious, thrifty entrepreneurs. Only with such individuals can there emerge genuine private stocks, authentic stock companies and a real stock exchange. I close with a quote from the CATO Institute based in the United States:</PARA>
<PARA>The message is quite simple: there is no capitalism without capitalists. And capitalists (domestic and foreign) are something the east European nations will have to cultivate on their own-through constitutionally guaranteed and fully functional property rights systems, viable legal accounting system, modest levels of taxation and regulation, and a functioning convertible currency. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust this bank will enhance those prospects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill and the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill. In the less than two minutes available to me, I regret that I am unable to give any kind of reasonable reply to a number of the points that have been raised during the debate. But let me just say two things. First of all, as to the validity or legitimacy of Australia spending such a significant proportion of the aid budget on the World Bank, I believe there is ample justification for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The International Development Association is an efficient and effective vehicle for developing development assistance to the poorest developing countries and in this way-by contributing money to the World Bank development agency-we are usefully supplementing the regional focus of our bilateral aid program in a way that is entirely consistent with our obligations of good international citizenship to help the poorest and most deserving countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some returns for Australia in this in a number of respects, not least reputational but also in terms of the procurement that is possible through World Bank programs by virtue of being a credible paid-up member of it. Generally I think we can amply justify the payments that we do make. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the second reading amendment that has been moved by the Australian Democrats, there is quite a lot to be said about the appropriate nature of the qualifications for executive directors of the bank. I simply say that it is important not only that there be expertise within our representatives on development and technical assistance issues of a familiar kind as Senator Bourne emphasised but also that there be a capacity to play a professional role in equity investment issues, borrowing issues and the kind of policy decisions that the bank constantly has to make on loans and guarantees and, in effect, investment appraisal. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons it has been somewhat traditional for the market from which executive directors have been drawn to be a fairly limited one. I believe we have acted consistently with our response to the Senate committee report by widely notifying, as we promised to do, the availability of this position coming up. It was not wide outside the public sector agencies immediately involved, but it was nonetheless not unreasonable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that during the recent debate on the industrial relations legislation I drew the attention of the Senate to the plight of Mr John Ellenbogen in New South Wales, who was attempting to pursue before the courts of that State a matter in relation to his professional standing in a clash that he has had in an industrial dispute with the Blue Mountains City Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to speak briefly to the plight of Mr John Ellenbogen because it goes to the very heart of human rights in Australia. I have had quite a number of conversations with John Ellenbogen and, in fact, I have asked questions in this place of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). Those questions and the answers are on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> Much is said in this place about human rights, and so it should be. Human rights are very close to the hearts of all Australians. I think it can be truly said that Australians are fully committed to human rights in this country, but there will always be aberrations and those aberrations must be seriously and consciously addressed by us as legislators. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disturbed by the circumstances in which Mr Ellenbogen finds himself and I would like to provide some details of those circumstances to honourable senators. Ten years ago the Hon. Andrew Peacock, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, signed the ratification instrument for the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). He signed this on behalf of Australia but in doing so Australia filed a number of reservations about that covenant. Four years later Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, advised the Secretary-General of the United Nations of Australia's withdrawal of most of those reservations. In a press release on Human Rights Day in 1984 Senator Evans stressed:</PARA>
<PARA>The ICCPR provides a charter of the civil and political rights of individuals within a country and places an obligation on the country to ensure the protection of those rights. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Civil and political rights are those rights which we enjoy as citizens of a country in our dealings with government and include such matters as the right not to be subject to arbitrary arrest, the right to a fair trial, to freedom of speech, freedom of movement, freedom of religion and the right to equal protection of the law. </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, includes equality before the law. </PARA>
<PARA>In a number of subsequent statements Australia has quite emphatically endorsed the principles of that covenant. Unfortunately, it is a sad situation that Mr John Ellenbogen does not enjoy such rights before a tribunal in New South Wales. The realities are that, in fact, he as an Australian is not equal before the law in the circumstances in which he finds himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that Mr Ellenbogen fell into dispute with the Blue Mountains City Council. He attempted to carry his case before the Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales and the only way of doing that is to get a special writ of the Minister. Because of my own intervention and the intervention of Mr John Howard, who is his local member, after some 20 months Mr Ellenbogen got a special writ and found himself before the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> He is a highly qualified person. He has a bachelor of commerce and a masters degree in business administration. He is a very competent, articulate man; but still he finds himself in the most extraordinary situation. Even after getting that special writ-that was actually the beginning of a nightmare in attempting to pursue his case supposedly equally before the courts and equally before the law-he had to get two references to the tribunal, which he succeeded in doing.</PARA>
<PARA> The Blue Mountains City Council-that is, his former employer-is represented before the tribunal by its own solicitor and by a barrister. The Crown appears in the court as well and is represented by the Crown Solicitor and by a barrister. But right up to the present time Mr Ellenbogen has had to appear for himself without any legal or financial support. After 4 1/2 years of delays and intentional blockage by government authorities, he has managed his entire living expenses and he brings his case before the court daily on a budget of $19.18, which he receives from the Department of Social Security in a form of benefits. He has lost, in this process of four years, all other financial resources. As I say, he has himself before this tribunal by a special writ of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales legal aid does not cover industrial matters; indeed, it specifically excludes them. As the law stands at present, normally only unions and employers are able to appear before this jurisdiction and Mr Ellenbogen is there by special writ of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that he is a very determined individual. Between 3 January and 5 December this year he has on 29 occasions travelled from the Blue Mountains into the city and he has had to represent himself in court for a period of 23 full days without any financial support whatsoever. He is appearing in his own right, as I said, against solicitors and barristers representing the Blue Mountains City Council and the Crown Solicitor and barristers representing the Crown, and he is standing there without legal aid, supposedly equal before the court, representing himself. </PARA>
<PARA> I put a case to Mr Fahey, the State Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment, to the State Attorney-General, Mr Dowd, and in fact to the State Premier that his circumstances be acknowledged as being quite extraordinary by virtue of the writ having been granted to him. We asked for special financial assistance, which has not been forthcoming. Instead, the New South Wales Government actually claims a copyright over Mr Ellenbogen's own words spoken in open court in his own defence. It will not hand over the transcript without some considerable payment from the person that they know is simply not able to pay for that transcript. Up to now Mr Ellenbogen is about 1,000 pages of transcript behind in his own proceedings. His application to the Premier, as I said, for tangible support has so far received nothing but resounding neglect.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 Australia claimed on page 136 of its second report of the ICCPR to the United Nations Human Rights Committee that `in all Australian jurisdictions all persons are of equal standing before the courts and tribunals'. Quite clearly that is not the case in relation to Mr Ellenbogen's circumstances before this jurisdiction in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Ellenbogen circumstances are a matter of some considerable controversy between the former Federal Liberal shadow Attorney-General, the Hon. Neil Brown, and the Greiner Government. I have been privy to some of the correspondence over the situation in which Mr Ellenbogen finds himself. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the realities, the fact is that the State Government and the Minister have issued a writ to allow him to appear before the court but there is no attempt to follow through with the necessary provisions to allow the gentleman to have equal standing before the court. He is clearly disadvantaged in terms of his representation; he is clearly disadvantaged in terms of his access to resources-even the resources of the printed transcripts of his own words are not made available to him. Indeed, almost three days of the court proceedings have been taken up by cross-examinations and the case being presented to the tribunal justifying the fact that Mr Ellenbogen should not be entitled to transcripts. The cost of those three days of proceedings, of course, would vastly outweigh the limited cost of providing the man with photocopies of the proceedings recording his own statements before the court. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely no person in Australia should be forced to reduce his food intake-and this is what this gentleman has had to do. He has had to so trim his budget that he is barely able to feed himself or to pay his fares from the Blue Mountains to appear and represent himself before this tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying is that for Foreign Ministers, Federal Attorneys-General and others to assure the United Nations that all Australians have equality before all courts in this land is clearly not a statement of what the realities are. We have in New South Wales this very day clear proof positive of the fact that we cannot claim such things for Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I have on a number of occasions placed this matter before the Senate in the form of questions and statements. All I can do is to call upon the Government and, in fact, all members of parliament, and particularly all New South Wales members and New South Wales senators, to carry this case to the Foreign Minister seeking his intervention in the implementation of the international covenant to which we are a signatory. I can only seek their intervention in appealing to the New South Wales Government, to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Minister and to the Premier to make a special grant available to Mr Ellenbogen so that he at least is able to present himself and feels that there is genuine sincerity intended in the granting of that writ and not just the continuation of a nightmare in which he finds himself in an attempt to pursue his case before one of the courts of the land which we as a government have assured to the United Nations and the people of the world provides equality for all Australian citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity to say a few words about the problems that are besetting the Horn of Africa and in particular the famine victims of Eritrea and Tigre. I do that not simply in my capacity as one of the two parliamentary sponsors of the Eritrean Relief Association. I say in that context that both I and Senator Schacht are indeed honoured to be in that position. I speak because it is a matter which I think ought to concern all Australians and the Federal Government in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also speak in the context of a further Food For Life campaign which was launched by the Melbourne Age on 14 December last. As I understand it, even the bankrupt Victorian Government has managed to give $25,000 to the campaign but I am not aware of the Federal Government having yet made any commitment and I wish to take this opportunity to urge it to do so. The Age campaign is a relaunch and it is fair to say that the previous campaigns that have been run in the previous two years have been remarkably successful in raising in excess of $1m which has gone through Community Aid Abroad to help famine victims in those two areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the dimensions of the current famine would seem to be even greater than in previous years. The latest estimate suggests that something like 10 million people are now facing starvation in the region. For the first time even drinking wells are drying up or turning saline. The United Nations, through the world food program, has predicted very dire consequences, forecasting that something like 4.28 million would require food, almost half of them in Eritrea, and a further 20 per cent in neighbouring Tigre. It has appealed for almost 850,000 tonnes of food to be donated. That figure is the assessment of the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and is less than the figure of the World Food program, which has put the food requirement at 941,000 tonnes. I hasten to say that the Eritrean Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, which I think has probably in general done a very good job in trying to deliver aid to the people in its own areas, is for obvious reasons unable to ensure that aid flows through to Eritrea. From my own experiences in dealing with the Commission in the early 1980s I thought that it was then-and I presume now-a very appropriate vehicle for the distribution of aid throughout Ethiopia. But that of course does not cope with the problems of Eritrea. Those problems are part and parcel of the ongoing war of liberation that is being fought there and is now in almost its twenty-ninth year. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) has by far the upper hand and it is only a matter of time before it will finally succeed in liberating Asmara, the traditional capital of Eritrea. When that occurs then I think we will be entitled to feel that the end is nigh, but that point has not arrived. It has been a protracted siege of Asmara and the latest reports suggest that the fighting is at a standstill. If that is the case, then it looks as though we will have to be even more patient. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer briefly to some remarks contained in an interview with the EPLF secretary-general, Mr Afewerki, as recorded in the October edition of the Adulis, which is published monthly by the Foreign Relations Bureau of the EPLF. I found the remarks of the leader very encouraging in the sense that they seem to constitute a recognition of the mammoth post-independent problems that have not always been faced up to by emerging nations. He does, I think, have an acute awareness of the potential for corruption in Third World countries and the abuse of power that often follows from independence. He shows a very clear determination to ensure that that does not happen in this instance. Indeed, he does not even aspire to political office once the war of independence has been concluded. He says that the role of the EPLF will come to a halt at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly the EPLF has been addressing a number of the post-independence problems that will arise-such as devising Eritrea's own currency. At the moment the Ethiopian birr, the Sudanese pound and to a lesser extent the Saudi riyal are simultaneously used as optional currencies throughout Eritrea, and the United States dollar is also used. It is probably an indication of the magnitude of the difficulties faced that Eritrea does not yet have an independent, convertible currency. </PARA>
<PARA> The EPLF also shows an acute awareness of the need to achieve international legitimacy, and therefore its call for the United Nations to organise a referendum in Eritrea is one that ought to be supported by the UN itself and certainly by the Australian Government. It has given a commitment to create a multi-party system in Eritrea, and again I think we would all welcome that. It is clear that it sees the pitfalls of one-party systems. Indeed, even those who have tried them, such as Mr Mugabe in Zimbabwe, would ultimately have to acknowledge that their advantages are far outweighed by their shortcomings in the democratic process. Again, that is an enlightened acknowledgment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting that it has decided to place a ban on religious political parties and it says that the same rule would apply to regional and ethnic movements. Again, I think that is probably a sensible commitment to give in the circumstances. Eritrea being a heterogeneous society with diverse, linguistic and religious constituencies, the last thing it would really want is to foment tensions and difficulties along racial or ethnic lines. I think broadbased political movements are certainly what is desirable in that context. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States shows a recognition of the merits of the argument. Presidents Bush and Gorbachev both discussed the issue in their recent summit and I think the US has now finally come to a stage where it regards the Eritrean cause as legitimate and would therefore, I think, welcome the end of the struggle on the basis of an independent nation. That I think is something that the Australian Government will do in due course as well. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not altogether clear to me why the EPLF has refused to resume the talks and the peace process. I did not find the argumentation particularly convincing on that point but no doubt there are military and strategic reasons for that although it was originally proposed by the EPLF itself. It has probably got a bit to do with the capture of Masawa in February this year. It is interesting to note that agreement has now been reached following negotiations coordinated by the world food program which will allow Masawa to serve as a channel for food shipments into Eritrea. I think we should welcome that announcement made only in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA> That now being the case, there is the prospect of alleviating to at least some extent the horrific drought and famine problems. That is why I take this opportunity to say that it would be very welcome indeed for the Australian Government to show some Christmas generosity, despite the fact that we have inordinate problems of our own, by contributing to the Age appeal, and I urge it to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak today on the duplication which occurs between the land care program and the National Soil Conservation Committee. I think it is appropriate at this time when we have discussions going on regarding rationalisation of the roles of the Commonwealth and the States that we should also look at duplication which exists in Commonwealth functions. I suggest that now that the political glamour of the land care program has disappeared somewhat-and there is no doubt that it was used as a political tool-Commonwealth functions should be looked at very closely and coordinated into one function to stop the current duplication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure honourable senators would be aware that I have been a great supporter of the soil conservation program and the change of attitude in Australia towards land care which really started in a big way in the mid-1970s and has gradually improved. Today soil conservation is a State and national effort. When we examine the reports on both programs we see that fundamentally there is a transfer from one to the other. The land care program transferred some $23.4m to the national soil conservation program during the year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are land care reports for the various States. In Western Australia, my State, the number of land care districts has increased from 109 to 120. Between two committees, 26 people in total are responsible for the management of them. There are 12 people on one body and 14 on the other. The inherent costs involved in what is fundamentally a duplication of two functions need addressing. The emphasis should be on maximising the dollars and cents in programs, not on duplication of functions of people.</PARA>
<PARA> Time is limited so I will not try to track on all this now, but the reports show that some 200 land care groups have been established in Australia. Some 120-odd of them are in Western Australia, which signifies very clearly that the real push and the drive for land care or the national soil conservation program started off in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern that, with the duplication, the amount of money allocated this particular year has not been sufficient for a land care coordinator in Western Australia, despite the position that we find ourselves in. I would certainly urge the Government and those responsible for these two programs to have a careful look at them and see how they can be coordinated into one program so that we do not have the duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the duplication is not confined to the people on the committees. Two separate sets of accounts have to be kept. There is duplication of auditors and the people who perform the various administrative functions associated with the running of these committees. I mentioned that we cannot find enough money in Western Australia for a land care coordinator, yet we can find enough for duplicated functions. Something like 80 per cent of the State is now covered by land care districts. Some 50 catchment groups have been established in catchment areas to deal with salinity problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now looking in a much broader way at soil degradation problems. Water erosion, wind erosion and soil salinisation have always attracted the headlines. We can see these problems very clearly. But with the transfer of responsibilities, particularly from the land care program to the national soil conservation program, attention is now being given to soil structure decline, invasion of production land by native woody shrubs, and water repellency. </PARA>
<PARA> These things are not obvious to the eye. But soil structure decline and water repellency are two factors which in fact lead to the other problems. Water repellency prevents proper plant structure that will hold the ground together and keep it healthy. It therefore leads to soil structure decline. It is very pleasing to learn from the reports that those particular aspects-I believe for the first time-are being seriously looked at as part of the broad picture encompassed by the programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the prime purpose in raising this matter of public interest today. I think there is an opportunity to coordinate the two programs, get them under the auspices of one active committee, and maximise the dollars and cents that are currently being put into programs so that they are much more effective. I believe the whole issue of soil conservation or land care, whichever one wants to call it-they are really one and the same thing-is above party politics at this time. If the Government is serious about cutting out duplication, this is a wonderful opportunity for it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another point very briefly. I am bitterly disappointed that today Mr Justice Maddern of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission refused to hear the SPC Ltd case even though there is an agreement between employers and employees about the direction to take. The people involved are going to have a very sad Christmas and my sympathy goes out to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the handling of this situation shows the inadequacy of the current Industrial Relations Act. Certainly I do not accept Senator Cook's explanation that it can be handled under section 115 because that spells out quite clearly that there has to be a dispute before a matter can be heard. Obviously in this case, because there is agreement, there is no dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 November in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) I raised a series of questions with the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) concerning allegations of fraud on the construction of Royal Australian Air Force base Tindal in the Northern Territory and concerning the redeployment of Tindal staff of Australian Construction Services. On that date the Minister was not able to provide me with answers and he subsequently wrote to me in a letter that I received on 6 December providing certain information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not surprised that the Minister did not choose to table that information in the Senate and make it publicly available in the Hansard. So I intend to read the two answers into the record and then to comment on them. With regard to Tindal fraud Senator Bolkus replied to me in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Details relating to allegations of fraud at Tindal RAAF base were requested and I have answered the questions as adequately as possible given the stage that proceedings are at. </PARA>
<PARA>Based on advice, the thrust of my answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Allegations of fraudulent practice by both contractors and ACS employees have been made over a period of time and have been given quite a deal of publicity.</PARA>
<PARA>Every allegation has been thoroughly investigated by either or a combination of:</PARA>
<PARA>- internal departmental inquiry</PARA>
<PARA>- DAS fraud control unit</PARA>
<PARA>- Australian Federal Police</PARA>
<PARA>- State police</PARA>
<PARA>The upshot is that charges have been laid against one contractor and one ex-ACS employee and the matter is currently before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA>A committal hearing for the contractor has been set for 6-7 December 1990 and for the ACS employee for 26-27 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Further discussion may be sub judice and, as I have said before, investigations are continuing and the possibility of further charges cannot be ruled out. </PARA>
<PARA>Once the investigation is fully resolved I will provide the specific details requested such as:</PARA>
<PARA>- how many officers were involved</PARA>
<PARA>- how many contractors were investigated, and</PARA>
<PARA>- how many employees were counselled or disciplined</PARA>
<PARA>When court proceedings are finalised further details may be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>In connection with the redeployment of Australian Construction Services Tindal staff, Senator Bolkus replied in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of questions about the redeployment of ACS staff previously associated with the Tindal project were raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that there is no connection between the redeployment of staff from the Tindal project and any allegations of fraudulent activities there. Staff located on the Tindal project site peaked at 60. Of course more than 60 people were employed on site over the project's full duration but some of these were contract staff and others were Auslig employees. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted that the numbers of people engaged on a project such as this build up and taper off over a period of time. In fact there is still one officer engaged on site. </PARA>
<PARA>Having carried out some research into the questions my Department now advises that to the present date of those staff engaged on the project at Tindal:</PARA>
<PARA>- 11 have voluntarily resigned</PARA>
<PARA>- 22 transferred to positions in the Public Service in other locations as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> - 7 to Adelaide</PARA>
<PARA> - 8 to Darwin</PARA>
<PARA> - 1 to Alice Springs</PARA>
<PARA> - 1 to New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA> - 1 to Victoria</PARA>
<PARA> - 1 to Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA> - 3 to Katherine</PARA>
<PARA>- 4 returned to Adelaide after term transfer to Tindal</PARA>
<PARA>- 1 has been promoted to a position in the Public Service in another location (Canberra)</PARA>
<PARA>- 5 accepted voluntary retrenchment packages in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition one officer was offered a transfer to a position in Adelaide but refused. He is now the subject of action under the Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to staff located on site at Tindal a number of staff located in the Adelaide office were engaged on the Tindal project. Of these there have been:</PARA>
<PARA>- 19 voluntary resignations</PARA>
<PARA>- 5 age retirees</PARA>
<PARA>- 1 invalidity retiree</PARA>
<PARA>- 50 remaining in Adelaide</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the foregoing some Darwin based staff also worked on the project. Of these:</PARA>
<PARA>- 1 transferred to Canberra</PARA>
<PARA>- 1 transferred to Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA>- 2 voluntarily resigned</PARA>
<PARA> The number of Australian Construction Services employees therefore identified in the Minister's answer is 123, and I appreciate that the Minister indicated that the general workload peaked at 60. However, in linking the issue of fraud and the matters that needed to be investigated, I am concerned to note from the information provided that of the 123 identified employees 33 have since resigned, five have been retrenched and one is subject to redundancy. </PARA>
<PARA> So if I add together the resignations and the retrenchments they are of the order of 30 per cent-27 per cent have resigned and 3 per cent have been retrenched at this stage only one employee has been charged with regard to the allegations of fraud. It causes one to wonder about the 33 who have since resigned. We need to know: were they forced to resign in lieu of being prosecuted for serious offences? The fact that 23 other employees transferred interstate should not be overlooked either. Next year during the Estimates I will be pursuing the large number of employees over whom there now hangs a cloud with regard to their bona fides in the conduct of this major Australian Construction Services project. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I am informed that a number of service personnel employed in the Department of Defence are also under investigation with regard to fraud allegations and that either Defence or public prosecutions could also be laid. It is a serious matter when such a high proportion of employees have obviously been subjected to questioning. It will be interesting to note Senator Bolkus's subsequent replies with regard to investigations as to how many departmental and service officers were involved, how many contractors were investigated and how many employees were counselled or disciplined. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days a number of other issues relating to the Australian Construction Services have been raised in this chamber by my colleagues Senator Parer and Senator Newman in particular. Obviously, Australian Construction Services has not operated as an efficient organisation. The fact that it has had the carriage of large contracts and large sums of taxpayers' funds is something that the Senate needs to keep under close scrutiny and it needs to ensure total accountability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -You looked a little surprised, Mr Acting Deputy President, when I rose for the call. I am not on the list of speakers, but I did not have an opportunity to raise a matter last night so I am taking the opportunity now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the last two to three weeks the Government has been attempting to convince us of the seriousness of its fight against welfare fraud as it has been pushing the data matching legislation through this chamber. It was rushed through the House of Representatives and then rushed in here. It has had scrutiny but was passed last night with, I believe, the minimum of attention. During that time, the Government was telling us that it was serious about its fight against welfare fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> It was timely that during this week the Auditor-General's report on the operation of the Department of Social Security's telephone rental concession scheme was tabled in the Senate. The reason I want to speak on it here is that rather than just having that document as a tabled document there should be on the public record an analysis and a description of the sorts of things that the Auditor-General was highlighting. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is very scathing of the lack of accountability and monitoring that occurs during the administration of this scheme. The Auditor-General found that neither DSS nor Telecom Australia was willing to accept primary ownership of the scheme and that there was no clear designation of responsibilities between the two organisations. It was found that the scheme fails to ensure that the concession is paid only to eligible pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In this day and age when we are trying to direct benefits and target them it seems odd that there is such sloppiness in the administration of this benefit. The major problem seems to be that the present system does not prevent vouchers from being used for the payment of telephone accounts which are not in the name of the eligible beneficiary. The Auditor-General's testing of a sample of Victorian vouchers found that 20 per cent of those vouchers had been credited to telephone accounts that did not relate to the eligible beneficiary. He noted that if his sample results were extended nationally it would mean that $8m of the scheme's $40m annual expenditure is being illegitimately claimed. As annual expenditure on the scheme is now over $46m a national extension of the Auditor-General's findings would actually mean that over $9m is being misappropriated annually. </PARA>
<PARA> The cause of the problem is a lack of sufficient checking of an applicant's eligibility for the concession. If applicants put a contact phone number on their benefit application they are automatically considered eligible for the telephone rental concession if there is no known evidence to the contrary. There is no requirement to provide a recent telephone account as evidence that the phone number which has been furnished relates to a service that is held in the name of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> The inability of the Department of Social Security to check applicants' eligibility for the concession is heightened by the fact that its household income test is, in the words of the Auditor-General, not capable of effective implementation. In other words, it is impossible for DSS to check if the income of the household where the concession is being claimed is below the $215 per week threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General also found that the present system is incapable of ensuring that those people who are eligible for the concession receive and make use of the correct concession. Generally only one voucher should be accepted for credit against any one telephone account. The Auditor-General found cases of six vouchers being credited against the account of a non-DSS client and three vouchers being credited to a company telephone account. Although the DSS manual does not permit the use of prior year's vouchers, the Auditor-General found that payments of over $1m were made against prior year's vouchers in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General also found numerous examples of where multiple vouchers were tendered with the payment of a single account. He also found many cases where vouchers were accepted for credit against accounts where the details of the voucher did not accord with the details of the account. The problem of vetting the use of vouchers has been exacerbated by an inadequate control and monitoring of the custody and issue of the replacement vouchers.</PARA>
<PARA> Examples of inadequate control and monitoring include failure to record the number of vouchers issued, failure to stamp replacement vouchers, failure to check an applicant's eligibility for replacement vouchers on the DSS on-line inquiry facility, failure to include the issue of replacement vouchers on updated computer records and failure to include the person's pensioner or beneficiary number on the register of manual issues-a litany of failures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government might have some excuse if these accusations were being made for the first time. But as far back as 1976-77 the Auditor-General found that ineligible people were receiving the concession and that DSS could not verify that Telecom's claims for reimbursement included only eligible recipients. A working party considered the matter between September 1983 and January 1985 but could not agree on how it should be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Joint Committee of Public Accounts expressed concern about these unresolved matters Cabinet convened a second working party and a revised scheme began in January 1988. I would hate to work out how much all these reviews and committees cost. Then in April 1988 DSS's own audit branch found that vouchers were being issued to people who were not entitled to them and that DSS staff were not adequately briefed on eligibility criteria. The report of this latest audit says:</PARA>
<PARA>The matters now raised . . . indicate that deficiencies still exist in the Telephone Rental Concession voucher system and that the new system has not overcome the principal deficiencies in the old system. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the particular concerns for me as a member of the Senate in reading this report, and particularly for those of us who support the law making role of the Parliament, is the fact that since the introduction of the new Telecommunications Corporation Act last year the telephone rental concession has had no legislative basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In his report the Auditor expresses concern that there is no overriding legislation despite the amount of expenditure involved and the fact that both Telecom and DSS have shown a lack of willingness to redress deficiencies. As the Auditor has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>DSS believes that the key responsibility for ensuring the integrity of the voucher system rests with Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, Telecom `is willing to accept responsibility only where the voucher indicates clearly the telephone account for which it was issued'. This week I gave notice of a motion to urge the Government to take immediate action to rectify the ongoing but fundamental problems entailed in the administration of this scheme. Because of the embarrassment it would cause the Government, this motion obviously will not ever see the light of day except on the Notice Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot fob off this report. It must set up an inquiry to ascertain the amount that has been lost and what, if anything, can be done to recoup this money. The telephone rental concession scheme should be enshrined in legislation. The responsibilities of DSS and Telecom must be clearly specified in a formal agreement between them, and the Auditor-General has made a number of pertinent recommendations which have the potential to improve drastically the efficiency of the scheme without imposing an exorbitant financial or human resource burden on either DSS or Telecom. These recommendations should be examined forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the Government's response to the report of the National Committee on Violence and seek leave to incorporate a statement in Hansard and move to take note of the documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The National Committee on Violence was established as a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Governments at the Premiers' meeting on gun control held in December 1987. The catalyst for the establishment of the Committee was the tragic mass shootings which had occurred in Queen and Hoddle Streets in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee presented its report to Governments at the end of January this year, and I released it publicly on behalf of the Commonwealth on 9 February. The report is the result of a year of intensive and productive work by the Committee. Its work program included community forums and committee meetings in all States and Territories, the analysis of hundreds of submissions and responses, a series of discussion papers covering different aspects of violence in Australia and, finally, the preparation of a wide-ranging report. </PARA>
<PARA>Before turning to the contents of that report I would like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Chappell, who chaired the Committee, the Committee members and the members of the Australian Institute of Criminology who provided the secretariat to the Committee. Without the dedicated work of all of these people we would not now have before us what I consider to be a blueprint for a less violent society. I thank and commend them all for their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>The report is a comprehensive and detailed document which comprises some 138 recommendations. These cover a wide range of matters from long term initiatives to overcome the root causes of violence, such as employment and training initiatives, to support for victims of violence. It is made abundantly clear that just as there is no simple, single explanation for the causes of violence so there are no easy panaceas. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of the report will require a long term commitment, over several decades, by all levels of governments as well as by individuals and community organisations. For, the report stresses that the problem of violence cannot be left to governments acting alone. Rather, if we are to change community attitudes and create a less violent society, then the role of individuals and community organisations will also be central to the task. </PARA>
<PARA>This tabling statement then, and the Government response to the report which I will also be tabling, should not be seen as the end of the Government's response but as the beginning. The report provides us with recommendations and principles which will need to become, or remain as the case may be, important considerations in ongoing Government decision making. Of the Committee's recommendations, fewer than a quarter are specifically for Commonwealth consideration, although others will involve Commonwealth participation through, for example, Ministerial councils and, where the Commonwealth sees a national interest, it will encourage all jurisdictions to adopt a uniform approach through appropriate Ministerial councils. </PARA>
<PARA>The remainder of the recommendations deal with matters for consideration by State and Territory governments, local governments and by non-government organisations. State and Territory governments have each received a copy of the report and will be making their own assessments of relevant recommendations. The monitoring unit which I will be announcing later in this statement will have responsibility for ensuring that all nongovernment institutions are aware of those recommendations which are of relevance to themselves and, where appropriate, will seek to assist them in their task by providing a clearing house for information and by providing training seminars.</PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to those matters which are particularly for Commonwealth consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to start by noting how pleased I am to see that the Government is already on the right track in fulfilling many of the Committee's recommendations designed to correct the root causes of violence. Particularly in the areas of income support, education, training and the provision of opportunities for women, young people and Aboriginals we already have in place the types of measures which the Committee sees as central to reducing the incidence of violence in our society. </PARA>
<PARA>The report rates poverty as one of the more important causes of violence and notes at page 142:</PARA>
<PARA> ``. . Most violent offenders, and victims of violence, are drawn from the disadvantaged strata of Australian society. The image which many people who are on low incomes have of themselves is one of worthlessness, expendability, or at best irrelevance. This self-image is reinforced if the person of economic disadvantage belongs to a minority group. Respectable paths to status or prestige are seen as barred too often. This translates into a search for dominance or anger, often expressed in self-destructive or outwardly aggressive behaviour.''; and</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Committee considers that governments and oppositions should avoid the kind of political point-scoring which labels poor people as worthless bludgers. The Committee considers it a responsibility of the Federal Government to provide adequate income support for the most disadvantaged members of society . . . Evidence for the importance of adequate income support comes from countries which lack income support programs and where the level of violence is much higher. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has given social justice enormous priority. That priority has been backed by action rather than words alone. In this respect much has already been done to curb the problems of violence and it is crucial that those policies are preserved in the future if Australia is to reduce the divisive and destructive results of the type of society which treats its disadvantaged people as worthless. </PARA>
<PARA>This year the Government took further steps to expand on its good record in relation to social justice issues. In particular it has introduced the active employment strategy. Job search allowance and Newstart provide financial assistance for the unemployed-while also providing them with the opportunity to retrain and acquire skills so that they are better equipped to compete in the job market. </PARA>
<PARA>These programs combined with the JET scheme, which assists sole parents to re-enter the work force, help people to live their lives with dignity, independence and most importantly, with self esteem. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also addressed poverty by increasing the opportunities for people to obtain a better education. It has developed a system of student allowances which has a genuine and achievable objective of promoting equality of educational opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Government is promoting a better standard of living and financial independence for the disadvantaged through the social work service of the Department of Social Security; increases in the family allowance; the creation of a successful child support scheme which is helping to alleviate poverty amongst custodial parents and income related fee relief to ensure that low and middle income working families are not denied access to child care because of prohibitive fees. </PARA>
<PARA>These are but a few of the initiatives which the Government has taken in addressing the social injustices which the Committee has identified as important underlying causes of violence. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear however that there is still much to be done and that there can be no grounds for complacency. </PARA>
<PARA>To me perhaps the most horrifying findings of the Committee were the vulnerability to children to violence, with infants up to one-year-old being the age group at greatest risk of homicide. </PARA>
<PARA>While child abuse is an issue which is the responsibility of the States and Territories, the Government believes that this is such an important issue that it is appropriate to complement their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to tackle the issue of violence against children as the corner-piece of its initial response to the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I am thus pleased to announce that Cabinet has given in-principle approval to the development over the next 3 financial years of a national campaign against child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>The campaign will build on the Government's social justice initiatives which have already done so much to alleviate child poverty through income support measures and will reinforce the Government's efforts to improve opportunities for children. It will also be extremely timely in view of Australia's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. </PARA>
<PARA>As well as tackling the problem of violence in society such a campaign will contribute towards alleviating problems which can lead to youth homelessness and will thus further the Government's commitment to tackling the problems identified in the Burdekin Report, ``Our Homeless Children''. </PARA>
<PARA>The campaign, details of which are still being developed, will concentrate on a primary child abuse message emphasising positive parenting and the unacceptability of violence. It will combine a vigorous education campaign which will reach a broad cross-section of the community with direct service delivery, through an expanded network of family skills centres, to targeted families. This later aspect of the campaign will build upon the Government's current family skills program which is designed to provide direct assistance and education to families suffering from problems such as sexual and physical abuse. The campaign, with its emphasis on parenting skills, is consistent with the approach put forward by the Council of Social Welfare Ministers, though it covers service delivery in addition to a media campaign. The Government supports the involvement of a joint Federal/State/Territory task force in the development of strategies for the campaign to ensure that it will not duplicate child abuse campaigns currently run by the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>The additional funding will be directed towards increasing the number of family skills training centres, so that centres will exist in all jurisdictions, and developing a basic training package relating to positive parenting and non-violent problem solving which can be used directly with vulnerable families. Add on components to the training package will be developed for professionals and community workers and for use with schools, health services, community organisations and self-help groups. In addition, a vigorous education campaign using selective print media, video tapes and workshops will also be developed. </PARA>
<PARA>The actual services will be located within established Government-funded family organisations which have public acceptance and can provide back-up services. The entire package will have the advantage of enhancing the autonomy and resources of the family to deal with tensions in a constructive non-violent way while respecting and promoting its integrity and survival as a social unit. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that honourable senators will agree with me that, in providing as many families as possible with these basic skills in positive parenting and non-violent conflict resolution, we can make a significant contribution to breaking the cycles of violence which currently cause so much misery and emotional and physical damage to the children who are the potential of this country. For, it is quite clear that improving family skills is regarded as critical in arresting the inter-generational cycle of emotional deprivation, violence and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated earlier, the Committee's recommendations cover a wide range of topics and are addressed to numerous organisations and bodies. Because of the number of bodies involved and the complex interaction of the numerous recommendations the Commonwealth will be establishing a monitoring unit within the Australian Institute of Criminology from 1 January 1991 for a two year period. </PARA>
<PARA>Amongst other things the unit will organise seminars and act as a clearing house in relation to material relevant to the implementation of the report. This will ensure that both government and non-government bodies can learn from the initiatives of others and will help avoid needless duplication of research and activities. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time the unit will have the effect of maintaining low-key pressure on the various bodies to persevere with the issues covered in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The unit demonstrates the Commonwealth's long-term commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In preparing its report the National Committee on Violence divided its recommendation into areas of government and non-government responsibility. The Commonwealth's full response to all recommendations is included in its response which I am tabling in conjunction with this statement. I would like now, however, to comment briefly on the Commonwealth's response to some of those recommendations which touch upon its areas of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>I noted at the beginning of this statement that the Committee arose out of the Premiers' meeting on gun control. In the section of the report which puts forward recommendations for public sector agencies involved with criminal law the Committee has made a number of important recommendations relating to gun control. It sees these recommendations as central to its strategy for a less violent Australia. The Commonwealth has urged effective uniform national gun control laws on the States and Territories both at the Premiers' meeting, which led to the establishment of the Committee, and through the Australian Police Ministers' Council, and will continue to do so. It must be recognised though that the Commonwealth does not have the Constitutional power to impose its preferred position. Nevertheless, it has implemented strict controls on the disposal of surplus military weapons and a ban on sales of semi-automatic firearms to members of the public from the small arms factory at Lithgow (Recommendation 55.1) and, under the auspices of the Police Minister's Council, has developed a generic statement of firearms approved for importation (Recommendation 55.2). </PARA>
<PARA>I consulted widely on the development of this generic statement over the past year and, in November, Australian Police Ministers (apart from the New South Wales Minister) unanimously adopted the statement as a national policy relating to the importation of firearms. Apart from clearly setting out allowable imports, the statement is significant in that it prohibits the importation of all military firearms, such as Chinese military rifles, other than for official purposes. The statement of permitted firearms imports will be incorporated into the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Committee on Violence has recommended (Recommendation 55.3) that rifle clubs established under the Defence Act be placed within the ambit of State Licensing and Registration requirements. Honourable senators will recall that legislation to remove the special status of defence rifle clubs, and place them under the jurisdiction of State gun laws, was disallowed by this chamber. However, it remains the Government's view that the legislation governing defence rifle clubs is an anachronistic and unnecessary use of defence powers. </PARA>
<PARA>Another important aspect of the Committee's work is its identification of the complex relationship between the consumption of alcohol and violence. In the section of the report directed at health and welfare authorities there are several recommendations aimed at reducing the consumption of alcohol, including by an increase in the excise differential between high and low alcohol beer. The Commonwealth has already taken action in this regard. The Government's reforms to the taxation structure of beer announced in the 1988-89 Budget significantly widened the excise differential between low and high alcohol beer with excise now based on alcoholic content. There is now little scope to influence the relative price of low and high alcohol beer by further reducing the excise payable on low alcohol beer since to reduce it further would make low alcohol beer comparable in price to soft-drinks and could encourage the use of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has also taken steps to ensure that marketing and advertising of alcohol encourages responsible use. The Commonwealth will be taking up with industry, in the context of the national health policy on alcohol, the Committee's recommendation that health warnings should be placed on alcoholic beverage containers. Advertising is regulated by a voluntary code, which was recently reviewed in the context of the national policy on alcohol to incorporate community concerns. The revised code prohibits the advertising of alcohol in a way that strongly appeals to young people, promotes excessive drinking or associates alcohol with hazardous activities. The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, comprising Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for health and law enforcement issues, has set up a committee to monitor the effectiveness of the revised code. Should the Committee find that voluntary regulation is unsatisfactory, consideration may need to be given to some form of mandatory control. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth appreciates the special problems the report raises about substance abuse within the Aboriginal community, and its association with violence. The report provides a package of recommendations designed to restore the pride of all Australians in the extraordinary richness of Aboriginal social and cultural traditions, and seeks to find solutions to substance abuse and the other diverse problems which lead to violence among Aboriginals. Some of these matters are currently under consideration by joint Commonwealth and State Aboriginal health bodies, and are also expected to be addressed in the context of the forthcoming report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will continue to fund public awareness and public information campaigns which reflect the objective of raising awareness of indigenous issues and society among all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>In this regard, the Committee recommends the expansion of the Community Development Employment Program, under which Aboriginal communities may choose to forgo individual unemployment benefits in order to receive funds equivalent to the community's unemployment benefits plus an additional grant of 20 per cent of this amount. This fund then supplies wages to provide ongoing employment on community development projects for members of the community who would otherwise be unemployed. I am pleased to advise that the Government expanded the program in 1989-90. There are currently over 30,000 participants in the 130 community development programs operating in communities located from traditional lands in central Australia to the urban centres of coastal New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>In analysing who are the victims of violence the Committee found that they most commonly fall into two broad categories: ``men who engaged in altercations with other men and women and children who suffer at the hands of men with whom they have been living.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government is continuing to intensively tackle the problem of domestic violence. It has allocated $2.1 million to community education on domestic violence through the National Domestic Violence Education Program and a further $1.35 million has been allocated for the next 3 years to continue work on violence against women. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistent with recommendation 45 of the report, the Commonwealth has undertaken a number of initiatives to assist people who are homeless as a result of domestic violence. The most recent is the extension of the supported accommodation assistance program (SAAP) to at least 1993-94, with a guaranteed level of Commonwealth and state funding. It is estimated that, as a result of the new SAAP agreements an additional $20 million will be spent from 1989-90 to 1991-92 by the Commonwealth and State/Territory governments for assistance for women who are homeless as a result of domestic violence. The Commonwealth also supports the recommendation (recommendation 46) that victims of domestic violence should be given priority in the allocation of emergency and low-cost accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>The actions just outlined which the Commonwealth Government has taken in support of the Committee's recommendations are but a small percentage of our initiatives. The Government's response details other initiatives which have been taken in respect of recommendations covering such diverse topics as police and court procedures, violence in sport, violence and the media, environmental planning and victim toys. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a great deal more work to do to implement the recommendations of the report and achieve the type of non-violent society which I am sure all honourable senators would like to see in Australia in the 21st century. I believe, however, that the Commonwealth has made an excellent start and expect further results to flow from the work of the violence monitoring unit and from the consideration of these matters by Ministerial councils and by all levels of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a preliminary response to the Government's response to the report of the National Committee on Violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Almost two years ago, in February 1989, I addressed the National Committee on Violence in my then capacity as Shadow Minister for Justice. </PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion, I voiced the Opposition's concern about the level of violent crime in Australia and what seems to us to be an inadequate response by Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Examples of the poor response by Governments include the decreasing real level of funding of the Institute of Criminology and the Criminology Research Council. I also noted that the apparent lack of adequate funding had imposed substantial restrictions on the capability of the Australian Federal Police to combat crime. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, there was no doubt that the rate of violent crime was on the increase. For example, in my home state of South Australia, since 1982 the rate of violent crime had increased by 102%, robberies were up 65%, serious assaults had increased by 151% and rapes and attempted rapes 109%. </PARA>
<PARA>I noted again that the police force was starved of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Opposition does not regard the deterrent of likely apprehension and severe penalties as the total answer to criminal violence but we do regard it as a significant area which has been neglected. </PARA>
<PARA>I voiced the Opposition's hope that the Committee will report on deterrents-in terms of police resources, apprehension rates and penalties. </PARA>
<PARA>Another area in which the Opposition was particularly interested to learn the Committee's conclusions was that of domestic violence. In particular, we wished to learn the relationship between domestic violence and economic stress within a family as standards of living fall and government family support decreases; and we would be looking to the report to assist policy makers and legislators in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>We were also particularly interested in the relationship between violent crime and alcohol. It was the Opposition's view that in the Government's ``Drug Offensive'' there had been insufficient emphasis upon alcohol abuse. My personal point of view was that I would like to see more of the enormous revenue gained by Government in alcohol taxes re-invested in sensible drinking education programs, detoxification and other treatment centres, in encouraging low alcohol products, and in protection of those abused. </PARA>
<PARA>Courts imposing lower sentences because offenders were intoxicated sends a totally wrong message, and I called for this practice to be remedied, by legislation if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>I further noted the Government's neglect of the issue of illegal drugs and violent crime. It seems to the Opposition that the Government has totally underestimated the extent of importation of narcotics and is expecting the impossible from such bodies as Customs, the NCA and the AFP and State police forces. We need to place greater emphasis on policies to influence both supply and demand. On the one hand, we need education and rehabilitation programs to reduce demand, and on the other hand we need law enforcement and penalties to interrupt and deter supply. </PARA>
<PARA>This was another area in which the Opposition would be looking to the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee with particular interest. </PARA>
<PARA>In the context of these comments, the Opposition welcomed the commendably detailed report of the Committee, ``Violence: Directions for Australia'', which was tabled in May this year. One of the aspects of the report which is most laudable is that it is implementation-oriented; its 138 recommendations and conclusions are phrased in terms of the agencies which have responsibility for the various actions required. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has, in the intervening seven months, come up with an exceptionally detailed 52-page response to the report and the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has not yet had the time to examine this response in the detail which it deserves. However, I would like to make some brief comments on the recommendations relating to some of the issues I have just mentioned and the Government's response to them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition commends the Government's move in the 1988-89 budget to widen the excise differential between low and high alcohol beer. However, it should be noted that it was actually after this that the Committee recommended that the excise differential be increased so that low alcohol beer is significantly cheaper than high alcohol beer. The Committee would obviously not be satisfied with the Government's answer that the excise on low alcohol beer cannot be further reduced without making it comparable in price to soft drinks. I would call on the Government to exercise more ingenuity than is demonstrated here in its efforts to respond to the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>I think all Australians would share the Committee's horror that infants up to one year old are the group in our community at the greatest risk of homicide. The Committee has made a detailed examination of this type of violent crime, and has produced a number of recommendations which are aimed at decreasing the incidence of violence in families. Although these recommendations are principally the responsibility of State governments rather than the Commonwealth, we welcome the establishment of a national campaign for the prevention of child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition commends such moves by the Federal Government as the introduction of the National Domestic Violence Education Program, and the 40% increase in funding for the family services programs run by the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services. </PARA>
<PARA>However, we are disappointed that the Committee did not examine in greater detail the relationship between domestic violence and economic stress in the family, although the recommendations about the availability of respite child care for low income families, and a 008 hotline for advice for parents are peripherally related. </PARA>
<PARA>Another Committee recommendation is that the Commonwealth should sign and ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Convention has in fact just been ratified, with the support of the Opposition. However, I must voice the Coalition's disappointment that the Government failed to make reservations about the need to respect the rights and responsibilities of parents towards their children in key areas. The Minister, Senator Tate, told the Senate on November 7 that he expected that Australia-like the Vatican-would make reservations about the need for the Convention to properly recognise the pre-eminent role of the family. The Convention's articles fail to accord parents the right and duty to provide guidance to children on the information they receive in their formative years and the associations they keep. It further fails to properly recognise the rights and responsibilities of parents regarding their children's educational, physical, social and moral development. We had called on the Government to lodge reservations safeguarding ``the inalienable rights of parents'' in regard to privacy, freedom of association, religion, education and freedom of expression, and we are extremely disappointed that the Government has chosen not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition had hoped that the Committee's report would focus to some extent on deterrents in relation to criminal violence, in terms of police resources, apprehension rates and penalties. We believe that increased penalties and increased likelihood of apprehension would have a significant effect on rates of criminal violence, and we are disappointed that the Committee has not made recommendations with respect to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also draw the Senate's attention to the Committee's recommendation that Governments should increase their contributions to the Criminology Research Council. The Government's response claims that the CRC's funding is now indexed to the cost of living, and is therefore maintained in real terms, but that the level of contributions is an issue to be decided each year in the Budget process. I would point out that the level of the Commonwealth's contribution in 1989 was a pitiful $125,000. The Opposition calls on the Government to do as the Committee recommends and actually increase this amount. </PARA>
<PARA>I note in passing that, in relation to the Committee's recommendations about legislation on firearms control, the Opposition agrees with the Government's response to recommendation 54.1 that the responsibility for such legislation should remain with the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Committee on Violence has produced a report which merits the detailed consideration of governments at the Federal, State and local levels, as well as many other bodies, agencies and individuals in the Australian community. The Opposition supports the Government in its recognition that the implementation of the report requires a long term commitment, of which this debate is just the very beginning. There is, as the Minister says, still much to be done. We share the hope that all responsible Australians will co-operate in facing the enormous challenge ahead of us to bring about a less violent society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition basically supports the introduction of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill for one very sound reason and that is that the Opposition joins with the Government in opposing the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport. In other words, we oppose cheating-cheating on one's fellow athletes, cheating on one's nation, cheating on one's supporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also oppose performance enhancing drugs because in fact they are instruments of death. As the reports of the Senate committee on drugs in sports clearly indicated, the massive development of drugs in sport-in an organised way in some countries, particularly in the former eastern bloc in Europe-has led to disastrous, horrific consequences among those athletes who take them. </PARA>
<PARA> So this Bill seeks to establish as a statutory authority the Australian Sports Drug Agency, which in effect has been operating for some time, as a response to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts drugs in sport inquiry which was headed by former Labor Senator John Black. Other members of the Committee were yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator John Coates, Senator Bob Collins, Senator John Coulter, Senator Julian McGauran, Senator John Panizza and Senator Olive Zakharov. The reports of that committee were issued last year. When issued, the reports generated a very large amount of controversy and there has been much debate in this chamber about the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The question facing us is whether this Bill is entirely the right way to go about resolving the problem that both the Government and the Opposition recognise exists and that we both agree calls for action. In the main, the Opposition agrees with the Government. We do have, however, a couple of specific problems and one of them is this: the Sports Drug Agency is yet another governmental statutory authority being set up, but in this case it is being set up because self-regulation, particularly by amateur sporting bodies, has failed to prevent the widespread use of performance enhancing drugs. On the contrary, there was plenty of evidence before the Senate drugs in sport inquiry that some officials in amateur sports were actively encouraging the use of performance enhancing drugs, in many instances, it seemed, because of the level of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Particularly while the Government uses an elite funding approach whereby funding depends heavily on performance or the prospect of performance, the use of these drugs certainly appears to have been encouraged or at least a blind eye was turned. Some of the evidence in that drugs in sport inquiry, particularly that about some of the power lifting and weightlifting, was quite dreadful. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unacceptable that amateur sporting bodies have not demonstrated in so many instances-I am not saying universally-the willingness, the determination, to stamp out the killer drugs that are used to enhance performance or in fact any performance enhancing drugs. That is one of the reasons we strongly take the view that this organisation should exist as a governmental body only so long as the sporting associations continue to be incapable of policing their own activities. This function could and should properly be performed by a non-governmental body. That is if, of course, the sporting community overall were prepared to face up to its full responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were to take place, if the sporting community itself would do it, who would cover the cost? I would suggest that in that situation any responsible government would ensure that the costs of testing were made available to the sporting bodies so that they would be properly covered. But it is the Government itself that will be running an organisation which has the capacity to earn money by testing for professional sports like rugby league and so on where in fact it has been with great success conducting revenue raising activities. In this context it seems curious that this body should be seen to be, in perpetuity, a governmental body. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason we take the view that there should be a three-year sunset clause in this legislation and not because we want to see the body wiped out. On the contrary, we want to see the body run by the people who ought to be running it and that is the purpose of the sunset clause. In fact, we are proposing a sunset clause so that the matter can be reviewed on our coming to office after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the purpose of the sunset clause-not to do away with the organisation but to ensure that the organisation is run by the most appropriate people to run it, and that is not the Government. The less the Government has its clammy fingers in things the better as far as the Opposition is concerned, particularly in an area where there is every prospect of an efficient, well-run organisation-as this is, I might say, at the moment-being able to raise revenue in large amounts from a whole range of bodies requiring testing.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, because the local organisation, the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, has International Olympic Committee accreditation-as I understand it, it is the only organisation in our region to have that accreditation-it then has the opportunity of earning revenue from drug testing in the whole of our region. It may well be a useful earner of foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact-and I must stress this because there has been some misunderstanding among some people in the sporting community-is that the purpose of our sunset clause is not to wipe out the body but so that when we come into government after the next election we can review whether or not the sporting community has developed the determination to face up to its proper responsibilities to ensure that its own house is in order. I regret that at this stage we simply cannot say that its house is in order, and the Senate committee demonstrated that to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a bit of a problem about privacy. I will not go into that at great length other than to say that the present arrangements are rather curious in that if someone has shown a positive result to a test his or her name will not be made available. So if a football team was tested and half the team was found to be positive, the following week half of that football team would not be on the paddock-with no explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that stems from that is that at any time some highly performed athlete, whether it is a footballer or anyone else, does not turn up to participate or is left out of a team, there will be the inference, unfortunately because of this legislation and this privacy requirement, that he or she has failed a drug test. I think that is a most unfortunate consequence of the privacy aspect of this legislation. While I understand that there are benefits in privacy, there are also disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have a little bit of a problem about the fact that Senator Richardson at one stage suggested that the reason this Bill was not coming forward was some sort of hesitancy or reluctance on the part of the Opposition to have it come forward. On 13 November Senator Richardson made that suggestion in an Appropriation debate and it is utter bunkum. At least he did have the courtesy to say that if that suggestion was wrong he would apologise. I am waiting for him to apologise. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that this Bill was so delayed by an incompetent Government opposite that it came to this chamber after the cut-off date for legislation to come to this chamber. In fact, we had to pass a special enabling motion this morning to enable this very important piece of legislation to come in. Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I took the strong position at the time when Senator Richardson made those remarks that we wanted this legislation in before we got up, despite the heavy program, because we wanted to send the right signal to the sporting community and to young athletes that both the Government and the Opposition were very serious about stamping out drugs in sport. I am glad that the Government has brought this legislation forward even though it is at a very rushed time in the lunch hour when we cannot have divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I wish to make is that we want to move amendments in the committee stage-and I regret to say that the committee stage may now have to be deferred until tomorrow-removing the restriction on people over 65 being on the agency. This is the usual amendment we move. We are opposed to age discrimination. I hope that the Australian Democrats, who recently put out a press release supporting the removal of the age discrimination clause from the pharmacy legislation, will join us in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that the coalition strongly supports the thrust of this legislation and supports the creation of the Sports Drug Testing Agency. Our only reservation is about the manner in which it should conduct itself if and when the amateur athletics organisations demonstrate that they are capable of looking after their own shop and making certain that their own sports are clean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to state from the beginning that the Australian Democrats unequivocally support the Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill and the motives behind it. We congratulate the Government on its actions in establishing the Australian Sports Drug Agency and we fully support the efforts being put into the testing for all forms of performance enhancing drugs. We therefore hope that we will be able to see its passage through some time today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to spend a bit of time now on the foreshadowed Liberal amendments, of which there are a number, beginning with the proposed sunset clause that Senator Michael Baume has just been dealing with. My reading of this clause and my understanding of this issue, coming into this place after 20 years of physical education teaching, is that it would effectively wipe out the effect of this whole Bill. While I understand that it may not totally destroy it, we believe that it would severely reduce the effectiveness of the body. It really puts us back to square one. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see how the amateur sports would be able either to raise sufficient funds or to organise the administration of the testing themselves through this body if government support was effectively withdrawn. We understand that the Opposition has philosophical problems with the establishment of another government instrumentality but in this particular case we have no such problems and therefore will be opposing this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to move on to two other amendments. Unfortunately Senator Crichton-Browne was not able to speak before I spoke, but I understand that he is going to be proposing the other two amendments that have been circulated. These are about the disclosure of confidential information. There are quite persuasive arguments both ways regarding the disclosure of names of athletes whose names have been placed on the register of positive tests. </PARA>
<PARA> There would probably be a deterrent effect if athletes were certain that their names would be splashed about in the media. However, the Democrats believe that a carrot rather than a stick approach should be considered and believe that the education functions of the agency, particularly in schools, will go a long way to changing our future athletes' perceptions regarding drug use.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also a concern for athletes who test positive after unintentional or inadvertent use of legal substances, such as medicines-or indeed coffee, as we saw not so long ago-that contain some level of substances which are in fact on the banned list. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance, the Democrats believe that protection of privacy of the athlete, and particularly of the athlete's family members, in general overrides other considerations. There should be no public crucifixion of athletes, especially before they are dealt with by the ruling bodies of their own sports. The intent of the legislation is quite rightly to solve the problems of cheating by the use of performance enhancing substances. </PARA>
<PARA> But we note that there is already in the legislation the possibility for the Minister to obtain information and, if it is appropriate, for her or him to release information about substance abuse by any particular athlete. This means could be used to cause speculation about particular athletes or teams and we would hope that the Minister would handle this with the utmost discretion. The Democrats therefore believe this matter has been dealt with with a sensitive and fair balance and will be opposing the Opposition amendments on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume foreshadowed an amendment regarding the exclusion, as it stands now, of people over the age of 65. Our concern has been, and continues to be, that these people are not covered under the Comcare legislation. We had thought that the whole problem regarding Comcare had been overcome when Senator Tate agreed to an amendment similar to this in previous legislation in the community services and health portfolio last week. However, it seems that now the Government has indicated it will not be supporting the amendment and has indeed changed its mind. </PARA>

On that basis, I thank Senator Bourne again for her question, to which I can provide only a rough and general answer, though I do have some facts and figures to back me up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of the current parliament, the Committee has examined some 213 Bills both from the Government and from private members and senators. Of those Bills the Committee has commented on just under one-half-100 of them to be exact; we made a century. The Committee's comments on these Bills have ranged across the whole spectrum of its terms of reference. I believe that the success or otherwise of the Committee is evident in several ways. Firstly, the most tangible measure of the Committee's success is the number of amendments--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is not a debate; I am just laying the foundations for the answer. I was told by the person who prepared this answer that it would not take long. The first and most tangible measure of the Committee's success is the number of amendments moved and passed as a result of the concerns expressed by the Committee. In the short time available to me I can only draw attention to the ones which have actually been passed. If Senator Ray had given me more time I could have given further examples. In this regard I refer to the States Grants (Higher Education Funding) Bill 1990, which was amended on the motion of the Government; the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill 1990 and the Livestock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1990, which similarly were amended on a motion of the Government to require the tabling of certain guidelines; the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1990, a very important Bill which was amended on a motion of the Government to require that the annual report of CSL be tabled in the Parliament; the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill 1990, which was amended by the Senate; and the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1990, which was amended by the Senate to remove some retrospectivity to which the Committee had drawn attention. In this context I also note that the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 was referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs explicitly on the basis of comments made by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second way in which the Committee has been successful is in the sense that matters raised by the Committee as possible problems in Bills are not necessarily problems. In many cases, Ministers have responded to the Committee in terms which have allayed the Committee's concerns. Ministers have also assisted the Committee, and ultimately the Senate, by providing clarification or further information on matters raised by the Committee. In this sense, I draw attention to the assistance which has been recently forthcoming in relation--</PARA>

In any event, I conclude by saying that this Committee has been most successful in scrutinising Bills for the Senate and giving a report on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not part of the answer, but I will conclude on this basis: I congratulate Senator Bourne on the question because it is one example of where the legislature, which we all purport to be, at Question Time does in fact have the ability to express its point of view, in contrast to what is normally the case where it is the Executive that is questioned and gives the answers. Although we accept the toing and froing which goes on across the chamber, this is one occasion where the legislature-Senator Lewis would agree with this-has its say.</PARA>

What is the Australian Government's attitude to the establishment of the provisional government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was announced a couple of days ago, on 18 December, that the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the Democratic Alliance of Burma have formed a provisional government, known as the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, based at Maneplaw in Burma. The provisional government is headed by Dr Sein Win, who was elected as an NLD candidate in the May national elections and is a cousin of the leader of the NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest since July 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reports of the number of elected NLD representatives who have associated themselves with the provisional government vary from 10 to 50. Altogether, the NLD won 396 of the 485 seats contested in the May elections. Other members of the provisional government are associated with the Democratic Alliance of Burma, which comprises about 22 different ethnic, student and expatriate organisations. The Karen and Kachin independence movements are prominent members of the Democratic Alliance. The provisional government's claim to popular acceptance in Burma must depend largely on the number of representatives elected at the May elections who are prepared to support it.</PARA>
<PARA> On 7 December, the Secretary of the ruling SLORC-State Law and Order Restoration Council-accused sections of the NLD of planning to set up a parallel government on the border. By imprisoning most of the NLD's leadership and arresting at least 40 elected members, the military regime seems intent on bringing about the situation it most wants to avoid by giving the elected representatives of the NLD, who are not prepared to accept the regime's conditions, little alternative but to make their way to the border and declare themselves for the provisional government. In these circumstances, I am sure it is the case that the sympathies of the international community will remain with the elected representatives who have been so vigorously persecuted by their military rulers and denied their rightful place in a democratic government.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the specific Australian policy in relation to all of this, while the Australian Government has made known our concern over the repression of democracy in Burma, which has led to the announcement of this provisional government, the question of Australian recognition and support for the provisional government does not arise as, of course, it is now the case that Australia recognises states and not governments. We do consider that the establishment of a provisional government reflects the failure of the Burmese regime to honour the results of the May elections and the severe repression and intimidation that has been directed at the NLD, many of whose leaders have been arrested in recent months. We consider that the political crisis in Burma cannot be resolved without genuine democratic change. We call on the military regime in Burma to accede to the widespread popular desire for representative government.</PARA>

It has before it a reference concerning Coronation Hill and the conservation zone in the Northern Territory. It determines how it best proceeds to gather evidence and obtain opinion in order to make a judgment and offer advice to the Government. It is not appropriate for me to say any more than that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important matter. That is why it has led to much consultation and discussion in Western Australia over the last few hours. As recently as an hour before Question Time there had been no resolution favourable to the passage of the Corporations Bill by the Opposition parties in the upper House in Western Australia. There seems to be some suggestion that perhaps a deal can be done between the Western Australian Opposition parties and the Federal Attorney-General in this matter; that cannot be the case. This is a project of all the jurisdictions around Australia, all the elected governments of all political persuasions-State, Territory and Federal-in the Commonwealth of Australia. This project is absolutely essential. That is why it has the support of all those governments responsible to the residents of their particular jurisdictions-States, Territories or, as I say, the Federation as a whole. This legislation, which will allow for political responsibility in the area of companies and securities, and for regional responsiveness in the way in which services are delivered in the various States and Territories of Australia, is extremely important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Beahan alludes to some very serious consequences that could flow from the failure of the Western Australian upper House to pass this legislation. Indeed, there is, for example, a very serious possibility that Western Australian stockbrokers will have to shift their operations interstate in order to continue business because, unless the corporations legislation is passed in Western Australia, the Stock Exchange's national guarantee fund may not continue to cover stockbroking operations in Western Australia. As I understand it, there are some eight stockbroking firms operating in Perth. It would be an absolute paradox if, as a result of the Western Australian Opposition in the upper House failing to pass this legislation, those stockbrokers had to set up really active business offices, say in Adelaide or Melbourne, in order to get the protection of the guarantee fund for their clients. It would be a paradox because it would be sending business to the eastern States, whereas the claim of the Opposition parties in the Western Australian upper House has been that they are trying to protect business in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We know already from previous answers that Western Australian companies wishing to raise funds outside Western Australia will have to comply with consequent additional fees and costs. But of course the most striking paradox and contradiction is that the Western Australian Opposition parties in the upper House may well bring about a situation where the Bond Corporation investigation, amongst others, will be severely restricted by the actions of the Western Australian Opposition. In particular, the Australian Securities Commission will not legally be able to take over this investigation and any Western Australian investigation will not be able to exercise powers of investigation outside Western Australia. I think that all honourable senators could understand the very grave seriousness of that situation developing. As I say, it would be a political contradiction to what has been claimed to be the concerns of the Western Australian Opposition parties in matters relating to these particular activities either being dealt with fairly before judicial tribunals or by other established procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> To have a situation where that investigation could be put in such severe jeopardy would be a total contradiction of the proclaimed stance of the Western Australian Opposition, and indeed calls it into question. I hope that over the next few hours-it is only late morning in Western Australia-there will still be an opportunity for the Western Australian Opposition parties to come to an understanding of the import and the consequences, perhaps unintended, of their stance, which I hope has been well motivated on behalf of the business community in Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Mr Justice Barry Maddern, handed down a decision under sections 107 and 108 of the Industrial Relations Act. In that decision he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am not satisfied that conciliation has been completed and, in the circumstances, I am not of the opinion that the matters, at this stage, should be referred to a Full Bench in the public interest. Conciliation proceedings will be conducted by Commissioner Donaldson as soon as practicable. If agreement is not reached as a result of those proceedings I would be prepared to consider a renewed application pursuant to Section 107 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>My understanding, as a consequence of that decision today, is that Commissioner Donaldson has listed a proceeding for Monday, at which the parties can attend. I am not at this stage advised whether it is a hearing or a conciliation conference but I believe it to be a conciliation conference. If I am right in presuming it is a conference then I believe that does offer an opportunity for the parties-the unions, workers and employers in this particular case-to thrash out the various issues that have featured in the SPC case and resolve them. I wish the parties well, and trust that they can negotiate a satisfactory outcome. I acknowledge that this proceeding is going on in the Commission, a forum in which the award can be varied if there is an agreement or arbitrated decision in the end to vary, and that should speed the process considerably.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also say that this morning, on entry to Parliament House, I was asked by a reporter whether I knew that a New South Wales county council was doing an SPC deal and bypassing the unions. I said, in that particular case, that if anyone is doing deals of that nature they are ill advised or foolish to bypass the union movement because an award will need to be varied in the end, otherwise a breach of an award would occur. The union is an applicant or a respondent to such an award and it will be heard in those proceedings. It is advisable and prudent to involve all parties in a consideration of a particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA> I have now been advised that on Radio 2GB it was reported that the Federal Government is going to step in and stop a pay deal. It quoted me as allegedly saying that, and Mr Peter Reith and the New South Wales Government have described this as the Government being clearly worried. Can I say that in this case it refers to a pay arrangement being heard before the New South Wales Commission concerning the Prospect County Council. I was not responding to the question, which was a question at large, not in particular, with any knowledge of the Prospect County Council.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not proposing to step in. This is an excitable report by a radio journalist and it is only matched in its excitement by the meddling interference in industrial relations by Peter Reith and the Opposition. They would be best advised to keep out. Their presence may well promote their policies, but it does not in any way help the parties, the workers, the unions and the companies. The Prospect County Council issue is before the New South Wales Commission. It is being dealt with there. That is the right way to proceed and I commend the parties and hope the matter is resolved as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, in general terms, of the program for making available generic drugs in order to reduce the cost to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme-which means the cost to taxpayers-for the provision of suitable medication for those who suffer from a particular disease or illness.

In relation to any particular generic drug's availability, I have no information in the brief. I will certainly bring it to the attention of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether the Guild itself asked for a delay in the implementation of this particular scheme-if Senator Herron says that it did make that request I have no doubt that it was made-I am sure that the Minister had good reason, on balance, for deciding that the scheme should be implemented. If the early implementation of that scheme has led to the situation where some generic drugs are not available as might have been anticipated, I feel confident that Mr Staples will take that into account in any relevant decision as to the cost to those who might be required to pay full cost for a labelled drug.

What is the Minister's response to such a suggestion?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="6167" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen that suggestion from the magistrate, Mr Barritt. There have been a number of suggestions emanating from the Northern Territory in the last six months because of problems with alcohol and, obviously, there are considerable problems. When one focuses on the difficulties of the excessive use of alcohol, one quickly comes to the conclusion that the solutions do not lie totally within the social security system. In fact, the majority of them are outside it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of departments, since an incident in Alice Springs with a march of Aboriginal women some time back, have been meeting to bring to bear a range of possible solutions. However, I would not have thought that food vouchers would be one of them for a number of reasons. Firstly, in response to some suggestions made by Mr Perron some time ago that social security should be paid only to Aboriginals who went back to their stations, we said that we would never support systems of A-grade and B-grade citizenship. I think the same would apply to a suggestion about food vouchers. The second reason would be that if one looks at their use in countries like the United States, then one will always see the creation very quickly of an illegal market in the trade in them. By its very nature, that ensures that if one is trying to deliver to those in need, those who seek to make a quick buck will never have that as their priority. So on those grounds the proposal ought to be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that already more than 95 per cent of payments of benefits made from the Alice Springs office of social security are actually split between husband and wife and children. That means that wives are receiving their half of the married rate of benefit plus whatever amounts have accrued for their children. That means that at least some of those problems ought to be addressed. The difficulty is that in remote Australia the problems are not simply about access to social security payments, but about access to better health facilities, better education and training and, of course, employment. It is in all those areas that the Government will be seeking to address the problems.</PARA>
<PARA> We would hope that the working group that has been established can report on this early in the new year and we can take some real steps to improve the situation. But food vouchers will not be the way to go and the Government will not be considering that suggestion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The complaint in the article in the Australian arises from the decision to transfer nurse education from hospital based courses to higher education. It is a decision which was strongly influenced by changes that have occurred in nursing practice in recent years. The change recognised that nurses are part of a team involved in the delivery of health care services. As such, they need a broad understanding of the principles that underlie the work they do. In turn, health care has become much more complex in recent years, particularly as procedures based on sophisticated technology have become much more common.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be recognised that a large proportion of the nursing work force is employed in acute care hospitals where the average length of stay for patients has decreased and where patients who are in hospital are more seriously ill. In summary, the level of expertise and responsibility required of nurses is higher than it has ever been. The Government recognised that and recognises that while the humanities base of nursing practice will always be very important registered nurses must also have a thorough grounding in the basic sciences in order to understand the illnesses and medical procedures affecting their patients. As this need has become more obvious in recent years, prospective students may still not realise that science is an important prerequisite for success in nursing.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to Senator Colston's second question, the Government recognises that clearly each institution must look carefully at the course content of its nursing program and the assessment procedures. Standards for entry into nursing must also be examined and, where appropriate, bridging courses developed and offered for students who lack the appropriate entry qualifications. In response to the third question, the most important contribution the Government can make is to support the nurse education programs, recognising that nursing is now a profession requiring strong academic training. Nursing as a career should be promoted in schools with emphasis on the challenge and opportunities it provides. We should also be attempting to attract stronger students into nursing, not compromising the standards of existing courses because of a perception of nursing in the community that has not caught up with the reality of nursing in practice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. On Monday he boasted that under the accord policies to 1988 the Government had provided `low wage outcomes and a distribution in factor shares away from wages to profits'. Now the Treasurer's contractionary policies have engineered a depression, destroying many small businesses, contracting most of the larger businesses and producing massive unemployment. Can the Minister tell us how his current industrial relations policies-by that I mean another accord and larger unions, with those unions involved in all negotiations over wages and those negotiations strictly controlled by the umpire-will help Australia to develop wage costs more closely related to productivity which economic recovery in Australia so desperately needs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say, with the red light flashing, is that sometimes I am accused of taking a long time to answer a question, but now I am asked to give a whole policy speech. I do not think I can fit it into the remaining 45 seconds of Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me, however, answer the question by citing two outstanding examples of how we are managing in the current economic circumstances. The first example is an example of something that was possible to achieve only because of the accord. About three or four weeks ago we brought out the September wage round with a tax cut. We therefore in one fell swoop lowered the rate of inflation in this country without imposing wages costs on employers but at the same time maintaining the purchasing power of wages. We did that in one swoop. The only way in which we could manage to do that in Australia was with an accord. Many of the economic commentators hailed that as a significant policy breakthrough at the time, recognising that, in a completely decentralised system such as the Opposition preaches, that type of management is not possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the changes in union rationalisation are aimed at creating one bargaining unit in the workplace. In Australia there are up to nine unions in medium-sized companies; management deals with nine separate bargaining arrangements. By creating one bargaining unit we simplify the bargaining process, remove the old demarcation barriers and create multi-skilling, career path possibilities and training and accreditation for advancement. We do all that in a way which generates higher productivity per head of employed worker in the work force. It is clear from our record that productivity per head has increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally-this has not been an exhaustive answer-the Government is managing a wages system which has some centralised increases but is now shifting the focus to enterprise. The national wage case currently sitting is about, in part, determining the guidelines for enterprise level bargaining under a managed, decentralised system and doing it in a way that will ensure that productivity is generated properly and that the benefits of that productivity are shared for the economy and for the workers.</PARA>

The full text of the response is recorded at page 5213 of the Senate Hansard. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of the answer in Hansard. It is a bit esoteric for honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, in response to the JCPA report the Government has decided that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for Commonwealth-owned or controlled entities, but did not accept that the ANAO should be established as a statutory authority. With regard to the release of 60 full-time staff for efficiency audits referred to by Senator Olsen, the report concluded that initiatives already undertaken by the Auditor-General, or suggested in the review and properly matters for decision by the Auditor-General, could lead to additional resources, broadly equivalent to some 60 full-time staff, becoming available for efficiency auditing over the next two years or so. These resources, in the order of $3m per annum, together with the $2m per annum increase in funding for efficiency audits announced in the Government's earlier response to the JCPA report, represent a very substantial increase in resources above the level allocated to such tasks at the time of the report, then estimated at $1m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 November 1990 Senator Crichton-Browne asked a question without notice regarding the interception of telephone calls. I answered that question and Senator Crichton-Browne then asked a supplementary question. He again referred to the matter in the Senate adjournment debate of 29 November, referring in particular to a radio interview with Mr John Lewis of Telecom Protective Services, Western Australia. I have some additional information for Senator Crichton-Browne in respect of those matters. Telecom has now identified a case to which Senator Crichton-Browne may have been referring in his question without notice of 27 November 1990 and in his follow-up comments in the adjournment debate on 29 November 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case involved Telecom staff in a Perth district where technical staff responding to a complaint regarding the status of a previously reported customer fault conducted tests and intercepted a conversation between the customer-that is, the complainant-and a Telecom technician. The incident has been investigated by Telecom Protective Services, which is currently preparing a brief of evidence to be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration. Telecom views any breaches of the Telecommunications (Interceptions) Act most seriously and has assured the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, that the remarks made by Mr John Lewis in the radio interview were in no way meant to reflect at all on comments made earlier by Senator Crichton-Browne.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Crichton-Browne on 27 November 1990, relating to interception and monitoring of telephone calls by Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>I should not want it thought that my question was stimulated by one particular complaint, as there have been a number. It would be evident to all of us that when a matter of this nature is raised in a public forum almost half the community suddenly imagines that it is having its telephone calls monitored and one receives a flood of complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some very disturbing features running through the thread of complaints that have come to me. In my view the intrusion into privacy is a breach of the most fundamental kind and it is grossly offensive to all Australians. There is, and there always will be, a great temptation for Telecom or any other organisation which has at its disposal access to tap in immediately to somebody's telephone calls for whatever purpose, whether it be for workers compensation purposes or for other equally unsavoury reasons. It is a matter of sadness to all of us that probably a considerable majority of the Australian people, rightly or wrongly, now suspect from time to time that their telephone calls are no longer private. I suspect that there is not a senator in this chamber who does not work under the premise that any conversation he has on the telephone is not being intercepted by somebody else. I am not necessarily suggesting that this is done by Telecom, but this is the state of mind and perception which, sadly, is permeating the community. I am careful when I say that not to suggest that there is something terribly wrong with Telecom and the vigilant way in which it deals with these matters at an official level when they come to the notice of management. </PARA>
<PARA> However, recent events in Western Australia give rise to concern. I have had my own telephone monitored by Telecom for three months because of my belief and Telecom's belief that my telephone calls were being intercepted and my conversations recorded. Frankly, with the events unravelling in Western Australia at present, my concern and that of Telecom has had very good cause. When asking questions of the Minister in respect of this matter, I have been very careful not to be inflammatory because I think it would do little to unsettle the vast majority of decent Australians by raising spectres of this nature. I hope that whenever these matters are brought to my notice-whether they be from the management of Telecom or from Telecom employees-those people will not as a result of that be vilified, intimidated, threatened or compromised in their future careers or promotions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented and I wish to make a personal explanation. Yesterday Mr Courtice on the Bundaberg commercial radio station 4BU misrepresented me in drawing differences between me, Senator O'Chee and the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, when he said, in effect, as it was reported to me, that Senator O'Chee and I supported tariffs and Mr Fischer supported free trade and that we would all have to get our acts together.

This obviously includes the right for Australia to utilise means such as protection against countervailing and dumping when Australian primary producers have been the victims of subsidies and dumping from overseas. This is a matter on which Senator Button concurred yesterday in Question Time. I do not intend to sink to the grubby personal level of attack that Mr Courtice has brought upon those on this side of the chamber and in the other place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this time of the year it is not unusual to reflect on the events of the past 12 months. This was a year in which the Australian people narrowly, and clearly with hesitation, entrusted the reins of government to the Australian Labor Party for a fourth successive term. I use the word `entrusted' advisedly because government is a privilege. It was not an election in which the people voted confidently. It was fought against the background of a massive balance of payments deficit; the background of a foreign debt that had trebled under previous Labor administrations; and the background of people struggling under record high interest rates-interest rates which were not only having the claimed effect of dampening demand but also were crushing Australian business, crushing the capacity of Australia to produce competitively. Therefore, instead of getting the country out of the economic decline into which it had entered, the Government was, in fact, contributing to its further decline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that election we set out an alternative-a major program of reform: reform of the labour market; reform of national infrastructure-roads, transport, the waterfront; privatisation of government enterprise and simplification of regulatory reform. But a clearly nervous and hesitant community was not quite ready for change. Instead it accepted what was put to it by an arrogant Treasurer (Mr Keating), the mastermind of the growing economic catastrophe who pledged that everything was on track, that the most worrying figures were beautiful figures and that the public need not be concerned because there would be a soft landing. </PARA>
<PARA> When the community hesitated, Mr Hawke intervened and talked of his special relationship. He claimed his much flaunted special relationship and asked that the public again trust him. In fact, he said, `Trust the team. Trust the Treasurer and me. If you are concerned by the Treasurer, don't be, because I am alongside him. We won't let you down'. The Government offered no new policy direction at the election, just a call for trust and, of course, a very negative campaign on the Opposition about which it boasted after the election.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have witnessed since the election is an amazing betrayal of that trust. Those are not just my words. I do not often quote editorials, but I refer the Senate to last Saturday's Adelaide Advertiser editorial, which is normally regarded as a sensible, moderate editorial. The writer headed that editorial `Labor has betrayed our trust' and wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The people . . . are no longer prepared to accept the insensitive arrogance of a Government which has lost credibility and direction. They no longer trust federal Labor. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> There are fears among decent hardworking people that their jobs and consequently their personal and domestic security are under threat. People are despairing for their future and the future of their children and grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA> Who can blame people for being frightened when the Labor leadership plainly has no idea where the economy is going?</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> A Government which refuses to accept what the people already knew about the parlous state of the economy and the desperate plight of working Australia can no longer command confidence, attention or respect. Federal Labor has betrayed Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that those are the sentiments of many Australians at the moment. Australians have been appalled at the obscene spectacle of Messrs Hawke and Keating brawling over the spoils of office, power and influence whilst the community suffers. What I think the community is so upset about is the timing of this leadership brawl. When Australians are suffering, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer seem more concerned about who will maintain power. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are also appalled about Mr Keating's J-curve which, in effect, became a U-turn. Australians remember when the Treasurer said so little time ago that hell would freeze over before his policies would lead the country into a recession. Now he boasts that it is his engineered recession; it is being managed; it is the recession that the community had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short will have an opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate and will look at the economic mismanagement which has led to this crisis. I hope that he will have a chance to touch upon the confusion now evident in industry policy. Not only are we witnessing a leadership contest but also we are witnessing a clear split within Cabinet as to the way out of that economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins is calling for a change of policy-a more interventionist approach. He is described in the last edition of the Bulletin as `the Left's new ministerial visionary'. The Treasurer is calling Dawkins's approach `a grave mistake'. Senator Button, it seems, is calling for a more interventionist approach in the export economy but not the domestic economy. So it is not surprising that the community is confused and has lost confidence. Where is the Prime Minister whilst this debate is raging? The Prime Minister is sitting firmly on the fence. No-one regards him as a leader any longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be interested in Senator Faulkner's contribution. I think it will be his first in this place. Senator Alston will look at the thousands of people who are becoming unemployed every week as a result of this Government's economic mismanagement and the human suffering from the Government's engineered recession. And Senator Faulkner calls himself a socialist. I refer the Senate again to the article in the Advertiser:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Across Australia there are now 698,000 people officially looking for work. In South Australia alone 62,000 people are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> Across Australia 42,000 jobs were lost in November, 7,700 of them in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>These sterile figures, while totally unacceptable in themselves, must not be allowed to disguise the true picture of human misery and suffering. Labor has said, `If you can't govern the party, you can't govern the country'. What a boomerang. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me dwell for a moment on the litany of divisions that currently exist in the Government Party and within the Government. The Gulf crisis, probably even beyond the economy, is the most critical matter facing Australia at the moment. We have the Left putting down in writing the conditions on which the Prime Minister could and could not act. Then the Centre Left, fearing that it would be left out, had to do the same thing and leak to the press its own letter to the Prime Minister. All that does is compromise the Prime Minister's capacity to indicate even a unity within the governing Party. </PARA>
<PARA> On privatisation we saw a dispute raging for months. It finally had to end when the special conference to achieve compromise was held, while the economy continued to deteriorate. On telecommunications reform, there was the Keating position, and then the Beazley position, both made publicly. There was a campaign of leaks by Mr Keating, the whole of Mr Beazley's Cabinet submission appeared in the paper, and then there was a Treasury minute criticising the Beazley submission and introducing a new option. Senator Button argued against the Beazley option and, we understand, informed the Centre Left that telecommunications reform was not important anyway. On the environment there was public debate between Ministers Kerin and Griffiths; Kerin and Griffiths attacked the conservationists; Griffiths attacked Kerin's sustainable development process. On infrastructure, Mr Howe of the Left called for a massive increase in spending, not the tokenistic gimmick advocated by Senator Richardson. And so one could go on. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most unedifying of all was the insight we have had into the internal workings of the faction system. We got that insight from John Gayler, who, speaking of the Right, said, `I'm not interested in their particular form of thuggery'. He told us that incompetent Ministers are in the ministry simply because of their factional allegiance. So it is not surprising that the Australian people are so disillusioned and so disappointed. It is not surprising that, in terms of the editorial to which I referred a moment ago, they are feeling betrayed by Labor. It is a sorry record since Labor's re-election. It is a record of which Labor members should not be proud. </PARA>

<PARA> Mao Zedong once said that all power comes out of the barrel of a gun. Well, in this matter of public importance all intellectual power comes out of the columns of the Adelaide Advertiser, it seems. That is the basis on which Senator Hill wrote and read his speech-an editorial in that newspaper. The whole story that Senator Hill tells, when strung together, is a series of unsubstantiated allegations from various snippets in the press. I find it extraordinary that Senator Hill made some of the allegations he did in his speech today, particularly when they concern me or my position on a certain matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The first part of Senator Hill's speech was devoted to telling us why his side lost the last election. As he put it, there was a very nervous community. It was a very nervous community when it examined Senator Hill's leader in the last election, and indeed it was entitled to be. Mr Peacock had been leader for a relatively short time in this incarnation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I study polls from time to time, but I also study other things; and I think that is advice that the honourable senator should take as well. Senator Hill, in the speech which he wrote and read, referred to the spectacle of brawling in the Government and the economy in the last 12 months. As he put it, he gave an end of term review of the economic situation in the past year. I must explain to Senator Hill yet again that we do not pretend that it is easy to manage an economy like the Australian economy with a commodity-led dollar and a great degree of dependence on commodity exports. Those things are very difficult and were handled in times gone by by tinkering with exchange rates by various conservative governments which ignored the entire issues of Australian competitiveness-the competitiveness of the financial sector and of Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill talked a little about industry. In the seven years of the Fraser Government, during which time Senator Hill was here, there was not one change of any significance to tariff policy. Of the 65 per cent reduction in tariffs which has taken place since the early 1970s not one percentage point took place under a Liberal government. Senator Hill was here, as was Senator Short. Senator Alston was here as an office boy, where he still ought to be. I repeat: not one percentage point of change took place in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill speculated on changes in industry policy. There was no change in those last seven years that the Liberals were in government. There have been enormous changes in the time that we have been here, and change is difficult to manage. These people would not know about that because they never tried it.

Where the differences arise is the Opposition's new-found machismo to tinkle at the edges with talk about micro-economic reform and all those sorts of things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here, on the second last day of sitting, with still dozens of Bills before this chamber, spending an hour on a matter of public importance raised by the Leader of the Opposition in this place, Senator Hill. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The incapacity of the Government to address Australia's real economic and social problems compounded by a lack of leadership and debilitating succession squabble. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats do not disagree with the earlier proposition that this Government has demonstrated an incapacity to address Australia's real economic and social problems but we would say that that incapacity is shared by the Opposition. Senator Button a minute ago asked the question, `What are the differences between the economic policies of the Government and the Opposition?' and I interjected at the time that they are minuscule and very hard to find. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week in this place, again in a debate raised by the Opposition, I very briefly put down our views about the economic policies of both the Government and the Opposition and I will do that again. The policies are both based on an ideological commitment to deregulation and privatisation leading to private sector irresponsibility which we have seen and for which ordinary Australians are now paying, and leading also to unrestrained borrowing overseas which has, of course, been a major factor in blowing out our foreign debt. The Government has failed to reduce the current account deficit and, as we know, the Budget this year predicts a deficit of about $18 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we look at the second plank of the Government's strategy, that is, the high interest rates, which were designed to choke off demand for imports. This is a very single-stranded strategy, a blunt instrument and one that has been very counterproductive. In the process a recession has been induced, and this is being felt especially in my home State of Victoria. The Government's national unemployment target has already been exceeded and worse is yet to come. We are staring down the barrel of one million Australians being unemployed. The cost is being felt in human terms. The Smith Family has reported, as I said last week, that in the last four months there has been a 40 per cent increase in emergency relief requests. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has documented that currently we still have over 300,000 children living in absolute poverty. We only have to read the newspapers daily to see these problems generated by the Government's economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policies of privatisation and deregulation do not give us any more comfort. Full privatisation is what it is after and the faster the better. The Opposition proposes a consumption tax which will hit the poor and low income families simply because it is not prepared to chase the real tax cheats and avoiders, any more than the Government has been. It offers at least another $2 billion cuts in Government spending and social infrastructure and privatisation of the social security system. As I say, the Opposition's policies do not give us any comfort of any great competence on its behalf to address the major economic concerns before this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the second plank-the social problems which the proposition before us suggests have not been dealt with by the Government-the records of both the Opposition and the Government are equally abysmal. Social justice is the trendy term that is bandied about by the Government, which even put out glossy little brochures bragging about how much social justice it is spreading around. Let us have a little look at how it is going. As I say, I am taking the Opposition up on its record at the same time because it has not been prepared to go out on a limb to support ordinary Australians, and it is about time the community took a long, hard look at how the Opposition's record stands up on these principles as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again we sit here and see the Opposition supporting Government measures designed to hit easy targets, that is, the people in this country who do not have the power, the money or the influence to take on the Government. It seems a pretty fair assessment of the Opposition to say that it is really full of sound and fury, such as we are hearing and seeing today, signifying nothing. It does lots of posturing, lots of huff and puff but, when it comes to the crunch, it does nothing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us look at the Opposition's recent record, because Senator Alston is going to get up in a minute, so I am told by his leader, and tell us all about the social justice and community service records of propositions put forward by the Opposition and how it will demonstrate its capacity. Let us see what the Opposition has been up to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The liquid assets test has been introduced for unemployment and sickness beneficiaries That is a patently unfair measure that further penalises people for being unemployed or sick. The Democrats voted to remove that altogether. Where was the Opposition? Voting with the Government, of course! On rural policy, after all the lip-service paid to rural Australia by both the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia, it took a virtual revolt from rural backbenchers-to their credit-to get the Opposition to support our proposal to remove the assets test on family allowance. Then, just two days ago in this chamber, rural families witnessed the spectacle of the Opposition parties voting against our amendment to exempt the family farm from the assets test on family allowance supplement. The Democrats know, and rural Australia certainly knows, that the Opposition's excuse, that the family allowance supplement is a welfare payment, is pretty weak. </PARA>
<PARA> Many farming families now need this welfare payment just to keep their heads above water and would not meet the income test. In opposing the Democrats' amendment at the time, the Opposition was consigning these families into further poverty. As my colleague Senator Meg Lees has commented in a subsequent press release, `You can't eat dirt'. That is clearly what the Opposition and the Government expect farming families who are not getting an income to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners have not been exempt from these attacks either. We have seen a wave of attacks in recent months. The $2.50 charge for pharmaceuticals is one that has caused us, and many others, great concern and expects those elderly who are using pharmaceuticals-and obviously the ill elderly as well-to make decisions that should be medical decisions made by the prescribers of those pharmaceuticals and not by the pensioners themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as usual, has ignored much evidence which has indicated that this is a wrong, potentially dangerous and unnecessary measure. It has steamrolled ahead, once again with the support of the Opposition, despite stirring speeches by Opposition senators in this chamber. But when it comes to the crunch, they vote with the Government-a scene to which we have become accustomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The deeming of the rate of return on loans and accounts held by pensioners has clearly caused, and is causing, the pensioners of this country more concern than almost any other measure in recent memory because of its poor execution and its lack of consideration of the fact that it affects old frail people who may have difficulty managing their affairs. It unjustly penalises all the elderly in these circumstances. Again, the Opposition had a chance actually to oppose something. If it had joined with the Democrats in just one or two areas, we could have made this measure much fairer for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Young people have not been exempt either. We had the wonderful scenario earlier this year of the Opposition joining with the Government to reduce support payments to young people. How this is supposed to benefit the community is well and truly beyond me, to say nothing of the terrible effect it has had on thousands of already disadvantaged young Australians. It is no wonder that the youth of this country are so cynical about politicians when this is the sort of treatment they get at the hands of the Government and the Opposition alike. </PARA>
<PARA> The list goes on. I must say that many of the Government measures are particularly mean and are targeted at precisely those Australians who bear the brunt of Mr Keating's engineered recession. Those of us who have been reading the financial papers in recent weeks and who listened to the AM program this morning know that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is getting along very nicely, thank you very much. By taking advantage of tax rates in this country of around 2 per cent, he has been shoring up his international operation. Yet, young people, pensioners, the sick and the elderly are paying under this Government, with the support of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing that the Government or the Opposition have done this year indicates that either of them has the capacity to come to grips with, or is interested in, seriously coming to grips with the social problems affecting this country. Of course, this is because they both follow the same ideological economic rationalism based on deregulation and privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the matter of public importance that is before us today talks about the compounding of the Government's incapacity by a lack of leadership and a debilitating succession squabble. This is really the nub of the proposition that has been put to us today. The Opposition has raised this matter for the purpose of political point scoring. It wants to engage in a little bit of personality politics. It wants to see some blood on the floor. After all, the House of Representatives has come back to sit today. The Opposition in the Senate is desperate to get a bit of media coverage. Most of the members of the media are over on the other side of the House watching the A-team. I must say that, in the face of a legislative program which is still packed and in the face of major issues that ought to be before the Parliament, the media and the general public, this is the sort of thing that brings into ill repute the actions and work of politicians and political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say that the media colludes with the Opposition in this sort of practice. Last weekend's newspapers demonstrate what I am talking about. With all of the challenges and despair that exists, the major issues dealt with in virtually every weekend paper by key journalists, most of whom work upstairs in the Press Gallery, was the succession squabble that has been raised today by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Weekend Australian Paul Kelly wrote a full page feature article under the heading `Labor's love lost'. He said nothing about the fact that in that very same week this Government, which claims not to be doing so, actually passed legislation which will allow it or a conservative government not only to sell off 100 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank but also, if it wants to, to sell it off to foreign interests. Mr Kelly was more interested in writing about blood on the floor between Keating and Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Michelle Grattan wrote an article in the Age under the heading `Awaiting more thrills in the leadership cliffhanger'. I do not think Michelle will find too many thrills in what the Opposition has to say in the debate this afternoon. The Sunday Sun carried an article by Peter Logue under the heading `Hawke and Keating can't last' and an article by Richard Farmer under the heading `Doubts on leadership still linger on'. There was nothing from them, or any of the others, about the fact that under the Opposition's privatisation plan for Telecom and the Government's plans for deregulation Australian women are going to be seriously disadvantaged. This was pointed out by Ann Moyal in a paper entitled `Women and the Telephone in Australia'. I consider that to be a major issue worthy of the attention of journalists of the capacity of those I have named. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan Ramsey wrote an article in the Sydney Morning Herald which was headed `Keating slips into bleak recession'. This was not an economic piece. The article contains a cartoon which shows Mr Keating and Mr Hawke engaging in a very active wrestle at the edge of a waterfall. This very good cartoon has nice squiggles which demonstrate a great deal of movement. Yet, the Sunday Age contains a photograph of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating with their arms around each other. Underneath the photograph is an article by Michael Gordon headed `Death of a double act?'. The same paper contains an editorial on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra Times of last Saturday contained an article by Tony Wright headed `Keating's speech and a breach of confidence'. I can understand the basis for Senator Hill's remarks about the Adelaide Advertiser. I should add that the television people conducted doorstop interviews on the Senate side door on only two days last week although there have been four weeks of sittings. The only question that was asked was about the squabble between Mr Keating and Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the issues that the journalists and the Opposition could be looking at? Let us join together and put pressure on the Government, as the very responsible Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, is doing in order to get big funding for Aboriginal health. We could use a little bit of help on those sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be nice to see the media pay some attention to the fact that after years of work by senators from these cross benches, the Government has finally agreed to reduce the duty on wheelchairs, pacemakers and defibrillators for disabled and ill people in this country. But it appears that this is not a major news item. It is much more important that Mr Keating and Mr Hawke should shed blood on the floor in the ministerial area. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole range of major key issues that are before this country are being neglected by the Opposition. We need only look at the number of futile questions that have been asked this week to see where the Opposition's priorities are. We only have to look at the important legislation that has yet to be passed, amended or dealt with in some way or other. Yet we are spending time on this sort of exercise. This demonstrates what the Opposition's priorities are. It is particularly ironical because its capacity to solve the real problems is no better than that of the Government's. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Accustomed as I am to the ramblings of the Australian Democrats in this place, I am nevertheless amazed that Senator Powell and the Democrats find the most serious economic crisis since the 1930s not to be a matter requiring debate in this chamber. This matter of public importance brought to the Senate today by Senator Hill goes to the heart of the problems and hardships facing all Australians. There is no need for Australians to be suffering these problems and hardships. They are not imposed on us by an act of God or by circumstances beyond our control. Rather, they are the deliberate, inevitable, engineered result of the subject of the matter of public importance which we are dealing with at the moment, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The incapacity of the Government to address Australia's real economic and social problems compounded by a lack of leadership and a debilitating succession squabble. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt about it: our problems are home grown. They have been planted, nurtured and brought to full bloom by an incompetent government which not only fails to address our real economic and social problems but also fails to recognise what those problems are-a government which chooses to put petty personal ambitions and super egos above the national interest and the common good. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill has dealt with the leadership issue in his remarks and Senator Alston will cover the social consequences of the Government's failure when he speaks later in the debate. My main purpose today is to highlight the evidence and the extent of the Government's incapacity and incompetence in its economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence of the Government's incapacity to provide effective economic management abounds. The main cruel evidence, of course, lies in the deep recession Australia is now experiencing. This is a recession that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said on 22 March of this year-two days before the Federal election-that the Government would not let happen. This is a recession which he now says we had to have. What nonsense, what arrogance and what economic blindness. The only reason that Australia has had to have this recession is the Government's gross criminal negligence and incapacity to provide effective economic management. The result is for most Australians the greatest hardship in living memory. </PARA>
<PARA> At the business level, particularly in small business, bankruptcies have soared to record levels. Unemployment is, to use the words of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), rocketing up, and he admits that it will go much higher in 1991, despite the cloud-nine assertion by our discredited Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that it will not reach double figures. Indeed, Mr Hawke put forward this assertion as a truth only two weeks ago. But we all know what the word `truth' means to this Prime Minister and this Government: it means the exact opposite to how all other Australians define it. This is the same Prime Minister who said again just two weeks ago, `The Australian people should not fear the recession'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have news for our Alice in Wonderland Prime Minister: Australians do fear this recession, and well they might as the dole queues grow by more than 1,000 people a day, as more and more businesses go under and as more of those children that the Prime Minister said would not be living in poverty by 1990 go into poverty. This recession, to quote both the Treasurer and the former Finance Minister, has been deliberately engineered? What gain has Australia derived from it? Absolutely none. We have had all of the pain of a recession and none of the potential gain. We have had none of the potential gain for several reasons, which are all directly attributable to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had none of the potential gain because the Government has, firstly, failed to recognise that the number one problem that must be attacked is inflation. Secondly, it has failed to produce an appropriately tight fiscal policy and, indeed, is now presiding over a massive blow-out of the Budget, with the surplus for the year now certain to be much lower than the $2 billion less than was forecast in August. Thirdly, the Government has failed to take appropriate offsetting measures to accompany its progressive easing of monetary policy and is therefore storing up potentially more difficult long term consequences. Fourthly, because its industrial relations decisions are dictated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Government has failed either to encourage or to permit employers and employees to negotiate directly on wages and other conditions of employment without interference by unions, governments or commissions. Indeed, we have a Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) who vehemently denies that such negotiations are in the interests of workers, even if the alternative is for those same workers to lose their jobs as their employers are forced to close their doors. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the Government has failed comprehensively on micro-economic reform, again largely because it is the captive of powerful unions. There has been virtually no progress on waterfront or coastal shipping reform. The Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport third runway has not progressed and the proposal to merge Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd is the antithesis of desirable reform. Sixthly, this Government has failed to address the urgent need for fundamental tax reform and, particularly, the need to abandon our archaic and unfair wholesale sales tax system and replace it with a modern indirect tax system embracing a broadly-based consumption tax which would provide scope for significant personal tax relief and increased saving and investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh reason-as Senator Hill said in his remarks-is that the Government has again comprehensively failed to give industry any certainty on which to base its future planning and investment decisions. On the contrary, the Government gives increasingly confused and confusing signals. The Treasurer says one thing and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) says another, only to be then mercilessly-or perhaps mercifully-publicly humiliated by the Treasurer for his trouble. Ministers Dawkins, Kerin and Howe have all made separate and conflicting statements. The Cabinet cannot come up with any environmental guidelines. Last night we had the damaging farce of Cabinet's inability to make any decision on the timber industry's access to resources. The Industry Minister is obviously having great difficulty in getting an industry policy paper together. Eighthly, by concentrating entirely on bludgeoning the economy into submission in order to suppress demand, the Government has failed to address the only long term path to increased productivity, competitiveness and real incomes-namely, the supply side of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government stands condemned in the eyes of all Australians for these failures. No other government in Australia's history has so betrayed the trust of the electorate; no government has so deliberately engineered-to use its own word-such a brutal and unnecessary recession; no government has so squandered the great opportunities with which it was presented; and no government has deserved more to be thrown out of office for incompetence, and that, inevitably, is what will happen at the next election. The only question is whether our nation can afford to wait that long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was asked to speak in this debate I thought we would be in for some fireworks from the Opposition, judging from the terms of the matter of public importance that was put before us. But I have to say that, waiting for my turn to speak, I nearly went to sleep listening to the contribution from the Opposition. I know it was once said of Geoffrey Howe, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Conservative Party in Great Britain, that being attacked by him was like being savaged by a dead sheep. After hearing the contributions of Opposition senators here today I think we could say that being attacked by the present Opposition is like being savaged by a dead mouse. It has absolutely no impact and no credibility and is of total non-interest. I would have thought that if this were going to be the big fiery debate to end this long parliamentary session in the Senate a few backbenchers and a few other shadow front- benchers would be in the chamber cheering the speakers on. But there are not because most members of the Liberal Party know that this is just a last gasping shot at the Government on the second last day of this long sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard Opposition senators go on at length about the Government's mismanagement of the economy. They have made assertion after assertion but, in the two speeches that I have heard today, they have not given any outline of what they would do to change anything in Australia. That is the fundamental problem with this Opposition; it can nitpick and have a go at the Government in a number of areas-like any government we will make mistakes from time to time; no one denies that-but there is no comprehensive plan coming from the Opposition. It has said that it will probably introduce a consumption tax, but there is no detail about it. It has said that it will reduce tariffs to nothing by the year 2000, but there is no detail about how that target will be reached. At the first chance honourable senators opposite get to be hairy chested about cutting government expenditure, they funk it in the party room, and as a result we have seen in the last few days Opposition senators in this chamber voting against cutbacks in government expenditure in the assets test to the tune of some $55m. They could not even take the decision to cut expenditure by $55m. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard Opposition senators going on about their wonderful privatisation program, yet when the Pipeline Authority Bill came through the Senate yesterday they voted against it. They took a decision not to allow the privatisation of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline to take place. When put to the acid test they have failed. They have failed for seven years. They are now working themselves into a lather because they believe that they have a great opportunity to win the next election because of the present standing of the Government in the opinion polls. I remember them saying the same things during the last term. At times they were well ahead of the Government in the polls, but when it came to the crunch the people would not trust them, because they are not credible. That is the problem that the Opposition has. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look back over the record of government since the Second World War-the Opposition was in government for 30 of the last 40 years-we see that the present Opposition parties have basically been asleep. They did nothing in those long years. All the things that the Opposition is shouting about today and saying the Government has not done could have been done when the Opposition was in government for 30 years. When it had an opportunity to do those things it did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite criticise us for not going fast enough on shipping reform, waterfront reform, telecommunications reform, tax reform, rail changes and so on. But they had 30 years and they did nothing. Despite the current economic difficulties, we are proceeding with major reform in those areas. We have the national rail freight initiative. We are getting the manning rates down in shipping to the levels of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. There have already been 20 to 30 per cent productivity increases on the waterfront. We have seen the biggest change in telecommunications in our history. We are creating a major national carrier that can not only do the job in Australia but also compete worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing that those opposite have not mentioned is the success of the accord in getting a wages outcome over the last seven years that has reduced our inflation rate to substantially less than it was in the Fraser years. The last inflation figure, which was for the September quarter, was 0.7 per cent. As a result, the accord is now being adjusted to lock in that lower inflation rate as a basis for sustained growth in the next couple of years. These are things that those opposite have not been able to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather extraordinary to listen to people such as Senator Schacht and Senator Button. The way they talk one would think that there was nothing wrong with the state of the economy and that somehow all we need to have is more of the same over the next couple of years and we will be right as rain. Senator Schacht, who fancies himself as an expert in interpreting polls, surely does not believe that more of the same will rescue the Government from its current predicament. I would have thought that these polls were enough to terrorise anyone, even the nervous nellies in the Party who do not believe in the whole range of economic measures that Senator Short and Senator Hill have outlined today. For Senator Powell to somehow pretend that there are no differences between the major parties in policy terms is fatuous nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tragedy is that not only could we have a more efficient economy but also we would not have to have the magnitude of human suffering that we are seeing at present. That is probably the saddest part of this whole exercise. The recession that we had to have has now led to the alleged jewel in the Labor crown of 1.6 million jobs having been created since 1983 looking as though it might as well never have happened. We now find that unemployment has reached 700,000 and that unemployment beneficiaries total about 500,000-up 30 per cent for Australia and, in my State of Victoria, up 72 per cent over the last 12 months. People are going out the job doors backwards. Even though the bulk of those jobs were full time, it is not much consolation to those thousands a day who are now finding themselves in the unemployment queues. The problem will be compounded by school leavers in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA> We are clearly looking at the worst recession since the Second World War. This of course makes a cruel joke of all the promises that we would have a soft landing and there was no need to fear recessions-generally the sorts of things that a Prime Minister without principle would say in the run-up to an election. Just as he used to say that interest rates would come down and then revised his promises, so Australians were fooled into thinking that somehow the economy would turn around magically of its own accord. We now find people of the calibre of Bruce Chapman, a recognised authority on employment trends, predicting that long term unemployment is likely to be almost 50 per cent higher by the middle of next year. Apart from what that does to the Budget surplus, we should all be able to appreciate the measure of human tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why we are seeing this desperate U-turn promoted by people such as Messrs Dawkins and Howe. Even Mr Dawkins had to concede that the latest unemployment figures showing 8.2 per cent of the work force out of work were grim. He described it as a very rapid decline in the number of jobs and a very rapid increase in the number of people unemployed-although of course he did not think that Australia was facing a recession of 1982-83 proportions. But, again, he made those predictions with some caution and some trepidation. Of course, that is precisely correct because we will see a recession of at least that magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The social tragedy is that at a time when we need some innovative and imaginative welfare policies and a recognition that we need an active employment strategy, we have a Minister for Social Security presiding over these rocketing figures who has absolutely no interest in the portfolio. I do not need to catalogue the number of areas in which Senator Richardson has poked his nose and which he has no business getting into simply to demonstrate that the last thing on his mind is trying to tackle the social and human problems in Australia. He is interested in the numbers, power, resolving leadership issues and getting his head on the box. But in recent times there is not much about social security that he has been promoting other than trying to sabotage the Expenditure Review Committee. Indeed, at one stage Mr Willis complained that Senator Richardson had tried to oust him from the Ministry. We know that Senator Button has much to fear in that regard as well. Senator Richardson was quite happy to announce that if he had been as disloyal as Senator Button, he would not still be in the Ministry-a clear call for Senator Button's head. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson is happy to be involved in issues such as the Commonwealth Bank, to pontificate about the Party reaction, to promote mickey mouse schemes, to establish special trusts for the proceeds of privatisation and to predict that there will not be any change in the Labor Party's ridiculous three mines uranium policy-not because of the merits of the argument, but because there is not enough support for change in the Party branches. All those sorts of interventions are simply a recognition of the fact that he is not prepared to face up to what is desperately needed, and that is an active employment strategy that will provide some alternative to people remaining on welfare indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research said today that economic growth was unlikely to be sufficient to absorb the increase in the Australian labour force. We know that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has not been very comforting in terms of jobs. That is the Achilles heel of any government, but a government that pretends to believe in social justice and one that claims to be concerned about the workers is in the process of delivering perhaps the greatest tragedy of all. Rather than suggesting that we revel in the plight of the unemployed, as Senator Button's disgraceful canard implied earlier this afternoon, the Government ought to be taking a lead in demonstrating how it will solve some of these social problems. Instead, all Senator Richardson has done is try to back away from a number of Budget commitments and cost the Treasury about $150m in the process. It is a tragically inept and inadequate response to a very serious social problem. I do not think that any Australian expects it to improve while this Government remains in office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really is the second last day of the session, is it not. Quite clearly, the Opposition's heart is not in this matter of public importance. Senator Hill came in here under duress from his party room and stumbled his way through a written speech. Senator Short and Senator Alston really do not believe what they have told us today; their hearts were not in it. They have come in here with the most hypocritical matter of public importance imaginable; they are talking about supposed leadership problems in the Government. This comes from an opposition whose leadership record since 1983 is unparalleled in Australian political history. It has had more leaders, more division, than any other political party at any time in Australian history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We just have to look at the record of the Liberal Party when its members talk about division. They studiously avoided mentioning Mr Howard's name. They studiously avoided mentioning Mr Peacock's name, not to mention the National Party. I do not really want to bring up the issue of Mr Sinclair and the way in which he was removed by Mr Blunt in a palace coup. Opposition senators should remember Mr Blunt-the world's greatest letter writer-when they talk about leadership. I remember Mr Blunt. He was so unpopular and so desperate that he wrote in excess of a quarter of a million letters to Australian electors to gain the National Party a few votes in the last election. It was not very successful. In fact, Mr Blunt was such a failure that he lost his own seat-one of the safest conservative constituencies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we can always mention the Senate leadership. I am not churlish enough to talk about Senator Hill and the way in which he just scraped in as Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate and that group of backbenchers who plot against him every Question Time as he fouls things up for the Opposition. Because it is Christmas, I do not want to talk about the leadership of the National Party in the Senate, either. Again, Senator Boswell has made political history in this country. He is the only leader of a Party in Australian political history not to hold a shadow portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard from the Opposition that this is the most important matter that has faced our community. For the last four weeks we have heard that the Government is allegedly paralysed by leadership problems. It has taken the Opposition four weeks to propose a matter of public importance before the Senate. With just two days to go before the end of this sitting, the Opposition has managed to come in here and to propose a matter of public importance on the leadership of the Government. If this matter were such a crucial issue, I am sure that the Opposition would accept that it would have been canvassed more often. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard yet again Senator Alston's obsession with published opinion polls. I just want to point out to Opposition senators that the Government is well satisfied with the results of the elections in 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990. The Opposition had a different leader in each of those elections. We have trounced every single conservative leader who has been put up and we will trounce Dr Hewson, who as recently as 14 November 1990, according to the Australian Financial Review, was downed in a party room revolt led by some of those people who contributed in this debate. I do not have time to quote from the Australian Financial Review on that issue, but it is clear that Dr Hewson is starting to have the same party room pressures that destroyed Mr Howard, destroyed Mr Peacock, destroyed Mr Blunt and destroyed Mr Sinclair. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tax Expenditures Statement tabled today, which is a document from the Treasury, is to be welcomed. The introduction to the document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Tax Expenditures Statement was first published in 1986 and has been published in every year since then . . . Tax expenditures are those provisions of the Australian taxation law which tax certain classes of taxpayers or particular types of activity differently from the chosen benchmark structure. These provision may take the form of tax exemptions, deductions, deferrals, rebates or special rate relief. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very important document as it is essential that information on tax expenditures be given equal weight to the direct outlays of government because in many respects they have a similar effect. The scrutiny of government spending should require that all forms of spending be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures are not small by any means. In 1989-90, the total costed tax expenditures amounted to $9.4 billion, that is, 11 per cent of direct outlays by government. In the case of the social security and welfare expenditure, the tax expenditures of $5.67 billion are the equivalent of 21.5 per cent of direct outlays for that portfolio of $26.3 billion. In the case of industry assistance and development, the tax expenditures of $3.45 billion are 50 per cent higher than the direct outlays by government of $2.26 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures are very significant. The ones that I have mentioned relate only to the items that are actually costed. Regrettably-and this is a criticism of the document-many tax expenditures are not able to be costed and so they have the words `not available' beside them in the tables. That certainly detracts from the value of the statement. Nevertheless, despite that, it is a very important statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the new method of valuing tax expenditures adopted in this report. Tax expenditures are now costed according to the year in which there is an impact on the revenue rather than in the year in which use of the provision is made. This allows more meaningful comparison with direct outlays and is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased to see that the timeliness of the data provided in the statement has been improved. Whilst last year's statement included data only until 1987-88, this year's publication includes data to 1989-90, although additional caveats apply to the accuracy of costings provided for the most recent year. I do have a criticism of this and previous tax expenditures reports. It relates to the caveats which apply to comparisons of costs of direct outlays and tax expenditures, which are listed in Attachment C to the report. That issue deserves more explicit recognition in this report, particularly because many readers of the report may go to tabulated information and, therefore, be unaware of the caveats which are outlined in the attachment. Whilst the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury are to be congratulated on improving the number and timeliness of the costings since the last report, as I have already intimated, we are a long way from an exhaustive list. For example, none of the fringe benefits tax concessions have been costed. </PARA>
<PARA> In a perfect world, I would go so far as to suggest, the full benefit of the information in the statement will materialise only when it takes its rightful place alongside the information in the Budget Papers. In my book, this information rates in importance next to the Budget documentation, which ordinarily receives so much attention. Such a move would go a long way to breaking the common perception that expenditures through the tax system are somehow intrinsically different from direct outlays and, therefore, do not need to be reviewed in the same way. As I said earlier, that is a point with which I would not agree. In the meantime, I hope that this statement continues to occupy an important place in the valuable information produced by the Treasury. It is a document that warrants much closer attention by the Parliament than we have given it in the past. I hope that we will have the opportunity to do so. </PARA>

With the move towards self assessment, the value of this document is becoming less and less relevant because of the inability of the Australian Taxation Office to get the required answers.

There is a cost to the taxpayer in providing such information, and I question its usefulness against its cost of preparation as far as the taxpayer is concerned. I believe the solution, in order to incorporate the best features of this report, is to have that information incorporated in the Annual Report of the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, I could not let this opportunity go by, particularly with you in the chair, to commend this report. The Australian Institute of Health is an independent statistics and research agency within the Federal Community Service and Health portfolio. It comprises three major research divisions: Health Services, Health Technology and Health Monitoring. I draw attention to page 57 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Cancer remains the second most common cause of death in Australia, accounting for 25 per cent of all deaths in 1988 . . . . There has been a very large increase in cancer death rates in males since the 1940s, mainly due to smoking related cancers . . . . The higher incidence and mortality for males is largely due to their greater use of tobacco. About one-third of cancer deaths can be ascribed to tobacco--</PARA>
<PARA>On page 99 of the same report there is a list of the major risk factors for preventable cancers. At the top, under the heading `Lung cancer', is tobacco smoking. It then states that the aim for the next few years is to set a program of health for all Australians in relation to five lung cancer related goals as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> * To reduce the incidence of death from lung cancer. </PARA>
<PARA> * To prevent the onset of smoking in non-smokers, especially children. </PARA>
<PARA> * To reduce the number of smokers. </PARA>
<PARA> * To reduce the exposure of smokers to tobacco derived carcinogens. </PARA>
<PARA> * To reduce involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke. </PARA>
<PARA>Among other targets are the following:</PARA>
<PARA> To reduce the prevalence of smokers from 33 per cent (1983) to 28 per cent or less by the year 1990 and to 15 per cent or less by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> To reduce the difference in prevalence of smoking between males and females from 23 per cent to 10 per cent or less by the year 1990 and to a negligible figure by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure you will agree with me that these are admirable aims. My reason for standing today in response to this report is to plead with the Government to take notice of it and, perhaps, to act on the aims. I refer, particularly, to where an opportunity has arisen, namely, to ban the incidental advertising of cigarettes on television. The Government did not take action in that regard when it had the opportunity. I think the time has come when this action is urgent. A small step, perhaps, but one that should be taken urgently. If the Government is to take any notice of this report it should take action in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the second report of the activities of the National Science and Technology Centre. This centre has become a major attraction for visitors to Canberra. The way it is run and the organisation behind it have become very much a feature for tourists, particularly younger tourists, many of whom come to Canberra to go there. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to very sincerely pay a tribute to Dr Michael Gore whose enthusiasm and dedication for the job has to be experienced to get full appreciation of it. He has made a great contribution to the starting of an interest in science on the part of younger people at a time when Australia has never needed it as much as it does right now. The fascination and variety of the exhibits are commented on regularly and the 338,000 people who have seen it appreciate it greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> The science circus travelled 21,000 kilometres around Australia during the last year. The only difficulty has been that as a result of the air strike and difficulties with transport the actual number of people who visited the centre last year was down on what was anticipated and revenue was down accordingly by about half a million dollars. The significant contributions that have been made by sponsors have helped the presentation tremendously. I thought that the effort that Dr Gore made last year in inviting the parliamentarians down to have a good look at it and have a meal there was an excellent piece of public relations. It was fascinating to watch the parliamentarians doing all the things that the 10-and 12-year old kids do with the same degree of enthusiasm. I know that many of them have been back since and have encouraged people from their own electorates to do likewise. I congratulate Dr Gore. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently, I had the opportunity of saying a few words on the report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). But there is another matter that I want to raise in regard to that report; that is, a program cut by the ABC of the very popular program, Countrywide. I could find no mention in the report of the axing of such a popular program, only the boast that it covered rural issues, bringing viewers in the cities dramatic accounts of the loss and devastation caused by the May floods. It also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>From its new base in Brisbane, the program emphasised more detailed analysis and reported on a wide range of topics. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that there has to be a program like Countrywide which captures the colour of the bush and the things which happen outside the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The charter under which the Australian Broadcasting Corporation operates calls for the national broadcaster to provide adequate and comprehensive programs. By any standards, that must include television aimed at the generally ignored minority of Australians who live outside the big cities and provincial centres. For the rural audience, ABC television supplies only 30 minutes of programming a week in the form of Countrywide-a catch-all of news, current affairs and magazine stories that might appeal to people with interests outside suburbia. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a memo from the controller of news and country affairs, Countrywide was axed, `because ratings in the city are falling'. This, I believe, was the result of changing the timeslot for the program from 9.30 on Wednesday night to early Sunday, when most farmers would still be in the paddocks. It then moved to 8.00 p.m. on Friday, the traditional time for most country folk to have their night in town. So it is no wonder to me that the ratings were falling. </PARA>
<PARA> The change in format of the program from rural issues to a gentrification of the program so as to appeal to many of the greenies in the cities, would have had another effect on its ratings. Instead of reporting on newsworthy items for farmers and bushies, the report boasts that Countrywide:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . has reported on a range of topics including abuses in drought payment schemes, controversial use of chemicals to clear land and the death of 5,000 cattle from botulism in Queensland feedlots. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not to say that there have not also been some issues that it has dealt with intelligently in the year, such as the serious issues of wool marketing, soil degradation and salinity and the importing of questionable pig meat. </PARA>
<PARA> If there are complaints about the program, a better solution is to restore it to a more sensible timeslot and more tightly focus its rural brief. The Corporation's preferred solution-to increase the rural content of programs such as the 7.30 Report-might only succeed in producing segments aimed at the ABC's environmentally conscious city based audience rather than real producers. </PARA>
<PARA> When I saw Doug Murray say goodbye to everybody on his last night on the Countrywide show, I felt very sorry about it. But I would like to congratulate the ABC on its annual report. In doing so, I remind it that it should examine honestly whether it is really achieving one of its stated goals, which is to be an effective and distinctive alternative to other broadcasters through a wide range of high quality and innovative services to rural and remote Australia-I emphasise that-to the cities and to specialist and minority audiences, and not just chasing a ratings war with the other commercial channels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to talk on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) annual report 1989-90, there are a number of matters that I would like to raise in terms of the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which have been raised with me by constituents in Western Australia. Senator Bjelke-Petersen, I believe, raised a very important point when she made reference to the charter of the ABC and the fact that it is not a ratings operation. In fact, it is quite different and its responsibility is quite different from commercial radio. Part of its charter is to ensure that people who live in remote areas or people who live in relatively small inner communities have access to information and data that would not be otherwise available to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three matters have been brought to my attention which I want to raise in the time available to me. The first one concerns the operations of Country Hour and regional radio in Western Australia and also some television broadcasting; that is, the networking of programs out of Sydney, in particular, and Melbourne to a lesser extent. One must make the point that while these programs may be of a lot of interest to people in Sydney, to people in other parts of Australia they do not have as much attraction. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular point I raise is the situation, for example, of the tomato growers at Geraldton who have been accustomed for a number of years-ever since Country Hour has been operating-to getting market reports through Country Hour. That service has now been discontinued and this has put them in a difficult position in terms of having knowledge of what is occurring in the marketplace in Perth. That is one of the functions that consistently has been part of the operations of the Country Hour. </PARA>
<PARA> The other two points I raise also relate to people in remote areas, and not so remote areas, who are being disadvantaged. For example, in the Christmas holiday period the broadcasting of the trotting to country areas has been stopped. It is very easy if one happens to live in metropolitan Perth or any of the metropolitan cities to hop in one's motor car and drive down to the trots. But if people are 200, 300, 400 or 500 miles away and trotting happens to be their interest, they cannot get there. Likewise, a complaint that continually comes up is the discontinuation of the broadcasting of the cricket into country areas. Once again, this is the only opportunity that people have to participate in this recreation unlike people who live in metropolitan areas. The total expenditure of the ABC is $510,343m. In the structuring of its programs sufficient funds should be made available to cater for that part of its charter and for people who live in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> One must also emphasise that in metropolitan areas there are groups of people who have particular interests, groups that are very small in number and cannot have an impact on the ratings as far as the type of broadcasting is concerned. If there is to be this sort of contribution from the public purse, I think it is beholden on the ABC to meet that part of its charter. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to deal briefly with the report of Landcare Australia Ltd. Earlier today I commented that the time has come to rationalise the role of the Landcare program and the national soil conservation program because essentially these do one and the same thing and the money is transferred between them. But I do not want to dwell on that now. Rather, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to developments that have occurred in Western Australia in recent years in respect of the Landcare program, or mainly through the national soil conservation program, which is also covered in this report. As they duplicate one another, I will make note of the matter here. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 200 Landcare groups or soil conservation district committees, some 120 have been established in Western Australia. I wish particularly to refer once again to the Government's decision in regard to taxation deductions and the necessity for a mechanism to be put in place relating to approval of farm plans. Despite the $23.4m which was originally put into the program, most of which was transferred to the soil conservation program, in Western Australia insufficient funds were available to have a Landcare coordinator. Given the stage we have reached with the number of Landcare conservation districts-or soil conservation districts as they are known in Western Australia-and the fact that there are now 50 catchment areas operating on most of the major rivers and in salinity problem areas, it is important that this aspect be dealt with. I certainly acknowledge and am very pleased about the work done in this area. </PARA>

<PARA> The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1990 will amend both the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 and the sales tax regulations. While the coalition supports this Bill, it contains a number of anomalies and shortcomings which I wish to draw to the Government's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been introduced to give effect to the announcement made by the Government in its August Budget to provide relief from sales tax on computers used by manufacturers and persons who process goods on behalf of manufacturers. The comment from industry in response to this announcement was, `About time'. In legislating to exempt computers from sales tax in the manufacturing industry, the Government is finally recognising the technological advances which have been made over the years and which have led to the computerisation of a number of functions not previously considered within the realms of computer technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The move towards the use of computer technology in many manufacturing processes has been tax-exempt because the functions the computers perform have fallen within the `aids to manufacturing' provisions of sales tax law. Under these provisions computer hardware qualifies as an aid to manufacture when it is used directly in the physical manufacturing process. There is also a number of supporting income tax rulings in the area of aids to manufacturing. The sales tax exemptions announced in this year's Budget will apply where 50 per cent or more of the individual items of computer equipment are used, firstly, in the engineering or technical design of goods for manufacture and of machines, tooling and production processes needed to make goods for manufacture performed using CAD, CAM and CAE equipment. Non-manufacturing activities specifically excluded under the Bill are audio-visual production, architectural-structural design, certain computer software and the work of certain authors and secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The second criterion covers production related computers, which includes scheduling, sequencing, monitoring, controlling and costing of the processes of manufacture. It will also extend to the ordering, handling and controlling of new materials to be used in the manufacture of goods, such as just-in-time material control systems. Broad exclusions under this category include marketing, sales, management and accounting activities. That is in accordance with normal precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area is that of print related computer equipment. This will cover equipment used for the finalisation of text or artwork for printing, including, for example, the final layout of text by a typesetter, the production of forms by a commercial printer, the recording of newspaper advertisements, the subediting of newspaper articles and the production of technical manuals and other manufacturing documentation. It is in this area that I believe the great problems arise under this legislation, particularly for the newspaper industry. I thought this legislation was essentially designed to assist the newspaper industry. Under this category, exemption will not be available for an author such as a general journalist who finalises the format or typesetting of his or her original works. The exemption will also not be available for the activities of an office secretary. The latter is not surprising. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also made in the Bill to exempt sales tax on computer equipment in cases where a combination of the three new eligible exemption areas, which I have listed earlier, are employed such that the total use on all of the exempt activities is 50 per cent or more. I concur with that sort of approach. In addition, the exemption will cover combinations of previously exempt criteria and new exempt uses. So for manufacturers who use a computer for 20 per cent of the time as an aid to manufacturing activity and 40 per cent for technical design work, the exemption will apply because the total exempt usage of the computer exceeds 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are broadly four groups of people who will be eligible for these exemptions: manufacturers registered under sales tax law; unregistered manufacturers other than those who operate in a small way, where their average turnover is less than $50,000 per annum; persons carrying out processes or treatment to goods on behalf of manufacturers, whether or not they are registered; and subcontractors engaged by manufacturers to carry out the exempt activities on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> A registered manufacturer will be able to purchase eligible computer equipment free of sales tax by quoting a sales tax certificate to the supplier-a normal procedure-and sales tax regulations will be aimed to require quotation of a certificate in these circumstances. An unregistered person who is entitled to exemption will be able to claim exemption by providing to the supplier a written certification claiming exemption. This is the same procedure that presently applies to persons who are entitled to an exemption from sales tax but who are not registered. No amendments to the law are required, naturally, for this procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> These new exemptions will apply from 19 October 1990. I have a problem with this date, except for paragraph 7 (a) which refers to regulation 12 and which will commence on the day that the Act receives royal assent. To qualify for sales tax exemption, each individual piece of computer equipment will need to satisfy the definition of eligible computer equipment. The definition, while not exhaustive, primarily includes hardware and excludes accessories such as computer furniture and consumable items. So the exclusion also extends to telecommunication equipment such as satellite dishes and private automatic branch exchange systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's estimate of the cost of providing exemption for this computer equipment is $44m in 1990-91 and $70m in 1991-92. In his second reading speech on the Bill, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) made the comment that the Bill will assist Australian manufacturers to become more competitive in the international environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hate to shatter any illusions of those on the front bench, the Minister or the Government he represents, by suggesting that any manufacturer who has been waiting for a government to change its sales tax laws before updating its equipment to the latest computer technology will have already missed the international market competitive boat. I think this is a reflection on the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce as well as tax and other areas. I think it is most important that our laws, particularly our taxation laws, keep up with advances in technology to ensure that the manufacturing sector of the community remains internationally competitive. It cannot do this unless our laws keep abreast and provide the right sorts of deductions in terms of changing technology. So rather than being a piece of legislation which provides the impetus for manufacturers to move into the latest technology, it is what I would term catch-up legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office has been dealing with an increasing number of cases where manufacturers have not paid sales tax on computer equipment purchases. Manufacturers have not paid the tax, believing that the equipment was purchased to be an aid to manufacture and thus was exempt. Regrettably, we have a difficulty with the Taxation Office because it is now arguing that sales tax is owed. This is very much a backward-looking piece of legislation. It shows neither foresight nor vision about where the manufacturing industry may be heading. It also lacks any understanding of the impact of modern technology through computerisation on job structures. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of illustration on this point, I refer to the case of the computers used in manufacturing printed matter, particularly newspapers and magazines. The Australian Taxation Office has on its books at least 12 cases of newspapers that have not paid sales tax on updated computer equipment. The bone of contention has been computer equipment used by general journalists. The problem is the lack of proper definition of and extension to `general journalists'. Approximately 15 to 20 years ago, for most newspapers, the process of producing general journalist input into the final newspaper went something like this: the general journalist or a local reporter would come into the office and bash out the story on a typewriter. He would not include a heading, an introductory paragraph or any font information. When the story was passed to the subeditor, this information would subsequently be added. Having been edited by the subeditor, this piece of paper with all the necessary markings would then go on to the production department. In this department the story would have to pass through three different machines-one for the heading, one for the introductory paragraph and, finally, one for the body of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> This typesetting has gone through a number of different technological developments but typically it was done on a linotype or tape perforator machine. The next stage was for the original copy and the proof from the typesetting process to be compared by proofreaders. Any difference, where marked, was taken back for correction. Once corrected, printing could commence. Under this system, the aids to manufacture sales tax exemption applied from the production department step in the process onwards. This is the point that I wish to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Using this technology it is evident that the keystrokes which were used for printing the final product were formed at the production stage where rekeying of the general journalist's story occurred. I think that fellow senators will agree that this process was riddled with inefficiencies, particularly the duplication of keying in the story first by the journalists, then by the subeditor, and finally by the production department. </PARA>
<PARA> Typically, I believe that the way technology now enables the system to work is as follows-and the reporters upstairs might like to correct me-the reporter enters his story, including the heading, introductory paragraph and fonts into the computer system. The subeditor is then able to call up the story on his screen and do any editing which may be required. Using the latest technology it is possible for a general journalist to view, on his computer monitor, the page on which the story is to appear and to type the story straight into the space specified for it. Once the article is typed in, the general journalist is able to give the necessary commands, from the computer terminal, to have the story or the whole page printed out on bromide paper ready for the printing plate to be made. There is no need for the story to pass through a subeditor before it becomes the final product. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect about a newspaper industry's technology is that all functions to produce a newspaper can be done on the same computer terminal. This is the difference nowadays with modern technology. Individual computer terminals and keyboards are not job-specific. I think that this is the problem with the legislation: the terminals and keyboards are not job-specific but the legislation tries to relate them to particular types of personnel. Telephone advertisements, Australian Associated Press information, sports results and subediting can all be done on any one of the machines installed as part of the total system. </PARA>
<PARA> So with the changing technology, brought about to remove inefficiencies and keep the industry commercially viable, there came a change in job specification. Virtually the whole production department became redundant. A reskilling of the work force was required along with a reassignment of roles which were negotiated with the unions and the Australian Journalists Association. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which is before us today, the clauses dealing with the exemption of computers used in the finalising of text or artwork to be printed are as follows: the equipment which is to be used mainly by a subeditor will qualify for exemption-I have no problem with that; equipment which is to be used by a person who is designated as a journalist but who performs predominantly an editing role on the third party source material will also qualify; and equipment which is used to set, display or classify will also qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition inserted in subclause 1(1) of the first schedule to the principal Act by paragraph 4 (b) of the Bill excludes equipment which is going to be used by a general journalist from the sales tax exemption. I am concerned at the non-exclusion of computer equipment used by general journalists employed by newspapers and magazine manufacturers. My reasons are as follows: firstly, the definition of the term `general journalist' focuses on the designation of the individual rather than on the type of work performed. Without the input of the general journalist, the final product is not the same. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, I now indicate the way the Australian which was produced on 18 October would appear. I must say that page one of the Australian on that date was not particularly interesting. The front page would be very boring without the input of the general journalist, but at least we would have the photograph of Archbishop Hollingworth to look at. To reiterate the point that I made earlier concerning the technology and induced job structure changes in the case of general journalists, they now perform the majority of the functions previously performed by the typesetter for the articles which appear in the end product. </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacturing process which results in the newspaper as the end product begins with the general journalist sitting down at the keyboard to key in his or her story. Technology has changed, job descriptions have changed, and the Government's thinking on this point needs to change so that it reflects the practice of today and not the practice of 20 years ago. I think that this paper illustrates my point. </PARA>
<PARA> Another flaw in the Government's thinking on this Bill which I mentioned earlier but will reiterate because it illustrates my point is the implication that equipment used by general journalists is somehow different from that which other contributors to the newspaper's manufacture use. This is certainly not the case. Computer equipment is not job specific; that is the problem. The only reason terminals are assigned either to advertising classifications or to the journalist section and so on is for job flow efficiency and for supervisory reasons. Small newspapers, which typically provide a valuable community service, could well be discriminated against by this Bill; and that is one of my major objections. In the small newspaper area, for example, the general journalist is more than likely also to be the subeditor. Thus, there is uncertainty as to whether this equipment would be sales tax exempt under this Bill or not. I believe that some clarification is required on the role performed by the general journalist vis-a-vis subeditors, in particular where the roles are merged, if the coalition's point of view is not accepted. Certainly there is need for an income tax ruling. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss of sales tax income as a result of extending this exemption to also include terminals used by general journalists is estimated by the industry to be no more than $2m. Given the number of other budgetary changes which the Government has made since August, particularly in social security and other areas, it is not a large figure, but the Government has to focus on improving industry efficiencies. This is one area on which it could well focus some attention. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of definitions, the definition of `finalisation' appears far too restrictive and requires relatively detailed knowledge of what constitutes editing and subediting in the context of a newspaper or magazine. This definition should at least be cross-referenced with the definition of `general journalist' and the reference to `subeditor' for purposes of clarification. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which the Government needs to tidy up is that which covers equipment used by a journalist mainly in an editing role on externally sourced material. While under the explanatory memorandum's definition of `general journalist' it is stated that `the term will not include a journalist who performs predominantly an editing role on third party sourced material such as international news which comes into a publishing house via a wire service', this is not stated in the Bill as such. </PARA>
<PARA> While tidying up the legislation for the Government, I should also like to mention the reference to `manufacturer' in paragraph (4) (a) of the schedule which, if it is intended to include a deemed manufacturer of printed matter, needs clarification. This needs to be stated, and is another deficiency in the legislation. The definition of `architectural/structural design computer equipment' might also need to be reworded if it is not to operate, in conjunction with paragraph (2) (f), to exclude the designs of major items of plant which become structures. Last year, at roughly the same stage in the Senate sitting program, the Senate had before it a sales tax Bill, over which the Government had some difficulty in telling the difference between a microchip and other forms of firmware. Once this problem was brought to its attention, the Government, to its credit, did make the necessary alterations to sort it out. I am hoping that the same will apply again today. </PARA>
<PARA> The exclusion for software generation computer equipment and specifically paragraph (b), which reads, `the goods are not mainly for use in connection with the embodying of the program concerned in a microchip', should be reconsidered for the following reasons. First, often it would not be known at the time software is developed whether it would be embodied in a microchip. Secondly, the software design might be embodied in something other than a microchip but still be firmware. Thirdly, the use of the phrase `for use in connection with' might not necessarily create the linkage which is sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue is whether computer equipment used to produce designs and plans, where the design process involves a degree of programming, is excluded from the design engineering computer equipment exemption because it could fall within subparagraph (a) of the definition of `software generation computer equipment' and is not excluded by subparagraphs (b) and (c) of that definition. Computer equipment used to produce designs and plans could well fall within the design engineering computer equipment exemption, notwithstanding that the design process involves a degree of programming. It would therefore be desirable if the Minister were to clarify that such computer equipment does in fact constitute `eligible computer equipment' for the purposes of proposed clause (2) (1) of the first schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> On the topic of manufacturing equipment, there is no specific reference to specification testing, scientific research and maintenance equipment. I believe a specific reference is necessary, particularly in the case of scientific research and maintenance equipment. Many large scale manufacturers use computer systems extensively to control and schedule plant maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also a couple of vagaries with regard to items of computer equipment. First, there is no reference to typesetting equipment or to pagefax equipment. Secondly, paragraph (m) of the definition excludes a device that forms part of the infrastructure of a telecommunications network. However, it would appear, in theory at least, that where the telecommunication network is installed solely to facilitate manufacturing activities this definition might operate to exclude equipment which is intended to be covered-for example, analogue-to-digital converters, modems and cables which might all form part of a specific telecommunications infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> Creativity also receives a rap across the knuckles from the Government in this legislation. I have already mentioned the case of computer equipment used by general journalists not being exempt. This non-exemption also stretches to authors and specifically mentions original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work. There is no incentive to encourage creativity at all in this Bill, and this is a further indictment. If the Government wins the day on this Bill-and surely it will because of the guillotine process-then the only incentive it has given the newspaper and magazine industry is to use imported material or second-hand articles. The reporter covering local events and issues is being given the thumbs down treatment and is discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I have not heard from any groups representing the authors of literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work in this country, if I were one of them I would not be pleased with this Bill. The main problem that I see for authors in this Bill comes under the definition of `eligible print finalisation activities', where the computer equipment used to create text or images that embody an eligible original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is sales tax exempt where the finalisation is not carried out by the author, or any of the authors, of the work. Again, they are discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Senate will appreciate that more often than not the author is the person best placed to do the finalisation of his or her piece of literature or music, particularly on the modern day technological scene. No-one else can know what they are wanting to portray by the words and notes they have used. Thus, the Government has made a very definite move by including this paragraph in the definition to exclude the `creative' sector of our society, including authors and the other people I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I wish to draw to the Senate's attention the Minister's comments in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government intends to examine further options to relieve the impact of sales tax on business inputs in the sales tax simplification review announced by the Treasurer in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Why did he not do that job in this Bill for this particular purpose if he had that in mind? We in this place have heard the Government regularly mention the phrases `tax simplification' and `micro-economic reform'. Along with the rest of the nation, we look forward to some action. We have been promised some action, but we need such action now on this front. This Bill, given the state in which the country now finds itself, only adds further to the sales tax confusion. It is additional proof of the need to convert to a goods and services tax, as proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1990, as well as the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. I shall address my remarks first to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and then proceed to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill. My colleague Senator Coulter will later offer some remarks on amendments that he is moving to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main purpose of the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to amend the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 to allow the extension of the scheme from 6 July 1990 to 31 December 1995. The Bill provides for the rate of bounty to be phased down from 20 per cent to 9 per cent of factory costs. The Australian Democrats, after due consideration, do not oppose the phasing down of this bounty. We have had extensive consultation with industry bodies in this particular industry and we believe that the phasing down is being carried out at that level with the full agreement and support of the industry. So, it is for that reason that we are pleased to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that the phasing down will act to restore the relationship between the effective rates of assistance for the information technology sector and will align it with the rest of the manufacturing sector. It is interesting to examine and compare the performance of Australian indigenous companies and foreign companies that receive the bounty in the industry technology sector. Australia is the only market in the world where most of the United States, European, Japanese, Asian and indigenous companies operate. These companies use Australia as a testing ground, in many cases, for new products and new strategies. The top three ranking companies in terms of sales revenue are: IBM Australia Ltd, Telecom Australia and Alcatel STC Australia. The top three Australian-owned companies last year were: Telecom Australia, Computer Power Group Ltd and Imagineering Technology Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 11 of the top 20 bounty recipients, and three of the top five bounty recipients are Australian indigenous companies. Of course, this means that nearly half of the recipients are non-Australian; a bleak and typical snapshot of Australian high-tech industry. Most disturbing is the fact that export performance is highest in non-Australian companies. Fewer than half of the top 50 Australian information technology companies export technology. However, the sector has a number of strong export performers resulting in an export propensity-that is, exports as a percentage of total sales-of between 39 and 51 per cent. The strongest performers are foreign transnationals who use Australia as a centre for sourcing the regional inputs for particular products. Nevertheless, if we look at Australian exporters alone, they have an export propensity of 40 per cent and are performing reasonably well. Let us hope that this trend can be improved over time. In this context, I draw the attention of the Senate to claims made by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), in the other place, that these transnationals often rig transfer pricing mechanisms in order to qualify for bounty assistance. I express concern at these remarks and would ask the Minister to comment on this allegation and certainly to investigate them as quickly and as effectively as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the nationality of the recipients of the bounty, it is accepted that the bounty has assisted in increasing exports. This is confirmed in the recent Bureau of Industry Economics Program Evaluation report No. 8-the Computer Bounty Scheme. Let us hope the reduction in the bounty does not have an unfavourable effect on our export performance. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), in his speech, emphasised the continuation of the bounty to encourage research and development. The Australian Democrats certainly support this objective and agree that targeted government assistance is crucial in this area. The Bureau of Industry Economics report states that the sector is a strong research and development performer with an average research and development intensity-in other words, the ratio of research and development expenditure to turnover-of 9 per cent, well and truly above the manufacturing average of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister states that the bounty has been instrumental in the development of a number of industry sectors, in particular growth of 25 per cent in the sector in this industry which produces bountiable equipment. However, the Bureau of Industry Economics in its report on the computer bounty scheme states:</PARA>
<PARA>This suggests that the bounty has been influential in encouraging industry growth. The significance of this growth is more difficult to ascertain. </PARA>
<PARA>It is, in fact, difficult to determine the actual contribution of the bounty to the growth of the information industry for a number of reasons-firstly, the prevailing economic circumstances, notably the movements in the Australian dollar resulting in increased export market activity in 1985-86 and a decrease in 1988-89. Furthermore, the firms that receive the bounty may also be recipients of other government assistance as part of the Government's information industry strategy such as the export market development grants scheme, the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development and the partnerships for development scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing my remarks on this Bill, I want to make it clear that the Australian Democrats believe in government intervention in the marketplace and, in particular, in overseas trade. This involves consumer protection but it also involves assistance to industry where such assistance leads to improved outcomes. In supporting this Bill, we are in no way embracing the free market deregulation mania to which the old parties are increasingly drawn. Experience in other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations shows that proper government policies yield economic and societal benefits. In this context, I eagerly await Senator Button's forthcoming industry policy statement. Certainly, it is clear that our export industries deserve a concerted and well thought through program of government assistance and encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1990. The Bill implements a Budget commitment of the Government to exempt from sales tax computers used by manufacturers and people who process goods on behalf of manufacturers where they are acquired from 19 October 1990 onwards. There are four basic situations where exemption will be granted. Firstly, computers used by manufacturers to design goods for manufacture; secondly, computers used by manufacturers to schedule, monitor and control the production of goods; thirdly, computers used in the finalisation of text or graphics in the printing industry, including those used by typesetters and subeditors in producing newspapers; and fourthly, computers used in a combination of the previously mentioned functions. The exemptions also apply to subcontractors who carry out the relevant functions on behalf of manufacturers. The estimated cost of these measures is $44m this year and $70m next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support this legislation. However, we do not understand the rather arbitrary treatment which is being imposed upon the newspaper industry under the Bill, so I join Senator Watson in his criticisms of the Government in this area. I understand that negotiations have been conducted between some members of the industry and the Government concerning the problems in the legislation, and I hope this will be resolved in a satisfactory manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals appear particularly disadvantageous for smaller newspapers such as country or regional publications and do not appear to have any rationale. Whether or not a particular story ends up in a particular newspaper is irrelevant. The fact that the story was prepared for inclusion in a newspaper is surely enough to qualify as part of the manufacturing process of the newspaper. The subediting and editing functions are akin to a quality control process, yet the stories which are discarded are still part of the production process and the equipment used predominantly by journalists to produce these stories should also qualify for sales tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly believe that the Government should immediately look at this particular situation and the series of anomalies which affect the production of newspapers. I urge the Government, as Senator Watson has, to take urgent action in this particular area. The Australian Democrats will certainly be pressing the Minister to introduce satisfactory amendments early in the new year. Although aids to manufacture and auxiliaries to aids are exempt from sales tax, one of the major problems of the wholesale tax is that it does tax some business inputs. This Bill eliminates some of these extra costs but only in the areas which have been specifically mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the Budget announcement of the complete review of the wholesale sales tax. Hopefully, the review will lead to the total elimination of the liability to sales tax on business inputs. This, in turn, will assist the competitiveness of Australian industry. However, the current situation is not a major impediment to our exporters in the terms that the Opposition claims. The total effect is less than 2 per cent of our exports and this should be noted. </PARA>
<PARA>Another furphy being run by the Opposition to justify its proposed broad-based consumption tax is that exported goods are taxed under the wholesale sales tax. Except in the very limited case of business inputs, goods for export are exempt from wholesale sales tax and always have been. The zero rating of exports under the Opposition's consumption tax proposal can be achieved by exempting all business inputs from sales tax in the first place. We look forward to the Government taking this action as a result of its forthcoming review. In fact, we much prefer this method of assisting our exporters, thus eliminating the need to tax every good and service. </PARA>
<PARA> Some examples of what the Opposition proposes to tax under its broad-based consumption tax are foods for human consumption; agricultural machinery, implements, equipment and materials-it wants to do so at a time when our rural industries are going to the wall; spectacles and eye glasses; and wallpaper paints, putties and wood filler. Talking about taxing the dead, the Opposition also proposes to tax coffins, cremation caskets, urns as well as wreath and floral tributes. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does the Opposition propose to take from the dead, it also proposes to take from the young. Prams, strollers and pushers, which are at present exempt, would be taxed at 15 per cent under the Opposition's proposals. So too would sanitary napkins, pads and towels and wedding rings. People concerned about the environment will be unhappy to learn that goods for collecting solar rays will also be taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Coulter and I will be moving some amendments. My amendments seek to remove recycled plastic products from the imposition of sales tax. Products that are totally or in part made of recycled plastic would be affected. </PARA>

I would have hoped that, as sufficient notice has been given, these amendments would have received the support of the Opposition.

But at least there is some rationale in what it is doing, even though I regret the delay which will result in suffering by handicapped people and further environmental damage.

Since the Opposition last neglected to support these amendments, I have received literally hundreds of letters asking why on earth we have not been able to get the amendments through the Senate. My answer was that the Opposition felt that it should not help disabled people; that it should not exempt from sales tax products that advance environmental protection and conservation. Once again, I will have to tell people that the Opposition has adopted a similar position. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.26)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1990 and the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. I propose to direct my remarks to the bounty legislation. Debate on this Bill has been curtailed because of the guillotine motion moved by the Government and supported by the Australian Democrats. Nonetheless, I will endeavour in the time available to make the points that need to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worthwhile exploring the question of why this Bill is part of the guillotine program. The Bill ought to have been introduced in the last session before the winter recess. The Government simply forgot that the bounty scheme ran out on 5 July 1990 and, therefore, properly ought to have been replaced in the last session. Despite the retrospective nature of this Bill-and this Government is becoming progressively adept at introducing retrospective legislation-there are still serious legal questions that arise as to the legality of the bounty payments which have been made subsequent to the expiry of the old scheme and the introduction of this one. </PARA>
<PARA> We said very strongly in the debate that ensued after the Government moved the guillotine motion-and I spoke in this debate-that the result of having to deal with 52 Bills in such a short time as a week and a bit would be poor legislation. We have seen plenty of examples of poor legislation coming before this chamber. One of this morning's newspapers carried a story that the Australian Securities Commission had discovered a serious flaw in the new corporation legislation which was guillotined through the Parliament. The Government had failed to include the legal requirement for managers and trustees to comply with the covenants of trust deeds, which was the law under the old scheme. This was simply left out of the current legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, my colleague Senator Watson, in dealing with the sales tax Bill now before us, gave examples of how the legislation is both poorly drafted and fails to take into account the way in which technology has advanced. Having seen the way in which the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITC) has failed in its duty to introduce bounty legislation within an adequate time, it is not surprising that this morning we saw that the recently appointed head of the Department, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, is resigning after being in the job for only six months. </PARA>
<PARA> This follows the report last week that the Managing Director of Austrade, Mr Lindsay MacAlister, has resigned. What other resignations are in the pipeline for DITAC? Dare I suggest that it might be the Minister himself? This Department has failed to deliver any coherent, sensible or, indeed, successful industry policy. People are bailing out of it like rats from a sinking ship. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Bill itself. The Bill extends the computer bounty scheme until 30 December 1995 and, furthermore, makes some amendments to the textile yarns legislation-another piece of legislation that was introduced hurriedly at the end of last year. In our debate on that Bill we outlined problems that we foresaw occurring and, indeed, they have now been seen by the Government to occur, so in this Bill the opportunity is taken to amend part of that legislation as well. Basically, we support the extension of the computer bounty scheme, firstly, because it provides for predictability and certainty within the computer sector; secondly, because it reduces the overall rate of assistance; and, thirdly, because we acknowledge that bounties are less distortional than tariffs or quotas. However, our support for the Bill should not be seen as an endorsement of the strategic trade approach of the Australian Manufacturing Council, because we simply do not uphold that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing this legislation, it is important to look at the review that the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) conducted in July last year when it was requested to undertake an evaluation of the bounty scheme. The Bureau invited written submissions from bounty recipients and conducted a postal survey to which 72 recipients of the bounty responded. Of the respondents to the survey, 24 per cent indicated that they were not satisfied with the administration of the bounty scheme by the Australian Customs Service-which is quite interesting in light of the other criticisms that have been levelled against the Australian Customs Service. This is one more aspect that obviously needs attention. The dissatisfaction interacts with various anomalies which are noted within the scheme. These anomalies arise because goods which are similar in character to bountiable items are assisted by tariffs rather than by bounties and disputes have arisen within the Customs Service as to which items are eligible for a bounty and which are not. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, on the import side, components of some items which might be covered by the bounty and therefore enter duty free have had tariff duties imposed. This is particularly the case with communications-related equipment where products intended to be covered by the bounty are closely related in function and manufacturing technology to tariff-protected goods. Further findings of that survey show that the number of claimants increased from 11 in 1984-85 to 179 in 1988-89, that payments under the scheme similarly rose from $1m to $35m and that the average bounty paid last year was $174,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that the bounty played a relatively minor role in the performance of the sector overall. The report acknowledged that changes in the value of the Australian dollar, rather than the scheme itself, had a marked influence on the performance of the industry. To back up that point, 26 per cent of survey respondents stated that their level of production would not be affected at all if the bounty scheme was removed altogether, and 44 per cent of respondents stated that their level of export activity would not be affected if the scheme was removed altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> The review was also particularly useful in that it criticised the strategic trade theory which is currently gaining some headway with some members of the Government and some people within the bureaucracy. Of course, it must always be identified as just another version of the argument for targeting assistance and it suffers the same pitfalls as does the practice of picking winners generally. As I said earlier, we in the Liberal and National parties prefer the use of bounties rather than tariffs and quotas because we see two benefits which are quite important. The first is that the value added bounty is a way of supporting domestic producers while enabling consumers to obtain products at world prices, and the second is that bounties provide a more visible form of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The BIE found that the assistance afforded through the computer bounty is closely in line with that for the rest of manufacturing, with the exception of the passenger motor vehicle and, of course, the textile, clothing and footwear industries. What the report did not do-and it would have been useful if it had-was assess how many firms had fallen by the wayside in spite of receiving bounties, because respondents to the survey about the scheme were those who were in receipt of the bounty and who were now exercising a 150 per cent research and development tax concession or partnership in development programs to augment the computer bounty. Further, the Bureau did not identify what proportion of the expansion of the industry over the life of the bounty was attributable to the bounty itself and not to other forms of Government assistance and the increased demand for products or the fluctuations, particularly of the exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of other points are also important. These relate to the differences between what the Bill does and what the BIE report in fact found and would have recommended. There is a discrepancy between the financial impact statement of the Bill and the forecast level of bounty predicted by the BIE. On the one hand, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill estimates that the cost of extending the computer scheme will be as follows: in 1990-91, $37.6m; in the following year, 1991-92, $38m; in 1992-93, $36m; in 1993-94, $34m; in 1994-95, $32m; and, in 1995-96, $25m. On the other hand, the BIE predicted that until 1992-93, with the same rates as were adopted by the Government, bounty payments would level off from July 1990 at about $33m per year. It will be interesting to see which prediction is in fact accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has an alternative for industry. The coalition offers certainty by informing industry now of our goal to reduce industry protection to negligible levels by the year 2000. We offer complementary measures of structural reform, such as an industrial relations system featuring voluntary enterprise-based agreements and guaranteed voluntary unionism; the injection of competition into telecommunications; waterfront reform which will take away cabotage from Australian waters; and, most importantly, reform of the unsatisfactory regime of taxation, including wholesale sales taxes and the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, in supporting this piece of legislation the Opposition in no way wishes to signal that it supports the strategic trade theory, which is only another way of expressing the picking of winners. As I also said, this legislation is another example of the fact that the Government is incapable of managing its own business. Its Department failed to introduce the legislation prior to the expiry of the previous scheme and thus we are again indulging in retrospectivity, with a question mark hanging over payments made between the expiry of the last scheme and the introduction of this scheme. This Bill is serving a dual purpose in fixing up problems that have resulted from the textile yarns legislation introduced in the last session-problems which were foreshadowed by the Opposition, both in the House of Representatives and by myself in the Senate. The Bill is part of the overall guillotine program which has seen other pieces of legislation forced through without adequate debate and with subsequent errors showing up in that legislation. It is a sad way to go into Christmas- to see a Government racing through 52 pieces of legislation simply because it is not able to manage its own program and handle its own departments in a competent way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We differ very much from the Opposition in what Senator Bishop has just enunciated. It is very appropriate that the setting of appropriate tax rates, the payment of bounties and various other monetary measures should be used to move the society quite deliberately in the direction in which we wish it to move. Moreover, we believe that the Government should be taking a much more far-sighted view of where it wishes society to go and using those tax measures quite deliberately to encourage certain industries, to discourage other industries, to encourage certain practices, to discourage other practices and, quite deliberately, to move society in the direction in which it quite clearly needs to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is in that context that I wish to speak to the amendments tabled in my name and which will be moved by my colleague Senator Spindler as a block. These are amendments to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). In each case they relate to industries which very much need to be encouraged because of the direction in which we are now moving. I refer specifically to the increase in concentration of greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere and the consequences which will flow from those, one of which will be that in the very near future we will need to use industries which are much less polluting. </PARA>
<PARA> On previous occasions I have put before the Senate the figures which indicate that, as a country, Australia is very profligate in its use of fossil fuels. It uses roughly 4.5 tonnes per person per year of carbon-based fuels. According to the scientific report of the IPCC-the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-which, interestingly, Senator Michael Baume quoted yesterday in his rather disparaging remarks about greenhouse, we need to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions down to 0.35 tonnes per person per year as rapidly as possible; in other words, Australia needs to achieve about a 92 per cent reduction in per capita release of carbon-based gases, principally carbon dioxide. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has removed the sales tax from photovoltaic cells and the array of equipment that goes with them. I do not know whether it is as a consequence of that, but it does so happen that per head Australia produces more photovoltaic cells than any other country. As I think other honourable senators would know, we are the world's leading manufacturer of photovoltaic cells in terms of the efficiency achieved. Professor Martin Green of the University of New South Wales has achieved 24 per cent efficiency, which is the highest efficiency ever achieved. Professor Green's production line has been bought by BP Solar and has been put into production. </PARA>
<PARA> In the amendments which I am putting we are seeking to move into other areas of electricity generation with technologies which are established, technologies which can produce electricity at a competitive rate with fossil fuel-based electricity, and in which we already have, as it were, a nascent industry in this country. We are seeking the removal of sales tax from devices which would be used to convert wind energy into electricity and, as with the solar cells, the ancillary equipment which would go with those. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also seeking to remove the sales tax from electrically-powered vehicles. Of course, the second of those would involve no cost to the Government at all because currently we do not produce electrically-powered vehicles. But we do have, in the case of the University of Sydney, a very interesting experiment going on in which vehicles are being developed which will have solar panels on the roof. They will generate about 30 per cent of the energy that will be used during that vehicle's use and, at the same time, the carport roof will be covered with photovoltaic cells which will charge batteries. That electricity will then be transferred into the batteries in the vehicle overnight. One could have a totally solar-powered car. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have the whole technology together but this amendment seeks to encourage the development of that sort of industry. Certainly, we already have the makings of a comprehensive technology which would allow second vehicles-commuter-type vehicles-to be totally run on solar energy. We believe that this development is absolutely necessary. It is a development that needs to be put in place over the next 10 to 15 years. It would be encouraged if the sales tax were removed from electrically-powered vehicles, as with the other amendment removing the sales tax from the goods and other bits and pieces and services which would go along with that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to one part of the amendment which will be moved by Senator Spindler and which has been moved before. It relates to the recycled paper component of goods containing recycled paper. I remind the Senate that originally it was a motion of mine which sought to remove the sales tax from recycled paper. It was voted down by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. Shortly thereafter the Government introduced its own piece of legislation to do that. Unfortunately, it has made a very bad error; that is, in the case of paper bought by, say, a printer who then prints on that paper and charges the ultimate consumer for the manufactured goods, the portion of the cost paid by the ultimate consumer which relates to the recycled paper is taxed, so there is indeed a tax on recycled paper in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the Government has not seen fit to remove this anomaly. It can be got around by people purchasing the paper, taking it to the printer and then simply paying for the printing separately. But that is a rather unsatisfactory arrangement. I simply run that analysis past the Government again because it is an anomaly which the Government did not intend to put into its legislation when it removed the sales tax from recycled paper. It has put it in there and it needs to be removed. Senator Spindler's amendment seeks to do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1990 and the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, which have the common thread of encouraging the development and utilisation of computer-based technologies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to take up too much of the time available in response, although there are a number of things I would otherwise wish to say, but I will respond to some of the major issues raised in the course of this debate and some of those raised by honourable senators. Some of the positive things about the computer bounty scheme need to be mentioned. Debates tend to focus on the things with which we disagree rather than the things which have been successful. That is inevitably the case because people do not want to spend a lot of time debating agreed things; they emphasise the differences because that is the nature of the forum. But one thing that is important and underemphasised in the computer bounties area, and which the Bureau of Industry Economics brought out, is the extent to which there is a thriving area of research and development in the industry benefiting from the bounty. This will make a very major contribution to the development of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will maintain the relationship between the assistance for this industry and manufacturing generally. That is appropriate and has been acknowledged by all honourable senators. It is a very important part of the continuing Government commitment to the industries in question. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take the opportunity to respond to two points which Senator Bishop made. In one she wandered off into an attack on strategic trade theory. I think that she actually wished that somebody had advocated it so that she could criticise it; but nobody did, so she pretended that they had and somehow or other linked such things so that she could criticise strategic trade theory and recount a series of Opposition industry policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> As an academic concept, strategic trade theory is quite distinct from anything that is currently in the public debate in Australia. But let us not pursue that tangent, except to say that it is quite possible for a government which does not believe in picking winners or in using the taxpayers' money to take entrepreneurial risks that ought not to be taken with taxpayers' money-it is not the government's money; it belongs to other people-to still be effective in the areas of export and industry assistance. Those two things are in no way mutually exclusive. It is proper that a sensible government continues to look at those issues. We do, we have and we will. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question that Senator Bishop raised related in two ways to the timetable for this legislation. She questioned the legality of payments made since 5 July 1990, when the current bounty Act expires. We have to distinguish between payments in two different circumstances under the existing legislation since that time; that is, payments that would have been owing, had the scheme been operating, for products manufactured outside the bounty period. That would not be eligible for payment under the expired scheme and no such payments have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments have been made since 5 July on bounty for equipment completed prior to the expiry of the bounty period; that is, prior to 5 July. Even though the scheme had expired, the Act still exists and they were payments for production completed during the period set down in the Act. Therefore, payments were made during that period but for production that took place in the period covered by the then existing Act. Payments since 6 July have been made only in respect of bountiable production completed prior to 6 July, which is within the law. The Act has not expired; only the current bounty period has. This Act comes in to pick up the payments that might otherwise have been made for the period since 6 July. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators may not know, as soon as the decision to continue the bounty was announced, which was on 12 June, the Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr Beddall, wrote to all 250 bounty recipients advising them of the decision and to continue to lodge claims with the Australian Customs Service for processing pending enactment of the new legislation to enable payments to be made quickly should the Parliament pass the legislation. Customs advises that almost 200 claims have now been processed, worth about $5m. Payments can be made to eligible bounty recipients as soon as the Bill receives royal assent. A number of other claimants have chosen to delay lodging claims until the new legislation comes into force. We expect, with the support which I welcome from honourable senators for the legislation, that the recipients will be making those claims expeditiously. I would be very surprised if they did not. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall say a couple of things in conclusion about the sales tax legislation. I would love to have had the opportunity to debate a little more the goods and services tax issue which Senator Bishop raised. It is a bit of a tangent but not one I initiated. I will simply say that it is another example of proposing to fight inflation by putting up prices and I remain unimpressed by it. It is interesting that people argue for a broadly based consumption tax at the same time as they are talking about increasing the exemptions within the sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the support for the legislation and the debate around it. I indicate to Senator Watson that I note the questions that he will put on notice. Although I will not be able to fulfil the timetable on these matters as I have with other matters-because these questions only came in late on Thursday-I will get him prompt answers although not by tomorrow, I would have thought. I will respond very briefly to the Australian Democrats' amendments in the committee stage. Once again, I indicate in regard to the amendments moved by Senator Spindler that I am no more disposed to support them this time than I was last time and that we will not be supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Coulter. However, we can discuss those in the committee stage. I thank honourable senators for their support for the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE STAGE OF SALES TAX BILL NO. 3</PARA>
<PARA>Part 1-Clause 2</PARA>
<PARA>1. Date of operation. I am aware that the Tax office has before it a number of cases where manufacturers have claimed exemption based on the premise that the equipment is an aid to manufacture but the ATO is claiming sales tax is owing. If this Bill is passed what is the situation for those companies whose equipment was bought before l9th October?</PARA>
<PARA>Part 2-Section 4 (B)</PARA>
<PARA>2. Concerned about the changed focus on people rather than their roles at work performed. Departure from the norm of sales tax references. Does the Minister agree that the definition of the term ``general journalist'' focuses on the designation of the individual rather than the type of work performed. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Does the Minister also concede that this Bill discriminates against small newspapers because the general journalist is more than likely to also be the sub-editor thereby denying sales tax exemption?</PARA>
<PARA>4. Given that the role of ``general journalist'' and sub-editor is often merged, does the Minister agree that this situation requires clarification within the Bill in order not to discriminate against efficient small papers?</PARA>
<PARA>5. The definition of finalisation appears too restrictive or alternatively requires relatively detailed knowledge of what constitutes editing/subediting in the context of a newspaper or magazine. Should not the definition of ``finalisation'' should be amended to read:</PARA>
<PARA>``In relation to text or images includes inputting, editing, formatting, typesetting and similar activities where carried out in connection with a publication or printed matter which will be manufactured.''</PARA>
<PARA>6. While it is the intent of the Bill, as explained in the explanatory memorandum ``the term (general journalist) will not include a journalist who performs predominantly an editing role on third party sourced material such as international news which comes into a publishing house via a wire service,'' the wording does not achieve this. Should not the wording be amended such that the intent is obvious from the Bill, rather than the reader having to rely on the explanatory memo. </PARA>
<PARA>7. I draw the Minister's attention to the definition of architectural/structural design computer equipment which might need to be reworded if it is not to operate, in conjunction with paragraph (2) (F) of Clause 2, to exclude the designs of major items of plant which often becomes structures. </PARA>
<PARA>8. I suggest to the Minister that the exclusion for ``software generation computer equipment'' and specifically paragraph (B) which reads, ``The goods are not mainly for use in connection with the embodying of the program concerned in a microchip'' should be reconsidered. The reasons for this are:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) It would not be known at the time software is developed whether it would be embodied in a microchip. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) The software design might be embodied in something other than a microchip but still be `firmware'; and thirdly, the use of the phrase ``for use in connection with'' might not necessarily create the linkage which is sought. </PARA>
<PARA>9. Pursuant to sub-paragraph (D) of Sub-clause 2 (2), goods which constitute ``software-generation computer equipment'' are excluded from the design/engineering computer equipment exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>An issue arises as to whether computer equipment used to produce designs and plans, where the design process involves a degree of programming, is excluded from the design/engineering computer equipment exemption because it falls within sub-paragraph (a) of the definition of ``software-generation computer equipment'' and is not excluded by sub-paragraphs (B) and (C). </PARA>
<PARA>It would be desirable if the Minister were to clarify that such computer equipment constitutes ``eligible computer equipment'', for the purposes of proposed Sub-clause 2 (1) of the first schedule to the Act, by making an appropriate statement during the course of the debate in relation to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>10. With regards to items of computer equipment, I wonder if the Minister could confirm whether eligible equipment includes typesetting equipment or pagefax equipment as neither are mentioned specifically?</PARA>
<PARA>11. Paragraph (M) of the definition of `items of computer equipment' excludes from exemption a device that forms part of the infrastructure of a telecommunications network. However, it would appear that where the telecommunication network is installed solely to facilitate manufacturing activities, this definition might operate to exclude equipment which is intended to cover. For example, analogue digital converters, modems and cables which might all form part of a specific telecommunications infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>12. There is no specific reference to specification testing, scientific research and maintenance equipment in the Bill. I believe a specific reference is necessary particularly in the case of scientific research and maintenance equipment as many large scale manufacturers use computer systems extensively to control and schedule plant maintenance. </PARA>

<PARA>To a large extent these amendments have been placed before the Senate on a previous occasion. They refer to the exemption from sales tax of recycled plastic products where such products are entirely, or partly, composed of recycled plastic. In addition, the amendment seeks to rectify a previous mistake where legislation was passed to exempt recycled paper from sales tax, but omitted to exempt that part of a product composed of recycled paper from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of amendments which seek to eliminate sales tax from communication aids for disabled people and seek to widen the clause by which sales tax is to be removed from cars which are used for the transportation of disabled people. We seek to widen that from the limitation that it only happens in a case where a car is being used to and from gainful employment. As I have said, these amendments have been moved previously. They also include a widening of the clause which, in general terms, allows goods designed and manufactured especially for the use of disabled people to be exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with regret that I note that neither the Opposition nor the Government sees fit to accept these amendments which are modelled on the recommendations of the Industry Commission report put down earlier this year. The Government says it needs further time to assess these recommendations and the Opposition says it needs further time to assess the Government's assessments. Here we have bureaucratic procrastination while people who could benefit-those who are least well off in our community-are once again sentenced to wait. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sorts of arguments apply to proposals to remove sales tax from re- cycled paper and plastic products. We are exhorted to recycle and we are exhorted to conserve our environment and energy. Here is a perfect opportunity to follow through with action, where people have used glowing words, but they renege. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has described in some detail the amendments that he is seeking to move. They also cover extremely important conservation measures. Once again, one must express regret that, while members of the old parties profess to be concerned about our environment, they are not prepared to follow through with action. Nevertheless, I press these amendments and commend them to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has indulged in a great deal of debating licence in the manner in which he has put the Opposition's views. I would like to remind the Senate that the Opposition did not receive the final draft, which included some additional items-1 and 2 (da) to (de)-until well into the second reading debate. They do appear to be somewhat similar to items put previously. Given the importance of these items we are not prepared to take them on the run. The Liberal-National coalition believes that items under 2 (df), which it did have adequate time to address, appear to be too loosely drawn, and `vehicles' could perhaps be extended to include golf buggies and electrically driven vehicular toys.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that when amendments of this nature are drawn, it is responsible for a party to cost them. The Senate has been presented with a raft of amendments which have not been costed. The Senate does not know the cost to the revenue. I believe that when amendments are drawn consideration should be given to ensure that they are tightly drawn. For those reasons, the Opposition will not be able to support the Democrat amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take long on these matters because it is a discussion we have had before. We will continue to resist what I call the bowerbird theory of sales tax amendment, that is, flitting around finding all the shiny-looking bits and trying to stick them in a heap. It does not constitute rational tax policy or rational policy development at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of people with disabilities I understand the attraction of the recommendations, but it appears-and I am going from recollection-that this is only picking and choosing from among the recommendations of the Industry Commission, those with which people feel comfortable. In the end, we may all want to look at the Industry Commission report and say we do not agree with it all, but I do not find it terribly persuasive that we have to agree because it is modelled on what the Industry Commission recommended, because it does not incorporate all its recommendations. Therefore, we think it is perfectly proper that those recommendations ought to be considered in conjunction with all the others. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said during the last debate on this matter, I am also extremely dubious that the use of the sales tax to achieve this objective is the most cost effective way of providing assistance to people with disabilities. It is often the case that the people in greatest need are those not in a position to benefit from assistance such as this. There are people with disabilities who cannot afford vehicles at all. It may well be that if we were talking about targeting our assistance, we would be giving an entirely different sort of priority to the expenditure of taxpayers' money to assist people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> We dealt with the conservation amendment with regard to paper and plastic on a previous occasion. I think it is part of an uncoordinated grab bag, and there would be substantial administrative problems with it. It is not the way in which we think, at the moment, that we should proceed to deal with the environmental issues that are raised in the amendments which originated from Senator Spindler concerning recycled paper and plastic. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had the opportunity to give detailed consideration to those issues raised by Senator Coulter. They fall into the same category. Not having had the opportunity to consider them in the context of all the other issues we are looking at, I am not prepared to support them at this stage. What I will be looking for is the outcome of the considerations of the sustainable development committees, many of which will deal with the issue of tax. That will put us in a position to come up with a coordinated response. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what distinguishes the Government and, perhaps the Opposition, from the Australian Democrats in this matter is not this buzz phrase that Senator Spindler would love people to adopt about old and new parties, or old and new senators, as the case may be, but the fact that some people have to deal with policy on the basis that either they have, or aspire to have, responsibility to actually implement the policies and some people do not. That is a distinction that I will continue to emphasise. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the start, we do not intend to enhance or pursue the bowerbird theory of sales tax policy development. We will try to do it in a consolidated and consistent manner as we have done over the last seven years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over a month ago we were dealing with the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990. I preface my remarks by saying that it seems silly that after waiting for over a month to finish this debate, we now have to finish it in a rush because the Government has guillotined this and many other Bills. It seems, again, a classic example of the Government's mismanagement of its own agenda--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990 is intended to assist in phasing out the statutory general levy. It also provides for an adjustment of the statutory levies, whether general or special, to ensure that the reform program hoped to be achieved by the Government is met and to provide for adjustments of the levy rates by regulation rather than through legislation. We do not oppose this Bill but we suggest that a sunset clause needs to be incorporated in the legislation to ensure that the reform processes proceed with the urgency they deserve. We will move amendments to that effect later. </PARA>
<PARA> The second piece of legislation is the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, which alters the constitution and functions of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, which authorises payments in respect of employers meeting obligations under the award. The principal Act will be amended to allow the Committee to make payments in respect of the new redundancy packages included in the agreement. When this matter was last adjourned, I was referring in particular to the situation in the Port of Cairns, which is of more general significance because it is the first of the regional ports in which the Government is attempting to implement its reform process. It is essential for all the regional ports in Australia that it be done correctly at Cairns. I am sad to say that the reform process in relation to the Cairns port, and therefore other regional ports in Australia, is not moving as well as it should. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday during Question Time I highlighted the scandalous situation that currently exists at the Cairns port. There has been meeting after meeting for over six months now, trying to get some resolution, when all along what was really needed was some leadership from the Government on this issue. The Government, in spite of its rhetoric and, I think, its genuine attempt to implement some reform on the waterfront, has not been game to take on the unions which control the Australian Labor Party to get reform where it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I gave the example of the situation in Cairns. After months of meetings, a little over a month ago the Water Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) said to the parties, `Go away. Come back with an agreement in a month's time. If you don't, we will do something about it and we will get the Minister to do something about it'. Practically nothing has happened. Because no agreements could be reached with the stevedoring companies, the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour (AEWL), which I do not think represents the people it is supposed to represent, went away with three of the maritime unions and came up with a memorandum of agreement for Cairns. This agreement has not been referred to the users of the port, the port authority or the stevedoring company which operates out of this port. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, indeed. It says in its terms of agreement, inter alia, that there should be nine workers at the port whereas the stevedoring company believes that four are sufficient, although it is prepared to concede an extra one. The stevedoring company says that only five workers are needed to work the Cairns port for the two companies there. Those two companies are Freeport Indonesia and Incitech. They need four or five people, but the agreement which the three waterfront unions and the AEWL are attempting to thrust on the Cairns port is that there should be nine employees out of the current 23 plus, on top of the nine, any of the other 23 who do not feel like retiring and taking the redundancy package now. It is anticipated from inquiries around the Cairns port that this will be another seven or eight, bringing the figure up to 16, 17 or 18 workers in a port that needs only four or five. That is a classic example of why our port situation is the way it is and why it is impossible to export through our ports at any competitive rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed, and I accept, that if this proposal is implemented in the Cairns port the charges at today's rate would treble for the two companies using the port. One does not have to be anything of an economist to work out that trebling the charges to use the Cairns port for the two companies that use it will mean that those two companies will no longer be able to afford to work out of that port. That will have severe and dangerous repercussions for the Cairns port. It means that Freeport Indonesia will not be able to use that port. If it does not use the port, the other major user, Incitech, will not be able to use it either. </PARA>
<PARA> Freeport Indonesia has spent $34m in the Cairns community so far this financial year. It does that through its stevedores in getting stevedoring provisions for its ships going to the equatorial parts of the world. It also ships vehicles, food, tractors, goods, greases and oils and all those sorts of things-$34m worth-out of the Cairns port. In a community as small as Cairns, that is an enormous amount of money. If Freeport and Incitech have to leave the Cairns port because of the charges, that $34m, which multiples many times over in a small place like Cairns, will simply be lost to the community. I am advised on all the best estimations and research that that will mean the direct loss of some 300 jobs in the Cairns area. That will have a multiplier effect and will lead to a lot of other employment losses in these very difficult times for employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Already the Cairns community has suffered enormously from the pilots strike. It was just getting out of that when the recession-the recession we had to have-hit Cairns. That has led to the collapse of a number of major building companies and general trading companies in Cairns. They have then left their suppliers without payment and that is having a flow-on effect. It is a very difficult time and, because the Government cannot get its reform program in place, it looks very much as though the Cairns community will lose another $34m with the resulting loss of jobs and the flow-on effect. </PARA>
<PARA> It only needs the Government and the people it appoints to take a firm hand to make that port operate as it should; that is, with four or five workers rather than the 16 or 17 which the Waterside Workers Federation and its mates are trying to impose on Cairns port. It is a very serious thing; it is not just a matter such as one talks about in industrial relations in Sydney or Melbourne. This will have immediate and noticeable effects in the Cairns area simply because the Government cannot get its reform program up and running as it should. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity Senator Collins is not here because I genuinely believe that he recognises the problem and wants to do something about it. In fact, he has put his job on the line. On 7 May this year he said that he would resign after one year if there had not been a significant improvement in the process of reforming the waterfront. I am sorry to say to Senator Collins, because he tries hard and tries to do the right things, that he has only five months to live in his job. There is no way in the world that the Government will get the Cairns situation sorted out in five months, let alone the situation in the rest of Australia. It is a case where the Government should forget about its union bosses and move on and get the job done. As I mentioned, Cairns is the first regional port to be subject to this reform process and it will be used as a precedent. The sort of things I have just been talking about in relation to Cairns makes one realise the difficulties in working on the waterfront throughout Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour this day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That in accordance with section 2 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the Senate approves the Therapeutic Goods Regulations as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 394, made under the Act and tabled in the Senate on 11 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I have pleasure in presenting regulations to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. This Act was passed by the Parliament in December 1989, a mere 12 months ago. At that time the Senate amended the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 to provide that the Act will commence on the day after regulations made pursuant to the Act have been approved in the same form by both Houses of Parliament-a most unusual provision. I think that former Senators Macklin and Puplick, amongst others, bequeathed this as a memorial to themselves. The Senate considered that any regulations may be so substantial that they should not commence until positive approval of Parliament was obtained for the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> In May this year the Senate disallowed previous Therapeutic Goods Regulations to provide the opportunity for further public consultation. As many honourable senators will be aware, the intervening period has seen much public debate and extensive consultation with interested parties. I believe it is quite obvious that the revised regulations reflect this activity over those many months. It is certainly a matter of regret that in this hiatus many people have been frightened into believing that the intent of the legislation is to somehow deprive them of access to the alternative therapies from which they clearly derive considerable comfort and support. I have had several letters to that effect. Even when visiting schools, quite senior students have approached me and brought this matter to my attention. Clearly they have been upset and have had their misgivings aroused by this particular propaganda campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Patients have been encouraged to believe such bizarre interpretations of the purpose of the legislation as: natural remedies will be available from doctors only on prescription, all herbal products are to be irradiated, and practitioners will not be able to tell their patients what a product is for. It is a sad commentary that some practitioners-one hopes a small minority-have misled the people for whom they profess concern in such a cynical fashion, often to further personal motives. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly there are some people out there, be they manufacturers, practitioners or distributors, who feel so insecure in their practices that they eschew all thought of their behaviour coming under the simplest scrutiny. These people simply emphasise the need for such scrutiny. In the meantime, their more proficient colleagues, who acknowledge that the standing of the alternative therapies is at least partly dependent on the standard of the products they use and recommend, have been constructively involved in assisting to identify and resolve genuine concerns about the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The public debate has introduced many extraneous issues. It has proved necessary to continually remind people that the purpose of the legislation is simply to establish one national system to ensure that the public is protected from substandard, unsafe or ineffective therapeutic goods which are supplied commercially to practitioners or consumers; that is, simply to provide a level of protection which is taken for granted in many other countries. Therapeutic goods, although used to improve people's health, involve an element of risk because they are intended to manipulate or augment normal body processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I advise the Senate of some pertinent and relevant factors: in Australia at the present time over 100 therapeutic goods are recalled from the market each year because of hazards to consumers; many manufacturers do not operate at internationally accepted standards of manufacture; the suppliers of some products make extravagant or inappropriate claims to the public; some suppliers promote products to inappropriately trained practitioners, thus encouraging these people to treat serious medical conditions; and independent analysis of products demonstrates many products do not reach appropriate standards of quality. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when there are moves towards international cooperation in the regulation of therapeutic goods, Australia is being hindered in its participation in these developments because of the lack of a national system of regulation. For instance, our membership of an international group which deals with manufacturing standards for therapeutic goods has been deferred until the Therapeutic Goods Act commences. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now 10 years since the State and Commonwealth health Ministers, in conference, agreed that Australia needed to bring together into a single national regulatory system the various regulatory aspects for therapeutic goods currently resting with different levels of government and characterised by their many inconsistencies and gaps. It still comes as a surprise to some-though, of course, not to the honourable senators in the chamber who follow this matter with such avid interest-to learn that the new Act and its regulations do not introduce any regulatory requirements which are not already in existence in at least some part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The development of the Act has given the opportunity to review the level of regulation of therapeutic goods, and indeed there will be a lessening of current requirements in some areas where this is not detrimental to the public interest. There is, of course, one aspect which might be deemed new. While some States have been charging registration and licensing fees, these have not been of the scope currently proposed. Nevertheless, such action is in line with efforts to better target the source of government costs and is consistent with international trends in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Many correspondents have made the point that the more potent drugs represent a higher risk than do the many products which may be purchased over the counter at the local pharmacy or health food shop. This is readily acknowledged and specifically reflected in the legislation which provides the ability to require different levels of pre-market assessment. The level of scrutiny applied to a new orthodox drug and to a new herbal product are very different. For example, most therapeutic devices and many alternative medicines are listed rather than registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This means that they are subjected to a lower degree of scrutiny, such as checking for compliance with standards for quality prior to marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> However, certain factors can predicate the need for a higher level of scrutiny. For example, where an alternative medicine contains a substance which has been scheduled by the National Health and Medical Research Council because of its toxicity, or where an alternative medicine is intended to be used to treat a serious medical condition, it is necessary to establish the product's safety and effectiveness, hence registration involving a more detailed scrutiny is appropriate. Similarly, a product may contain substances which by themselves do not represent a risk but because of poor manufacture may have wide variations in the amounts of the active ingredients or may be adulterated or contaminated with other substances. The manufacturing controls are designed to ensure therapeutic goods are manufactured in a reliable and reproducible manner. The regulations also contain restrictions on the promotion of products to the public to not only ensure that the advertising of products is truthful but, equally importantly, that promotion does not encourage inappropriate self-diagnosis and treatment where the input of a trained health care practitioner is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Promotion of goods to trained health care workers is exempted from these requirements. Included in the exemption are alternative therapy practitioners registered under State or Territory legislation. However, it is recognised that few alternative therapy practitioners are registered at the present time. Until registration is more generally available, it is proposed to allow the alternative therapy industry to self-regulate advertising of products to practitioners on the understanding that the practitioner community identifies an appropriate level of accreditation and that the manufacturers will put a code of advertising conduct into place. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made for two bodies, the National Conference of Natural Therapies and the Australian Homeopathic Registration Board, to fulfil the first function by providing a list of associations for inclusion in the regulations, with the Nutritional Foods Association having responsibility for the second. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the extensive consultation that has taken place, and I am pleased to report that the discussions with industry and practitioner groups have resulted in a number of amendments to the regulations. These amendments include, first, as already mentioned, extension of the professional advertising exemption to members of identified homeopathic and natural therapy associations; secondly, provision for homeopathic products provided to practitioners to be treated as listable rather than registrable products, together with complete exemption from product certification and licensing requirements for many of the more dilute homeopathic products; thirdly, acceptance of various additional nutritional substances for listing rather than registration; fourthly, provision for representation by manufacturers of alternative medicines on the Therapeutic Goods Committee; and, fifthly, various adjustments to the scale of fees and charges, including reduced licensing charges, for manufacturers of herbal and homeopathic products and waiving of the annual registration or listing charge where this charge would constitute 2 per cent or more of the value of the annual wholesale turnover of the product. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the amendments, it has been agreed that, first, codes of good manufacturing practice will not be applied to production and processing of herbal raw materials supplied to licensed manufacturers. Extended time will be allowed for manufacturers of dried herbal consumer goods to achieve good manufacturing practice standards. Secondly, a separate committee, the Traditional Medicines Evaluation Committee, has been established to evaluate traditional medicines for registration. The membership of the Committee would include representatives of the manufacturers and practitioners, and it will shoulder the heavy responsibility of consumer protection by reviewing primarily new herbal products. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) will personally appoint the members of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Following discussion with the Australian Democrats, the Government has undertaken to amend the regulations during the autumn sitting to reduce the annual licence charge for a manufacturer with an annual turnover of $50,000 or less to half that which would apply otherwise; and to exempt from licensing manufacturers of components for therapeutic devices where these components come into direct contact with body tissue or body fluid. </PARA>
<PARA> As Sir Humphrey Appleby would point out, the first line of defence against any proposition is to claim that there has not been adequate consultation. Despite a history of consultation extending over a number of years, such a claim might have been arguable with regard to the earlier regulations. However, it would certainly have no legitimacy in relation to the current regulations. We have all been flooded with comment on the legislation, albeit a lot of it based on misinformation. There have literally been hundreds of meetings and conversations centred on issues of concern and exploring solutions thereto. Such dialogue will of course be an ongoing process after the legislation becomes operative. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the positions of the groups affected by the legislation. First, the manufacturers and sponsors of therapeutic goods, who have always supported the purpose and need of the legislation; who have been rightly critical of the frustrating and often expensive differences between State, Territory and Commonwealth requirements; who will be contributing 50 per cent of the costs of the program, but who have had direct input into the distribution of the impact of fees and charges through the Industry Government Consultative Committee; who have been provided with representation on most statutory committees and, in the case of non-prescription medicines, on the evaluation committees; and whose exports will be more readily accepted on overseas markets because of the Australian controls. </PARA>
<PARA> We then might consider the practitioners, who will have protection from unsatisfactory commercial products; who will receive product information safeguarded by industry self-regulation; whose services will be sought for the treatment of appropriate medical conditions because the public will not be encouraged by product promotion to self-treat serious conditions; and who will participate in the statutory and evaluation committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are the consumers, who at times are almost forgotten by many but who are the focus of this legislation; who will have protection from unsafe, poor quality and ineffective therapeutic goods; who are not adequately protected by current controls; who will be protected from false or inappropriate product promotion; and who, despite some outrageous claims to the contrary, will not be inflicted with large price increases of products. The fees and charges should be reflected by only a few cents per product, and we will certainly be watching to see that this is not used as an opportunity by sponsors to extend profits while blaming the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reiterate the purpose of the legislation, which often becomes forgotten in the public debate. It is simply to regulate, in the interests of the consumer, the quality, safety and efficacy of commercially supplied therapeutic goods. As mentioned earlier, it is remarkable that distortions of this purpose have sometimes occurred. This legislation does not have any cynical hidden agendas. It is simply consumer protection legislation that is necessary to afford the Australian public a level of protection taken for granted in most of our industrialised partners. After years of deliberation and with 12 months having elapsed since the enabling legislation was passed, it is now time to move to a more efficient and effective way of regulating therapeutic goods in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity of acknowledging the high level of cooperation between all States and Territories in developing this truly national system to replace the current largely uncoordinated systems of State, Territory and Commonwealth controls. I commend the regulations to the Senate for its approval. </PARA>

I feel that they must dislike the Minister so much to have him represent in the Senate the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs has had to defend that Minister this year when that Minister has disenchanted the pharmaceutical industry, disenchanted the nursing homes sector and the hostel aged care sector and disenchanted the therapeutic goods sector. He always leaves the Minister in this place, Senator Tate, with a mess and Senator Tate is the one who carries the can. If I were Senator Tate, my new year's resolution would be not to represent Mr Staples in this place. Give the task to Senator Richardson or Senator Cook, who are so good at speaking. I would opt out of the operation if I were Senator Tate, or at the end of next year he will not be looking as well as he does now.

The Government says, `We have had negotiations with the Australian Democrats'.

The first the Whips knew about it, despite what everyone else might say, was this morning when Senator Tate or Senator McMullan gave notice that the matter was to be brought on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has given the Democrats assurances that the regulations will be amended in the new year. But if the Democrats believe the Government's assurances, they are more stupid than I thought they were-in fact I think some of the people over here have become unreasonable-but if they believe that things are going to change they are deluded. What I think should happen is that we should see those amendments and then vote on them when we have seen them. We should not vote on some pie in the sky hope that the Minister is going to change them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has a number of fundamental objections to the original regulations. Firstly, they take away the consumer's right to choose the method of health care treatment, the preferred practitioner and the product used. They impose severe restrictions on the availability of remedies. They prohibit the sale of some homoeopathic remedies and many herbal substances and increase the cost of all natural therapeutic substances by imposing an annual registration fee. I believe from what has been said that that fee is going to be reduced but I have not had time to assess the impact of that. But it will not necessarily result in a national system offering uniformity and increased efficiency in the manufacture and sale of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also some confusion as to the operation of the grandfather clause to the Act that these regulations give effect to. All existing products that are listed or registered after six months of the operation of the Act will have to comply with the regulations. Existing products on the market will therefore not be protected from the heavy costs imposed by these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have serious concerns about the set-up of a number of committees. The Proprietary Medicines Advisory Council (PMAC) is constituted by incorporating the current Victorian PMAC and renaming it. The PMAC will evaluate nutritional and vitamin products. The committee's expertise lies in evaluating proprietary medicines, that is, those that are patented. It may have been better to look at a much broader scope and a much better representation on these committees with a wider range of people with expertise and interests in the alternative medicine industry. This seems a reasonable request but, for some reason, the Government seems to have been unwilling to accept this. </PARA>

Another concern with the PMAC is that a body contracted for the purpose of evaluating over the counter products on a national basis should be set up under the relevant national legislation. It is inappropriate for a body with a national brief to operate within an existing State legislative framework.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has agreed to set up a Traditional Medicines Evaluation Committee (TMEC) which will evaluate traditional medicines, primarily herbal products, which require registration. However, each formulation will be evaluated by the PMAC as well as the TMEC. It is possible that the TMEC may give clearance to a formulation but it could be knocked back by PMAC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean will have his chance in the moment. No reference to the TMEC has been included in the regulations. The composition of the TMEC, as announced by the Minister, places heavy emphasis on people from outside the natural therapy area on a committee. There should be more time to clarify the terms of reference for this committee. If there is debate in this chamber at the moment about this, it is because the issues have not been clarified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The regulations attempt to ensure that an appropriate manufacturing code of practice is followed in the production of therapeutic goods and devices. This code of practice is significantly tighter than that which is currently enforced in most overseas countries. This means that Australian standards of manufacturing practice must be complied with for products which are produced solely for an export market. An exporting manufacturer may have to comply with two completely different sets of regulations, one overseas and one in Australia. The stringent requirements of good manufacturing practice (GMP) may make Australian production unviable. This is contrary to overall Government policy that seeks to encourage the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and therapeutics in Australia, their export from Australia and the development of new and improved therapeutic products. </PARA>
<PARA> Given our fragile trade situation-and not one of us here needs to be reminded of that-we should be encouraging our export industries, not crippling them. Imported products will not be subject to the code of good manufacturing practice that Australian companies are. What an advantage this gives to importers. The GMP is an important principle that ought to be adhered to, particularly in the case of large manufacturers. But to insist that a cottage type industry installs high tech industrial equipment so as to be able to comply with GMP will lead to the destruction of that part of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The code of good manufacturing practice imposes many unnecessary requirements on small herbal, vitamin and mineral supplement manufacturers where there is presently no obvious cause for concern over their manufacturing standards. What we are saying is that maybe with some more lateral thinking, some of these questions could have been answered and some of these smaller industries considered more fully in these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the Therapeutic Goods Act is $30m. Fees and charges are expected to recoup $15m of this cost. One of our major concerns is the extra costs to be imposed on the industry. As I have said before, the first time I have had any indication from the Government about the costs is tonight. So, my estimates will most probably change slightly given the fact that some of those costs will be reduced. But again, what I find absolutely appalling is that I am the person who is responsible on this side of the chamber for taking health legislation through this place and I have had no communication at all about when these regulations will be brought on or any suggested amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 9 of the regulations lists the fees that will be imposed and many of these fees are prohibitive. The regulations include charges for the checking of methods of manufacture, quality control, evaluation, et cetera. One company estimated that complying with the regulations could cost it anywhere between $1m and $3m a year. Again, I heard on the grapevine, but only heard officially tonight, that the Government promises to amend the regulations to allow small manufacturers to have their charges decreased by up to 50 per cent and that there will be an increased number of nutritional experts on PMAC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has told the Democrats about this and Senator Coulter might say that he negotiated with the Government about it, but I think it would have been a reasonable--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would have been just plain courtesy-at least this morning when this motion was moved-for me to have had a communication from either Minister Tate, or from Minister Staples. Although these amendments should be applauded, they do not go far enough. There are too many unanswered questions. The consumer's choice of therapeutics is too restricted. The fees and charges are prohibitive and will send many manufacturers to the wall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The form of the relationship about PMAC and TMEC is far from resolved. The lack of national representation on PMAC will not instil confidence in the minds of manufacturers from outside Victoria. As I said, at a time when our current account deficit is out of control, the standards of good manufacturing practice in the regulations have the potential to shut down therapeutic exporters, thus forcing the industry to become reliant on imports. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had shown any interest in attempting to solve these problems, and had I known beforehand, I might have done what I did with the nursing home legislation. I might have come to Minister Tate and I believe that I would have had the same courteous response as I had on that issue. But I did not know, so I could not come to him and say, `How are we going to resolve this? How can we ensure that we have good legislation?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not want to just get up and oppose this for the sake of opposing legislation. We want to try to cooperate but it is very difficult to cooperate when in fact we are not consulted. When Mr Staples does not behave in a courteous and appropriate way, it makes it impossible for the Opposition to attempt to work with the Government to assist small businesses, which are not just facing these regulations but are also facing all the other things, such as high interest rates and inflation which affect businesses in this country, that are under threat. Here are small business people in the therapeutics industry facing all those plus the uncertainty that these regulations have brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want to continue to add to that uncertainty. We do not want to be part of that. But tonight we have to oppose these regulations because we do not believe that they are correct. We believe they still need amending. We do not think that we should approve them in the hope that the Minister will amend them in the future. We should have those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> When my office rang last week to ask when these therapeutic regulations would be brought on, what was the flippant reply from Minister Staples's office? `We will bring them on when you decide to agree with them. That is when we will bring them on. Most probably that could be next year. They most probably will not be brought on until next year'. So the information that we were operating on was that the Therapeutic Goods Regulations would not be brought on until next year. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning we had indecent rush and haste. I hope that the therapeutics industry will realise from this experience-as the pharmacists and the people in the aged care sector have come to realise, not just the Catholic bishops-that despite the fact that this Government believes it has a monopoly on care, consultation and consensus, this is not the case. We would have cooperated had we had the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I condemn Minister Staples for the way he has handled this matter and the whole allied health care sector. I hope that those people will remember that when the Government next faces the polls. The Opposition and I do not believe that the appropriate remedies have been implemented to make these regulations meet the needs of the therapeutics industry. On that basis, we will oppose them tonight. </PARA>

<PARA> The Therapeutic Goods Act was passed late in 1989 with the Australian Democrats supporting its broad thrust. An amendment to the legislation ensures that the Act cannot become law until the regulations have been passed by both Houses. The purpose of this legislation is to establish and maintain a national system of controls relating to the quality, efficacy and safety of therapeutic goods that are used in Australia, whether produced here or elsewhere, as well as those exported from Australia. The present system is one of inadequate state by state registration and regulation. The Federal Act and these regulations will join reciprocal arrangements in a growing number of other countries which will facilitate import and export between these countries while ensuring quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Therapeutic goods cover a wide range of products from medical devices and pharmaceuticals to natural therapies, including herbs. The register of therapeutic goods will contain two classes-those to be registered and those to be listed. Registered goods-the small class-will require evaluation with regard to their quality, safety and effectiveness before being approved. Listed goods-the larger class-are of less hazardous nature and may require assessment with regard to quality and their compliance with appropriate standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, the Act and these regulations are about public health and safety and consumer protection. The Australian Consumers Association (ACA) is very supportive of it and anxious that its implementation not be unduly delayed. Indeed, the ACA was disappointed when I successfully moved for the disallowance of the regulations in May. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent official reports of bacterial contamination in both orthodox and alternative medicines for oral and topical application show that 30 per cent of such preparations from both sources have unacceptably high levels of contamination. </PARA>
<PARA> It is manufacturers, not therapists and not individual users, of therapeutic goods for human use who must be licensed and comply with the regulations. They must allow their premises to be inspected to ascertain compliance with codes of good manufacturing practice. Various committees will provide advice to the Minister or Secretary on determination of standards, manufacturing principles and the approval of goods for supply. Decisions may be reviewed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> When the regulations to the Act were first tabled in May this year there were sufficient anomalies for me to move for disallowance. This motion was supported by the Opposition. The concerns mainly cover the areas of advertising, advisory committees and the level of fees and charges. I believe that in addressing these and several other more recently raised concerns, the Government has gone as far as it can go in changing the regulations without transgressing the spirit of the Act. Further weakening of the regulations would totally emasculate and destroy the legitimate purposes of the legislation. The remaining concerns with the new regulations have been addressed by way of ministerial assurances in a letter of 12 December, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Coulter,</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your frank and constructive discussions with Terry Counihan and officers of the Therapeutic Goods Administration on 6/12/90. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Democrats will support the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, subject to my providing an assurance that the Regulations will be amended to address concerns which you have raised. Your undertaking to support the Regulations is appreciated and it is clear that the period of negotiation following the disallowance in May 1990 has led to the development of Regulations which provide a more appropriate balance between the interests of the affected groups and the need to provide protection for the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>I have agreed that the Regulations will be amended at the first opportunity during the Autumn sittings to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) provide that the annual charge for a licence to manufacture therapeutic goods may be reduced to 50 percent of the amount prescribed in the Regulations to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act where the value of annual wholesale turnover is less that $50,000;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) extend the exemption from licensing to manufacturers of components for therapeutic devices where the components come into direct contact with body tissue or body fluid. Due to the critical nature of these components, the principal manufacture will be responsible for the manufacturing standard of the component manufacturers and Commonwealth inspectors will retain the right to inspect (without charge) the component manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA>I have communicated with Ms Hogg, Victorian Minister for Health regarding the need for adequate representation for nutritional products on the Victorian evaluation committee. I have strongly encouraged the appointment of either an expert in nutrition or a representative of the manufacturers of nutritional products. </PARA>
<PARA>I have also attached to this letter a draft document concerning minimum microbial levels in dried herb products. This document deals with the microbial limits in foods and the rationale and interpretation of the guideline limit for herbal preparations. </PARA>
<PARA>The frequency of testing batches of dried herbs for microbial contamination is at the discretion of the manufacturer and depends upon the confidence that the manufacturer has in the cleanliness of his procedures and the source of the materials used in the product. </PARA>
<PARA>You also discussed the need to monitor the performance of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the effects of the legislation on the Industry, particularly the effects of fees and charges. The performance of the Therapeutic Goods Administration following the commencement of the legislation, will be closely monitored by members of the Industry Government Consultative Committee (IGCC) and the Senate Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The IGCC will also have a continuing role in advising on the fees and charges particularly in response to experience with the effect of the costs on Industry. While I have little doubt that the activities and performance of the Therapeutic Goods Administration will be subject to scrutiny by various other bodies in the future, I suggest it would be appropriate to ask the IGCC to provide an evaluation of the impact of fees and charges on exports within 2 years from the legislation having passed both Houses. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were supplied to the honourable senator. In the first set of regulations, proscribed claims about therapeutic goods could only be advertised to medical practitioners, pharmacists and other members of the orthodox medical profession, but not to practitioners of alternative medicines such as herbalists, homoeopathic practitioners, nutritionists, osteopaths, et cetera. This was offensive to the latter. In the present regulations, advertising proscribed claims has been extended to this latter group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an exact reciprocal of the arrangement under which orthodox medicine operates. Claims included on this proscribed list made with respect to drugs used in orthodox medicine can only be advertised in professional journals to doctors, nurses and people in the orthodox professions. These professionals have the presumed competence to assess the veracity of the advertised claims. In an exactly similar way, the manufacturers of traditional or alternative medicines may advertise proscribed claims to professionals in alternative medicine who are competent to assess these claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Claims from this proscribed list may not be advertised directly to the public. This is an important aspect of public protection. For example, all honourable senators will have seen exposure, through newspapers and such programs as The Investigators, of `manufacturers' of `lolly water' being sold as `a cure for cancer'. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the extension to alternative medicine practitioners but do not believe that it should be extended further. The responsibility must lie with the professional to weigh up the claims as to the efficacy of various products and then pass on his or her professional judgment to the patient or client. The doctor does this with proprietary drugs through information conveyed in medical journals. Natural therapists will now be able to do so through information conveyed in their professional journals. </PARA>
<PARA> An implicit assumption that all `natural' things are safe and require no regulation, and that all man-made chemicals are unsafe, are made by crooks, and need very close control lies behind much of the dissension over these regulations. This assumption is not based on fact and is irrational. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, approximately 25 per cent of all people in Australia, as in most industrialised countries, will get cancer at some stage in their lives. Comparative epidemiological studies indicate quite clearly that the bulk- that is, about 80 per cent-of these cancers are caused by factors in the environment and most of these are naturally occurring. Most of these factors have not been identified. This relates very much to the assertion that `no-one has been harmed by natural products'. Very often, no-one has looked and even if they have, there are enormous problems in identifying and isolating one factor from amongst the many others to which we are all exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would remind the Senate that tobacco is a natural product. It is a herb. It has been used as a therapeutic and cultural substance for thousands of years. It was not definitively established as a potent carcinogen until the early 1960s. Long tradition does not establish safety. We are all aware of the implicit therapeutic claims made by the advertisers of tobacco and the Democrats have sought rigid controls over the advertising of these claims to the general public. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give a second example. Nothing could be more `natural' than honey. Claims as to the therapeutic value of honey for the treatment of a wide range of illnesses can be seen in a number of books on `natural health'. Of course, honey contains substances derived from the flowers from which the nectar was collected. Salvation Jane, which is also called Patterson's Curse, is much valued by apiarists as a good source of honey. Patterson's Curse contains pyrollizidine alkaloids which are potent liver toxins and carcinogens. Honey collected from salvation Jane contains significant levels of these alkaloids. </PARA>
<PARA> Apiarists fought successfully for several years to prevent the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation introducing biological control against this weed. Information-and this is the important point-that the honey from this source was a significant danger to health was assiduously suppressed during this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many, many herbs which are used in both culinary and therapeutic ways which contain known carcinogens-pepper, tarragon, comfrey, mushrooms to mention just a few. If extracts from any of this host of `natural'- and I stress `natural'-plant material is marketed with claims of therapeutic efficacy, it is reasonable that the public have some assurance that the extraction process has not concentrated these carcinogens or converted them to even more potent genetic toxins. It is not a defence that these are `natural' and to claim, as some have attempted to do, that therefore they should not attract regulatory oversight. </PARA>
<PARA> These regulations and the legislation of which they are the principal instrument of implementation are completely silent on what people may believe about the effectiveness of any therapy, whether physical or chemical and whether `natural' or chemically synthesised. They are silent on what one person may tell another about those beliefs. They are silent on what or how a person may treat himself with therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> These regulations are about the appropriate regulation of manufacturers of therapeutic goods-that is, those who make and market therapeutic goods. They are about the protection of the potential and actual consumers of the products of these manufacturers. They are about ensuring that products are made in clean and hygienic premises to an acceptable standard, that the efficacy and safety of the product can be relied upon, and that the claims made by the manufacturer reflect these qualities. There is no interference with the rights of the individual to take what he or she likes and no interference with freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Considerable fear has been expressed by the alternative medicine school that the committee named in the earlier regulations to evaluate its pharmaceutical goods was biased and that alternative medicine industry would not be treated fairly. In the earlier regulations it was determined that all natural therapies would be assessed by the Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee (PMAC)-a Victorian-based Committee which has traditionally evaluated orthodox proprietary medicines and which has generated a great deal of hostility from the alternative medicine industry because of past decisions on its products and the known attitudes of its members. I have successfully negotiated a change in this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the regulations as they now are, a new and separate committee is created to assess natural therapies. This is known as the Traditional Medicine Evaluation Committee (TMEC). It has qualified members, including three herbalists-a lecturer in herbal medicine and adviser to a herbal manufacturer, a practitioner in traditional Chinese medicine and a practising herbalist with expertise in herbal toxicology-and a pharmacist with strong associations with the Nutritional Food Association. The Committee is to be chaired by the Chairman of the Australian College of Natural Medicine. There are still some people who want a multitude of committees, one for each of their special interests. I consider this to be totally unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> All synthetic drugs would continue to be assessed by PMAC. The new regulations require that vitamins, minerals and amino acids would be assessed by PMAC rather than TMEC. This continued to cause unhappiness in the natural therapy industry, so I sought and gained an assurance from the Minister, contained in the letter that I have just incorporated, that he would ask the Victorian Minister for Health-I note that PMAC is an instrument of the Victorian legislation-to recommend that a representative of the nutritional food industry, as recommended by the Nutritional Foods Association, be added to the membership of PMAC. PMAC has now agreed to increase its committee from six to eight members and has agreed that one of the new members be a nutritional food teacher from the Deakin University nutritional school and the other a person who has specific expertise in the manufacture of vitamin, mineral and herbal therapeutic goods-that is, someone who directly represents the alternative medicine manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> Some lobbyists from the natural therapies industry have argued for 50 per cent representation on PMAC, but I believe that that is unreasonable. Vitamins, minerals and amino acids are not the sole preserve of the natural therapies industry but are of equal interest to orthodox medicine. There has to be some dividing line between what PMAC and TMEC assess. It is reasonable that that line be whether the items being assessed are synthetic or natural products. No specific examples of PMAC's alleged past bias have been supplied. However, even accepting that such bias against traditional medicine has existed-it is certainly quite believable-under the new arrangements in which two separate committees, presumably with competing biases, will each report, both committees will be extremely careful to see that any judgment they pass is fully justified and justifiable. Moreover, both are advisory committees to the Secretary of the Department, who makes the final decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, the fee structure was based on total cost recovery from manufacturers. The philosophy underlying this was that the manufacturers were the ones generating the need for placing products on the market and that they would benefit from the imprimatur of registration. In the first concession the Government agreed that the industry would carry only 50 per cent of the costs, the other 50 per cent coming from general revenue. Half of the total cost is expected to be $15m. The most substantial fees will be for evaluation of products for registration and the inspection and licensing of manufacturers. It is anticipated that, of the $15m, the natural therapies industry will carry about $800,000 of the costs. The pharmaceutical companies will bear the brunt of this cost because most of their new products will require registration rather than listing. Those products already on the market will be grandfathered-that is an important point-and will be exempt from registration fees. </PARA>
<PARA> A successful Democrat amendment to the Act was to make low value, low volume goods exempt from fees and charges. This was done in order to address the genuine concerns of herb growers and small companies making medical appliances whose turnover on a number of product lines might be only a few hundred or a few thousand dollars. This amendment has been given effect in the present regulations by waiving the fees if the fee for registration or listing exceeds 2 per cent of the gross turnover on a particular good. Thus for a listed good if the annual turnover is less than $3,000, the manufacturer, such as a grower or marketer of herbs, does not need to pay the $60 fee to have that product listed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Government Consultative Committee (IGCC) met in July with the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and a general reduction in fees was recommended. Exemptions from annual listing or registration charges were made where the charge would represent more than 2 per cent of annual wholesale turnover rather than the 5 per cent proposed in the first regulations. Thus, if the turnover is less than $3,000 for a listed good, the manufacturer does not pay the $60 listing fee, and if the turnover for a registered product is less than $8,750, the manufacturer does not have to pay the $175 registration fee. The cost of an export certificate was reduced from $300 to $50, and it should be noted that an exporter will have to provide one only if the importing country requires one for that product. Some fees appear quite high, such as the fee for human clinical studies in evaluating therapeutic devices. I gained a ministerial assurance that, where a number of component parts were made on different premises for a device such as artificial joints, the manufacturers of these component parts would be exempt from inspection fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Western Australian medical device manufacturers have argued that the fees and charges will knock out research and development for small manufacturers and they cite the United Kingdom precedent where fees were introduced and exports fell. The United States, on the other hand, does not expect manufacturers to pick up the expenses for licensing and inspection and has maintained its exports. This situation may change, as this matter is reviewed each year. As far as I can ascertain, the United Kingdom charges appear to be higher than those which would apply in Australia, but I have not been able to get details of specific charges from the people most concerned about the United Kingdom situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have gained a ministerial assurance, however, that the IGCC will monitor the TGA and provide an evaluation of the effects of the fees and charges on the industry within two years. This is contained in the ministerial letter which has already been incorporated. The period of two years has been chosen as it is expected that it will take some six to nine months to get this legislation into full operation. In all cases-except in the case of herb growers-where claims have been made that a business will go to the wall or will stop exporting because of the charges, further investigation has revealed that they are not significant in terms of annual turnover-for example, $20,000 for a turnover of $2m, or one per cent. Complaints have been made that manufacturers get nothing in return, but in fact they get the stamp of good manufacturing practice (GMP) approval, which enhances credibility in the domestic and international market. Totally outrageous claims have been made, including one from a manufacturer who maintained that he needed to spend $8m on upgrading his premises to comply with GMP. One might ask rhetorically what his premises are like if he needs to spend that amount on the necessary upgrading. It is indicative of the general lack of understanding of the new regulations and the misinformation which is spread, mischievously or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of herb growers, many of whom have annual turnovers of less than $70,000 and some of whom have annual turnovers as low as $15,000, the annual license fee of $1,000 and the inspection fee-not necessarily annual-of $1,200 was obviously a hardship. I therefore negotiated successfully for another ministerial assurance that license fees for those with a turnover of less than $50,000 would be reduced from $1,000 to $500. In these cases most, if not all, of their products will be listable and not registrable. For products already on the market, listing will be grandfathered and no fee will be payable. For new products a listing fee of $60 per product will be charged only when the gross turnover for that product exceeds $3,000. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been lobbyists who have been very tough but fair-minded in support of their industry. Anthony Morgan of the Nutritional Foods Association has put his industry's case extremely forcefully, as have David Marks and Rob Carolane on behalf of the herb growers. Unfortunately, some who have lobbied have made totally exaggerated claims. It is significant to note in passing that several manufacturers who are members of the Nutritional Foods Association do not submit some 40 per cent of their products to the NFA's own internal review process. These people are among the lobbyists making these exaggerated claims. Is it any wonder that such people do not want this Parliament to pass these regulations? Some herb growers, many of them biodynamic and organic farmers, have argued that the microbial limit for therapeutic goods was tighter than that for food and they object, quite legitimately, to treating their herbs with ethylene oxide or radiation to sterilise them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Therapeutic Goods Administration Laboratories (TGAL) replied in response to this claim that the National Health and Medical Research Council food standards code 1990 included microbial limits for some foods but there was no general limit for all foods. There was also a requirement that the foods mentioned be completely free of certain pathogens such as salmonella and E. coli. The TGAL is in fact flexible in interpreting results of its testing and may recall above or below the 10 colony forming units per gram, or per mil, microbial limit depending on the nature of the organisms found. </PARA>
<PARA> Some growers expressed concern at the cost of testing-that is, around $75 per batch-and the possible need to test every batch. I have obtained ministerial assurance that the frequency of testing will be at the discretion of the manufacturer. Frequency of testing will depend on the confidence that the manufacturer has in the cleanliness of his or her procedures and source of her or his materials. In other words, having established that the manufacturing practice is up to standard through the testing of several batches, no further testing will be required for that product as long as the manufacturing process remains the same. The question of whether a dried herb is a therapeutic or a food has also been addressed. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a schema supplied to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Dried herbs will be divided into two categories: appendix A being those herbs which automatically come under the Therapeutic Goods Act and appendix B being those which have both therapeutic and non-therapeutic uses. The onus is on the grower to decide whether to market her appendix B herbs as therapeutic goods or as a food; that is, as herbal tea. Whichever she chooses, she will label her products appropriately. If the product is marketed as a food it does not come under these regulations. After direct negotiations between growers and the Department, and via my office, some herbs, especially those used in making herbal teas, have been shifted from one appendix to the other. Further shifts can be negotiated and the Department has shown itself quite willing to review the classification of a herb on the basis of evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some companies, such as R.P. Scherer Pty Ltd, have argued that they will not be able to compete with imports from countries where manufacturers do not have the expense of compliance with strict GMP standards. Australian therapeutic goods manufacturers will be able to appeal against any imports which they believe do not comply with GMP, and the onus is then on the importer to prove that they do, and carry the expense of inspection of premises overseas if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that these regulations be passed now. This will put certainty into this complex matter and allow a start to be made on dispelling the myths and misinformation which are now circulating. Any changes by those who are dissatisfied can then be proposed against a known and certain background, not against the mischievous rumour. There will be an amendment to the regulations in those areas indicated in the Minister's letter. Those amendments will be put in the next session. Passing these regulations now allows the important process of regulating the therapeutic goods industry, in the interests of consumer protection, to begin. Accordingly, the Democrats support these regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. Sadly, this has come up very suddenly. Once again a deal that has been done by the Government and the Australian Democrats has made sure that this matter will not be debated to the degree that it should be. I want to make one point very clear and put it on the record right now: Dr Woods, the shadow Minister for health, has still, as of 15 minutes ago, not been spoken to by the Government or the Democrats about any of these proposals or amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is quite clear, quite categorical and unequivocal. The real sadness about all of this is that the letter from Minister Staples to Senator Coulter is dated 12 December; today is 20 December. Senator Coulter did not have the courage of his convictions to go to Senator Patterson or to Dr Woods-no, no, no-the fairies at the bottom of the garden party strike again. </PARA>
<PARA> Only this afternoon, the Democrats' State President's husband in Western Australia-former Senator Jenkins' husband-Brian Jenkins, told an interested party in Western Australia, `No, it is the Opposition which is agreeing to these regulations and the Democrats are opposing them'. But then again, that could be true because those Democrats who had the courage of their convictions to oppose these regulations-and I hope there will still be some in the fairies at the bottom of the garden party that will have the courage of their convictions and oppose these regulations-have had to be screwed down by this non-existent leader, Senator Powell, who wants to go home to play tiddly-winks. She said to the Senate last Thursday morning, `I want to go home', as Senator Walters quite clearly said. I wish she would do herself a favour and go home but, more importantly, do us a favour and go home. At least we would get some legislation passed in this place without any of the nonsense that the Democrats are going on with. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell has said that any regulation and any additional restriction against the private sector should be supported. The Democrats' record in this Parliament stands checked by that. If they can screw down the private sector, they will, and if they can put more people out of employment, they will. Sadly, this Government has facilitated that move. I hope that there are those in the Democrats who are prepared to have the courage of their convictions. I know that some of them are very personally concerned about representing their constituents. I know that some of them are very concerned about the implications of this. Unfortunately, their Leader and Deputy Leader have this great ability to change their minds five times in five minutes. It is probably being generous to say that they have minds. But let us be factual and say that only in the last few days the Democrats supported legislation to give the--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen to old knowledge box back here, who would not even know what a chemist shop or therapeutic goods looked like. I go back to the point that patients are being offered a choice by the position that the coalition is taking tonight. Yet the Democrats, only a matter of days ago, were insistent that people in nursing homes had the choice of doctors. By their actions, they are ensuring that people such as me do not have the choice of going into health food shops and getting information to buy the drugs without additional cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately they have even bluffed some of the people from the Nutritional Foods Association of Australia, who sent in information to say that it had spoken to Jenny Macleod of Senator John Coulter's office in the last hour. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the letter to be incorporated in Hansard, which will flag an Amendment Bill being proposed for the Autumn session is as follows. </PARA>
<PARA>She encloses the infamous letter that only appeared tonight on my desk just after 8 o'clock. The fact is that even the Nutritional Foods Association has been bluffed into believing that the Government and the Democrats will do what they say. We know that that is very unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Government's position on this. The other day, Senator West sent back all the information that the therapeutic goods people had sent her. In a most abusive letter she said that she had `flushed their products down the toilet where they deserved to be put'. If that is the Government's attitude, that is very sad. Many of us are given a contrary point of view to the position that we take but we do not have to abuse constituents the way that Senator West has obviously done. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is a prime example of rapacious regulatory government at work. This Government is so determined to shackle the therapeutic goods industry that in the dying stages of this parliamentary session it is trying to force through these regulations with less debate than they deserve. This is just another addition to the business regulations that have been estimated to cost Australia between $34m and $46m a year. Do the Democrats bother about that? No, they do not. Do the Democrats bother about the 150 jobs in one company that will be done away with because of their support of these regulations? No, they could not care less. Once again, this is an effective denial of consumer freedom of choice when products become more expensive or simply unavailable when it is no longer profitable to manufacture them. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor governments do not pay much heed to the old saying, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Oh no, they want to fix everything, regardless of whether it is needed. Of course, that is also the case unless they are defending their own vested interests. Such vested interests do not extend to the field of private enterprise, where the possibility of any type of marginal abuse always becomes the excuse for blanket regulation that restricts business or professions. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the lack of availability of these products in the future because of the restrictions that will be placed on them, what really concerns me are the number of enterprises that will go out of business and the number of employees who will lose their jobs. Neither the Government nor the Australian Democrats-and Senator Powell in particular-seem to care about that. Senator Coulter did not even make any reference to the number of jobs that will be done away with, nor did the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that is a fact of life. Only last week 10,000 people went onto the unemployment queues. Does that matter? No, it does not matter in the slightest. The mere fact is that more people will go onto unemployment queues because of these regulations which will be carried tonight. In selling this regulatory proposal, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has admitted, under his list of the 10 common questions, that it will make alternative health products more expensive. Does he care that they will be more expensive? No, he does not. He glibly tells consumers that a major manufacturer has estimated that prices would not increase by more than 4c per item. Pull the other leg, because it defies commonsense to suggest that the fees being proposed will raise prices by only a couple of per cent. The Minister tries to reassure consumers that it will not make alternative health products harder to get. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . some manufacturers who are making poor quality products may pull out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA>What a convenient excuse! It is simply an excuse, one that Senator Powell wants to go along with. I cannot understand why Senator Powell is so silly-mind you, I can and I should; I have known her long enough-to be able to accept that. The fact of the matter is that the Democrats are making sure that these regulations will force exporters to satisfy not only overseas codes of practice but also the draconian Australian code. Is that not a real boost to exports? Manufacturing for the home market, the local industry, must still compete against imported products that are exempt from compliance with the Australian manufacturing practice. No wonder a major Australian manufacturing company, R.P. Scherer Pty Ltd, has decided that these regulations will make a proposed $25m factory uncompetitive and, therefore, it has cancelled its plans with 150 jobs and $10m in exports, as I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should consider that this new regulatory monster will simply duplicate State legislation. I am very sorry that the time for this debate has been restricted so severely and that we have not had an opportunity to debate the matter thoroughly. I certainly hope and pray that there will be those senators in the Australian Democrats who are prepared to exercise a conscience vote and to make sure that these regulations are defeated. </PARA>

<PARA> I would like to have gone into a number of aspects of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations as they relate to the Therapeutic Goods Committee, the Therapeutic Devices Evaluation Committee and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. I point out that the membership of those committees is almost exclusively made up of scientific and technical experts. Therefore, it is important for the public to know that, if approval is eventually given to particular pharmaceuticals or devices, it is not a decision that means that the goods, the pharmaceuticals or the devices are appropriate in the fullest sense of that word. In regard to applications for the testing of therapeutic goods, pharmaceuticals, devices, et cetera, to my mind there should be an examination of the appropriateness of those devices, goods, pharmaceuticals and drugs prior to their being evaluated. We have been told tonight that some amendments are being proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened carefully to the debate. We have been informed that amendments are likely to come forward some time in the new year. I am interested to hear that because, in my view, there are a number of weaknesses in these measures. I will be interested to see those amendments. Whilst the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the regulations were an attempt to streamline the process of evaluation and approval, it is very important that Australia maintains its standards and the respect it has in regard to therapeutic goods, devices and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I believe that a worthwhile argument has been advanced by people from the natural health area. Although I have not spoken to anybody, I have read some of the submissions that have come forward. I have listened to the debate, to Senator Coulter, to Senator Patterson and to Senator Knowles and I carefully listened to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) first of all. I believe that it would be appropriate for the Senate to await the amendments prior to giving approval to the regulations. It is my intention at this stage to vote against these measures tonight. I re-emphasise that I do not believe Australia should give away its status in the world as a country which is looked at as having very stringent requirements for drug evaluation and for therapeutic device evaluation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall make a few brief remarks on this matter. Lobbying to me on this subject began more than a year ago before I was in this place, before I nominated for election. That was because people in Tasmania who were concerned about the Government's proposed therapeutic goods legislation knew that I was able to contact the Australian Democrats Senator John Coulter, who had decades of experience in these matters and whom they trusted as being capable of evaluating the Government's proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he is. Senator Coulter's evaluation led to his rejection of the first set of regulations. Since then, continued and comprehensive consultation has guided all of us through to a set of regulations which are vastly improved on those that were first offered. The responsible participants in this industry want regulations which will benefit them just as much as the regulations that have benefited other paramedical professions and have recently been sought by those professions and they have benefited from them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on these very important Therapeutic Goods Regulations which, as I say, have come before the chamber because of a consideration 12 months ago that they could be so complex and important that they require the affirmative vote of both Houses of the Parliament, which is rather an unusual way for the chambers to deal with regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it has led to the sort of pressure which has brought about very extensive and exhaustive consultations. Those consultations have, of course, principally been with those involved in, and affected by, the impact of those regulations. There have also been, I am advised, considerable discussions at the political level. If the Australian Democrats had taken advantage of the opportunity over the last 12 months in a more vigorous and constructive way than the Opposition has, that is to their credit. I believe Senator Coulter has taken advantage of that period in order have those sorts of consultations which have had the constructive results which he was able to outline to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Dr Bob Woods put out the statement that he would not support these regulations as early as 4 December. I am advised that officials actually met with Dr Bob Woods to give him a full briefing on the regulations on 5 December but, obviously, he had already made up his mind despite the fact that there has been that process of briefing and consultation with him. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not talking about fringe groups. What we are talking about is the consumers of these therapeutic products in Australia who deserve to be given the sort of protection in the marketplace. Even the most extreme laissez faire capitalists in our society now recognise that minimum regulations are quite proper and ordinary in the marketplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, in the last few days I have been considering the question of full ingredient disclosure on the labels of cosmetic products. It is very important for people out in the marketplace who are dealing with cosmetics to know whether a particular ingredient is present in a cosmetic which might affect them by giving them a skin irritation, an allergy or whatever. There are certain minimum requirements as to standards and as to disclosure for consumers which are fundamental to the operation of a fair marketplace. I believe that these Therapeutic Goods Regulations fall into that category. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had almost concluded my speech. I am glad that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) is now here to take part in this debate. I had been explaining the amendments we were looking at. I have been told in the break that I am naive, too trusting and I do not quite understand how things work. I was giving the Minister credit for, in my opinion, trying to do something about waterfront reform. I had said that he had failed miserably whilst I thought that he had tried to do the right thing. I stand to be corrected on that. I invite the Minister to do something about the very serious problem that exists in Cairns at the moment-a problem which can have enormous and devastating repercussions for the people of the Cairns area. With that, I conclude my remarks on the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight two significant Bills, both vital to the waterfront industry and to our export industry, have come back to the chamber. Honourable members and senators on all sides of politics agree that a flourishing export trade would solve many of the economic ills besetting Australia today. The parlous state of the waterfront has long caused our manufacturers to avoid exporting their products and has jeopardised growth and employment prospects elsewhere in the economy. The Government's proposed waterfront reforms will hopefully lead to increased overseas trade and therefore increased prosperity for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats unequivocally support waterfront reform and the fundamental recommendations and plans of the Inter-State Commission, but we do not agree these should be embraced at breakneck speed. Everyone agrees that the waterfront has been inefficient, with delays and questionable work practices by some employees for decades-decades, I might point out, under a Liberal Government which did nothing whatsoever to rectify the situation. To attempt to rush headlong into reform is dangerous. It is too easy to make mistakes which could be both damaging and difficult to redress. Bringing change to work practices that have been entrenched for 100 years poses great challenges, not the least of which is the avoidance of serious disruption to the nation's trade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that the Australian Democrats do not see waterfront reform as a matter of urgency or importance. We do, but we differ about the method and strategy. We are against confrontation and aggression and firmly for consultation and agreement. The report issued by the Inter-State Commission in March 1989 concentrated on a strategy to improve the industry rather than to examine its deficiencies in depth-a wise move, as we could still be back at square one. In its response on 1 June 1989 the Government accepted the majority of the Inter-State Commission's recommendations in its waterfront industry plan and emphasised three main recommendations. The first was a change in employment from a pooled arrangement to enterprise-based employment. Surely that is acceptable to the Opposition? Secondly, it recommended measures to improve the efficiency of port authorities. I would imagine that is acceptable to all Australians. Thirdly, it recommended measures to create a more competitive waterfront environment-once again, surely acceptable to all sides of this chamber. The Australian Democrats fully support these three recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In September last year the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) was set up to implement the Government's reform agenda, and recently Senator Collins announced that the first in-principle agreement had been agreed to. Although progress to date has been slow, things are starting to happen. One of the fundamental structural problems cited by the Commission is that of an ageing work force. Tas Bull, the leader of the Waterside Workers Federation, admits that at least 33 per cent of his members are over 55 and that there has been no recruitment in Sydney or Melbourne since 1975, no recruitment in Adelaide for 22 years and only 10 recruitments in Hobart since 1956. In other words, it is an ageing, entrenched and inherently inflexible work force. </PARA>
<PARA> To address this problem, the Government has put in place a generous redundancy plan, which I believe is in the vicinity of 70 per cent of an employee's base rate earnings from the time of retrenchment to retirement at 65. Employers and the Government will each contribute $154m each to finance this plan. By this plan the Government hopes to reduce the numbers by 3,000 employees in the upper age bracket and to replace them with 1,000 younger people who will be unfamiliar with the old questionable ways and hopefully more flexible and willing to accept new approaches. To date approximately 277 gangway watchmen have been paid out under the Government's special retirement and redundancy plan but, until enterprise agreements have been implemented, no waterfront workers have been able to receive their redundancy payment. It is no use the Opposition thumping the drum about delays. If the infrastructures were not in place, nothing could happen. However, now things are beginning to move. To blame stevedoring labour entirely for the woes that beset our waterfront is simply wrong. The attitudes and work practices of the waterfront in the past also reflect the attitude of waterfront management. This fact has been acknowledged in some of the contributions made to the Commission prior to its bringing down its excellent report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats argue that to confront the problems of labour without also addressing the problems of management is to deal with only half the problem. The Inter-State Commission found that only four companies performed almost all stevedoring work. There were strong barriers of costs and arrangements to any expansion or competition and there were strong links between shippers and stevedoring companies to prevent new companies entering the market. The main cost barriers included high relative labour costs, relative levies and current labour practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about the need for genuine competition in the workplace. Indeed Mr Sharp, the honourable member for Gilmore, recently said in the other place that genuine competition on the Australian waterfront is the `first and foremost requirement'. They are excellent sentiments, but he was referring to waterfront workers. There was never a mention about waterfront management, nor did he say a word about competition across the board-that is, both workers and waterfront enterprises. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) spoke of waterfront bans on ships. The banned ships were rust buckets, unfit to take to sea, yet employers expected their workers to sail in them. There have been many faults on both sides but it is no use attending to only half the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> Before closing I would like to comment on the amendment moved by the Opposition in the other place. It concerns clause 7 of the Bill to insert a new section 9a into the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977. The proposed section allows the Minister to give notification in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette that the levy ceases to be payable in respect of waterside workers who are not employed on a weekly hiring basis. Incidentally, after this cross-subsidy ends the permanent ports will no longer subsidise the non-permanent ports, which are currently in deficit to the tune of $6.4m. A finishing date is not to be notified in respect of a port unless all employers at the port have changed their employment arrangements in accordance with the reform agreement. In other words, the date cannot be notified in the Gazette until all arrangements have been finalised. If a finishing date were specified, there would be the inherent danger that all arrangements may not be completed by that date, necessitating mistake-fraught haste or costly changes in legislation to redress these. The in-principle agreement has specific dates and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority has a finite life, which should be sufficient to ensure that adequate progress is made. The Australian Democrats therefore do not support the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> With these two amendment Bills the Government is addressing the problem of labour, but it has yet to address the problems of management. Management has been able to escape the effects of the general inefficiencies and increased costs inherent in the waterfront industry because of its monopoly powers and the general lack of potential competitors, and has been able to pass its costs on to those using the ports and ultimately the consumers of imports and exports. The Australian Democrats will never advocate rampant competition as the answer to economic ills, but we also do not advocate complete monopolies. We look forward to further legislation which will lead to more effective management by stevedoring companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill are part of the reform process of the various waterside ports in Australia. That reform process is going on apace and I think there is much to be said for the way in which the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, has gone about his work. But he has had much help in that. To use the Port of Melbourne as an example, the Minister would agree that the President of the Victorian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, Mr Jim Beggs, the Secretary, Mr Claude Cumberlidge and other officers such as Archie Arceri have contributed much to the reform process which is progressing rapidly under the present Ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly shall, and with no disrespect to you, Mr Acting Deputy President. What has happened under this Minister and those people in the Melbourne wharf is that they are about to establish four enterprise-based agreements with the stevedoring companies in that port. There are five but Conaust Ltd has not found it possible to enter into an enterprise-based agreement. The Industrial Relations Commission has sent it away to discuss the issues with the union and to have an answer by 15 January.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reforms have taken place in three main areas. First of all, there has been a restructuring of the industry through the enterprise-based agreement mechanism. There has been a restructuring of 17 awards into one, and there has been a bringing together into one organisation of 25 or 26 unions that are now on the waterfront. But when this process has been completed-and it is expected to be completed fairly shortly-they will become one union. This is a lot of reform to have taken place within a year. It is in line with a long term process of reform on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> When Charlie Fitzgibbon, a very famous man not only on the waterfront but also in Australian history, was the secretary in 1961, there were about 27,500 waterside workers in Australia. That number has now been reduced to about 5,000, including people who were not originally in the waterside workers union such as clerks, shipwrights and painters and dockers. The Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, quite a famous union, is about to be absorbed into the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. </PARA>

I think that is to his credit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a lot of criticism, and I see Senator Crane is in the chamber. He is a man who has struggled mightily for the farming community of Australia over the years. He would be pleased to know that there is a relationship in Melbourne, through the waterside workers down there, led by Mr Beggs, whereby when farmers have problems with the transport of their stock to the wharves and overseas-whether that problem arises through actions by the waterside workers themselves or through others-they are able to ring the executive of the waterside workers in Melbourne and that executive, led by Mr Beggs and Mr Cumberlidge, will see that the problem is solved. I think that this sort of thing, which has been going on for some years now, ought to be proclaimed more and more in this chamber when there is so much criticism of unionists and the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the wharf in Melbourne is an example of what can be done if a proper reform progress is pursued in the right way. I finish as I commenced by congratulating the Minister. There was some suggestion today that he ought to resign because he has not fulfilled his promise of having reform progressed on the waterfront within a particular period. I think that the amount of work he has already done on that more than justifies his staying. The Minister has been greatly helped in that by the people I have already named as the executive of the port of Melbourne. That has been borne out by the appreciation of people such as those that Senator Crane has represented in the past, and no doubt still represents, and the sorts of things that they now say about the way the waterside workers of Melbourne have acted over the years and how sensibly and progressively they have faced up to the reform and have brought it about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding the efforts of Senator Cooney over the last few minutes to talk up the success of the Government on waterfront reform, the sad fact remains that the legislation we are debating this evening is nothing more than an attempt by this Government to cover up the fact that it has failed to achieve any significant structural reform of the waterfront, or indeed any other aspect of reform in our economy. Despite years of inquiries and reports and the establishment of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, the Government is no nearer completing the reform, which even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself has admitted needs to be achieved, than when it started. Although the Opposition is not opposing the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 or the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990, the point must be made that this legislation is only one very small part of what needs to be done in the whole process of waterfront reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year the Inter-State Commission brought out a report on waterfront reform which reinforced the evidence of a number of earlier inquiries-that is, massive reform of the waterfront, and the whole transport industry in general, is a matter of utmost urgency for the survival of the Australian economy. Of course, the Government has since done away with the Inter-State Commission, presumably because it did not like what the Commission had to say. </PARA>
<PARA> The report laid down a detailed plan of action which, despite its shortcomings, pointed the way toward a more efficient and internationally competitive waterfront. This plan was more than generous to waterside workers whose rorts and work practices have for decades ripped off their fellow Australians. Yet what has the Government done so far? It has introduced this piece of legislation which is far from being a significant step towards eliminating the restrictive work practices, industrial disputes and high unit costs on our waterfront. This legislation only ensures that waterside workers retrenched under the rejuvenation of the work force scheme receive their more than generous redundancy packages. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the Government, as it has done over the last year or so, will continue to attempt to camouflage its lack of action. The Government will point out that it aims to achieve a 30 per cent increase in productivity over the next three years by cutting out overmanning, pensioning off waterside workers over 55 and introducing industry-based employment rather than pooled employment. This does not sound too bad as a goal when we consider that productivity on the waterfront in Australia has been going backwards for 50 or 60 years. Any sort of improvement has to be good. But when we look at how this goal compares with reforms in other countries, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the level of productivity increase that the Government is seeking really starts to look like a bad joke. New Zealand managed to achieve a 100 per cent increase in productivity in just one year and it is now looking for even greater far-reaching improvements. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly it matters where we start from, but the point needs to be reinforced that Australia also starts from a very low base, and to aim at about a 30 per cent increase simply is not good enough. New Zealand's waterfront costs now run at about 60 per cent below ours, which simply reinforces the point I make, and it is an indication of how woeful this Government's productivity aims really are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> New Zealand has managed to cut overall stevedoring costs by between 20 and 40 per cent and in some cases by as much as 66 per cent. The number of waterside workers has dropped by as much as 50 per cent which, combined with improvements in work practices, has produced a saving of up to $10,000 per ship per call for roll-on, roll-off vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in the United Kingdom, which had a similar, if not worse, situation on its waterfront than Australia's, it achieved a 65 per cent productivity increase in one year. The former director of the United Kingdom National Association of Port Employers, Mr Nicholas Finney, said in an address while visiting Australia recently that the United Kingdom terminal operators have achieved productivity improvements of between 25 and 400 per cent in all operations and they have improved ship turnarounds by up to 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government should look at all aspects of micro-economic reform undertaken by both the British and New Zealand governments. It then might start to get an idea as to how it should be done. In New Zealand it was done essentially by decentralisation of employment and wage fixing on the waterfronts and the corporatisation of all its ports. The New Zealand Government, in one fell swoop, stimulated a drive for improved efficiency by introducing a profit motive among port authorities and did away with pooled employment arrangements-the bane of waterfront employment in Australia and elsewhere-introducing legislation under which individual employers employed their own workers. </PARA>
<PARA> In Britain the introduction of real competition between the ports was the key to breaking the stranglehold which the waterside unions had on their dockfront. British ports had suffered under the same rorts and restrictive work practices that we still have here. The unions dominated and controlled every aspect of employment of dock workers with a national dock labour scheme. It was only when some smaller, privately owned ports outside the labour scheme began to take more and more of the sea cargo in Britain that employers began to take a different attitude towards the unions. A long campaign to change public attitudes was undertaken, and eventually legislation was introduced to do away with the nationalised labour scheme. It was the determination of the Government and the employers to break the damaging power of the unions which eventually put the British waterside industry back on the road to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> Our productivity and unit costs on the waterfront are already way behind those of our international trading competitors. We have to improve at a much faster rate than anyone else just to tread water. On several previous occasions in debates on the waterfront I have given the Senate facts and figures as evidence of our abysmal record on the waterfront and with regard to shipping costs and productivity output compared to other nations. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were not nonsense, Minister, they were right on the ball. Let me repeat that the Australian waterfront is only 50 per cent as productive as waterfronts in Europe and only 40 per cent as productive as waterfronts in Asia. It is obvious, therefore, that a 30 per cent increase in our productivity over three years will not make much headway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Inter-state Commission report estimated that reform of our whole transport system, including roads, railways, aviation, shipping and the waterfront, would boost gross domestic product by some $9 billion per annum. A mere 20 per cent improvement in productivity on the waterfront would improve gross domestic product by $1,100m per annum. Yet the only tangible piece of reform that this Government is putting into place is an agreement with the unions and employers as to how much they will pay the retiring wharfies-and a very generous payment it is too. A 55-year-old wharf labourer with 25 years' experience, who would probably be retiring soon anyway, will receive 247 weeks' pay. That is not bad-nearly five years' pay. That is a fine nest egg to retire on, if one can get it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 3,000 retiring wharfies will get an average of $100,000 each in redundancy payments, a total of $300m-$150m of which comes out of the taxpayer's pocket with the other $150m being paid by industry, which will be passed on to the customers. Most significant among these customers are Australia's farmers, who simply cannot afford to continue carrying the additional expense, especially in the circumstance of the present rural crisis, which is utterly destroying their livelihoods. How many farmers who will have to walk off their properties because the source of their livelihood has been destroyed by this Government's failed economic management would like to walk away with $100,000 in their pockets? But there is no such handout for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet while all this largesse for waterside workers is being signed, sealed and delivered, the Government has not come up with any significant agreements to change work practices. We cannot afford one without the other. What guarantees do we have that improvements to work practices will ever be forthcoming once the redundancy payments have been made? No wonder the Government has been able to expend only $9.3m of the $40m allocated for waterfront reform in the 1989-90 Budget. I understand that that is because so far no-one has actually taken up the golden handshakes and that, on the contrary, the size of the work force on the waterfront has increased by some 200 or so. Therefore, less than a quarter of the amount it had budgeted for has been spent. That is a clear indication of its failure to keep pace even with its own meagre plans for reform. That Budget allocation in 1989-90 was to ensure that the Waterside Industry Reform Authority would be able to complete its reform program by July 1992. It is now budgeted to continue into 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejected in the House of Representatives an Opposition amendment that would have put a time limit on its reforms-a three-year time limit which the Government originally imposed on itself, but which it has now blithely abandoned. Coupled with the Government's failure to keep up to its schedule of reforms in the shipping industry, this woeful performance can only cast serious doubts on the Government's ability to complete even the simplest plans. Next year I am expecting to see a new Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support in office because the incumbent Senator Collins promised to resign if he did not deliver significant reform in the shipping and waterfront industry within 12 months. On the Government's record so far, he has not a hope of doing so and there is very little time for him left to achieve that. We look forward to his resignation with some anticipation. </PARA>
<PARA> Time in this debate is limited, so I shall not put some of the details that I would have put to the Senate if we had had more time. I conclude by saying that this Government has admitted that shipping and waterfront reform is a vital element in any micro-economic reform, but it refuses to bite the bullet and do something productive about it. The Government continues to be more interested in keeping the unions happy than it is in fixing up the economic mess that it has created. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, when it comes to waterfront reform, this Government has been out on one long smoko because it is scared shipless by the union power of the wharfies, like the one called `Judge' because he is always sitting on a case. The fact is that this Government lacks the political will to recognise that we do not have the luxury of a decade for discussion and negotiation to work out what should be done. By that time, the opportunities will have evaporated and the International Monetary Fund will be determining our future. To achieve the changes that are necessary, this country desperately needs a coalition government which has the policies, the drive and the guts to implement them. The coalition is committed to change and our policies will bring about real reforms-reforms which, it is estimated, will bring about $850m in annual savings in waterfront costs. </PARA>

<PARA> Waterfront reform is the key to micro-economic reform. One has to conclude that what has happened is a shameful era in Australia's history. It has impeded our export performance enormously.

The second one was the report of the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping. The third one was an importer-exporter panel chaired by Ivan Deveson. The fourth one was the Stevedoring Industry Review Committee chaired by Sir John Moore. The fifth one was the Shipping Reform Task Force chaired by Ivan Deveson, and the next one was the culmination of these in the Inter-State Commission Waterfront Investigation report released in April 1989. Now, we have the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) with the supposed job of putting them in place. It is quite incredible, when we see all the inquiries and the report process, that we have actually had six inquiries in that time and the Government is now attempting to do something very minimal on the whole waterfront. I do not think that does the Government any good, and in my view it does not reflect a genuine effort to reform the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the reasons why it has to be reformed. We only have to look at the figures. In Asia approximately 60 containers per hour are moved; in Europe, approximately 35; on a good day in Adelaide, 20; and most of the other ports around Australia are significantly less than that. In Asian countries ships are turned around in 24 to 36 hours; in Australia they take between 8 and 14 days. In terms of the situation we have in front of us, it is absolutely crucial that we do more than has put in front of us now. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the WIRA situation. It is my view that what has been put in place in terms of WIRA is really a cop out of what is required. The principal points of the WIRA agreement are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Negotiate and include the draft Stevedoring Industry Award 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) determine Industry and enterprise based training arrangements to be offered to enable company standards to be met;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) process offers for early retirement to enable surplus watchmen to leave the Industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) complete the recruitment and training of 200 new employees;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) employers shall advise the Authority of their plans to change to enterprise employment;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) enter into negotiation of enterprise or port agreements;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) process offers for the progressive removal of 500 employees;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) develop enterprise/port training programs and establishment of industry training facilities;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) resolve issues related to intermediate/small ports; and</PARA>
<PARA> (j) resolve issues related to grain handling ports. </PARA>
<PARA>None of these are particularly momentous or require a lot of effort. Yet there has only been progress made on three of them-(c), (d) and (e). </PARA>
<PARA> I will go a bit further and highlight the lack of activity on the waterfront and where Australia finds itself today. I refer particularly to Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd and Nissan Motor Manufacturing Co (Australia) Ltd, which are now contracting to have their motor cars shifted to New Zealand by Russian air cargo. These companies are going to achieve out of that a $350 saving per car and time. All one can conclude from that is that Ivan Deveson has obviously given up. That is an absolute disgrace and it is a reflection on the lack of activity and reform in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want also, as Senator Chapman did, to raise the issue of redundancy payouts. There is no question in anybody's language that they are generous in the extreme. They will work out somewhere in the order of $100,000 per employee who takes redundancy or, at the top level, payouts of up to $250,000. Now we have the situation where these redundancy payouts are now being offered without any productivity gains in return. I find that absolutely incredible when one looks at the amounts of money involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that I made at the start and that is what waterfront reform is all about is whether or not Australia is going to become internationally competitive. The pace at which we have moved in this particular area has been abysmal, and it is not creating a situation where we are catching up to the rest of the world. Whether it be on a percentage basis or whatever measure one wants to place on it, the facts are that the other countries around the world that we compete with, particularly New Zealand, Great Britain, and those in Asia and America, are beating the pants off us when it comes to our performance on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront is the key to micro-economic reform in this country. We must start where the bottleneck occurs. We can have all the reforms in the other areas but if the product is going to be held up or interfered with at the point where it leaves the country, all the virtues and advantages that have been gained in the other areas are lost. They just slip down the drain. I emphasise that a little bit is better than nothing but it brings little credit to this Government and the Minister, in particular, that we have a Bill before us which has had so much noise made about it and which really is going to achieve so little. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have followed this debate very closely, even though I was not in the Chamber. I listened to every speaker over the monitor and compiled pages of corrections to the utter nonsense that has been delivered by the majority of the Opposition speakers in this debate. But, as a lot of it was repeated by Senator Chapman, I will just confine myself to give the flavour of some of the nonsense that has been perpetuated by the Opposition in this debate and principally what Senator Chapman said. When that is combined with the rubbish that was delivered in the House of Representatives, particularly by the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), it does really provide a pile of paper so deep that it would take an hour and a half, not 10 minutes, to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just turn to some of the things that were said by Senator Chapman. He repeated once again the complete furphy, which has been repeated by at least 10 Opposition speakers in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, that the Government has said that it has set a target of 30 per cent for productivity increases on the waterfront. The Government did not say anything of the sort. What the Government did say and I will quote from the then Minister, Mr Willis, who said that the agreement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . provides the framework for an increase in labour productivity of around 30 per cent over the next three years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government expects substantial additional productivity improvements from the introduction of enterprise employment, award restructuring and the phasing out of cross-subsidisation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>of stevedoring labour costs between the ports. These Bills-and Senator Chapman, of course, also totally misunderstood what they were about-underpin the need for that last part of the Government's undertakings to be delivered. They are important and essential legislation to the waterfront reform process.</PARA>
<PARA> To give an indication as to why the Opposition should in fact stop running this nonsense about 30 per cent productivity across the board being set as the target, one has to go no further than one major employer of waterfront labour in Australia, and that is National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, and what it has tangibly demonstrated about its confidence in the waterfront reform program. No company as efficient and as professional as National Terminals, in its right mind, would invest the sums of new capital in new investment in waterfront infrastructure if it did not have absolute confidence in what was finally going to be the substantial outcome of this process. </PARA>
<PARA> A month or two ago, National Terminals announced that it is about to embark on a $60m infrastructure upgrade of its port facilities in Sydney, of which $40m will be spent by the end of next year. No company engaged in waterfront would engage in that kind of capital investment, particularly considering the current downturn of trade, if it was not confident of achieving substantial productivity gains from the waterfront process. National Terminals knows that it can have confidence in getting those gains. After months of very detailed and tedious negotiation with the unions involved, National Terminals has substantially completed what will be, I think, the first enterprise agreement-and a major enterprise agreement at that-in this country after half a century of the existing work practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not quite know why that is relevant. It makes no difference at all. The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority will determine at the end of the day, with no pressure from me, whether agreements delivered in terms of these arrangements meet the Government's productivity targets. Whether Australian National Lines owns or has a significant participation in National Terminals is hardly relevant to the fact that this enterprising company has committed $60m to new investment in the very important container port of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again Senator Chapman used-and I think he made a comprehensive fool of himself in his subsequent statements-comparisons between Australia and New Zealand. He said that it did not matter from what base one started in terms of comparing percentage increases. I must say that this would be an interesting piece of logic to apply in future debates on productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the gains that have been made in New Zealand ports and on the New Zealand waterfront. We wish the new New Zealand Government well in continuing, as I have no doubt it will, the substantial reforms that were put in place by the then Labour Government of New Zealand. But in terms of making a valid comparison, we cannot ignore the fact, as unsatisfactory as it is, that the current level of productivity in Australia is running at about 4,000 tonnes of cargo per man per year. If we are to make a percentage comparison, it is essential that we compare starting points. New Zealand started in terms of that 100 per cent increase from a base of 2,600 tonnes of cargo per man per year-an abysmal record, even by the current unsatisfactory standard that exists in Australia. Of course, no member of the Opposition has bothered to put that on the public record. I do so now. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something with considerable conviction. I will tell the Senate this in respect of Senator Chapman's criticisms-and we have heard many from the Opposition-about the redundancy payouts for wharfies who have spent 40-odd years on the wharves: I will listen to complaints. It is a generous package-deliberately generous. The package was in fact set not by the Government but on the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission that carried out the substantive investigation and report on which this entire reform process is based. We adopted its recommendation on redundancy to encourage this process without industrial disputation and to provide a fair deal for people we are asking to voluntarily put their hands up and leave the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I will listen to criticism of this package. I will listen to criticism from Inghams chicken pluckers or hospital cleaners. But there is one group of workers in this country that I will not even listen to in terms of criticism of that package and that is from politicians, especially Federal politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that in terms of stresses, strains and particularly disabilities of our profession, I do not downgrade our superannuation situation. I just put it on the record as a matter of fact that if it is not the most generous scheme for workers in Australia, it is among the most generous. Not surprisingly, I have compared the two schemes because of the continuous criticism from Opposition Federal politicians about the redundancy payments. I can tell the Senate without going into actual detail that in rough terms a superannuation package, on equivalent basis of service, paid out to a member of the Senate such as Senator Chapman is about twice as generous as the redundancy packages that will be paid out to waterside workers. So that is one species of worker that I will simply not even listen to that sort of criticism from because it is hypocritical-and I might add, substantially so. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not satisfied with the pace of progress on the Australian waterfront. That is no great state secret. I must have said it at least half a dozen times in the last month at public or semi-public occasions, the last one of which was the annual dinner of the bulk commodities group in Melbourne. I would like to see the pace of change faster than it is. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I would like to point out a number of facts-facts that have been confirmed by Opposition speakers. We are talking about radically changing work practices on the waterfront that have existed for half a century. In all of the years that these inefficiencies were perpetuated under coalition governments, not one single thing was done to address the problem. There was not a scrap of initiative from former conservative governments to change the system. Even though the arrangements are 50 years old, this is the first Government that has attempted to make this difficult change. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear only the employers' side from the other side of the House. This is even though the users, who are the biggest critics of the system, heap as much or more blame on the employers as they do the employees. But we never hear that from the Opposition. There is never an ounce of criticism of the employers from the Opposition. This approach has been perpetuated here again today. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean read out very accurate statistics on the lack of recruitment on the waterfront and the average age of the work force. Workers on the waterfront who went into the industry straight out of school at the age of 15 or 16 years are now in their late 50s or early 60s and close to retirement. They have known no other form of employment or set of conditions for their entire working lives. A little fat politician from the Northern Territory turns up on the wharves and says, `Right oh boys, everybody out of the pool in six months'. That is the attitude that is being promoted opposite-we come in with a big stick, we do not pay anybody anything, we belt them over the head with a legislative club and we stand back and wait for the devil take the hindmost. That is the prescription put by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government has embarked directly, in line with the recommendations of what I say and what I have said before is an excellent piece of work by the Inter-State Commission, on a program that will result in substantial productivity improvements on the Australian waterfront without any substantial losses to this country from serious industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Progress has been made. We are now very close to consummating our first major enterprise agreement. I knew at the start of this process-which is the reason I have quite openly expressed my dissatisfaction in the Senate tonight-that right now would be the most difficult time. I knew that all of the easy issues were going to be negotiated in the first six months and that the hard ones, in terms of jumping off the cliff, making this radical change, putting names on an enterprise agreement for the first time in half a century and breaking down the system of national employment, were going to be very difficult towards the end of the game. Despite that and despite my dissatisfaction about the pace of progress, I know that very shortly we are going to achieve a substantial breakthrough in this process and get some enterprise agreements up in the major ports of Sydney and Melbourne. Once that happens, the process will be accelerated and other developments and progress will rapidly follow. </PARA>
<PARA> The prescription the Government has offered and is asking the Senate to support tonight in these essential Bills to underpin this package is the only way to sensibly approach reform on the Australian waterfront. The prescription being offered by the Opposition would be one of absolute industrial and financial disaster for this country, were it to be followed. I urge all members of the Senate to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 is an omnibus Bill. It contains a number of uncontroversial matters. I do not propose to detain the Senate for more than a moment. I simply say that, as far as I am concerned, we support the amendments, particularly the Broadcasting Act amendment which will enable the power to approve the text of medical advertisements to be delegated to the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments to the Telecommunications Act allow the Minister to give written directions to Austel regarding the variation and cancellation, in addition to the issuing, of customer equipment permits and cabling licences. It also provides penalties for non-compliance and makes it mandatory for a person selling customer equipment for which there is no permit in force to notify the customer of that fact. Austel will also be empowered to waive application fees for disabled persons and in the cases of registered charities and benevolent institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> These are all minor but constructive amendments. They strengthen the powers of Austel. The track record of that authority to date gives us confidence that it will continue to be vigorous in its scrutiny of the activities of the major players, particularly Telecom Australia. We therefore support these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I confine my remarks on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 to concerns that relate to two of the regulatory bodies within this portfolio. The first is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). This Bill makes provision for the CAA to issue on the spot fines as an alternative to prosecution of operators who contravene a provision of the civil aviation regulations. As we know, at present, under the guidance of its Chairman, Mr Dick Smith, the CAA is considering removing around 200 safety regulations from its books in the name of-using that by now famous phrase- `affordable safety'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have expressed on previous occasions, the Australian Democrats have some serious reservations about this move, particularly coming at the same time as deregulation of our airways when the stresses on the industry as a whole are bound to be greater. Since becoming Australian Democrat spokesman for transport, I have been approached by people of all sectors of the aviation industry expressing their concern at the many changes going on in this industry. I have seen pilots, cabin crew, maintenance engineers, airworthiness surveyors and air traffic controllers as well as some of the professional bodies representing these people. The overwhelming feeling I get from them is that, while many of the changes under way in aviation are necessary and desirable, the rate of change within the industry is cause for great concern. When the experts from the industry are concerned enough to approach us, we have a responsibility to examine closely these proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that there is a chronic staff shortage in the CAA. It has been accepted that this staff shortage is industry-wide and that there are no short term solutions to it. Dick Smith himself has expressed concern over the declining number of people in the air worthiness surveillance field. To quote from an interview he gave to the magazine Australian Aviation in September 1989, Mr Smith said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am personally concerned that we are going into a system of deregulation where we are going to need, I believe, a lot more surveillance and we really don't have the people to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>What we do have though is the deregulation of our airways, a regulatory body significantly underresourced, a staff shortage in the industry as a whole and a number of reports recommending the removal of some of our safety regulations-and all of these factors are coming into play at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> A commonly given reason for removing some of our safety regulations is that they are unique to Australia. In my opinion, since we have what is internationally regarded as an excellent safety record, we should not be the slightest bit disturbed by having unique safety procedures. Indeed, given this record, we should be very sure before undertaking any major changes to it. Some, including the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Chairperson of the CAA, will argue that any airline with a safety cloud over it will see a marked decline in passenger numbers. I am sure that this is correct. But the question I ask is: what has to happen for that airline to get that cloud over it? Until one of the operator's planes actually crashes, how is the public to know which are the safe operators and which are not? This argument seems to suggest a highly reactive, rather than a pro-active, approach to air safety. When it comes to an issue such as safety, we simply cannot afford to be reactive in our approach. High standards must be set and enforced vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent speech on the deregulation of our airways, Senator Collins informed us that there were Australian operators, indeed in general aviation, falsifying maintenance records. I should not be surprised to know that. It is to some of these people that the CAA will be devolving some of its responsibilities. The many meetings I have had with industry representatives have led me to the opinion that if there is in fact no drop in safety from removing a costly regulation, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there must have been a good reason for installing that regulation in the first place and we should be very sure that this reason no longer exists. Let us err on the side of caution when making these decisions and when deciding which duties should be devolved to industry. If we are to remove some regulations, let us ensure that our safety watchdog, the CAA, is funded in such a way as to ensure that it can perform its surveillance duties assiduously. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are specifically concerned with the provision before us today to allow on the spot fines to be issued for breaches of air safety regulations. There needs to be some accountability for regulation breaches. While the Minister may argue that such fines will be issued only for minor breaches, nevertheless they are breaches of our air safety regulations. I understand that regulations as to which records are to be kept in relation to these on the spot fines are currently the subject of discussion between the Department of Transport and Communications and the industry. I also understand, through contact my office has had with the Minister's office, that these regulations are to be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament. I ask the Minister whether he could give a commitment to the Senate that this is the case when he sums up. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the broadcasting provisions of this Bill. We see that the Bill makes some minor amendments to the advertising of medicines in Australia. We have no problem with these amendments. However, we are concerned with the broader problems confronting Australia's broadcasting industry at present. We have two television stations in receivership and the third losing money. Ownership of our print media is the most concentrated amongst developed nations, with an American citizen controlling over 60 per cent of our print media outlets. We have television audience reach limits far in excess of those found in overseas countries and the Cabinet is currently considering raising these limits even higher. Further, under the policy of this Government, through networking agreements, actual audience reach can be much greater. </PARA>
<PARA> With the industry in this state, the Democrats believe that a powerful regulatory body is necessary to protect the public interest. Not only must this body be powerful; it must also be funded in such a way that allows it to adequately oversee the industry. This is particularly true given that broadcasters are basically in the industry for the purpose of making money or perhaps for some perverse form of ego gratification. I think we could ask whether it really is always in the public good. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 14 years, the power of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) has for purely political reasons been eroded by successive governments to the point where it has become, to quote the previous chairperson of the ABT, Deirdre O'Connor, a toothless tiger. We are concerned at the directions in which broadcasting in this country is heading. I just wanted to take a few moments in this debate to put that on the record. As such, having raised a couple of specific concerns, we have no major amendments to propose to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators for their support of this legislation and in response I will simply address the concerns raised by Senator Kernot. So far as the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is concerned, I am not only aware of but share Senator Kernot's concern about expressions that have been made about the rate of change in the airline industry in which the CAA is currently engaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is perfectly understandable; the change is long overdue. The CAA and, indeed, those Federal Opposition members who have a keen interest in this matter have substantially supported the review that has been conducted and is still being conducted of all the regulations that govern the operations of the aviation industry in Australia. Because many of these regulations have simply grown up over decades of use, without any real examination of the actual purpose for which they exist, it has been discovered that many of them serve no useful purpose in a safety sense. They simply represent unnecessary paperwork. That is the root cause of most of the changes that are being made. The primary objective of the CAA has always been, is, and will remain-certainly under this Government-that of safety. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Senator Kernot's concern that in making these changes the organisation should always err on the side of caution so far as safety is concerned, that is a view I hold equally with Senator Kernot and it is a view that is substantially held by the organisation itself. It is said often but can bear repetition one more time that it is no accident that Australia has one of the most enviable safety records in the world in respect of the operation of large aircraft. We are very much on a par with other countries when it comes to the safety of light aircraft. That is simply the nature of the beast: the types of aircraft that are involved in that operation and the people who fly them. </PARA>
<PARA> When a tragedy occurs in terms of a light aircraft colliding with a hard object-usually the ground-and people are killed, the best safety regulations and procedures in the world will not stop situations where it is discovered that the reason for the accident was that the pilot, with several people on board the aircraft, was busy dropping flour bombs out of the aircraft at a height of 20 feet from the ground at the time. Unfortunately that happens in an area of aviation that, by its very nature, is far more difficult to police effectively in terms of individual pilots than is the rigorous supervision that can be given to commercial pilots who fly passengers in Australia. That rigorous examination is given. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of that, I assure Senator Kernot that there will be no devolution of the supervisory role of the CAA in respect of, for example, the day to day administration of engineering checks and so on to the people who in the main actually carry out that work. The reason that it is being done is to enable the CAA to concentrate far more effectively on its supervisory role rather than having to carry out by rote the day to day examination of these issues. It will improve the efficiency of the supervision and not derogate from it. The CAA will be responsible for carrying out close supervision of the operators themselves rather than having to be engaged in the hands-on supervision of the actual maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as Senator Kernot's specific question about regulations is concerned, I can advise Senator Kernot that all regulations to the Federal legislation which govern aviation in this country are subject not only to the scrutiny of this Parliament but also to the disallowance by this chamber. Through that avenue, Senator Kernot will get an opportunity, whenever she desires it, to examine regulations as they are promulgated, passed through the various scrutiny processes of committees that are set up by this chamber to carry out that task and, eventually, scrutinised by this chamber in the final analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> On every occasion that Senator Kernot raises concerns directly with me-and she has done so on a number of occasions-or with people in the aviation industry, every one of those concerns is followed up with the CAA. In respect of one significant matter that the CAA is currently addressing-the new arrangements for the management of Australian air space, which have caused widespread concern within the industry, understandably enough because it is a substantial proposal in terms of change-I have been assured by the CAA that intense consultation within industry is being carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give Senator Kernot and the Senate just one brief example of how that process is alleviating these concerns and achieving some results. I was recently in the city of Mount Isa. I had a very long meeting with a large number of people from the aviation industry in that community, which has a very extensive charter operation, of course, by the nature of the community, and operators within that industry in respect of CAA changes. I agreed that the concerns that were raised warranted a personal Mount Isa visit by technical officers from the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> My office set those arrangements in place immediately. In fact, one of my own staff was to accompany those making that visit. The CAA contacted the people at Mount Isa in the industry in the interim and had preliminary discussions with them. I was subsequently advised by the very people who raised the concerns that the visit from the officers from my office would not be necessary because, as a result of the consultation that had taken place, their concerns had been alleviated. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply advise the Senate and Senator Kernot that that is the process I am addressing. I hold myself open-because of the responsibility that I have, ultimately, as the Minister-to have raised with me directly the concerns of any senator or, indeed, any member of the public about changes that are being brought about in the control of Australian airspace. I can assure all of them that those concerns will be followed up assiduously. In conclusion, I thank the Australian Democrats and the Opposition for their support for the legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; They should have been circulated some time ago. They have got to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), and I apologise that they have not been provided to the Australian Democrats. They certainly should have been. I see they are on my desk, so maybe they are on Senator Kernot's as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any event, I do not propose to take a great deal of time and, in the process, I will explain the purpose of the amendments. In essence, they give effect to the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that Aussat Pty Ltd would be allowed to be a full competitor with Telecom Australia whereas, in fact, what will occur is that it will become substantially able to compete but in the areas of public telephones and first phones, Telecom retains the monopoly, and we seek to remove those impediments. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have any great confidence that the Australian Democrats will be supporting us in that, and that is a matter of regret. I think it is consistent with the approach that the Democrats have taken in this area of blindly supporting Telecom, when the rest of the world has long since shown that competition in this area is absolutely vital if efficiencies for consumers are to be delivered and if, ultimately, we are to have lower prices for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of Aussat has probably been covered many times in this chamber. Suffice it to say that it would have been much better for all concerned if Aussat had been privatised when it was first established in the early 1980s. If that had occurred many of the problems that have beset it since that time would not have arisen. I am sure that most of us are aware of the compromise that resulted from Telecom, in the first instance, bitterly opposing the separate establishment of Aussat and then, ultimately, urging that it be kept in government hands, the ultimate sell-out being that it was then allowed to have 25 per cent of the shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom was wrong on all counts. Certainly, there was no justification in my view for Telecom being allowed to get its hands on Aussat. Indeed, if it had been privatised in the first instance it would have had access to private sector funding. If it had been given room to breathe by the legislation it would have been able to be a viable competitor to Telecom, and to have taken its chance in the marketplace. I have no doubt that we would have seen many more variations on the competitive theme, many more efficiencies forced upon Telecom and lower prices delivered to consumers as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end we achieved the worst of all possible worlds to the point where Aussat has now been a millstone around the neck of governments ever since it was created. It is still an albatross. I think it has gradually dawned on the Government, with its outrageous approach to competition in this area-or should I say, Claytons competition-that Aussat is not saleable. Nonetheless, the Government has persisted with its merger between Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (OTC) when they were clearly the two best potential competitors, as recognised from the outset by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that rational view of the world did not prevail and we have ended up with this nonsense of OTC-clearly the most efficient telecommunications carrier in the country-being forced very unwillingly into bed with the Telecom giant and the alternative, Aussat, as the vehicle for competition. That is not something that any of the potential new entrants would willingly embrace but, of course, they have no choice because of the way the Government has gone about this whole exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a grotesque nonsense and I am sure that everyone outside the Government recognises that. Certainly the industry itself watches with disbelief at the way in which these proposals have been put forward. Nonetheless we are stuck with it. The Government have to buy Aussat and pick up the debt burden if it is to get into the game as a competitor. If that is the case, that is the way it has to be until there is a change of Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome this Bill to the extent that it will facilitate the sale of Aussat, and repeal the parts of the Act which prevent Aussat from becoming a public company, thereby limiting the number of its shareholders. It has been a continuing conflict of interest, in my view, to have had Telecom right at the boardroom table. That has no doubt been a very significant inhibiting factor for any commercial decisions that Aussat might have wanted to make or, indeed, if it had had the funds to do so, had been able to make. </PARA>
<PARA> In the result, I suppose, it has not made a great deal of difference because Aussat has been bound hand and foot from the outset and has not been able to generate sufficient income in order to deliver its services at a competitive price. As a result, it has provided very feeble competition for Telecom. I do not blame the management of Aussat for that situation. I certainly blame the management of Telecom and the Government for allowing that situation to be perpetuated. Nonetheless, we are finally seeing the departure of Telecom from Aussat and that is a good thing as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group of amendments will enable Aussat to undertake a wider range of activities than it is presently entitled to undertake. As I foreshadowed, our amendments would go a stage further. Indeed, as things stand at the moment, if this Government is in office for the next seven years-which of course it will not be-it will not be allowing a third competitor into the game until that time. That is quite unacceptable. It is a nonsense and I am sure everyone else knows it. The experience around the world has been that the more competition we can introduce, the better. The Government is acknowledging that fact, but saying not yet. It is taking a second best approach to this whole exercise by pretending that it is getting into the business of competition. But by delaying the introduction of real competition for a further seven years, it is ensuring that Telecom will retain not only its first mover advantage, but by all sorts of means, will be able to exercise its dominance in the marketplace to such an extent that it will be a very daunting task for a third entrant to come on the scene in 1997. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, we will probably have a de facto duopoly and no doubt that is what the Government has always had in mind. Again, that is a Clayton's form of competition. I do not think it is defensible. It is explicable in terms of factional deals and national conferences; but it is certainly not defensible and it is seen in the industry as a nonsense. The Government will have to live with that. Nonetheless, to the extent that these amendments open up the game we welcome them. It is simply a product of the stranglehold that the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association has over Telecom and the Government that the first phone monopoly continues in existence. I think it is due for review by the end of June next year. I certainly would not want to be holding my breath that the Government will see reason in the matter. The overwhelming likelihood is that it will cave in and allow that outrageous monopoly to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, as far as public pay phones are concerned, again I think we have seen the experience around the world of what can happen. When there is competition in this area, we will find public pay phones springing up all over the place. There may be some that need subsidies and to that extent the Government can advance the subsidies. We would find a telephone on every corner. In shopping malls we would find any number of telephones available at a number of the major areas where the public congregates, such as railway stations, airports and the like. We would see much more healthy competition than we have at the present time. We would have credit cards, which Telecom has been talking about for years and has not yet made generally available, and we would have a much more sensible approach to public telephones. But no, Telecom is going to retain that monopoly and therefore our amendments would enable those limitations to be removed. On 8 November the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) quite inaccurately said that Aussat:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fatuous nonsense and that is why our amendments are designed to give effect to the Prime Minister's own words. The Government will not accept that proposition. I will be interested to hear from the Minister how he can justify the Prime Minister's comments in the first instance but it is quite clear that the Government has no intention of giving effect to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the glimmer of recognition on the part of the Government that it is about time there was competition in the telecommunications industry. It had turned its face against that prospect until the last election, no doubt knowing in its heart of hearts that that was what had to be done but also knowing that a whole series of groupings upon which it relies for support would not wear it. Once the election was out of the way we had a small recognition of reality, but it is a very unsatisfactory outcome. I have no doubt that whilst this Government remains in office, it will continue to provide the most unlevel of playing fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Aussat can become a viable entity in the hands of a new entrant. Whilst it will not welcome having the lead in its saddlebags, constituted by the debt burden, it will at least have the opportunity to go offshore and generally make the best use of satellite services, which is something that Telecom has steadfastly refused to allow in this country, preferring that people waste Telecom's own good time for the introduction of services such as the digital radio concentrator system and, as a result, not maximising efficiencies in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, we will get to the stage where the use of the satellite will be determined simply on the basis of what is the most appropriate technology and what delivers the most efficient and effective service. We certainly have not reached that stage as yet and this Bill goes a small way towards what is undoubtedly a very desirable goal in the longer term; that is, the privatisation of Aussat. We welcome it on that basis. </PARA>

We have to ask who took the decision to put the first generation of Aussat up there. Who, despite advice to the contrary, took the decision to go ahead with the second generation? Who ignored the success of fibre optic cable technology? Who took decisions to give Aussat a domestic charter only? Now, having such a debt, is that not just a backdoor way to find an excuse, particularly within Labor Party ranks, to say, `We have to get rid of this. The only way to do it is to offer the carrot of a licence to compete along with it.'? I believe that this will threaten the integrity of our entire telecommunications system. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that all the creative options for the alternative uses of Aussat have been really explored. I am not denying that action needed to be taken in relation to the finances of Aussat but I do not think that rushing into it in this way was the way to go about it. If the Government's much flaunted reform process is to proceed, then there are several important structural reforms which have to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, if the new Telecom-OTC body-Austcom or whatever it is going to be called-is to have an international competitor, it must have efficient and flexible access to large amounts of capital. In order to achieve this we believe that the possibility of freeing this new entity of Loan Council restrictions needs to be explored. I would not like to see the sort of pincer movement which, I believe, was applied to Australian Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd being used to achieve Mr Keating' s privatisation agenda by default. That is a well-known model now: to starve the government business enterprise of necessary funds and then use its poor performance as a justification for priv- atisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second structural matter we should address is that Austcom's operational management should be clearly separated from government. In comparison to regulatory authorities in overseas countries, Austel is highly dependent on the Government, acting primarily in an advisory role to the Government. I think the Government needs to recognise the distinct role regulation must play in this restructured industry. Thirdly, I believe that the new, merged Telecom-OTC should not be constrained in competition with a new entrant. I am concerned that by attempting to bend over backwards to accommodate the new competitor we are being unfair to the existing body. One example of that is the solution proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that Telecom-OTC will be subjected to Government-imposed price caps. </PARA>
<PARA> A strengthened Austel is essential, not only to protect the interests of residential and business consumers but also the providers of telecommunications equipment and services. We believe that Austel should assume responsibility for all consumer complaints and that mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that all complaints are adequately dealt with. I think it is also imperative that there be representatives from a range of major consumer groups on the Austel board. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn specifically to clause 6 of this Bill, which allows Austel to direct Telecom and OTC to make their networks available for Aussat's use. It will empower Austel, where the carriers are unable to reach agreement, to determine the terms and conditions under which this interconnection is to take place. I believe that the terms and conditions of the interconnect fee will largely determine the relative market shares of the providers. In this regard the Australian Democrats believe that Australia is getting not so much a new competitor as a privileged entrant to be granted access to Telecom's publicly funded, high quality, multi-million dollar network. It is absolutely vital that the interconnect fees determined set in place a competitive framework which encourages the most efficient allocation of resources. It would be inappropriate, for example, to set the fee on the basis of profit levels of the two organisations. This would simply remove any incentive for either party to attempt to run at the height of their efficiency, as this approach ignores the fact that the competing firms' profits will be greatly influenced by their relative efficiencies and technological advancements. To set fees based on profit levels would, I believe, be a disincentive to efficiency and development. </PARA>
<PARA> These are typical problems of a regulated duopoly. To establish an interconnect fee which provides a fair return to Telecom for past and continued funding of infrastructure development and community service obligations while not unfairly disadvantaging the new entrant will require a highly sophisticated technique. Interconnect fees must take account of the enormous investment the Australian public has made and will continue to make in our high quality telecommunications network. That investment is something like $3,500 for every household. There are a variety of means for establishing interconnect fees, and the debate over the appropriate means by which to calculate community service obligations indicates the controversy which is bound to emerge over the crucial issue of interconnect fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats would hope to be involved in discussions that will take place over the next few months on the future of this body, but I regret that in our rush to privatise-and knowing the parlous state of Australian financiers-we are opening up yet another avenue for foreign ownership of something which could be maintained in Australian ownership and which could be operated efficiently by Australians for all Australians. This is part of a complex package. I regret that we do not know the details of the other packages that go to make up this huge telecommunications jigsaw. I regret that we need to look again to foreign investment which will ultimately lead to foreign ownership as the solution to our woes in this industry as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I place on the record the fact that the Australian Democrats cannot support the changes the Government is proposing to the telecommunications industry. These changes are not urgent. Even the Business Council of Australia has said that, if we need to take action on micro- economic reform, it is not urgent to do this in telecommunications and we should start with the waterfront. The Democrats do not support this Bill. I guess I should foreshadow-and it will not surprise Senator Alston to learn this-that we will not support the Opposition's amendments either, because they go even further than this Bill does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no need to canvass at length in this debate the philosophical differences between the parties on this issue, because that is legitimately what they are. In respect of the Australian Democrats' position in particular, there is a substantial philosophical difference between their approach on this issue and those taken by the Government and the Opposition. I will address briefly in response a number of matters raised by Senator Alston in his contribution and to some extent the concerns raised by Senator Kernot in her contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston raised substantive matters that relate very much to the purpose of the amendments which the Opposition will move shortly and which the Government will oppose. Senator Alston queried the first telephone connection, the pay phone situation and the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when announcing this matter in the House of Representatives. As far as the first telephone is concerned, as Senator Alston is well aware, the monopoly which currently exists on that is sunsetted and will expire in June next year. It expires on 30 June 1991--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government does not propose to extend that first telephone monopoly. That is the response to the first matter raised by Senator Alston. The matter of pay phones is under review. The Prime Minister made this clear when he made the announcement. Indeed, when the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), introduced this Bill in the House of Representatives, he made it clear that this was simply the first part of a major package of legislation that will be introduced next year and that it allowed the arrangements to be made to enact the Government's policies in respect of Aussat and to provide Aussat with the capability of providing some immediate competition in the interim. This relates to pay phones because the matter is currently under review by the Government. Its decisions on pay phones and Aussat's capability of providing that particular facility will be incorporated. I add that this is not categorised as a service: in that sense it is hardware at the end of a service. The Government will be considering what to do in respect of pay phones in the major revision to the Telecommunications Act, legislation for which will be introduced into Parliament next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gravamen of Senator Kernot's position is a philosophical one, and one which I understand. The concerns which Senator Kernot has raised in previous debates in this Parliament are shared to a great extent by me and many other members of the Government, which is why, to the disgust of Senator Alston and the Opposition, we are taking the cautious approach to this matter that we are. It is not, I assure Senator Alston, being one of the lobbyists, as I am, and having been one for some years-I have made that clear in the Senate as a senator for the Northern Territory and formerly as a Northern Territory politician-simply a matter as Senator Alston would like to have it, and I understand the reasons why he is saying it, of buckling under to powerful Telecom unions. I can assure Senator Alston of that. This comes about as a result of widespread concern by members of the Caucus, particularly those who represent remote areas, as we do, to the potential results of the open slather approach that has been advocated by the Opposition to opening up competition. I think that the approach that is being adopted by the Government is the sensible course on which to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA> In respect of the matter that Senator Kernot raised about the division between Telecom, the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Ltd and Aussat, principally that kind of division gives both organisations a satellite capacity and, of course, it establishes both organisations with considerable existing domestic and international expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need to delay the Senate any longer with the second reading stage of this debate. I understand that Senator Kernot will be moving for a division on the second reading. In consideration of the hour, I simply conclude by thanking honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(c) the provision of all telecommunications services without restriction.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5 relates to the objectives of Aussat. We accept that the two specified in the Bill are valid and that they will enable Aussat dramatically to expand its business, certainly beyond Australia, which is to be welcomed. But, as we indicated previously during the second reading debate, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) cannot have it both ways. We take the view that the Prime Minister should be held to his word and that, if he wishes to say in one breath that Aussat will be entitled to compete at all levels, this amendment would provide as an object of Aussat that it should be able to provide all telecommunications services without restriction. That principally applies to public pay phones and to the first phone monopoly, but to the extent that there might be any other limitations on its activities they should be removed. The object should specify that henceforth Aussat will be a full and complete alternative carrier to Telecom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be brief. The Government, as I indicated earlier, will be opposing this and the other amendments. They are unnecessary and are not particularly helpful to the orderly introduction of competition, which has been carefully planned by this Government. As I have already explained, Telecom's exclusive right to supply the first telephone ceases on 30 June next year in any case, which is less than seven months away, but it needs to be properly managed. It is very important to provide the appropriate network termination points for both licensed carriers prior to the new carrier arrangements coming into place. Provision for Aussat as part of the second carrier to be able to provide pay phones is under consideration by the Government, and is part of a major revision of the Act which will be introduced into the House of Representatives next year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take up just a few minutes of the Senate's time this morning. Christmas is a time for family and it is interesting to note that in this place today the Government's response to the report of the National Committee on Violence was brought down. Those two ideas provoked me to say a few words tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have heard much said in this session by honourable senators who claim to care for the family-I suspect they do in their own way-but I have rarely, if ever, heard any of them speak out against domestic violence and child abuse. The Government has put these issues on the public agenda and is addressing them. But they are too important, too tragic and too costly in human terms and dollars to be overlooked by our Senate. Why, I ask, is domestic violence a women's issue? Why is child abuse a women's issue?</PARA>
<PARA> Today's report said that the violence which is perpetrated against women and children in our society is usually committed by men. I know that most men here and most men in Australia do not beat their wives or assault their children. I look forward to when those men who care for the family, including churchmen in this society, are heard on the public record speaking out against domestic violence. To this point they have been largely silent. I hope that they will join with the Government and with women in protesting against this appalling damage and destruction in our society and that they will worry about the violence of guns and some of the violence in our sport. I hope that that worry about guns and the violence in our sport will become an issue of real concern which we will hear discussed here, rather than the arguments that we hear in this place about issues of concern for families. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is often said that a man's home is his castle. I want the human rights that are here to protect people in our society to be assured for all who live in the castle-be it ever so humble-not only for the man whose castle it is, but also for the women and children in that home. This Christmas my wish is for a clear commitment to be made, by men as well as women, to opposing violence in our society, especially in our homes. A happy, safe, protected and peaceful Christmas to all is my wish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate tonight for very long on this issue, but I wonder how many honourable senators have read the latest issue of the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly, which points out various levels of gold production and the present level. In 1990 Australia was the Western world's third biggest producer of gold after South Africa and the United States of America. The statistics and the production forecasts to 30 June 1991 show that gold will reach an export figure of $3.588 billion. It is Australia's second largest export commodity-ahead of wool, but behind coal. As I said, gold is expected to earn that amount in 1991 and this is a 12-fold improvement on the figure for 1980 when 17 tonnes of gold was produced. It is now estimated that in 1991 there will be between 215 and 220 tonnes of gold produced. Yet it is the industry that we have heard the least about in this chamber or anywhere else during this time of economic downturn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder why everything is so quiet on that front. The reason is that the gold industry has been producing well, as is shown by the figures, but I believe that it has reached its zenith at this stage and from now on things may go the other way. I believe that a production slump will begin in the very near future. The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics in its December edition of the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly predicts that gold exports will drop to about 155 tonnes by 1995-96 and if the present prices are maintained we will receive about $2.265 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems I see ahead for the goldmining industry is the closure of small goldmines which have been high-graded-in other words, stripped-and will soon run out of gold. There will be a certain amount of easing of prices. The high level of interest rates has certainly damaged the industry in the last two or three years. I know that 70 per cent of drills are currently idle as there is no further exploration.</PARA>
<PARA> This is virtually the last week in which gold producers will enjoy the tax system that they have had. As honourable senators know, a tax on the production of gold will come into effect on 1 January 1991. I believe that that was the wrong decision to make at the time, but I will not debate that matter tonight because we have gone into it many times before. However, I still believe it was the wrong decision to make because it is an industry that has remained prosperous in the remote areas in the economic downturn of the last six months. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel for the goldmining industry and certain other industries as in the last month or so the Government has been talking about security of tenure of the land on which mining takes place. Of course, it has also been talking about security of tenure for forests and all of that sort of thing. It is virtually a new term that has been added to the Government's vocabulary, and I welcome it. There has been security of tenure with regard to environmental issues for quite some time. When there is mention of security of tenure for the resources industry we hear the Australian Democrats and the green movement around Australia making a big noise. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that is the way for the Government to go so that there will be security in the years to come. Otherwise, our resources, which provide so much export income, will dry up. I commend the Government for doing that very small thing in the last month. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I commend the goldmining industry for what it has done for the economy and for exports over the last couple of years. I have cited the figures from 1980 to the present. The industry has certainly kept small towns in very remote areas alive. It is not feeling the impact of the economic downturn as much as the rest of the country. I felt that its performance over the last couple of years should be put on the record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for keeping the Senate. I cannot remember the last time I spoke on the adjournment; it is such a long time ago. I should not have to rise, but there still remain unanswered questions that were raised with the Government and a number of Ministers in the Estimates Committee of the Whole.

I acknowledge that Senator Collins is not the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; He did undertake to do it. I accept his undertaking. There are a number of other matters. One relates to the Tax Pack. I asked a question about the need for the Government to clear what was put in the scales in respect of decisions taken to contract out big publishing jobs such as the Tax Pack. That is important because the Tax Pack will be published again next year and we would like it to be published on Australian paper. I received an answer from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and I thank him for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I want to put a few things on the record. As the Senate will realise, three months after the Tiananmen Square massacre, I asked the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) at Estimates committee hearings for its comments on a range of material I provided. This material documented gross violations of human rights resulting from the population control program of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a program explicitly and enthusiastically supported by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), and through it, implicitly supported by our Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The response from AIDAB was brief. It stated, `AIDAB has not produced any written evaluation of the material'. Twelve months later, in September 1990, again at an Estimates committee hearing, Senator Olsen raised the issue of the potential abuse by the State Family Planning Commission of China of ultrasound machines being supplied to China with AIDAB support. A suggestion was made subsequently that the ultrasound machines could replace X-ray measures currently being used to ensure that Chinese women had not had their compulsorily fitted IUDs `illegally' removed. I put forward that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I was asked in September to provide evidence supporting claims that systematic violations of human rights were occurring as a result of the PRC population control program. I referred AIDAB and the Minister to the fact that I had provided such evidence 12 months prior, but AIDAB had not taken the time to study it. Following my concerns expressed at Estimates and on subsequent occasions in this chamber, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to me on 17 December. I thank the Minister for his response. I would like the Minister and AIDAB to know that I consider the response to be somewhat shallow in the face of overwhelming evidence to what are widely held and profound concerns for the human rights of families, and particularly of the poor and powerless women who bear the brunt of state-sponsored population control violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's letter to me claims that the existence of compulsory abortion and sterilisation in the PRC is hard to verify. If they occur, the Minister claims, it is because of overzealousness on behalf of local officials, and not as a result of central policy. The Minister cites comments by the Minister in charge of the State Family Planning Commission that the PRC Government itself claims that coercion is not allowed. The Minister calls these comments `the most authoritative available statement on the present nature of China's population policies'. The Minister claims that much of my evidence is anecdotal and out of date. He claims that `there is no evidence of which we are aware that IUDs are imposed upon women by forceful methods'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to use the time now to respond to these assertions. I ask that AIDAB take the time to read the evidence. All of it is current, most of it is documented. It is clear from the Minister's response that this material has not been studied. How could AIDAB read pages 22 and 28 of the 1988 paper on China's population policies by the United States of America Bureau of Census and conclude that there is no evidence that IUDs are imposed upon women by forceful means? There is none so blind as those who refuse to see. One of the world's foremost experts on China's population program, John S. Aird, wrote to a senior United States congressman in September 1989 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Those who maintain that the Chinese program is not coercive, or that the question of coercion in the Chinese program is a `controversial' matter that is still in doubt, or that the program has been greatly moderated since 1983 so that coercion is no longer an issue, are simply not in touch with reality. The evidence bearing on this point, though not easily accessible, can be assembled with a little effort by anyone who really wants to get to the bottom of the matter. However, the apologists for the program have not sought it out. Their reluctance suggests that they do not want to know what is really happening with the Chinese program. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's response fails to reveal material relating to family planning regulations in the PRC which must be held within his Department. I know that a number of Government departments are aware that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade post in Shanghai reported on 2 August 1990 on new regulations which mandated that a couple who had a second unplanned child would be subject to a fine amounting to three times their combined average income as measured by their incomes two years before the unplanned birth. I interpolate here that that is also a violation of workers rights. I note that our Shanghai bureau saw such measures as clearly an attempt not only to standardise the regulations `in law' but also to tighten up the rules concerning birth control and strengthen enforcement. As John Aird wrote in 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>We can expect more central and provincial despatches reflecting the hardening line on family planning . . . They represent a trend that has been under way now for more than two years but with gathering force since the beginning of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's letter refers to such economic disincentives in the forms of fines imposed on PRC couples for so-called unauthorised pregnancies. I acknowledge the Minister's reference to such fines as `unacceptable coercion' and that the Government intends to take the matters up with China. I congratulate him on that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister has indicated in his letter to me that he will write to Dr Nafis Sadik, the Executive Director of the UNFPA, asking her to exert her organisation's influence to encourage the termination of such unacceptable practices. I doubt whether the victims of such oppression will find comfort in this. After all, the UNFPA representative in China said on 12 September 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>China's family planning program is the most successful such effort in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Sadik herself visited China in January 1989 and voiced her support for China's population policy. On 24 May 1989 she delivered a speech in Washington and said that the Chinese Government was running a totally voluntary program. Little wonder the United States Government continues to refuse to fund UNFPA. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the difficulties being faced by AIDAB in coming to terms with the issue of population control and violations of human rights. Little attention has been paid to this subject for many years, and it is understandable that AIDAB finds itself surrounded by the alluring and sanitised pronouncements of foreign governments, and the shallow responses of organisations-international and local-with vested interests in population control. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers I have received following concern at violations in Indonesia and Bangladesh reflect this difficulty in successfully examining the evidence. Nevertheless, this historical reality should not be allowed to stand in the way now of a mature, deep and sensitive analysis of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The credibility of our aid program and the programs that we support directly or indirectly are at stake. I ask AIDAB to once again examine the material I have provided. Dr Aird's 1990 book entitled Slaughter of the Innocents: Coercive Birth Control in China, complete with detailed notes from recent Chinese sources, should be priority reading. I hope that the Minister will again consider these matters and respond. I seek leave to table the Minister's letter written to me on 17 December. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Harradine, I cannot remember when I last spoke on the adjournment. This is only the third time I have spoken in 9 1/2 years. I was stunned by an answer to a question today from Senator Robert Ray. In that answer to me regarding Mr Uren he said that he would consider a reply when the Senate Privileges Committee dealt with the matter, which means at least the middle of February next year. In ordinary circumstances I would have no problem with that. But I believe there are very special circumstances in this particular case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tom Uren has been a friend and political colleague of mine for over 30 years. Therefore, I am particularly upset with Senator Ray's statement that Tom Uren `regularly briefed former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, on internal divisions within the Australian Labor Party'. It is the words `regularly briefed' that are so offensive because it implies great treachery. That is why I am so upset about this matter and why I believe that Mr Uren is so upset about it. If honourable senators have any question about the interpretation of the words, they only need to look at the headlines of the articles in the press the following day, including `Uren was Fraser's mole in Labor Party, says Ray' in the Sydney Morning Herald;  `Ray names Uren as spy and groveller' in the Australian Financial Review; and `Uren rejects Fraser-spy claim' in the Canberra Times. All of the papers carried similar stories, with the inference being that Uren is a spy for his political opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe under the circumstances it is intolerable that Mr Uren not be given the opportunity to clear his name and, indeed, to have a cloud over his head until February. Senator Ray is a senior Minister. I believe that he is wrong to persist with the position which he-and, by implication, the Government-gave in reply to Senator Loosley's original question. Indeed, Senator Ray has a responsibility to be fair in this circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to Senator Collins, who is sitting at the table, that he ask Senator Ray to bring forward an answer tomorrow. I tried to contact Senator Ray and I appreciate that he is not in the building at this moment and might not be present at Question Time tomorrow. I think it would be absolutely cowardly for this slur to remain on Mr Uren's character for another two months. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into all the circumstances, some of which I am aware of. Many people have referred to Paul Kelly's book on the matter. Incidentally, in 1982 I was informed by Tom Uren of the Fraser phone call when it happened. I will not go into that now because I do not have the time to do so. The important thing is that if people have evidence they should either front up with it or, as I said in the question, they should withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is essential that Senator Ray does this. If he cannot do it tomorrow, I hope that he will do the right thing and issue a press statement immediately after tomorrow, if he is not available, so that this matter is finalised. I only say that, if the matter is not finalised tomorrow, I will persist until this matter is rectified because I will not have a friend of mine called a scab-and that is what is implied in what has happened up until this moment. I have every confidence in Tom Uren's character and in his word. He said that he has not done what has been alleged. I believe that he is entitled to proper justice from Senator Ray. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the moment there is a crisis of confidence in Australian securities. The reason for this is that investors simply cannot be guaranteed of getting a true and fair picture of the potential investment opportunities that are on the market. Investors, both Australian and international, now understand that the Australian share market is far more risk-laden than was previously thought. To many investors the share market has become nothing more than a lucky dip and the annual report nothing more than a deceptive, glossy wrapper which disguises the true nature of what people are investing in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that things have changed. The 1980s presented us with a changed scenario. Greed, management excess, ineffective auditing and creative accounting all prospered. They still do. It is a very ugly picture. We have the power in this place to change that and to turn the 1990s into much better times for investors. We can tear off the deceitful glossy wrapping of annual reports and force companies to present themselves for what they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the disclosure and reporting requirements on companies and their directors were inadequate in this climate of greed. We can no longer consider them useful for the future. Caveat emptor is no more than a mindless chant if the buyer who wants to beware is bedevilled by deceptive annual reports and deceptive management practices hidden by deceptive annual reports. That is the situation which we are in. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980s, a decade of greed, materialism, and conspicuous if not gluttonous consumption, began with Labor in opposition. The 1980s began with big business as Labor's biggest enemy. They ended up bed mates. The 1980s were the years when ethics stopped being something that the business community cared much about. More and more companies took up the practice of behaving and accounting for that behaviour under the `catch me if you can' motto. The concept of managing for the shareholders has almost become something of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, more and more, we manage for the managers. The snouts are well and truly in the trough. Labor has been in power for eight years in the 1980s, for eight years of greed, for eight years of managing for managers and eight years of `catch me if you can'. The long list of corporate problems does not conjure up a very positive image at all. One only has to list some of them: Rothwells, Spedley, Bond, Independent Resources, Estate Mortgage, Unity APA, Qintex, Budget Corporation, Hooker, Interwest, Underwater Systems, Equity Corp and-in my State-Adsteam. </PARA>
<PARA> Still this behaviour goes on. Now we are finally reaping the reward for the decade of `catch me if you can'. The chickens are coming home to roost. What does that mean? It means that Australian investors have lost money-lots and lots of money. We can no longer say to investors, `Well, if you invested more wisely, you would not have lost your money'. How can investors invest wisely when they cannot get a true and fair picture of what a company is doing? Investors cannot get a true and fair picture of what a company is doing because the reporting requirements of the companies code are inadequate. I submit that the reporting requirements on banks and other non-banking financial intermediaries are also inadequate. The last decade and the recent collapses show just how inadequate the reporting requirements really are. It has been a very unfortunate situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, these are not simply my views. One only has to go into the Australian community and ask others. One could go to the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia which states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also the case that more prudent decision- making by lenders was not helped by the development during the 1980s of creative accounting practices and complex corporate ownership structures. </PARA>
<PARA>That is in the Reserve Bank's recent annual report tabled here not that long ago. The annual report of the National Companies and Securities Commission also tabled not so very long ago had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most remarkable features of the year was the number of receiverships of large and sometimes prominent business enterprises. In several cases those collapses revealed behaviour that was, at best, highly unethical and damaging to shareholders and which may eventually be proved to be illegal. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The chance of prosecutions being conducted successfully in some very complex cases revealed in some recent collapses is small. In these instances many interrelated companies and many elaborately contrived transactions are involved. It is usual for sophisticated legal and financial advice to be obtained with a view to constructing devices that are either just within the letter of the law or which are capable of being defended in Court by skilful lawyers. It is often difficult for even the financially initiated to unravel these transactions and inevitably it will be extremely hard for juries or even magistrates to understand them. </PARA>
<PARA>We face a serious problem. This is not something that I have dreamt up myself. One can hear about it widely in the community, read about it in the Reserve Bank's report and read about it in the report of the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was saying, the last decade of recent collapses show us how inadequate the reporting requirements really are. Schedule 7 of the Companies Code can be described as a user-friendly guide to deceiving shareholders and potential investors. There is a raft of ways in which the reporting requirements are inadequate, but the most glaring inadequacy in reporting requirements is the opportunity for companies to hide their activities in off balance sheet companies, trusts and partnerships. Consequently, the annual reports and financial statements do not always give a true and fair view of the whole group's activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere is this more evident at the moment than in my State of South Australia. In the private sector the problems of Adsteam are only now, in the last few months, coming to the fore. Teams of accountants and lawyers are trying to work out just exactly what the situation is. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more surprising is the situation of the State Bank of South Australia. The State Bank is, I think, incorporated under State legislation under its own Act. It has a wholly owned subsidiary, Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd. It has a web of off balance sheet entities which include 58 off balance sheet companies, 53 of them being operated by Beneficial Finance Company. Until recently, however, only four of them had been made known publicly. The State Government which has, in effect, ultimate control over the bank, was apparently unaware of the web of off balance sheet companies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very hard to say who is at fault here. Has the bank, which enjoys government backing, been less than frank with the Premier or has John Bannon, the Premier, been less than assiduous? Would not any premier, after the problems with the State Bank of Victoria, the collapse of the Farrow Group and this decade of the 1980s, make full and complete inquiries about his State Bank's position and the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries and subsidiary entities, if they are not legally subsidiaries? I do not know the answer to that, but I do know that we would not have the problem if the reporting requirements were more stringent. The Premier would know automatically what the situation was. </PARA>
<PARA> The device for avoiding consolidation of all these entities in which there is a very substantial interest, is deceptively simple. The holding company simply ensures that it does not have control as defined in the Companies Code. That simply boils down to this: either having less than 50 per cent ownership; not having control of the composition of the board; or not holding more than half of the issued share capital. </PARA>
<PARA> Company A can have a subsidiary company B. Each of these companies can-for example, through a trust-be de facto owners of a new company C. Company C could then own less than 50 per cent of any number of other companies in which A or B could own an equivalent amount. The trust could own the remaining, probably inconsequential, amount. We could have company A owning company B and both of them, through a trust, effectively being the owners of company C, and those three companies owning myriad other companies, effectively having control of them and bypassing the requirement to consolidate that group into their balance sheets. That is a very simple matter, and one does not have to be bright to figure it out. Of course, plenty of companies have been bright enough to figure it out. </PARA>
<PARA> There could be the situation where these two companies hold 49 per cent each-just less than 50 per cent-and a trustee, which could be a firm of solicitors, holds the remaining 2 per cent. It would be no surprise to find one or more of the partners of that firm conveniently on the board of company A or B. There would be nothing to stop one or more of them being on the board of all the other off balance sheet companies. The directors of companies A and B could, between themselves, divvy up the benefits by way of directors' fees, management fees and whatever for the off balance sheet companies. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves how much of these benefits is disclosed to shareholders in company A or company B. A government would have to be blind not to see the consequences of such a loophole. It would have to be blind or deceitfully indifferent to do nothing about it. I will make no further comment about the Government's blindness or indifference to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The accounting profession also has not been quick to adopt the accounting standards issued by an international accounting standards committee. Nor has the Accounting Standards Review Board been very mobile in issuing new approved accounting standards. Auditors have not been free of criticism. Questions are being asked. Are there mottos of integrity, and without fear or favour are they still applicable? What do auditors do when they believe a set of accounts, while strictly legal, nonetheless do not give a true and fair picture of a company's activities?</PARA>
<PARA> The question needs to be asked: who wants this situation changed? The Australian Accounting Research Foundation has been lobbying for some time to have the law relating to consolidation of accounts changed. Australian investors and international investors are entitled to a true and fair view of a group's financial position. Not the least of these investors are the superannuation fund managers; those who control the funds of all those people-workers, employees and self-employed people-trying to provide for their future by putting their money into superannuation funds. Those funds have managers who invest those funds. Those investors have a right to a true and fair picture of what the managers are investing in on behalf of the superannuants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees the importance of superannuation and of workers, employees and employers providing for their future. Why cannot the Government see the need for the super fund managers to have a true and fair view of the entities in which those fund managers are investing? Without going into detail, it is quite clear, and should be to everybody, that State governments and Federal authorities also need clear and accurate information for banks, which may not be covered by the Companies Code to a certain extent, and non-banking financial intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA> What is abundantly clear now is that none of these groups or bodies can rely on the annual reports and financial statements to get this information. When the annual reports and financial statements do not give a true and fair view of a company's financial position, and when we look at what happened in the last year in the last decade, how can we pretend that Australian investors, international investors, super fund managers, the Taxation Commissioner and the Reserve Bank have a true and fair picture of what is really happening? This is a detailed area of law. The law, in my view, is inadequate for our current situation. I have sought tonight only to raise the problem and the consequences for investors. They are disastrous consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> At a later stage, when the Parliament resumes, I will address the legal detail of these problems. However, the problem has been resolved in the United Kingdom. It has been resolved in Europe and we should get our own house in order. Let me conclude by repeating that we have the power in this place to tear off the deceitful glossy wrapping of annual reports and force companies to present themselves for what they are. I intend to see that we do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to conclude the remarks I was making last night when I was interrupted by a quorum being called and the Senate being counted out. It is very important that we recognise the selective nature of much of our indignation over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The Arab world is quite correctly bitter over the double standards applied by the world community to Israel and Palestine since 1967 and, of course, in many other examples that have been given in this place before of our very ready ability to ignore other instances where large countries have taken over small countries and invasions have taken place; for example, Indonesia in East Timor and the United States in Granada and Panama.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, these double standards are causing some disquiet. It is also important to stress that the United Nations cannot be used only when it suits the interests of the five permanent members of the Security Council. The United States does not mind using the United Nations to endorse and legitimise its planned attack on Iraq-of course, I still hope that it will not come to that-after 15 January, but it was not prepared to accept the criticism of its own intervention in Granada and Panama, nor was it prepared to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when Nicaragua complained about the mining of its harbours by the United States to that court. This is the country which is now using the United Nations for its own purposes. It is the same country which could not be bothered paying its dues and which also chooses to ignore many other United Nations resolutions when it suits it, particularly when they apply to its great friend Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to Australia's shame that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) personally intervened to instruct our United Nations delegation in New York to support the United States when it was threatened by a censure motion on Panama at the United Nations-a motion that originally the Australian delegation was prepared to support. It was going to support it but the Prime Minister rang and said, `No, we are going to support the United States on that'. This was despite the fact that the United States had intervened in another country's affairs in Panama which was a similar sort of situation to what we are complaining about now. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to be honest about why we are supporting the situation as it is at the moment in the Gulf and why we are supporting the United States without all this hypocrisy over fighting for freedom and democracy and self-determination. They are hardly concepts which are familiar to the inhabitants of the Gulf states and certainly not to those workers who lived in Kuwait without any civil rights whatsoever. Rather than liberating Kuwait, the phrase that is being used by the United States, it would be a complete demolition job. Let us understand that a war after 15 January will do nothing to solve the long term problems in the region. In the long run, it will serve only to exacerbate those problems. That is why I urge the world community to choose the path already being advocated by a number of governments, as well as leading figures like Robert MacNamara in the United States; that is, negotiations backed by sanctions, rather than the war option. War should be taken off the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> As I outlined last night, there are negotiating points and there is a formula for a peace conference. We must have a peace conference either before or after a war. If it is after the war, of course, it is a peace conference of the victors meeting with the vanquished. The Treaty of Versailles after World War I was so brutal to the vanquished that it sowed the seeds of World War II. (Quorum formed) We could, of course, cut out the slaughter phase, that is the war, and get straight on with the peace conference rather than continuing with war preparations. That is what I believe we should do. We have to have a peace conference either before or after a war. The human consequences of a war are something that the political leaders who are very heavily engaged in preparations for war are not acknowledging. I urge the Australian Prime Minister to withdraw Australia's forces while we still have the chance to do so. If we leave them there much longer it may be too late. There could well be a pre-emptive strike before the 15 January deadline. If there is a war, whether it is before or after that 15 January deadline, there will be blood on Mr Hawke's hands. None of us want that. </PARA>
<PARA> He is the first Labor Prime Minister in the history of this country to consider leading Australia to war and this is very distressing to the Australian Labor Party (ALP) membership around the country although we have not heard ALP members in here saying anything about that. It is a tragedy if the bully boys will never learn or listen to the wisdom of the people. For the honour of Australia as a good global citizen, in the long run we must take Australia out of the 23-nation United Nations sanctioned blood bath. It will not be to our credit that Australia rushed in to support the United States if it comes to a war. As I said earlier, I certainly hope it does not come to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with a remark that has been made by many people, not only in Australia but also in the 23 countries that are lined up with their huge forces of armaments against the Iraqis. People do not consider that we should be spilling blood for oil. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) As at 30 June 1990, 911 staff were employed by the CRS on a full-time basis and a further 40 staff were employed part-time.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) The CRS currently employs 971 full-time staff and 43 part-time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) CRS staff have professional backgrounds which include occupational therapy, rehabilitation counselling, physiotherapy and social work. In providing programs to clients they access specialist community and private sector resources. The CRS purchases on a fee-for-service basis specialist assessment and other assistance for clients, including specialist psychiatric and clinical reports, neuro-psychological assessments, and the services of allied health therapists where it is more expensive to provide these services in-house. The CRS also purchases aids and appliances, vehicle modifications and home modifications from the private sector. In 1989-90 $9.4 million was expended on such contracted services.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) From 1 July to 31 October 1990, $3.47 million was expended on contract services.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) A schedule of CRS-owned regional units as distinct from Commonwealth-owned property leased by the CRS from the Department of Administrative Services is shown in the following table. The valuations are acquisition costs unless otherwise noted.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) One additional property has been purchased since 1 July 1990, to accommodate a regional unit at Wonthaggi in Victoria. The purchase price was $78,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)</PARA>
<PARA> Details of rent, lessors, staffing and client activity levels for each regional unit are shown in a table which, due to the amount of material contained in it, is not published in Hansard. Copies of the table are available from the Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) The CRS does not have sufficient resources to undertake the manual collection of data required to respond to this question.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The CRS does not collect client data on a basis that would permit the ready calculation of the number of client visits in a given period. Within an agreed program, activity on behalf of a client may include seeking out suitable work training scheme employers, agreement with employers on a graded return to work, arranging the modification of a workplace for a new disabled employee, a supervision role in initial employment, advocacy of a client's case with potential employers, visiting the client in his own home or work environment, or the negotiation with community agencies for a referral more appropriate to the needs of the client. Rehabilitation programs last on average 26 weeks. Visits of clients to units do not measure the intensity of activity undertaken on behalf of a client and represent a minor proportion of the time devoted to an individual client.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) The CRS assisted clients whose major disabilities included:</PARA>
<PARA>acquired brain impairment,</PARA>
<PARA>amputation,</PARA>
<PARA>arthritis,</PARA>
<PARA>back and neck injuries,</PARA>
<PARA>drug and alcohol dependency,</PARA>
<PARA>fracture,</PARA>
<PARA>hearing impairment,</PARA>
<PARA>mild and moderate intellectual impairment,</PARA>
<PARA>heart and circulatory disease,</PARA>
<PARA>lung and respiratory disease,</PARA>
<PARA>muscular diseases,</PARA>
<PARA>speech and language disorders,</PARA>
<PARA>spinal cord injury,</PARA>
<PARA>over-use injury, and</PARA>
<PARA>visual impairment.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (b) Readily accessible records at the unit level are not available to give an accurate per client cost for each regional unit. However, the average cost for the network over the last four years is:</PARA>
<PARA>1986-87</PARA>
<PARA>$4,654</PARA>
<PARA>1987-88</PARA>
<PARA>$3,740</PARA>
<PARA>1988-89</PARA>
<PARA>$3,421</PARA>
<PARA>1989-90</PARA>
<PARA>$2,945</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (c) The CRS provides direct social and vocational rehabilitation services in a community-based context. A professionally qualified case manager works with a client to plan, co-ordinate and monitor a rehabilitation program. The case manager takes full responsibility for a client's program from referral to completion and uses community and private sector resources as well as discipline specific resources from within the regional unit. The case manager co-ordinates and controls the rehabilitation process from initial assessment and the development of a rehabilitation plan, through to the monitoring of progress against plan to case completion. A typical rehabilitation plan that is vocationally directed will include assessment activities, job search activities, and workplace support in the initial phase of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) End program circumstances are the major indicators of the effectiveness of the program.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) (a) Of the 19,573 clients assisted in programs in 1989-90:</PARA>
<PARA> * 283 were in active full-time employment, but with their jobs in jeopardy;</PARA>
<PARA> * 76 were in active part-time employment, but with their jobs in jeopardy;</PARA>
<PARA> * 3,977 had full-time jobs, but were unable to work;</PARA>
<PARA> * 657 had part-time jobs, but were unable to work;</PARA>
<PARA> * 309 were in supported employment arrangements under the Disability Services Act;</PARA>
<PARA> * 9461 were unemployed;</PARA>
<PARA> * 4792 were not seeking employment;</PARA>
<PARA> * 18 were not categorised.</PARA>
<PARA>(9) (b) Details of the 19,573 clients' workforce status at three months and six months after they ceased receiving assistance from the CRS are not available. Formal collection of this information is about to be introduced into CRS work practice and will be included in a redevelopment of the CRS management information system which is scheduled for implementation on 1 July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) (a) Of the 19,573 clients assisted in programs in 1989-90:</PARA>
<PARA> * 1,356 were referred from the Department of Social Security;</PARA>
<PARA> * 2,108 were referred from the Department of Employment, Education and Training;</PARA>
<PARA> * 1,221 were referred by other Commonwealth departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 4,398 were referred by State Government Departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Nil. The CRS does not independently request clients to participate.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) 5,138 of the clients assisted in programs were selfreferrals; a further 722 were referred by family or friends.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The CRS has over 120 physical locations in a widely dispersed network of units and outposts. Its practice is to have permanent locations to provide on-going support to clients during programs. From these sites, CRS combines caseworker and client travel, where necessary, to provide comprehensive services to outlying populations. CRS operates an outreach team from Darwin which services clients from Tennant Creek, Bathurst Island, and Nhulunbuy, and provides additional professional services to the outposts at Katherine and Kununurra.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The average salary cost is total salary payment divided by full-time equivalent staffing for the year.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The figure of $39,748 shown in the Explanatory Notes to the Senate was inappropriately inflated, as a result of internal accounting adjustments associated with intra-departmental charging practices. The correct estimated average salary cost for the CRS is $33,655. The increase reflects national wage case increases.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) The CRS Charter offers equal access to all eligible Australians on the basis of their need for rehabilitation. This includes not only gaining entry to the service, but also to the appropriateness of programs to the cultural, social and other circumstances of the client and to the quality of outcomes. The CRS aims to deliver services to the identified target groups at a level which properly reflects their representation among people with disabilities in the general community, who are eligible for CRS services under the Disability Services Act, and has active strategies in place to achieve this. The CRS does not use target group characteristics as a criterion for eligibility to participate in programs. The targets are used to monitor ex-poste the effectiveness of CRS access strategies.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) See response to Question 13.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) During the 1989-90 financial year no functions, activities or services of the CRS were transferred to any community-based organisations.</PARA>
