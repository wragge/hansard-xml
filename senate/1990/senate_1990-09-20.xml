<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. Is there any rational basis to the claim that the cost of construction of the third runway at Sydney will be 10 times the Government's projection? Also, is there any evidence to support the claim that the construction of the third runway at Sydney will increase, rather than decrease, the noise level associated with the airport's operations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2639" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there is not any rational basis for those claims. I did hear yesterday on national television claims being made that, according to the environmental impact statement, the third runway at Sydney Airport would cost $1.7 billion. In accordance with the work that is being done in other studies, the current estimated cost of the third runway at Sydney Airport is $273m. The figure that was used yesterday by the person who made these claims on the Today program was the figure in the environmental impact statement which covered the cost of the third runway, plus the complete cost of the staged development of Badgerys Creek Airport as well. So that claim simply cannot be substantiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the noise level claims that have been made, two key researchers formerly employed by the National Acoustics Laboratories were quoted extensively yesterday as saying that the short term impact of noise from the third runway would be considerably greater than the noise levels estimated by the environmental impact statement. Therefore, people were saying that on that basis the third runway should not proceed. Again that is not correct.</PARA>
<PARA> The statements made by these two researchers are correct. I agree with them that the short term impact of new noise does have a considerably greater impact on people than the steady state, if you like, impact of noise once the noise has been established for some time. The environmental impact statement recognises that at page 22. The only rational basis on which the EIS and indeed any planning for the third runway could proceed would be on the basis of the long term steady state impacts of noise at Sydney Airport and not on the impact of any new noise generated perhaps in the first six months of its operation.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals for the construction of a third runway, whether it proceeds or not, are predicated entirely on the removal of the east-west runway from operations. It is essential that that be done because if the air side capacity at Kingsford-Smith is increased with the construction of a third runway, the land side capacity has to be increased as well to match it. The only available land at Kingsford-Smith Airport that can be used for this purpose is currently occupied by the east-west runway. If a third runway is constructed and the east-west runway is taken out of service, as planned, the number of people seriously affected by noise at Sydney Airport will be cut by half-that is, the residents to the east and west of the airport will suffer no noise impact at all.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out in conclusion that what appears to be an attractive option which is being pushed-certainly it is canvassed in the EIS-involves transferring all light aircraft from Bankstown to the new light aircraft facility at Badgerys Creek and then transferring commuter traffic from Sydney to Bankstown. Frankly, I am astonished that the opponents of the third runway would push such a proposal. The difficulty with that scenario is that it will not just mean the existing use of the east-west runway will have to be maintained but also the use of it to cope with the additional traffic will have to be increased. Not only does it match the traffic capacity which would be provided by a third runway and a staged development at Badgerys Creek but also it would not just sustain existing noise levels for residents around the airport; it would increase them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether it is over 12 months or five years, the effect will be the same: the complete destruction of an Australian shipping industry. It is interesting to have a look around the world at the policies of maritime nations towards cabotage. There are a very small number of nations in the world that do not have cabotage. Those nations are: Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. One does not have to be too smart to work out why Ireland does not have cabotage, because of its close proximity to Great Britain and the intensive trade between those two nations. One does not have to be too smart to work out why Belgium does not have cabotage, because it has a coastline two inches long and two ports within close proximity to each other. One does not have to be too smart to work out why the Netherlands does not have cabotage either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, the only major maritime nation on earth that does not have cabotage-we had an expert on waterfront reform from that country in Australia just recently-is Great Britain. The interesting thing about that is that the British have recently introduced into their Parliament legislation to return cabotage to the United Kingdom.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed; Maggie has done that. Perhaps that should cross the attention of Mr Sharp. What the Australian shipping industry says, with some strength, because it was extremely alarmed by this Opposition policy, is a very simple and very logical statement, `If the Opposition wants to destroy the Australian shipping industry and if it wants to open up our coast to unrestricted competition and wipe us out overnight, then let us have some reciprocal arrangements'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trade unions and shipowners say to me, `We will allow into this country-we will not object-any major maritime nations similar to our own that will allow us to operate in an unrestricted manner on their coast if they are allowed to operate on ours'. That is not an unreasonable proposition, but it seems to have totally escaped Mr Sharp's attention.</PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that intrigued me about the statement made by Mr Sharp was that he gave a commitment on behalf of the Opposition in his speech to `deregulate manning levels in Australian shipping other than those provided by safety regulations'. I was astonished to hear that we in fact had any regulations determining manning levels or crewing levels on Australian ships other than those to do with safety. I inquired and found that in fact we have not. Mr Sharp has given a public commitment to an expert group-which I can tell the Senate got a great horse laugh from the people he was talking to-that he will implement Opposition policy to take away regulations that do not exist. The only regulations that exist on crewing levels in Australia are to do with safety levels and Mr Sharp has given a commitment, thankfully, at least to retain those.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's instant policy-the one that it whipped up in an afternoon, along with removing tariffs, selling Telecom Australia, selling the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and selling Aussat Pty Ltd; during a casual afternoon sitting down with a pen and a piece of paper-is a destructive policy in the national interest. There is no reason to believe, in my view-and I hold to this view very strongly on a personal basis-that we should not treat the domestic Australian shipping industry in any other way than we are prepared to treat the other domestic transport industries, road and rail, in this country. I would like the Opposition to consider trying to apply the same kind of approach to road and rail-that is, totally free and unregulated competition from overseas operators on road and rail in Australia. The same thing applies to our coastal shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I would add, to emphasise how important that industry is to Australia, that today the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has released a report which indicates that the Australian domestic shipping industry contributed nearly half a billion dollars towards our balance of payments in 1986-87. This is what the Opposition is determined to destroy. I ask the Opposition to reconsider, in the national interest of Australia, this outrageous policy.</PARA>

Thirdly, given General Dugan's revelations that Baghdad would be a priority Pentagon target and that a high level of civilian deaths would inevitably result, can the Minister confirm that this would violate the Geneva protocols, which the Government has signalled its intention to ratify? Finally, has the Minister conveyed to the Bush Administration the Australian Government's opposition to a first strike by the United States on Iraq, should sanctions fail to liberate Kuwait? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the legal basis for military action in response to Iraq's armed attack on and invasion of Kuwait, I have already made it clear on a number of occasions that Australia regards the right of collective self-defence under article 51 of the United Nations charter as a proper basis for both military and economic retaliation. I have also made it clear, though, that it would be very much our preference that any further direct military action-that is to say, as distinct from military action by way of enforcement of the present economic sanctions-be under arrangements specifically the subject of further United Nations resolution. But that is not to say that there would be no proper legal foundation if such action were to be solely based on the right of collective defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether such further direct military action should now be pursued or kept open as an option, the Australian Government's view, as I have made clear on a number of occasions, most recently in a speech last Sunday night, is that military action should not be wholly ruled out at the end of the day should all other means of resolving this crisis fail. But again, this is not an option which we believe should be contemplated in the foreseeable future. That clearly remains the United States' position. Indeed, the fact that it remains the United States' position is one of the reasons why General Dugan got himself into so much trouble for rather implying otherwise, albeit not stating so directly. We are continuing to take the view, and to express this view both publicly and privately, that we would infinitely prefer to see the matter resolved by peaceful means, although of course it would have to be a principled peace, not a peace by way of appeasement. That point has been made over and over again. I do not propose to speculate further as to what such further direct military action might involve and what its consequences might be. I think that such public speculation at such a sensitive time is manifestly inappropriate and, indeed, just as inappropriate for me as it was for General Dugan.</PARA>

In view of the fact that the NRMA targeted the electorate of Calare for its election road funding campaign during the 1990 Federal election period, could the Minister request the Australian Electoral Commissioner to investigate whether the 1990 return of electoral expenditure of the NRMA is complete and covers all the political advertisements authorised by the NRMA during the 1990 Federal election campaign?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the newspaper advertisements referred to in Senator Faulkner's question. I did note the campaign run by the NRMA in the last election campaign. I have not costed the campaign but, given the type of advertising and the type of coordination that the campaign entered into, it must have cost several hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is also a campaign which ordinary members of the NRMA ought to regard-indeed, if I were an ordinary member of that organisation I would-as going beyond the reasons why they joined it. In fact, this campaign appeared to have a distinct party political purpose: it targeted the Government's marginal seats and it appeared to be coordinated with some elements of the Opposition's campaign. I think that members of the NRMA would be justified in feeling unhappy about the use of their contributions for such a party political purpose. It raises the question of members of those service organisations asking, when their contributions are increased, if their money had not been spent on party political purposes, could the same services have been delivered without the increase in contributions, that is, whether the organisation could have provided the same level of services without the need for increasing its contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those press reports. I have seen reports of an announcement by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Mike Moore, supported by the President of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, Mr Ken Douglas, on 17 September announcing a historic understanding that has been reached between the Government, the trade unions and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to strike an agreement to tackle the economic problems facing New Zealand and, importantly, to change the direction of wages policy in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The document is similar to the accord that has served Australia so well over the seven years of the Hawke Government and enabled-as I said in answer to a question yesterday-the household disposable income per capita to rise in the seven years of this Government by 11.1 per cent. Each party to the New Zealand accord, if I may call it that, has entered into commitments that the Government will substantially reduce its Budget deficit for 1991-92, that the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions will exercise its influence to achieve wage settlements of 2 per cent in the present wage round and other increases in wages should be based on future productivity gains, and that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will not interfere to prevent the positive effects of these actions stabilising and then reducing interest rates in that country.</PARA>
<PARA> The New Zealand Government has come to recognise, as we did in Australia some years ago, the need for an adjustment strategy which does not throw its economy into recession or, as Mike Moore explained it, into recession, increased unemployment and despair. He has also recognised that this approach is a vast contrast to the divisive and confrontationist approach of conservative governments and, indeed, the conservative National Party Opposition in New Zealand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current Middle East crisis has emphasised the Western world's dependence on the supply of crude oil and highlights the onus on Australia to efficiently manage our own significant resources of oil. That means providing a taxation regime which favours the development of our reserves with an appropriate return to the community and continuing to open up new oil exploration fields. However, having said that, the Government is also well aware that we need to take into account the environmental sensitivities of an oil exploration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There must be a fair amount of misinformation over the subject of oil exploration in the Coral Sea. But the Prime Minister made the Government's position on this clear back in July. Firstly, he said unequivocally that the Hawke Labor Government would not countenance any drilling that would endanger sensitive marine environments and that he totally ruled out any drilling within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of oil exploration in areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef, such as the Coral Sea, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Resources-the Minister I am representing here in answering this question, Alan Griffiths-have stated that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would be asked for a full assessment of the proposal before any such exploration could be contemplated.</PARA>
<PARA> Any proposals for exploration near the park would trigger the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. This would mean that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories would examine the matter to determine whether or not further action is required, or whether a public environment report should be prepared or an environmental impact statement should be prepared.</PARA>
<PARA> After consultation with the Queensland Government and the companies concerned, Mr Griffiths also announced in July that the Government had decided to terminate the remaining petroleum exploration permits in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park which have been under suspension since 1971. Mr Griffiths said that he had proposed voluntary surrender of the permits to the companies concerned, but if the companies did not favour voluntary surrender an amendment would be introduced to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to terminate the permits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not to the same extent, because in the services that the ABC and Australia Post are providing there is already quite a bit of competition. The Government is sensitive to concerns that are raised from time to time from private industry in respect of the commercial activities of these public organisations. The attitude that I have taken as Minister and, I am sure, Mr Beazley has also taken as Minister in those portfolio areas that he is responsible for-and Mr Brown is responsible for this particular one-is to deal with those concerns on a case by case basis. So if Senator Chapman does have representations from private industry that raise particular concerns about any of these activities, as often does happen, I would be more than happy to take those concerns on his behalf to Mr Brown.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of comments in today's Australian Financial Review that a 22 per cent increase in private sector spending on research and development to a level of $1.738m is insufficient? Can the Minister comment on the accuracy of this claim and on the effectiveness of the Government's measures to encourage private sector research and development?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the article in the Australian Financial Review, by Peter Roberts I think, and it is a comment on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' business enterprise research and development survey results for the year 1988-89. From the ABS figures Australia appears to have had one of the strongest rates, if not the strongest rate, of increase in business research and development in the whole of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The latest data shows that business research and development of $1.738 million in 1988-89 now represents 0.52 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). This is more than double the business research and development to GDP ratio in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> I have to interpose by saying Senator Archer will be interested in these statistics, because he receives warm applause from the troglodytes around him when he raises the question of government funding of research and development, and it is suggested by way of interjection in this place that government funding in research and development is the be-all and end-all of a community's efficiency and success in developing products and in applied and pure research. That is not so and that has never been this Government's position.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is encouraging to see that the ratio of business research and development to GDP has doubled. I must say that while the picture for this new data is encouraging, I believe we still have some way to go.</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot be certain of the extent to which government research and development measures supporting innovation are responsible for the research and development increases, but it is clear that private sector research and development is continuing to respond positively to a range of government measures put in place to encourage research and development, such as the tax concession, the grants for industrial research and development scheme, the partnership schemes and so on. All these things have undoubtedly been some encouragement to research and development, but I still take the point made by the article in the Australian Financial Review that the improvement in private sector research and development does not mean there is any cause for complacency about levels of research and development in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that frequently Opposition spokesmen assert that the Government has no role in encouraging the commercialisation of research and development. The Government has traditionally had a role in encouraging the commercialisation of research and development in the rural and mining sectors. It has a similar role in relation to manufacturing in service industries. The Government will continue to encourage research and development efforts to be made where it has the chance of being commercialised, as well as otherwise.</PARA>

As well as this, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is to link two of these departments-the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs-to the Health Insurance Commission's computer; a match up system of six major government departments. Will the Minister confirm that information that Australians have given to these six departments about their personal affairs will now be used for purposes other than for which they gave it to the Department?

<PARA> There is no way that we can achieve justice for pensioners and beneficiaries if we continue to pay large sums of money to people who are entitled to none of it. The only way we will be able to make that system work is to have some kind of check. In doing that, in having a tax file number and some matching of records, we are making sure that linkage-the honourable senator used the word `link' in his question-is not what it used to mean; we are making sure that the computer terminals of departments are not linked to information that is being matched; we are making sure that public servants cannot tap into that information.

As I was saying, we will make absolutely certain that public servants in those departments will not be able to tap into those records. The only time that anyone will see any part of the records is when the computer shows us a possible incorrect payment. An investigation will then be made, but even then all information is destroyed within three months unless, of course, we discover fraud. When we discover fraud we are bound to take further action. The application of these measures will not take away people's privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many senators have expressed concern along these lines, and they are serious concerns. Senator Bell gave me a note yesterday saying that, if even one person was to receive information, that would be a breach of privacy. I understand that principle very well; in fact, no-one in my Department will see the information on the vast majority of Australian citizens. Some people will see information only when possible incorrect payments are shown up. I really do not believe that will amount to any breach of privacy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two days ago Senator Alston asked for further details of the Government's response to a recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on child-care awards. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has supplied the following answers to Senator Alston's questions. The first was: Does the Minister concede that the Government will be forced to increase child-care subsidies? The Minister answers that the Government has already provided for significant increases of fee relief subsidies in the 1991 Budget with an indexation expected in October 1991. The Government does not expect any further changes at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston then asked whether such an increase has been taken into account in the Government's Budget forward estimates for child-care expenditure. The answer is that the Government has fully funded its proposed increases to child-care fee relief subsidies. Thirdly, Senator Alston asked: If not, is the Minister concerned that many working parents, as a result of the Industrial Relations Commission's decision, will no longer be able to afford child-care? The answer is that the question of affordability is central to this Government's child-care policies which is why this Budget has provided for such massive increases to child-care relief which will benefit more than 90,000 ordinary Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Alston asked: Will many smaller child-care operations be unable to absorb the increased costs and therefore be forced to close down? The Minister replies that the Commission's decision provides for an 18 months phase-in period. The decision on how to deal with increased costs during that time, either through increased fees or other economies, is a matter for individual services. However, there is no doubt that the extension of fee relief to the commercial sector from 1 January 1991 will be of great assistance to that sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to round out a few remarks that I made when the Committee last considered the Patents Bill. I stress again that the majority of commercially used patents, in terms of the amount of money which is transacted, based on those patents, is tied strongly to a few very large companies. The use of all patents in a commercial sense rapidly becomes tied to a few very large companies. What we are doing in relation to allowing the patenting of life is very rapidly allowing life itself to become property owned exclusively by a few multinational companies. I am concerned because that fact will come to dominate in a major way the debate over the ethics which should appropriately surround the developments in the area of genetic engineering. I stress that this important debate should not be subverted by ownership of life and those very powerful interests. I point again to the way in which many of those large companies dominate the media. Therefore, they dominate the sources of what passes for information by which many people in the community will come to judge the ethics in this very important area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now address my remarks to the amendment which has been accepted by the Government. It has in fact been proposed by the Government but is based on Senator Harradine's earlier suggestions to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. It differs significantly from the amendment that I have proposed in that it also includes the disallowance of the patenting of processes. I point out to Senator Button that, despite his earlier remarks in Question Time, I am not seeking to disallow the patenting of the processes but the end products of those processes. There is a very important distinction there. In deference to the general standards in the community, I was accepting the idea of intellectual property in knowledge and the patenting of the processes, but not the end products. </PARA>
<PARA> While I will be supporting Senator Harradine's suggested amendment, as modified by the Government, I would make that distinction. I would also say that it does not really achieve a great deal because it says that humans shall not be patented. We all know that humans as such are not patentable because, firstly, they are not inventions-we already possibly have too many humans on this planet and heaven help us if we invent more-and, secondly, there are other laws which prevent us from the exclusive ownership of other people. So the first words do not mean a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA> But where the amendment goes on to say `the biological processes for their generation'-referring specifically to human beings-it begs the very question of which we need some clarification. What are the biological processes for the generation of human beings? I would expect that those words would mean the normal processes for the generation of human beings which would involve a male and a female human being in certain actions which have been the processes of the generation of human beings for perhaps six million years. But we now have very complex and different ways of making creatures which are quasi-human. That is the very point I believe this legislation should develop, but it will not do so unless it is amended in the ways I have suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> Enormous ethical problems surround this matter of patenting and the ownership of life, of life forms and the elements which go into life forms. It is extremely disappointing that this legislation has adopted no principles whatsoever beyond those which were written into the 1952 Act which this Bill replaces and which in itself predated by a full year the publication of Watson and Crick's model of DNA, the double helix model, on which a great deal of the developments in genetic engineering have been based, and which are accelerating enormously as we develop more sophisticated techniques for the manipulation of genes and for the passage of genes across species barriers. So I can only strongly commend to the Committee the amendments which have been moved in the name of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA>I need to clarify a point raised by Senator Coulter in addressing an amendment before the vote was taken. Senator Coulter indicated that my amendment could possibly cover normal processes connected with the generation of human beings. Presumably, he meant the act of sexual intercourse. It is presumably nobody's intention to have meters in bedrooms to collect a cent a time. It is an interesting thought. A law professor and writer on biotechnology, George Annas, likens patenting biological processes for the generation of human beings to `patenting a position in sexual intercourse'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an extreme example of a process which my amendment would prohibit. I refer to the techniques that may well be developed for cloning a human embryo at the four-cell stage. That is an example, albeit an extreme one, of the type of technique or process which my amendment to this Bill would prohibit from being patentable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Patents Bill 1990 is the first piece of legislation to be considered under this system. I can assure doubters on both sides that the system can, and in this case did, work. It worked because of three things. Firstly, we were fortunate in having a chairman in Senator Childs who ignored some of the trial rules which apparently were laid down. As a result, he made the system work. Secondly, it worked because of the cooperation of the Minister, Senator Button, in ensuring that the officers who were in attendance to give advice were allowed to do so. Thirdly, it worked because of the desire of the committee to make it work. Time was given to negotiate points, to develop amendments and to use the best advice available. No-one has lost any opportunity to participate and there is no doubt that in this case the change has been perfectly satisfactory. I would like to record that and give thanks to the people involved who made it happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on what Senator Archer said, I would make the point that some very complex issues were involved in the Patents Bill 1990. Personally, I would like to thank the committee for the way in which it handled the issues. Let me say, however, that in respect of these committees we are, as a Senate, on something of a learning curve. I think it is something of an abuse of the system if issues which have been thrashed out and agreed in the committee again become the subject of further speeches of considerable length in the chamber itself. I think that is something we have to sort out in looking at the operation of the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is always a tendency to say that if a system does not work after a short trial, because we have become used to our conventional ways, we should abandon it. I hope that that view is not strongly held in the Senate. But it will become a strongly held view if senators do not abide by the spirit of the system, which is designed to ensure that Bills are perhaps more adequately inquired into without posturing before the committee or in the chamber itself. I hope that we can learn from the experience of this committee and others to arrive at a workable system. I thank Senator Archer for his comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I did not intend to speak at this stage of the debate. However, I hope that the remarks by Senator Button a few moments ago were not directed at something I did. I felt that on this occasion the system worked extremely well in that the consideration of amendments which I put to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, although rejected by that Committee, allowed me to come back with amendments which were quite substantially different. Although based on the same arguments, they were different in kind and suggested a different mechanism. I was able to put that different mechanism before the Committee of the Whole.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that at the end of 1989 the Migration Act was amended extensively. Following these amendments a completely fresh group of migration regulations was made. These regulations were scrutinised by the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for compliance with its principles of personal liberties and parliamentary proprieties. The Committee has difficulties with some of the aspects of these regulations. However, following advice from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) that an announced major review of the regulations should satisfy the concerns of the Committee, it was decided to defer final consideration until after the review was completed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, to assist in its scrutiny, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee asked the Minister for a copy of the Procedures Advice Manual of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. This is the manual of guidelines and procedures used by officers of the Department to administer the Act and the Regulations. The Minister promptly furnished a copy, for which the Committee is grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee decided that it would be appropriate to table the manual as an example of the quasi-legislation through which the day-to-day administration of many Acts and Regulations is conducted. These are the documents piled on my desk. In the present case, the manual comprises 195 booklets, some 3,300 pages, as amended by 41 policy control instructions and is 30 centimetres or about one foot high. </PARA>
<PARA> The manual is a public document available for purchase at the Australian Government Bookshop, although it is priced at about $300, with special folders to keep the booklets costing another $100. Individual booklets may be purchased for $1.50 each. In this case the documents are at least available, even though they are expensive. In some other agencies manuals are unavailable to members of the public, who face procedural difficulties even in obtaining knowledge of their existence. </PARA>
<PARA> When dealing with members of the public or people overseas wishing to visit or migrate to Australia, it is to the manual that departmental officers refer, at least in the first instance. This quasi-legislation is not subject to tabling or disallowance in Parliament, although it may have an important effect upon the way in which entire classes of individual cases are decided and is, therefore, at least partly legislative in character. For example, the expression `reasonable period' is not defined in respect of a particular provision of the Regulations. The manual advises, however, that for this purpose a reason- able period is normally three years. Other procedures in the manual are less certain. One booklet advises that certain persons are to be contacted by overseas posts of the Department and invited to purchase an application for migration to Australia package. </PARA>
<PARA> The manual demonstrates an awareness that the entire migration program is based upon powers contained in Acts of Parliament and in regulations and other instruments made under the authority of Acts. The manual urges all officers of the Department to become familiar with the general provisions of the Migration Act and Regulations. The manual wisely advises that its procedures and guidelines do not have the same legal standing as Acts or regulations and should be applied in accordance with the principles of administrative law on the merits of each individual case. In addition, the manual properly points out that government actions must be consistent with the laws enacted by the Federal Parliament to regulate migration. Accordingly, I have tabled this huge manual and seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of contents of the manual. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tabling of the Procedures Advice Manual marks a significant step forward in immigration policy. One of the criticisms of the current legislation and the current delegated legislation, to wit the Migration Regulations, is that it is very unclear. In many respects, the operations of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs seem to many applicants unreasonable or very secretive. It is a mark of some concern that when many of my colleagues and I asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) to provide us with a copy of the manual, that was not so done. I am very pleased that the Minister provided a copy of the manual to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and that the Committee was able to obtain the documents here in the Senate. This means that the documents are readily available and are open to public scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given the very imprecise language that appears in many of the Migration Regulations, it is absolutely critical that the documents be available to the public so that people can see how the Department assesses applications. Unless this is the case, we run a very grave risk of individual civil liberties and rights of applicants wishing to come to this country being in some ways limited or contravened by virtue of the operation of the manual. Generally, we need to shorten the legislation regarding immigration. We need to make it much simpler. I am very pleased that a few months ago the Minister gave some sort of undertaking to the Senate to do that. This matter must be pursued as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that this Procedures Advice Manual has been tabled. I look forward to a continuing improvement in the operations of the Department and a continuing openness that we have seen in its dealings with this Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) The Civil Aviation Authority has introduced a range of measures to improve capacity at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. In February 1989 a team of CAA officers visited a number of North American airports with similar runway configurations to Sydney to identify any scope for improving the efficiency of the Air Traffic Services (ATS) system at Sydney. The team's report, known as the Bigsworth report, made a number of recommendations to improve Sydney Airport's capacity. The major recommendations have been implemented or are well advanced. These include:</PARA>
<PARA>* 25 knot cross-wind standards implemented in February 1990</PARA>
<PARA>- the increase in the cross-wind standard to 25 knots will reduce the frequency of the need to confine operations to a single runway.</PARA>
<PARA>* Simplified Standard Instrument Departures (SIDS) to be implemented in August 1990</PARA>
<PARA>- Sydney Airport has 87 SIDS to provide for every outbound track from each runway. These have been simplified which will lead to reduced workload for controllers.</PARA>
<PARA>* New wake turbulence separation standards to be implemented prior to end of 1990</PARA>
<PARA>- the new standards are based on distance rather than time which cuts down the separation required for each aircraft, thus reducing delays.</PARA>
<PARA>* Surface movement radar commissioned in November 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>* Extended simultaneous runway operations (SIMOPS) are under consideration with the staff association and the Industrial Relations Commission</PARA>
<PARA>- it is proposed to make the standards for SIMOPS more flexible which will increase the opportunities for simultaneous use of both runways and so reduce delays.</PARA>
<PARA>* Terminal area severe turbulence (TAST) displays currently under operational evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA>* New wind analysers are expected to be commissioned by end of 1990</PARA>
<PARA>- the above facilities provide controllers with improved meteorological information on which to base operational decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>The CAA engaged the Mitre Corporation to undertake a study of how capacity could be improved based on Sydney Airport's existing runway configurations. The Corporation's report makes a number of recommendations, which essentially provide no new findings of substance over and above the work being undertaken in response to the Bigsworth report. It does provide broad confirmation of the work already being undertaken by the CAA. Some matters canvassed in the report raise issues of Government policy, such as changes to the present noise abatement procedures, and so require Government consideration. Industry operators and staff associations have been invited to comment on the report prior to implementation of any of the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>The CAA is upgrading and replacing the existing radar system at the airport. The new radar system is scheduled to be provided towards the end of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> The Instrument Landing system (ILS) is being upgraded. The refurbishment of the ILS on 07 runway was completed in September 1989. In March 1990 the outer marker for runway 34 was commissioned. The localiser, glide-path, middle and outer markers for runway 16 have been replaced. The glide-path will be relocated to the other side of the runway when the Federal Airports Corporation completes taxiway works later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Training of Air Traffic Service (ATS) staff is being undertaken at full capacity. There are 220 air traffic controllers in training at the Centre for ATS at the Tasmanian Institute of Technology, Launceston, with 60 in training at the CAA's Central Training College in Melbourne. Seventy four of these are expected to graduate within the next year. The CAA is also recruiting experienced controllers from overseas, and about 40 controllers should commence duty in August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> The CAA, has established a Flow Management Unit which is developing improved arrangements for the management of the flow of air traffic on the major trunk routes. A Flow Management Information System (FMIS) has been implemented to measure and report on delays on the major trunk routes. Discussions are continuing with industry operators on the possible introduction of an industry regulated schedule rationalisation committee. It is proposed that the committee would work towards implementing airline schedules which facilitate an orderly flow of airline traffic, and avoid the present situation where a number of flights are scheduled to depart/arrive at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Particular studies undertaken by the CAA on industry requirements at Sydney Airport include the Bigsworth report and the Mitre Corporation report. The former report involved travel costs only for the relevant officers of $14,000. The Mitre Corporation report cost $172,153, which included the consultancy charges and associated on-costs for travel and expenses.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) No extra staff have been employed to specifically undertake consultation with the aviation industry. A considerable number of operational and management positions with responsibility for safety standards and aviation services within the CAA routinely consult with the industry. Since the CAA was established special emphasis has been placed on these aspects of the Authority's operations to achieve increased responsiveness to industry and the community.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Since June 1989, 663 staff have left the CAA.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) There have been 938 staff commence employment with the CAA since June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) The CAA has not employed any overseas personnel through overseas recruitment action since June 1989. Through normal domestic recruitment advertising, overseas personnel may have applied and been employed in the CAA.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is no Legal Services Division within the Department. Responsibility for AAT and VRB matters lies with the Compensation and Review Branch within the Benefits Program. Responsibility for the Department's legislative program and general legal advisory service lies with the Legal Services Group within the Corporate Services Program. The cost of running these functions has been interpreted as the cost of salaries and administration and as not embracing the cost of counsel and other fees. (See the response to the House of Representatives Question on Notice 2205 of 27 November 1989 for details of counsels' costs).</PARA>
<PARA> During the 1989/90 financial year $1,719,663 was spent on salaries and $366,198 on administration for the Review Section. $472,844 was spent on salaries and $166,889 for administration for the Legal Services Group.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Attorney-General is responding to this question.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In respect of Department of Veterans' Affairs officers, the Review Section handled 3205 cases in 1989-90. This comprised 1924 on hand at the beginning of the year and 1281 new cases received during the year. Of these, 1231 were finalised, leaving 1974 on hand at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Legal Services Group generally does not have responsibility for individual case files unless litigation arises in respect of the Department, the Repatriation Hospitals or the Repatriation Commission. The majority of staff are involved in the provision of general legal advisory and legislation services to the Department and the Repatriation Commission on a wide range of issues affecting all Programs and areas of the portfolio. This may involve the provision of advice on individual cases but, with the exception of Federal Court matters, is limited to specific aspects of pension or treatment entitlement under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, rather than carriage of a matter in the appeal system. In respect of Federal Court action arising from the determining system, during 1989-90 the Group examined 49 cases referred for possible Federal Court appeal. Forty three appeals were lodged by veterans and the Repatriation Commission. Thirty four cases were resolved and at the end of the year 26 cases remained outstanding.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2662" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Since 19 January 1988, Australian policy has been that the Government will not extend formal recognition, whether de facto or de jure, to new governments taking power in other countries. Instead, Australian authorities will conduct relations with new regimes to the extent and in the manner which may be required by the circumstances of each case. Since January 1988 Australia has recognised the State of Fiji. The recent promulgation of the constitution in Fiji has not affected this. The question of recognition of the new Fiji Constitution does not arise.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The UN Charter sets out the basic principles and structure of the United Nations Organisation. Its provisions essentially concern relations between States. The Charter does not impose obligations on States in the conduct of their domestic affairs. Article 2.7 expressly provides that the UN may not intervene in matters which are within the domestic jurisdiction of any State. International standards of human rights are set out in two major international covenants: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Fiji is not a party to either of these treaties. However, Fiji has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). A comprehensive range of human rights safeguards is contained in Chapter II of the new Fiji Constitution titled ``Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual''. These safeguards include detailed provisions for protection from discrimination on the grounds of race. This protection is subject to other provisions of the constitution and, in particular, can be overridden by Chapter III on ``Protection and Enhancement of Fijian and Rotuman Interests'' which gives Parliament and Cabinet certain powers to enact legislation or make directions, in essence to promote the economic, social, educational, cultural, traditional and other interests of the Fijian (and Rotuman) people. This has given rise to some concern that Chapter III in particular may be used in the future in a way which disadvantages the non-Fijian communities in Fiji, particularly, Fiji-Indians. There is also concern at the racial imbalances in the constitution, including the number of seats in parliament reserved for the different communities, and the reservation of certain positions for Fijians only.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Under the new constitution the provisions for ownership of land remain unchanged from the 1970 Constitution. While the majority of land in Fiji (approximately 82%) is owned by the traditional Fijian landholders, other races are not precluded from owning land designated as freehold land. A significant amount of the land owned by Fijians is leased, particularly by Fiji-Indian cane farmers, and administered by the Native Lands Trust Board. Provisions for positive discrimination for Fijians in some areas, particularly economic areas, will make it more difficult for other races to become civic leaders but will not exclude them except, effectively, from the Presidency, and explicitly from the Prime Ministership and the Chairmanship of the Police Services Commission. The new constitution provides for representation in parliament for all races, although with 37 of 70 lower house seats reserved for them, an indigenous Fijian majority is assured. Fiji-Indians have 27 of 70 seats in the House of Representatives reserved for them, while 5 seats are reserved for General Electors (Other Races), including Fiji citizens of Chinese origin, and 1 seat is reserved for Rotumans. In the Senate, there will be 24 chiefs appointed by the President on the advice of the Great Council of Chiefs, one Rotuman and nine Senators from ``other Communities'', also appointed by the President.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The constitutions of South Africa and Fiji are quite different. South Africa, unlike any other country in the world, bases its entire social and political system on an institutionalised form of racial discrimination underpinned by its constitution which affects all aspects of the lives of its people, including where they may live and go to school. In South Africa, furthermore, the African majority (some 70% of the population) is constitutionally excluded from any representation in the national parliament. The new constitution in Fiji is racially based and racially biased and has serious flaws, but will at least provide for a return to representative government, with all ethnic groups represented in a single parliament. In addition, the Fiji constitution contains significant safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of Fiji citizens and (unlike its South African counterpart and the laws enacted under it) makes no provision for separate development or institutionalised segregation. The features of the Fiji constitution that have attracted the most criticism are those provisions that actually or potentially favour the indigenous race in terms of parliamentary representation, affirmative action in the economic, social and educational sphere, and the filling of certain positions, as noted above. The shortcomings of the Fiji constitution, although serious, clearly fall well short of those of the South African constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. Australia's aid to Fiji is designed to benefit all communities regardless of ethnic origin and the disbursement of the program is monitored closely. The Defence Cooperation Program with Fiji was suspended following the coups in 1987 and remains suspended.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government has already made known to the Fiji Government its views on the new Fiji constitution, notably in the meeting between the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, on 2 August, 1990 in Port Vila. The Government has said that the new racially based and racially biased constitution entrenches communal divisions and does not allow fair representation for all groups in Fiji. However, the Government takes the view that, despite its serious flaws, the new constitution at least provides an opportunity for Fiji to return to representative government. In that sense, it provides a firmer basis for government than the interim arrangements in place since the coups. Regrettably, but realistically, there appears to be no likelihood that a significantly better constitution could be agreed upon at this time in Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. There are significant differences between the constitutions of South Africa and Fiji. South Africa, unlike any other country in the world, bases its entire social and political system on an institutionalised form of racial discrimination (apartheid) which affects all aspects of the lives of its people. Africans, who make up almost 70% of the population, have no vote and are not represented in the central parliament. It is for such reasons that successive Australian Governments have maintained an unambiguous opposition to apartheid and participated in international efforts to bring pressure to bear on South Africa for genuine political change. The new constitution in Fiji has serious flaws but these are not as significant or as pervasive as those of the South African constitution and the laws which it underpins.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia's regular bilateral aid program for Fiji in 1990/91 is $13.6 million. In addition, Fiji benefits through Australia's contribution to regional organisations and programs, including the South Pacific Forum Secretariat, the Forum Fisheries Agency, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, the University of the South Pacific and the South Pacific Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. Australia's bilateral aid program will continue at normal levels. The program is designed to benefit all communities regardless of ethnic origin and the disbursement of the program is monitored closely. The Defence Cooperation Program with Fiji was suspended following the coups in 1987 and remains suspended.</PARA>

<PARA> In addition to its ongoing roll maintenance work, the Commission is taking the following steps to have the electoral rolls as accurate as possible in the lead up to the 1990 redistributions:</PARA>
<PARA> results from the electoral roll reviews (or habitation reviews) and post-election objection action will be used to update the Commission's enrolment information on the electoral rolls.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of reviews and enhancements have been made to the computerised roll maintenance system which have improved the system performance and increased the accuracy of data processing in regard to electoral rolls.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At the time of the 1984 redistributions, the relevant provision of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, now section 73 (4) (a), specified that each augmented Electoral Commission, in making its final determination of electoral boundaries, should `as far as practicable, endeavour to ensure that, 3 years and 6 months after the making of the determination, the number of electors enrolled in each Electoral Division in the State or Territory will be equal''. There was no reference in the Act at that time to the 2 per cent tolerance mentioned in the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> The timing of the 1984 redistributions was such that in no State or Territory did the 3 years and 6 months period referred to in section 73 (4) (a) of the Act expire in December 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> The following table sets out the number of Electoral Divisions in each State and the Australian Capital Territory which, 3 years and 6 months after the particular 1984 redistributions at which they were created, had enrolments which differed from the relevant State or Territory average enrolment by up to 2%; by between 2.1% and 5%; by between 5.1% and 10%; and by more than 10%.</PARA>

On this basis the honourable senator's assertion that the projections used at the 1984 redistributions were ``seriously flawed'' is not accepted.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Australian Electoral Commission and the Redistribution bodies established under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 are completely independent of the Government in carrying out the redistribution process.

<PARA>(1) Is the Government aware that, according to The Age, dated 17 August 1990, at least five people, including a woman and child, have been killed at the village of Ok Bago on the Papua New Guinea (PNG) side of the border as part of a continuing Indonesian military operation there; if so, has there been any expression of concern from the Australian Government to the Indonesian Government on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Does Australia intend to publicly lend its support to the protests in Indonesia by PNG Foreign Minister, Michael Somare, as reported by the Australian Federated Press, on 14 August 1990 regarding Indonesian military incursions on PNG territory and infringements of PNG sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Did the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Philip Flood, discuss these military incursions while on his recent visit to Irian Jaya.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) In view of the report of the current level of military activity on the border, will Australia convey to the PNG Government, in the strongest terms, its concerns that refugees in the Yapsie area be permitted to stay in PNG at least until the situation in Irian Jaya improves and the safe return of the refugees is completely guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Is the Government aware of: (a) the whereabouts; and (b) the present condition of the OPM leader Melkianus Salosa who was recently forcibly deported to Indonesia by the PNG Government.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) Has Salosa been granted any access to independent legal or NGO representatives in a position to monitor his rights in his present situation of detention and alleged intense interrogation.</PARA>
<PARA>(7) Was his forced repatriation legally well-founded and does it comply with PNG's obligations as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees.</PARA>
<PARA>(8) Does the Government have any information as to the whereabouts, living conditions, and legal status of the seven Melanesian Irian Jayans who sought asylum in the PNG Consulate, Jayapura on 14 December 1989, and were subsequently handed over to the Indonesian authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>(9) Has the Government sought assurances from Indonesia that the legal and human rights of these political prisoners will be fully respected.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) I am aware of press reports of recent Indonesian incursions into PNG territory. The Australian Government has not commented on these, believing that the management of their joint border is a matter for Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to work out in cooperation with each other.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The Australian Government was not asked to associate itself with Sir Michael Somare's protest of 14 August calling on Indonesia to respect the territorial integrity of Papua New Guinea. It does not plan to do so .</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The Australian Ambassador discussed developments along the Indonesian-PNG border with Indonesian officials during his recent visit to Irian Jaya.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) The latest information available to me is that the UNHCR office in Papua New Guinea, with the cooperation of the PNG Government, plans to move refugees from Yapsie to the refugee camp further south at East Awin.</PARA>
<PARA>(5-6) According to my most recent information, the questioning of Melky Salosa has been completed. I understand that he is being held in Jayapura.</PARA>
<PARA>(7) I have no information to indicate that the deportation of Salosa was not legally well founded. Salosa did not have refugee status. His extradition was sought by the Indonesian Government for his alleged involvement in an attack on a transmigration camp in Irian Jaya which resulted in the death of a large number of civilians. Salosa was arrested in Papua New Guinea in December last year for the illegal possession of weapons. Before his deportation he was appearing before a PNG court on a charge of illegal entry. I believe that Papua New Guinea's deportation of Salosa did not contravene its obligations as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees.</PARA>
<PARA>(8) My latest information about the four Irianese who sought asylum in the PNG consulate in Jayapura in December last year is that all four were brought to trial in June on a count of subversion. I understand that all have received sentences of between twelve and eighteen years imprisonment. Staff from the ICRC have had access to the detainees.</PARA>
<PARA>(9) The Australian Government through the Australian Embassy in Jakarta has continued to monitor the situation of the four Irianese who sought asylum.</PARA>
<PARA>(10) I understand that in early August the Indonesian Armed Forces in Jayapura announced the capture of 11 suspected OPM members. They are reportedly being questioned by the security authorities prior to their trial.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2668" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) There is no doubt that government departments use, in total, significant quantities of paper for photocopying and related processes.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is not in a position to make such a sweeping statement about the suitability of recycled paper for use in current technology photocopiers.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's two major paper manufacturers, Australian Paper Manufacturers (APM), and Associated Pulp and Paper Mills (APPM), both produce recycled photocopy grade papers. Both recommend their papers as suitable for low to mid volume photocopiers, but not for high speed copiers or in applications where two sided copying is required. The attitude of major photocopying manufacturers varies, and most have indicated that their machines will operate satisfactorily using recycled paper for some or all categories of use, however, performance and warranty depend on the quality of the recycled paper used.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Most photocopiers use a heating process to fuse toner (the medium used to form the image) onto the paper. This process is not responsible for the production of ozone. Ozone is a gas produced as a result of electrical discharges in air and is primarily associated with the charging and discharging of the photoconductive drum or belt used in photocopiers. The design of the machine generally determines the amount of ozone produced with some photocopiers incorporating ozone scrubbers or filters.</PARA>
<PARA>It is generally acknowledged that provided care is exercised in relation to the placement of photocopier machines, and if they are regularly serviced, and not seriously overused during any given period, the ozone produced is unlikely to reach the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission threshold limit values for exposure.</PARA>
<PARA>Photocopiers utilise a photoconductive drum or belt which is electrically charged according to the image on an original to attract toner for transfer to the paper.</PARA>
<PARA>Many types of material are used as the photoconductive coating on the drum. Selenium, and selenium compounds, amorphous silicone, cadmium sulphide, zinc oxide and organic polymer drums are used in photocopiers.</PARA>
<PARA>During the normal course of operating a photocopier, there should be no reason to touch the drum, and in fact this may damage it. PSG contract conditions stipulate that the serviceman/technician remove all replaced drums for appropriate disposal. It is highly unlikely that drums will become overheated. Minute amounts of photoconductive coating can be released into the air but the levels produced are unlikely to affect the health of users.</PARA>
<PARA>Further information about the use of photocopiers and associated health hazards is available from the Worksafe Australia publication `Office Copying Machines'.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The useful operating life of a photocopying machine is not determined by age but by the number of copies produced. The Purchasing and Sales Group of my Department arranges Common Use Contracts for photocopiers which include provision of support for all equipment for a five year period.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) There is no new technology in photocopiers that my Department is aware of, that involves no harmful chemicals and does not use a heating process.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I am advised machines known in the industry as copy printers, have recently been released. These machines are new technology ink duplicating machines which incorporate automatic scanning, stencil making and printing facilities. They are simple to operate and look similar to photocopiers. They are not an alternative to the photocopier, but in certain applications they can be provide a direct substitute.</PARA>
<PARA>Copy printers are costly to operate in situations where less than 30 copies of each original is involved. After this volume per original they become cost competitive. They also tend to be more labour intensive, and are not generally capable of automatic two sided copying.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Copy printers could conceivably have a life of 15 to 20 years, but as with photocopiers is probably based on chassis copy life. Most machines incorporate sophisticated electronics which it is doubtful could be adequately maintained by the supplier after 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA>The Purchasing and Sales Group has arranged a Common Use Contract for copy printers and the machines on that contract have an expected life of 10,000,000 copies and are supported by agreements with suppliers for at least five years.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) Departments have the individual freedom to select the office equipment (including photocopiers and copy printers) they need to perform their functions. In selecting such equipment they must have regard to value for money, the availability of funds, the nature of the task concerned, and government policy on the use of recycled and environmentally friendly products.</PARA>
<PARA>To assist departments and other government agencies in making these purchases, the Purchasing and Sales Group has arranged Common Use Contracts for both photocopiers and copy printers and has specialist technical staff available to advise them on the paper and product most suited to their requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of all the information above I am not prepared to issue any directive of the type sought by the honourable member.</PARA>
